1
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:54,346
Right.

2
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:55,372
Move it right here.

3
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,417
Okay, I want you to relax your mouth.

4
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:59,276
Just look towards the camera, okay?

5
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:01,795
Dave? Over here.

6
00:01:02,777 --> 00:01:03,503
Sorry?

7
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:05,088
Look here.

8
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:08,165
Relax, Dave. Look here!

9
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:14,132
Dave, is there a problem?

10
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:15,286
Problem?

11
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:16,725
Let's take a break.

12
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:19,228
Fuck Mari.

13
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:20,897
What took you so long, Mari?

14
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:23,858
You're lucky I still showed up.

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
Come here.

16
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:28,737
Thank you.

17
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,091
Dave, this is…

18
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:32,534
- Fuck Mari.
- No, fuck.

19
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,754
Just Mari. My apprentice.

20
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:37,423
She says she wants to be a photographer.

21
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,270
Mari, this is for you.

22
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,604
I love, you Mari!

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,809
Not cool. Report!

24
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:23,848
I love you because…

25
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:27,677
You never give up even if
it's too much for you to handle.

26
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:31,918
I love you because
you didn't leave me.

27
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:34,721
Or because…

28
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:36,597
You came back.

29
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:39,434
Because you chose me.

30
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:41,269
I love you because…

31
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:44,397
You took care of me
when I needed it most.

32
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:50,128
Mr. MVP, recovering!
Say hi, Mr. MVP!

33
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:51,465
So handsome…

34
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:53,214
Oh shit!

35
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,270
I love you because…

36
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:56,825
You love me!

37
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:00,216
I love you
because you're so hot.

38
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:13,683
Wow, you've reactivated…

39
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:24,884
Mr. Baller to Mr. Business.

40
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:27,524
Do you still remember me?

41
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,528
I love you because…

42
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,354
You didn't leave me.

43
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,973
Or because…

44
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:52,506
You came back.

45
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:55,777
I love you because…

46
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,965
You took care of me when I needed it most.

47
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:02,747
I need you too.

48
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:06,913
I love you because you're so hot.

49
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:09,543
You're so hot.

50
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,801
You're so hot.

51
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:16,457
You're so hot.

52
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,025
Good morning!

53
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:53,698
What are you up to?

54
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,738
Well when I woke up,
you already had a hard-on.

55
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,073
Are you having a wet dream?

56
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:02,073
Who were you fucking?

57
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,291
Was it me?

58
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:05,952
Or someone else?

59
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:07,472
Of course it was you.

60
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,675
And another woman but…

61
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:13,987
That hurts!

62
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:15,965
A threesome is really
your ultimate fantasy?

63
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:19,612
That's why it's so hard to be honest.

64
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:22,639
Alright then.

65
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,725
Imagine another woman.

66
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,985
Shit, I'm going to be late.

67
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:25,437
Love?

68
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:30,230
Me too, I'm three weeks late.

69
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:33,385
Wait…

70
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:36,302
You're pregnant?

71
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,884
Doc Belle just texted.
Check the side table.

72
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:42,957
Are you serious?

73
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,977
Surprise!

74
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:03,865
Shit, we tried for four years.

75
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:06,576
Four fucking years.

76
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,161
And now we've succeeded.

77
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,496
I'm going to be a father.

78
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,673
Do you want one more?
For backup?

79
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,507
Can you handle it?

80
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:25,464
Can you?

81
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:28,389
What's taking you so long?

82
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:26,596
Mari is pregnant.

83
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:28,282
I don't want to infect her.

84
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:29,979
That's why I'm in the mancave.

85
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:31,761
What about it?

86
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:36,290
You know what, deal with
the liquidation of Sausage Fest.

87
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,608
I'm broke.

88
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:39,042
Negative cash flow.

89
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:42,690
How was I supposed to know that malls would
close when the world ended with the virus?

90
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:44,357
Well shit, what now?

91
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:47,636
We did pivot online so...

92
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:49,603
Dude, low sales, man.

93
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:52,056
Think positive, man.

94
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,309
Fucking hell, I am positive.

95
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:17,539
Fuck…

96
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:38,662
Mari, love?

97
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:41,605
The meeting just ended.

98
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,830
Those assholes fired me
from the coaching staff.

99
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,421
Mari?

100
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:49,589
Why?

101
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:51,917
What's happening?

102
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,986
Mari?

103
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,503
Tell me what's happening.

104
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:36,219
Let's eat.

105
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:39,139
Mari!

106
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:43,369
That's enough.

107
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:45,087
Let's eat. Come inside.

108
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:08,836
Hey, try the food. It's good.

109
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:12,757
I've been thinking
about opening a food truck.

110
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:17,943
Something like Filipino burritos.
That's my peg.

111
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,115
And this will be the filling.

112
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:24,851
Dave?

113
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:27,980
Haven't you learned anything?

114
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:24,821
I'm coping. It's like…

115
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:28,884
My world is crashing
and I can't count on anyone.

116
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:32,323
Kill!—

117
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:36,186
I'm into plants these days.
They're my subjects—

118
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:37,673
I said kill, dumbass!

119
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,635
Stupid motherfucker.

120
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:40,744
Dave?

121
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,696
I'm going to die, fuck you!

122
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,283
Sorry Rose, there's a child here
playing video games.

123
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:47,059
Kill!

124
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,520
It would be better if
we spoke in person.

125
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,188
Kill, assholes…

126
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:52,231
- Flank them.
- Yes!

127
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:55,901
I'll die, dumbass.

128
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:58,319
Stupid!

129
00:13:58,612 --> 00:13:59,697
Morons…

130
00:13:59,697 --> 00:14:00,697
Dave.

131
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:02,241
Fuck you…

132
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:02,783
Fuck!

133
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:03,783
Dave!

134
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,494
Motherfucker…

135
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:07,204
You're so loud!

136
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:09,582
Dave, that call was important.

137
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,209
You're useless!

138
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,129
What was that, love?

139
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:20,401
Sorry, my teammates
were a bunch of dumbasses.

140
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:24,196
Good thing you can
always start over in a game, right?

141
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:25,221
Are you okay?

142
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,890
Are you mad at me?

143
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:30,853
- Shit.
- Fuck…

144
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:43,485
Thank God, it just tripped, love. Relax.

145
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:46,619
I thought they were
cutting our electricity.

146
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,616
Why would they do that?
We pay our bills.

147
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
Until when?

148
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:53,374
I have savings.

149
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:55,961
Dave! Compute.

150
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,964
How long will your savings last?

151
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:03,302
Dave, I don't want to
borrow money again from my mom.

152
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:10,643
I didn't want to lose my job.

153
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:15,397
I didn't know the league would dissolve.

154
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,541
I didn't know the malls would close.

155
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:20,986
I didn't know my food business would fail,
fuck it's not my fault I'm injured!

156
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:23,305
Dave, fine then it's not your fault!

157
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,290
But Dave, think!

158
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,939
What are we going to do now?

159
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:46,512
If we need the money,

160
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:50,641
we can sell this house,
if it's okay with you.

161
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:52,481
It's just the two of us.
This house is too big.

162
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:56,647
You should be thankful I have a house.

163
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,567
And sorry, it's just the two of us.

164
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,319
Why?

165
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:05,823
Is it my fault I had a miscarriage?

166
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,467
Is it my fault I have APAS?

167
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:11,068
Wait, you're changing the issue.

168
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,724
You're changing the discussion.

169
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,708
I just said...

170
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,145
that a smaller house
would be easier to clean.

171
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,170
It's practical.

172
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,190
So you're saying it's dirty here?

173
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,107
I didn't say that…
When did I say that?

174
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:28,012
I'm not your maid,
I won't clean up after you!

175
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:29,321
Shit…

176
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:31,287
And why would we sell my house?

177
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:32,752
Why should I give up my inheritance?

178
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:35,958
- Why not yours?
- Fine, fine!

179
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,457
We'll sell them both. We'll sell—

180
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,255
- No!
- We'll sell them!

181
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:46,395
With how things are turning out,
it's a good thing we lost the baby.

182
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:49,325
What did you say?

183
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,169
Say that again!

184
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,419
Mari, that's not what I meant.

185
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,350
Love!

186
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,941
Son of a bitch.

187
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:40,631
The electric company is doing
rounds outside, checking up posts.

188
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:42,836
Maybe that's why the power tripped,
there was trouble.

189
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,883
I'm sorry.

190
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:50,928
Hey, please?

191
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:56,392
Our online pivot is picking up.

192
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:59,086
People are ordering more of our sausages.

193
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:02,272
I'll make it up to you.

194
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:09,612
No!

195
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,807
- Come on…
- It's sensitive, Dave.

196
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:13,732
Please, Mari.

197
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:15,300
Come on, so you could relax.

198
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,039
I said no! What the hell?

199
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:20,791
Hey, what's wrong?

200
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:21,791
Come on.

201
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:24,795
Mari… Mari!

202
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:27,964
Mari!

203
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:31,357
Mari!

204
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,388
Mari, are you okay?

205
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:38,475
It's your fault! Mari, come back…

206
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,619
- Mari!
- Stop it!

207
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:42,443
Come back!

208
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,355
Mari!

209
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:48,360
Don't have any control over your life?

210
00:18:49,903 --> 00:18:53,122
Me… I can't control my uterus.

211
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:58,598
I can't control you, the bedroom,
not even my own body?

212
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,391
When I say that I don't want to,
I really mean it.

213
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,252
You're too much.
I was just being sweet.

214
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,757
You're overreacting, you know that?
If you don't want to, fine!

215
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:15,407
Mari!

216
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:20,731
Just tell me what to do.

217
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,443
Hello, Dave.

218
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:14,826
I've been waiting for you
for so long.

219
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:17,009
What now?

220
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:34,636
Hey, what's with the big smile?

221
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:35,935
Someone's blushing…

222
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:38,567
What'd he say?

223
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:03,559
I'll go around?

224
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:18,279
Hey, you don't have to wear a mask.

225
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:25,429
Well… we're sharing
the same air right now.

226
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,732
- Okay.
- I live alone at my apartment.

227
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:33,769
You?

228
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:39,358
I'm alright.

229
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:42,779
Liar.

230
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,907
I don't go out.

231
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:50,912
Well, what now?

232
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:02,434
Your sausage!

233
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:05,801
Right.

234
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:12,538
Franks and Hungarian.
The Hungarian is kind of spicy.

235
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:14,741
It must have cheese.

236
00:24:15,223 --> 00:24:17,726
Filled with juiciness inside.

237
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:22,789
Hey, I've already paid for these, alright?

238
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:30,452
Okay, thank you.

239
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:32,953
Welcome.

240
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:55,894
Let's eat?

241
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:59,351
I want to try your sausages.

242
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:02,942
Where?

243
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:06,279
Up to you.

244
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:13,865
Tequila and sausages
are best for rainy days.

245
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,666
So basketball isn't your only talent?

246
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:22,170
That talent's long gone.

247
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:26,538
My knees, shoulders and back are wrecked.

248
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:28,510
You play too hard.

249
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:30,719
It was necessary.

250
00:25:32,136 --> 00:25:34,999
You know, if you lack height,

251
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,227
you need a lot of heart.

252
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:41,773
Too much heart.
That's why you get hurt.

253
00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:44,257
That was nice, let's have a shot.

254
00:25:46,116 --> 00:25:47,116
Oops.

255
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:51,031
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

256
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:15,390
So what do you do?

257
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:19,686
What are you an influencer?
You have a lot of followers.

258
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,899
10 thousand? That's not enough.

259
00:26:23,924 --> 00:26:25,196
That's a lot.

260
00:26:26,163 --> 00:26:29,396
Well I post sexy stuff so…

261
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:31,888
You know how it is
with horny people online.

262
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,551
Is that how you see me?

263
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:38,188
- No, no, I wasn't referring to you.
- Sorry. Not really.

264
00:26:38,712 --> 00:26:39,712
I'm alright.

265
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:42,458
Just okay.

266
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,953
Are you earning enough from it?

267
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:48,461
Well…

268
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:51,162
Hopefully, someday.

269
00:26:52,804 --> 00:26:58,141
You only earn from endorsements.
You need a million followers for that.

270
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,437
You know, we tried something
like that before.

271
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,106
We tried vlogging.

272
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:08,526
But it takes a lot of work.

273
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,779
Mari's into it.

274
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,031
Oh, fuck…

275
00:27:13,657 --> 00:27:14,657
Sorry.

276
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:36,071
I guess the alcohol's getting to you.

277
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:39,095
You mentioned your wife's name.

278
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,158
No, sorry, sorry.

279
00:27:40,183 --> 00:27:44,219
She's into social media too.

280
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,108
She has a plantita page, right?

281
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:53,129
Well, she partnered with my best friend's
aunt who owns a coffee shop.

282
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:56,313
They have this plant community.
Is that right?

283
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,280
Wait, hold on.

284
00:28:00,101 --> 00:28:01,383
You know my wife?

285
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:02,663
Of course!

286
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:08,208
Are you a stalker? Sorry but…

287
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:11,953
Me, a stalker?
Can't I just be a diehard fan?

288
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:18,096
Don't you remember me?

289
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:45,339
Hey. I said, do I have to remember?

290
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:47,666
Oh, not really.

291
00:28:48,741 --> 00:28:51,202
We can make new memories.

292
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:02,058
This tequila's hot.

293
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:18,239
That was five years ago.

294
00:29:20,283 --> 00:29:21,993
The last year of my championship.

295
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:24,621
After that, it was over.

296
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,375
That was my best game though.

297
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:35,507
Triple double. 36 points, 11 rebounds…

298
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,926
And 12 assists.

299
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:42,889
On your last play,
you had three seconds left.

300
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:45,517
The other team had a three point lead.

301
00:29:45,975 --> 00:29:48,061
Then you got three points.

302
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,397
Foul. Counted. Tie.

303
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:54,776
That time, I was in the crowd.

304
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:56,027
I whispered…

305
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,822
Go! You can do it!

306
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,284
I had a feeling you were looking at me.

307
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:06,329
So I said, go for it.

308
00:30:14,587 --> 00:30:15,588
Go for it.

309
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:01,968
Wait. Hold on.

310
00:31:03,178 --> 00:31:04,178
Look at me.

311
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:13,229
I want you to see me.

312
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,313
Was it good?

313
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:58,982
So good.

314
00:32:00,944 --> 00:32:02,695
Who's better? Me or Mari?

315
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,408
You know what would be even hotter?

316
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:11,371
Mmm, 69.

317
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:15,208
If we did it on your bed.

318
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,305
There's an airbed over there.
You want to sleep there?

319
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,756
I mean at your house.

320
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:25,314
That's a no-go.
That's my wife's house.

321
00:32:25,614 --> 00:32:26,614
Wait.

322
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,930
Why? Can't I go there?

323
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:33,998
Wait. We just met. Relax.

324
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:39,190
What else do you want?

325
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:47,198
Just a minute, I'm getting dressed.

326
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:58,167
You wouldn't meet up with me
if you and Mari were doing okay.

327
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,313
Day and night, with no undies.

328
00:33:02,338 --> 00:33:06,384
And no hubby.
Because he's with me!

329
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:12,889
Just kidding!

330
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:16,559
You know what,
you could be a comedian.

331
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:22,744
But this was nice, Layla.
Just keep it steady.

332
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,359
Lila.

333
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:38,499
Oh no, it broke!

334
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:42,337
Fuck, are you serious?

335
00:33:44,213 --> 00:33:46,025
Uh-oh, you're in trouble…

336
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,215
Where were you last night?

337
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:53,758
Work.

338
00:35:56,429 --> 00:35:57,429
Work?

339
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,101
You might be working on something else...

340
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,106
I love only you.

341
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:15,448
Hey! Does it still hurt?

342
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:21,162
I don't think it's ever
going away. It's okay.

343
00:36:29,128 --> 00:36:30,129
Get rid of this.

344
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:21,179
Dave…

345
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,768
I don't want to be pregnant, Dave.

346
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:31,691
I'm scared.

347
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:04,908
Who's that?

348
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,358
Fuck!

349
00:39:28,142 --> 00:39:30,178
Motherfucker!

350
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:41,589
My love, I'm going to the
warehouse to see Rob and Pao.

351
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:43,048
Business!

352
00:40:43,924 --> 00:40:47,720
Do you want me to tag along?
I'm almost done here.

353
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:49,449
I can handle this!

354
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,661
Are you sure?

355
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:55,436
Don't you trust me?

356
00:41:06,822 --> 00:41:10,409
Love, close the gate after. I love you!

357
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,578
I deposited the buyer's
money into your account.

358
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:48,090
Wait, this office… Don't you want
to sell it? Someone's interested.

359
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:56,956
For you, man.
Snort that good shit.

360
00:41:59,906 --> 00:42:00,741
You know what, dude?

361
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:03,769
It's weird you're a drug dealer
who's an anti-vaxxer.

362
00:42:05,798 --> 00:42:07,287
That's a different issue.

363
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:10,427
And you're the one
with an even bigger issue here.

364
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,139
Who, me? What issue?

365
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,435
Drug problems are okay, Dave.

366
00:42:17,927 --> 00:42:20,638
Even presidents go through it,
I even used to dabble.

367
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:21,810
Don’t worry about it.

368
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:25,557
Hey, I don't have a drug problem.
This is for my knee injury.

369
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:28,445
Of course. So they call it
a knee problem now.

370
00:42:28,988 --> 00:42:31,866
Fuck your knees. Look at this!

371
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:35,077
There's your issue.
She took a picture of you two together.

372
00:42:35,531 --> 00:42:36,949
I knew you were weak.

373
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:40,471
Hey Pao, remember our bet?
Mr. Perfect gave in.

374
00:42:40,496 --> 00:42:41,789
So you guys had a bet?

375
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:44,294
I'm not like you,
I'm not a player.

376
00:42:45,004 --> 00:42:46,714
Amateur hour, man!

377
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:51,151
Why did you bring her here?
You don't shit where you eat, bro!

378
00:42:51,176 --> 00:42:52,152
For sure.

379
00:42:52,177 --> 00:42:54,380
Fuck, bro. Block her.

380
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:57,266
Is this our fault?

381
00:42:58,267 --> 00:43:00,591
Wow, I approve!

382
00:43:06,013 --> 00:43:07,758
You seriously ghosted me?!

383
00:43:08,637 --> 00:43:10,414
Lila, I have a wife.

384
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:11,969
So?

385
00:43:12,071 --> 00:43:13,694
So we can't be together!

386
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,482
Well why did you meet me?

387
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:21,866
Huh?

388
00:43:21,984 --> 00:43:23,336
Why did we have sex?

389
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,052
You're an asshole!

390
00:43:25,077 --> 00:43:26,637
I thought it was just a one-time thing.

391
00:43:28,004 --> 00:43:29,426
I wanted to have some fun.

392
00:43:30,972 --> 00:43:31,972
I'm sorry.

393
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,010
I'm just a man.

394
00:43:34,716 --> 00:43:37,232
You're a man?
That's your excuse?

395
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:39,433
Are you thinking clearly?

396
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,810
I wasn't thinking at all, okay?

397
00:43:43,812 --> 00:43:45,731
I just needed a distraction.

398
00:43:47,706 --> 00:43:49,223
But I love my wife.

399
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:51,792
So you're fooling me now.

400
00:43:53,605 --> 00:43:54,605
Sorry.

401
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,702
But please, let's fix this here.

402
00:44:00,663 --> 00:44:02,748
No. It can't just end like this.

403
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:05,394
You motherfucking bitch!

404
00:44:05,419 --> 00:44:08,445
How dare you blackmail us?!

405
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,772
Don't you know who we are?

406
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:10,547
I have nothing to do with this.

407
00:44:10,572 --> 00:44:11,991
That's enough!

408
00:44:12,948 --> 00:44:13,948
Stop it, man!

409
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:18,514
Bro, delete the evidence.
That's not going anywhere.

410
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:25,311
I'm sorry.

411
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:28,898
Are you okay?

412
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:31,200
Fuck all of you!

413
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,629
Especially you! Fuck you!

414
00:44:33,654 --> 00:44:35,114
This bitch is brave, huh?

415
00:44:35,114 --> 00:44:36,323
It's okay, Pao…

416
00:44:36,323 --> 00:44:37,533
Who the fuck do you think you are?

417
00:44:37,558 --> 00:44:38,767
Enough! Stop it.

418
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:40,469
Fuck, man! Stop it.

419
00:44:40,494 --> 00:44:41,120
Take it.

420
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,413
Look at your friend, look at him!

421
00:44:42,438 --> 00:44:44,982
Let's forget any of this happened. Please.

422
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:48,585
- We're not done here.
- Lila…

423
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,279
Holy shit.

424
00:44:53,674 --> 00:44:55,217
Fuck him.

425
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:57,130
This isn't over.

426
00:44:58,512 --> 00:44:59,847
I'm so sad.

427
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,693
That's it?

428
00:45:06,351 --> 00:45:07,973
So that's how it is these days?

429
00:45:09,348 --> 00:45:13,203
You'll never know if
you never tried, right?

430
00:45:19,356 --> 00:45:21,216
It's not wrong to fall in love.

431
00:45:23,412 --> 00:45:24,580
Am I too easy?

432
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,290
Am I too easy?

433
00:45:26,315 --> 00:45:28,584
But isn't that what they want?

434
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,687
You give them a fantasy.

435
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:33,365
You give them a fantasy.

436
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,419
The one who falls in love, loses.

437
00:45:37,718 --> 00:45:40,162
The one who falls in love is the loser.

438
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:41,597
But he's wrong.

439
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:45,309
He made a mistake.

440
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:56,222
Fuck him! This isn't over.

441
00:47:29,775 --> 00:47:31,235
To new beginnings!

442
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:33,539
It's time.

443
00:47:33,564 --> 00:47:36,270
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you!

444
00:47:36,295 --> 00:47:39,673
Don't you worry,
if the future is not female,

445
00:47:39,698 --> 00:47:41,450
then at least it's feminine.

446
00:47:41,955 --> 00:47:43,554
And the capital knows.

447
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,028
Feminine capital.

448
00:47:45,053 --> 00:47:48,307
Feminine content.
Feminine communities.

449
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:52,060
And that convergence, that's ours.

450
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,414
I really hope so. I hope it happens.

451
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:56,315
Yes, it will.

452
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,759
We are already in the middle of it.

453
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,280
- Lila!
- Hello!

454
00:48:03,305 --> 00:48:07,484
Good morning.
Mari, this is Lila. Lila, Mari.

455
00:48:07,743 --> 00:48:09,369
You two will be partners.

456
00:48:18,378 --> 00:48:19,898
I'm so sad.

457
00:48:25,928 --> 00:48:27,137
So it's you!

458
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:31,117
No wonder you looked so familiar.

459
00:48:32,601 --> 00:48:35,103
You and your outburst
went viral nationwide.

460
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,969
What do you call those who go viral?

461
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:40,302
A virus.

462
00:48:43,779 --> 00:48:45,572
What's it like, going viral?

463
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:50,286
Going viral feels like…

464
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:52,828
It's like...

465
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:58,019
You achieved something even though
you didn't really achieve anything.

466
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:02,228
You feel connected, but it's shallow.

467
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,913
That's the thing with the world nowadays.

468
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:06,759
On the Internet...

469
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:13,016
You may be connected,
but it's not a real connection.

470
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:19,939
What about us?

471
00:49:22,567 --> 00:49:24,152
We connected.

472
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,952
I love you because...

473
00:49:33,287 --> 00:49:36,164
You never give up even if
it's too much for you to handle.

474
00:49:36,623 --> 00:49:38,208
I love you because...

475
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:41,837
You're a positive thinker.

476
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,017
I love you because...

477
00:49:45,571 --> 00:49:46,794
You love me.

478
00:50:35,015 --> 00:50:36,808
I love you because…

479
00:50:37,976 --> 00:50:40,979
You never give up even if
it's too much for you to handle.

480
00:50:41,237 --> 00:50:43,313
We just met.

481
00:50:44,398 --> 00:50:46,150
But you already know the real me.

482
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,990
I love you because...

483
00:50:53,658 --> 00:50:55,077
You're a positive thinker.

484
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:59,907
I love you because you love me.

485
00:51:06,194 --> 00:51:08,110
I love you too, Mari.

486
00:53:01,786 --> 00:53:04,241
Dave? Dave!

487
00:53:20,805 --> 00:53:21,805
What the hell?

488
00:53:23,016 --> 00:53:24,016
Are you an addict?

489
00:53:25,018 --> 00:53:26,854
That's for my pain management!

490
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:28,897
Don't make it a big deal.

491
00:53:30,732 --> 00:53:32,400
Who are you fooling?

492
00:53:34,236 --> 00:53:36,572
I'm just trying to cope, Mari.

493
00:53:37,135 --> 00:53:38,135
Dave.

494
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,950
You made a promise to me.

495
00:53:40,242 --> 00:53:42,953
You promised that
you would fix your life.

496
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:44,704
And our relationship!

497
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,932
How are you going
to do that if you're like this?

498
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:51,002
Don't you know
what I'm going through?

499
00:53:52,912 --> 00:53:55,706
The pressure from
everything that's happened

500
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:57,249
and dreading what's next.

501
00:53:58,154 --> 00:54:01,096
- Mari I just—
- What do you need? Drugs?

502
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:09,729
An escape, if only for a moment.

503
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,999
Where are the drugs?

504
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,167
Let me go, Dave.

505
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,675
Dave! What the hell?

506
00:54:41,094 --> 00:54:42,094
Mari.

507
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,183
Mari.

508
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,240
Stop it.

509
00:54:54,347 --> 00:54:55,347
Mari.

510
00:54:55,815 --> 00:54:56,815
Mari, don't.

511
00:54:57,444 --> 00:55:00,822
Mari, fuck. Mari! No, don't!

512
00:55:01,156 --> 00:55:02,782
Dave! What the hell?

513
00:55:20,925 --> 00:55:21,925
Sorry.

514
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,267
But you know I'm going through a lot.

515
00:55:35,523 --> 00:55:38,276
Can't you try to understand me,
just this once?

516
00:55:50,455 --> 00:55:51,873
This is your fault too.

517
00:55:53,865 --> 00:55:55,210
My fault?

518
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,800
If I wasn't injured, I would still
have played for ten more years.

519
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:06,431
But fuck it, I got injured.

520
00:56:07,889 --> 00:56:09,182
And I lost everything.

521
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:13,513
I thought if I became a father...

522
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:15,563
Everything would be okay.

523
00:56:15,588 --> 00:56:16,840
Fuck, Dave.

524
00:56:18,525 --> 00:56:20,735
Don't blame me for my miscarriage.

525
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:25,303
Stop playing the victim.

526
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:29,035
Be a man!

527
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:35,250
Did you know I gave
up my dreams for you?

528
00:56:37,544 --> 00:56:38,878
I chose you, Dave.

529
00:56:40,922 --> 00:56:45,093
So please, make the right choice.

530
00:56:56,521 --> 00:56:57,818
Dave.

531
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,072
Because if you don't stop,
you will lose me.

532
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,452
I am going to leave you.

533
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,800
Fuck you.

534
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:30,291
Who are you trying to scare?

535
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:34,476
If you want to leave, then go!

536
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,352
Fuck you!

537
00:58:50,844 --> 00:58:51,844
Hi.

538
00:58:57,392 --> 00:58:58,392
That looks good.

539
00:59:00,124 --> 00:59:06,841
How about this?
These are the layouts and then…

540
00:59:07,146 --> 00:59:09,881
This is where your pictures will go.

541
00:59:10,287 --> 00:59:12,380
But there are just placeholders.

542
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:16,693
I'm so lucky.

543
00:59:24,335 --> 00:59:25,335
Oops!

544
00:59:25,753 --> 00:59:26,754
Sorry, sorry.

545
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:28,210
It's okay.

546
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:50,528
There's just something that—

547
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,263
Just tell me, I'll do anything.

548
00:59:57,474 --> 00:59:59,448
Really, anything?

549
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:05,208
What?

550
01:00:11,925 --> 01:00:12,967
Take off your clothes.

551
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:21,225
You scared me for a second.

552
01:00:22,477 --> 01:00:25,229
Don't people take off
their clothes to change?

553
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:34,572
I stalked you on social media.

554
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,305
You don't have any accounts anymore?

555
01:00:37,787 --> 01:00:40,870
I deactivated everything
when my cry video went viral.

556
01:00:41,568 --> 01:00:43,039
I had too many bashers.

557
01:00:44,248 --> 01:00:48,044
It's first time going viral
and it was so negative.

558
01:00:49,754 --> 01:00:51,130
Why didn't you delete it?

559
01:00:53,424 --> 01:00:58,096
I did, but there were already copies.

560
01:01:03,643 --> 01:01:07,313
You know, netizens forget easily.

561
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,067
Especially these days
with so many other issues.

562
01:01:11,943 --> 01:01:13,945
Yours will also be lost in the pile.

563
01:01:15,863 --> 01:01:19,117
And besides, it isn't real life.

564
01:01:30,378 --> 01:01:31,378
You're so beautiful.

565
01:01:36,342 --> 01:01:38,011
Don't you have a boyfriend?

566
01:01:38,886 --> 01:01:40,263
Or a girlfriend?

567
01:01:41,806 --> 01:01:42,849
Girlfriend?

568
01:01:45,518 --> 01:01:47,812
Do I have lesbian energy?

569
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:56,372
I don't want to assume.
But the thing is…

570
01:01:57,363 --> 01:01:58,363
I used...

571
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:00,483
I used to be bisexual.

572
01:02:03,867 --> 01:02:04,868
Used to be?

573
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:09,667
Does one's preference change
even if you get a husband?

574
01:02:10,168 --> 01:02:14,589
Alright, I had a girlfriend
before I married my husband.

575
01:02:20,795 --> 01:02:21,795
Why?

576
01:02:22,043 --> 01:02:23,503
Do you know my husband?

577
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,811
The former basketball star?

578
01:02:31,522 --> 01:02:34,567
He was famous before,
but he got injured.

579
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:39,447
But I didn't just marry him
because of his fame.

580
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:45,911
Why?

581
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,208
You know, answers to 'why questions'
are mostly bullshit.

582
01:02:50,875 --> 01:02:53,169
And my answer's definitely bullshit.

583
01:02:57,465 --> 01:03:01,385
I chose Dave because… He needs me.

584
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,308
Do you think you made the right choice?

585
01:03:09,477 --> 01:03:10,477
Of course.

586
01:03:12,396 --> 01:03:14,232
But you know, being a wife is hard.

587
01:03:16,109 --> 01:03:17,401
It's hard to be a mother.

588
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,145
We lost our baby recently.

589
01:03:24,685 --> 01:03:27,620
And Dave, I don't think
he can live without me.

590
01:03:28,996 --> 01:03:30,623
Especially in this pandemic.

591
01:03:33,835 --> 01:03:38,714
We tried to have a baby,
but my body is resisting.

592
01:03:40,591 --> 01:03:42,635
So now, I'm just a mother to Dave.

593
01:03:44,345 --> 01:03:46,722
And my pet plants.

594
01:03:50,017 --> 01:03:53,688
Hey, sorry. Is this too much information?

595
01:03:55,807 --> 01:03:57,723
These boys...

596
01:03:58,442 --> 01:03:59,569
Are all childish.

597
01:04:02,155 --> 01:04:04,532
I bet you would be a great mother.

598
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,703
We're never going to find out.

599
01:04:44,822 --> 01:04:47,658
Of course I look after my models.

600
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:22,860
Sorry.

601
01:06:35,683 --> 01:06:36,683
Mari…

602
01:06:40,688 --> 01:06:41,856
Mari. I need my medicine.

603
01:06:46,652 --> 01:06:48,279
Fuck you, come back!

604
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,238
Mari!

605
01:06:59,498 --> 01:07:00,833
Hey… Come in.

606
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:05,063
Sorry, I'm still not ready.

607
01:07:05,424 --> 01:07:07,217
Dave's got another issue.

608
01:07:08,364 --> 01:07:09,364
He's here?

609
01:07:09,967 --> 01:07:12,887
Yes, he's sick,
but not with Covid.

610
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:13,969
Come in!

611
01:07:15,397 --> 01:07:17,024
Why? What happened to him?

612
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:19,518
He's just going through something.

613
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,496
The plants are in the garden.

614
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:25,566
Could you load them in the car?
I'll just prepare.

615
01:07:25,591 --> 01:07:26,591
Okay.

616
01:10:36,215 --> 01:10:37,383
What are you doing?

617
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,475
What happened to him?

618
01:10:48,435 --> 01:10:49,435
Dave is sick.

619
01:10:51,605 --> 01:10:52,940
What were you doing to him?

620
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:03,284
And why are you wearing that?

621
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:04,951
Sorry.

622
01:11:08,872 --> 01:11:09,873
That belongs to Dave.

623
01:11:15,707 --> 01:11:16,707
Mari…

624
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,651
You have a right to know.

625
01:11:27,144 --> 01:11:28,965
Dave and I…

626
01:11:31,228 --> 01:11:32,521
Something happened between us.

627
01:11:35,316 --> 01:11:36,984
That's why I came here,

628
01:11:37,484 --> 01:11:40,821
To tell you all about
the things he's done.

629
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,341
You should know that you
don't need people like him.

630
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:45,909
You don't deserve this.

631
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:47,870
What are you saying?

632
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:49,204
You have to believe me!

633
01:11:49,707 --> 01:11:50,914
The cry video--

634
01:11:52,204 --> 01:11:53,534
It was about Dave!

635
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,144
I was a fangirl, Mari.

636
01:11:56,337 --> 01:11:58,589
- He met up with me.
- Lila, that's enough.

637
01:12:01,091 --> 01:12:03,832
He used me then he ghosted me.

638
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:05,904
Believe me.

639
01:12:05,929 --> 01:12:08,512
Lila, that's enough. Get out!

640
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:26,274
Please believe me,
you don't deserve someone like him.

641
01:12:26,299 --> 01:12:27,926
Lila, get out!

642
01:12:27,951 --> 01:12:30,287
- Mari, I'm here for you.
- Lila, enough.

643
01:12:30,287 --> 01:12:31,535
You don't deserve him.

644
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,015
Look at this.

645
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,667
Stop!

646
01:12:34,692 --> 01:12:38,654
Lila, Lila get out.
I want you to leave.

647
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:42,423
Go!

648
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:48,298
Pao? Pao, fucking answer me.

649
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:50,242
I've run out. I'm going crazy.

650
01:13:50,267 --> 01:13:52,352
Mari threw away my whole stash.

651
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:54,162
Fuck her.

652
01:13:56,039 --> 01:13:58,917
I found some leftovers,
but that bitch.

653
01:14:05,257 --> 01:14:07,342
Mari, I'm sorry.
I just need one more hit.

654
01:14:08,237 --> 01:14:10,042
Mari, sorry.

655
01:14:15,058 --> 01:14:16,185
Whatever, Dave.

656
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:19,271
Do what you want to do.

657
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:22,771
I'm out.

658
01:14:22,796 --> 01:14:23,796
Mari.

659
01:14:24,485 --> 01:14:25,485
Mari.

660
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:26,694
Mari.

661
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:31,365
Come on, Dave.

662
01:14:31,909 --> 01:14:32,993
Don't wait for me.

663
01:14:33,577 --> 01:14:35,037
Where are you going? It’s late!

664
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,500
Mari!

665
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,202
Are you going to leave him?

666
01:18:12,129 --> 01:18:13,422
Dave needs me.

667
01:18:17,718 --> 01:18:18,844
Do you still love him?

668
01:18:27,477 --> 01:18:28,477
What about us?

669
01:18:40,032 --> 01:18:41,700
What are we going to do with Dave?

670
01:19:04,765 --> 01:19:05,765
Dave.

671
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,445
You were out all night.

672
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:27,661
Where were you?

673
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:33,125
Dave.

674
01:19:34,044 --> 01:19:36,338
Don't you remember
anything from last night?

675
01:19:38,298 --> 01:19:39,298
What?

676
01:19:55,899 --> 01:19:56,899
Where did you get that?

677
01:20:01,488 --> 01:20:02,488
Dave.

678
01:20:05,242 --> 01:20:06,576
Just admit it.

679
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:17,378
I also have someone new.

680
01:20:21,633 --> 01:20:22,634
Fuck you!

681
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:29,307
You cheated first!

682
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:34,479
Dave, do you think what you did
have no consequences?

683
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:39,734
Dave, look at yourself.

684
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:42,988
Look at how miserable you are.

685
01:20:45,365 --> 01:20:46,700
You must be guilty.

686
01:20:47,993 --> 01:20:49,327
You look like shit.

687
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:53,133
Well, that's what you get for being a liar.

688
01:20:54,499 --> 01:20:55,959
You hid the truth from me.

689
01:20:57,669 --> 01:20:58,670
That Lila?

690
01:21:04,301 --> 01:21:05,301
I made a mistake.

691
01:21:06,636 --> 01:21:07,637
That was one night, Mari.

692
01:21:08,972 --> 01:21:10,765
Fuck, I'm telling you the truth.

693
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:12,445
What I did was wrong,
but it was one night!

694
01:21:16,646 --> 01:21:18,857
Dave, you're such an asshole.

695
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:21,610
I avoided her.

696
01:21:22,903 --> 01:21:23,903
I chose you.

697
01:21:25,572 --> 01:21:27,741
I chose you because we're married.

698
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:30,952
I chose you because I love you.

699
01:21:31,661 --> 01:21:33,788
Because I love you so much.

700
01:21:35,415 --> 01:21:36,499
I love you too.

701
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:38,752
So what now?

702
01:21:39,417 --> 01:21:40,417
But Dave!

703
01:21:43,006 --> 01:21:44,841
I can't forgive you just yet.

704
01:21:45,175 --> 01:21:46,495
So that's why you did this to me?

705
01:21:49,262 --> 01:21:50,680
Why you fucked someone else?

706
01:21:51,097 --> 01:21:52,724
Fuck you!

707
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:56,603
You fucked someone else.

708
01:21:59,231 --> 01:22:02,484
Who is it? Tell me who it is.

709
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:04,653
I want to know who.

710
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:06,070
Who?

711
01:22:06,196 --> 01:22:07,196
- Who?
- Dave!

712
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:09,324
Who is he?
Tell me who it is!

713
01:22:09,783 --> 01:22:10,784
I want to know!

714
01:22:15,705 --> 01:22:16,705
Mari!

715
01:22:17,415 --> 01:22:18,415
Fuck you!

716
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:19,751
Fuck you too!

717
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:21,335
Calm down!

718
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:23,022
What were you expecting?
That I would be happy?

719
01:22:23,046 --> 01:22:24,923
That I would fucking congratulate you?

720
01:22:24,923 --> 01:22:26,174
Just tell me who he is!

721
01:22:27,634 --> 01:22:29,469
Dave, enough.

722
01:22:30,971 --> 01:22:33,348
If you won't calm down,
let's just talk tomorrow.

723
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,558
Tomorrow? Tell me who he is!

724
01:22:34,808 --> 01:22:35,934
- What the fuck?!
- I said who?

725
01:22:35,934 --> 01:22:38,395
- Dave!
- Who is he?!

726
01:22:38,895 --> 01:22:40,230
- Mari!
- Stop!

727
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:41,982
- Mari, tell me!
- Dave!

728
01:22:41,982 --> 01:22:42,982
Mari!

729
01:22:46,278 --> 01:22:47,696
Fuck you, this is all your fault!

730
01:22:51,616 --> 01:22:52,616
Are you okay?

731
01:23:02,002 --> 01:23:03,002
Mari?

732
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:09,968
You overdid it last night.

733
01:23:13,513 --> 01:23:15,265
Dave? Make this stop, please.

734
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:19,269
Let's fix this.

735
01:24:14,074 --> 01:24:17,243
The whole village is
under granular lockdown.

736
01:24:25,835 --> 01:24:27,504
As long as the two of us are together.

737
01:24:36,554 --> 01:24:38,301
The three of us will stay here.

738
01:24:39,891 --> 01:24:40,891
Us three?

739
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:47,941
Dave, we have a lot to discuss.

740
01:25:21,975 --> 01:25:22,975
Dave...

741
01:25:24,102 --> 01:25:24,853
You should eat.

742
01:25:24,878 --> 01:25:25,878
This is wrong.

743
01:25:27,397 --> 01:25:28,397
This is so wrong.

744
01:25:30,066 --> 01:25:31,943
- What's wrong?
- Shut up.

745
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:35,362
Mari?

746
01:25:35,947 --> 01:25:38,950
This is wrong.
And you need to leave.

747
01:25:39,387 --> 01:25:40,827
She's not leaving.

748
01:25:41,828 --> 01:25:43,329
Nobody's leaving, Dave.

749
01:25:43,997 --> 01:25:45,331
Why is she here?

750
01:25:51,129 --> 01:25:52,255
I need her.

751
01:25:54,257 --> 01:25:55,257
Why?

752
01:25:57,302 --> 01:25:59,262
We will love and take
care of each other, Dave.

753
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:00,764
You're shitting me right now.

754
01:26:01,598 --> 01:26:02,598
This is ridiculous.

755
01:26:08,772 --> 01:26:10,440
That's why we're here.

756
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:15,487
I don't want to do to you
what you did to me.

757
01:26:22,202 --> 01:26:23,703
This is sick.

758
01:26:25,371 --> 01:26:26,664
You're the one who does drugs.

759
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:29,541
Shut up.

760
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:55,443
Come on, let's eat.

761
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:17,632
Aren't you scared?

762
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:23,637
I am.

763
01:27:24,597 --> 01:27:26,975
But I can handle it
because you're here with me.

764
01:27:28,893 --> 01:27:30,019
Let's just leave.

765
01:27:39,237 --> 01:27:40,237
This is my house.

766
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:44,075
And if he won't straighten up,
I'll make him leave.

767
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:49,455
I want to give him a chance.

768
01:28:09,976 --> 01:28:12,176
I'm getting some things delivered.
Do you want anything?

769
01:28:13,771 --> 01:28:16,858
I need napkins,
it's almost the time of the month.

770
01:28:17,525 --> 01:28:18,026
Okay.

771
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:19,736
Alright, just let me know.

772
01:29:08,993 --> 01:29:10,620
This is so fucked up.

773
01:29:14,957 --> 01:29:16,042
I'm here, Dave.

774
01:29:19,629 --> 01:29:21,506
I don't want this setup.

775
01:29:24,509 --> 01:29:25,635
Why not?

776
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,138
Because it's wrong.

777
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,394
It's not wrong, Dave.

778
01:29:39,691 --> 01:29:41,776
I can't do it.

779
01:29:44,737 --> 01:29:46,239
You can do it.

780
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:50,743
Promise me that you'll try.

781
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:11,449
Maybe there's poison in there.

782
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:15,828
Why are you here?

783
01:31:22,668 --> 01:31:23,836
Why are you doing this?

784
01:31:28,299 --> 01:31:30,635
At first, I wanted revenge.

785
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:36,599
But now I just want to protect Mari.
From you.

786
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:41,103
Don't you have any self-respect?

787
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:43,230
This is wrong.

788
01:31:45,358 --> 01:31:49,070
Wrong? You fucked up first.

789
01:31:50,196 --> 01:31:51,531
I was just coping.

790
01:31:54,367 --> 01:31:55,367
Me too.

791
01:31:56,202 --> 01:31:57,537
Coping from what you did.

792
01:31:58,454 --> 01:31:59,789
What did I do?

793
01:32:26,279 --> 01:32:27,764
So all this…
is because of that?

794
01:32:29,235 --> 01:32:31,988
Over one thing that
happened a long time ago?

795
01:32:32,013 --> 01:32:33,639
Something I can't even remember?

796
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:35,615
That's why.

797
01:32:36,375 --> 01:32:38,584
Men are like that.

798
01:32:40,037 --> 01:32:42,397
You move on too fast.

799
01:32:49,171 --> 01:32:53,718
But good thing us women,
we don't forget easily.

800
01:33:01,017 --> 01:33:02,643
So you're punishing me?

801
01:33:12,028 --> 01:33:13,028
Yes.

802
01:37:18,732 --> 01:37:20,108
What do we do now?

803
01:37:23,154 --> 01:37:24,154
What will happen to us?

804
01:37:27,116 --> 01:37:28,534
I tried.

805
01:37:29,499 --> 01:37:31,751
But I don't think this is working out.

806
01:37:36,342 --> 01:37:37,626
When will she leave?

807
01:37:40,171 --> 01:37:41,672
You're the one who should leave!

808
01:37:42,339 --> 01:37:43,424
What?!

809
01:37:44,341 --> 01:37:46,886
I don't want to leave! I can't!

810
01:37:49,388 --> 01:37:50,973
I don't love you anymore!

811
01:37:53,559 --> 01:37:54,894
You're choosing her?

812
01:37:59,064 --> 01:38:00,524
We're over, Dave.

813
01:38:03,527 --> 01:38:05,362
You're leaving me for that woman?

814
01:38:06,822 --> 01:38:09,325
I'm leaving because of you!

815
01:38:10,326 --> 01:38:11,535
Because of myself!

816
01:38:14,330 --> 01:38:15,372
What am I going to do now?

817
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:18,459
What about me?

818
01:38:20,753 --> 01:38:23,339
Fuck you! This can't be.

819
01:38:23,923 --> 01:38:29,053
You can't do this to me!
I'm the man and you're my wife!

820
01:38:30,679 --> 01:38:33,974
I don't want you anymore. Get out!

821
01:39:39,957 --> 01:39:42,483
Why did you kill her?

822
01:39:46,588 --> 01:39:50,009
It wasn't just me.

823
01:39:50,509 --> 01:39:52,094
We killed her.

824
01:39:53,913 --> 01:39:58,309
You and me. We are one.

825
01:39:58,684 --> 01:40:00,623
The two of us. We're one.

826
01:40:00,915 --> 01:40:02,639
You're insane!

827
01:40:14,742 --> 01:40:20,164
Lila!

828
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:25,687
Lila!

829
01:41:06,502 --> 01:41:08,253
So what's next?

830
01:41:12,383 --> 01:41:14,616
We're going to love one another.

831
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:21,521
I'm pregnant.
