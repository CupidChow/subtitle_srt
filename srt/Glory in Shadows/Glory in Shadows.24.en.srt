00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,560
- abandon me!
- What are you doing?

21
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,690
why wasn't Xu Shan helping you?

He...

23
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
What happened to him?

He's fine.

25
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,760
You should focus on healing.

28
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,150

Jingchuan, Li Xingwan...

30
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,430
She's lost her mind.

31
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,350
She killed your mother

32
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
and the brother who fought by my side.

33
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,240

No.

36
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,060
I must go and kill her.

37
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,920
No, no.

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240
Don't!

39
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
Don't, Jingchuan!

40
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,910
Let's just stay together.

you're here.

50
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,960
Li Xingwan,

51
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,560
how did you end up like this?

52
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,480
Would you truly kill me?

53
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,390
You've harmed so many.

54
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,320
Today...

55
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,830
Today, I'll kill you.

56
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,760
Don't!

57
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,910
Stop!

58
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,270
Why?

59
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,510
Why not seek justice
for your mother now?

60
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,680
Silence!

61
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,930
Aren't you trying to avenge your mother?

62
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,160
If I don't kill her today,

63
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,390
more innocent lives will fall
into her hands.

64
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,540
I no longer wish to seek vengeance
for my mother.

65
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,390
Evil will meet its own end.

66
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,070
Let's go.

67
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,560
Shen Yaochu,
spare me your false kindness.

68
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,230
You...

69
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,710
Why?

70
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Tell me why!

71
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,240
Because she's my sister.

72
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,830
The sister I've searched
for over 20 years.

73
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,160
Shen Yaochu,

74
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,040
what nonsense are you spouting?

75
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,750
How could I possibly be your sister?

76
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,510
There's a birthmark
on your left shoulder.

77
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,590
Its shape is exactly
like this jade pendant.

78
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,390
When you were born,

79
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,160
Mother made it for you.

80
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,870
Ever since you went missing,

81
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,630
I've kept it safe for you

82
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,600
for over 20 years.

83
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,520
Mother,

84
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,310
when will my sister grow up?

85
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,960
Yaochu,

86
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,630
look at the shape of this jade pendant.

87
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,600
Doesn't it look like Yunge's birthmark?

88
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,310
Then you should be the one to guard it.

89
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,040
When Yunge grows older,

90
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,820
you can place it on her yourself.

91
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,990
Will you do that?

92
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
Yunge,

93
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
once you've grown up,

94
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,200
I'll return the jade pendant to you.

95
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,670
It's a promise.

96
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,710
Impossible.

97
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,160
No way.

98
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,240
I killed my mother?

99
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,080
Impossible.

100
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,680
No way.

101
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,240
I killed my mother?

102
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,000
I killed my mother?

103
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,120
Yunge.

104
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,870

105

106
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
I brought you something tasty.

107
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,440
Eat it,

108
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,200
and you'll see your daughter again.

109
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,390
It's very sweet.

110
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,350
Go on.

111
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,630
I'm telling you to eat.

113
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,110
Yunge.

114
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,270
Yunge, don't leave.

115

117

119
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,960
- Jingchuan.
- I killed my mother.

120
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,550
She was the only family I had left.

121
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,630
I killed my mother.

122
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,040
Don't kill her.

123
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
I killed my mother.

124
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,790
Today, I'll spare your life.

125
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,150
Consider it fulfilling
my mother's last wish.

126
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,510

00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,270
find me sooner next time.
