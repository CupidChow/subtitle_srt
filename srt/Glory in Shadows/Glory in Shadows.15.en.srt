Wan'er?

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,710
Why are you here?

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,070
Mother is chanting sutras.

15
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,710
I rushed over with some food.

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,950
You must be hungry.

17
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,710
Sister-in-law, did Brother come?

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,400
Sister-in-law,

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,710
Brother treats you so well.

20
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,960
Sister-in-law,

21
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,280
I believe you did not push Concubine Qin.

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,920
You couldn't possibly do such a thing.

23
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
However,

24
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,150
when did you get pregnant?

25
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,680
You didn't tell me.

26
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,680
I only just found out.

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,870
Sister-in-law, I truly envy you.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,710
You and Brother love each other deeply

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,400
and you are going to have a child.

30
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,280
You will also meet someone
who truly loves you.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,910
He will be good to you, too.

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,200
Will...

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,080
Will I meet someone like that?

34
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,870
Yes,

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,360
you will.

36
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,470
You're such a good lady.

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,910
Your future husband will cherish you.

38
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,150
Sister-in-law,

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,870
seeing you and Brother loving each other

40
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,030
makes me truly happy.

41
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,520
I think you should go back now

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,640
before anyone notices.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,000
Old Madam will punish you
if she finds out.

44
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,840
Take care, Sister-in-law.

45
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,470
Be careful.

46
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
Xiaocui,

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,680
I want some water.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,080
What are you doing here?

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,200
Yiyi,

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,750
our child

51
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,150
is gone?

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,200
You should go!

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,750
Here's the Li Manor!

54
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,400
We'll be finished if they see you.

55
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,590
Go!

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,910
I'm not leaving!

57
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,710
What are you doing? Let go of me!

58
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,520
I never expected that wretch Shen

59
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,030
to be so hypocritical!

60
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,360
She said she would spare us,

61
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,520
but she harmed our child instead.

62
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,430
How did you know about this?

63
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,190
You don't need to worry about that.

64
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,470
I'm going to kill her right now

65
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,000
to avenge our child!

66
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,710
Stop!

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,120
Do you want this to be known to everyone?

68
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,910
Do you want to ruin me?

69
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,750
Yiyi,

70
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,870
I'll take you away, alright?

71
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,160
Let's get out of here.

72
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,240
We can still have another child.

73
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,200
Kong Liang,

74
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,070
wake up.

75
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,070
How could I possibly go with you?

76
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,360
I...

77
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,950
Though we fell in love in our youth,

78
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,870
you are penniless

79
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,510
and have no official rank.

80
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,270
Should I accept begging for a living?

81
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,830
That's not true.

82
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,990
You told me that as I

83
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,870
pass the exams...

84
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,040
So what if you pass the exams?

85
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,360
How many years would it take

86
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,800
to rival the wealth and honor I enjoy now?

87
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
I will not forsake a life of comfort

88
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,800
to suffer with you.

89
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,980
So, you never planned

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,480
to leave with me, did you?

91
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,960
Yes,

92
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
I just wanted you to stop pestering me.

93
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,480
Did you hear me clearly?

94
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,120
Now hurry up and...

95
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,400
Get lost!

96
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,400
But...

97
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,720
We had a child.

98
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,190
(I am carrying his child.)

99
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
(If anyone finds out...)

100
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,160
What are you doing here?

101
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,120
She was right.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
My child must die.

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,600
She?

104
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,800
Who is she?

105
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,070
None of your business.

106
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,190
So, you killed our child

107
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,190
with your own hands, didn't you?

108
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,230
Yes, I did!

109
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,000
Kong Liang,

110
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,630
you're just a commoner!

111
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,120
Sharing a few nights with me

112
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,800
was already more than you deserved!

113
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,190
You want me to bear you a child?

114
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
Dream on.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040
Qin Ruoyi,

116
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,920
for your own wealth and glory,

117
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,560
you can even kill your child?

118
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,190
I never knew you were so vicious!

119
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,680
You can only blame yourself
for misjudgement.

120
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,310
That's all I need to say.

121
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,040
You'd better leave now.

122
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,520
Otherwise,

123
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,750
I'll have you arrested as a thief.

124
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,630
Qin Ruoyi,

125
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,120
you can humiliate me all you want,

126
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,870
but the child was innocent.

127
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,360
How can someone so vicious

128
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,190
deserve to live in this world?

129
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,430
I will kill you and send you

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,040
to follow our child to the grave!

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,920
Let go of me!

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,510
I will kill this evil woman!

133
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,680
What are you doing here?

134
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,880
Old Madam, General,

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,840
this man...

136
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,430
This man tried to assault me.

137
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,560
General, help!

138
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,790
General!

139
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,240
It was you.

140
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,390
You lured him here, didn't you?

141
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,310
Yes, I copied your handwriting

142
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,430
and wrote him a letter.

143
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,430
Do you think he could

144
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,720
just walk in here,

145
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,040
in the marquis manor?

146
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,590
General...

147
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,270
General...

148
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,070
Did you hear that, General?

149
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,870
Shen Yaochu tried to set me up!

150
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,750
Did she set you up,

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,270
or did you set her up?

152
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,270
General...

153
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,680
Don't take her word for it alone.

154
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,030
It was her!

155
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,190
She killed our child,

156
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,790
General.

157
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,190
But at that night,

158
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,870
I never even touched you.

159
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,950
Old Madam, did you

160
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,830
hear their conversation clearly?

161
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,680
Old Madam...

162
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,920
Please spare my life, I'm begging you.

163
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,750
I've always been loyal to you,

164
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,750
Old Madam!

165
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,080
How dare you commit adultery

166
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,200
and sully the Li family bloodline!

167
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,800
Guards!

168
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,270
Drag her out and beat her to death!

169
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,750
Old Madam, please don't!

170
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,040
Old Madam,

171
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,750
please have mercy!

172
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,000
Please spare my life!

173
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,790
Heaven watches!

174
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,030
Who knew your reckoning

175
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,910
would be so sudden, you wretch?

176
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,270
Wan'er.

177
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,270
Wan'er, please speak for me.

178
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,130
Wan'er,

179
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,550
please help me.

180
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,270
- Please save me!
- Mother,

181
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,150
Concubine Qin did commit a grave wrong,

182
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,000
but she's a human being.

183
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,150
Please spare her life, Mother.

184
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,360
Drive her out of the Li Manor

185
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,550
as punishment.

186
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,320
Wan'er, this is not your concern.

187
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,270
Mother, we practice Buddhism every day,

188
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,910
and we know that saving a life
brings boundless merit.

189
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,470
Mother,

190
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,870
for the sake of the Buddha,

191
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
please spare Concubine Qin's life.

192
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,030
Qin's conduct is corrupt

193
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,440
and framed Her Ladyship.

194
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,470
Shen,

195
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,440
she is yours to decide.

196
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,990
Yes.

197
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,280
Wan'er,

198
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,670
do you truly plead for her?

199
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,560
Sister-in-law,

200
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,790
I cannot bear to take a life.

201
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,550
Not everyone can be redeemed by kindness.

202
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,040
Sister-in-law,

203
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,790
you just conceived Brother's child.

204
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,360
I know your heart couldn't bear it either.

205
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,680
Moreover,

206
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,360
she's a human being.

207
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,120
Alright, I'll spare her life.

208
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,240
Send her to the estate

209
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,630
outside the city at dawn,

210
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,440
so she cannot spread rumors

211
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,120
and damage the Lis' reputation.

212
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,080
As for this man...

213
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,030
Send him to his hometown.

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,840
Yes.

215
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,870
Go!

216
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,160
Go!

217
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,160
Wan'er.

218
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,790
You are far too kind.

219
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,510
Wan'er,

220
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,600
with your temperament,

221
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,200
you'll be easy prey.

222
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,390
No matter what,

223
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,910
she's a human being.

224
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,320
Concubine Tang, you...

225
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,470
You...

226
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,680
I didn't.

227
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,030
(Qifang Pavilion)
Concubine Tang killed!

228
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,590
I didn't.

229
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,630
General, Your Ladyship.

230
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,280
Yuzhu,

231
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,280
you...

232
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,080
Your Ladyship, I didn't do it.

233
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,600
I didn't. I don't know.

234
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,360
Go, and speak not a word.

235
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,470
Yes.

236
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,670
It's Fan Scorpion Poison.

237
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,030
Yes, indeed.

238
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,390
What poison? I don't know.

239
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,670
I didn't poison her.

240
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,960
Calm down.

241
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Tell me, why are you here?

242
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,870
I...

243
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,750
I couldn't sleep last night.

244
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,600
Thinking Concubine Qin

245
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,910
would be driven out tomorrow,

246
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,360
I went to make fun of her.

247
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,150
But the moment I reached

248
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,600
her bedside, I was knocked out.

249
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,230
When I came to,

250
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,480
I found myself holding this dagger.

251
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
I... I really don't know.

252
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,480
I have no reason to kill her.

253
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,670
She would be driven out.

254
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,120
Why would I kill her?

255
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,920
Unless

256
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,600
there was a reason she had to die.

257
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,750
Since that's the case,

258
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,750
the murderer can only be Tang Yuzhu.
