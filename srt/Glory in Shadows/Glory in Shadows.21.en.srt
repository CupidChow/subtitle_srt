Just admit your mistake to Father.

Why? I've done nothing wrong.

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,790
Hit him.

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Hit him hard.

17
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,320
Father.

18
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,350
Father.

19
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,230
Stop it, Father.

20
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,150
I beg you, please stop.

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,280
Stop hitting him.

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,760

If you want to hit me, fine.

30
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,520
Consider it repaying your care
in raising me.

31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,190
But if you dare lay a hand on Yaochu,

32
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,500
don't blame me for shattering

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,630
what little bond we have left.

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,750
You'd turn on your own father

35
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,400
for such a woman?

36
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,750
Have you no respect for me?

37
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,730
A father's kindness
breeds a son's respect.

38
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,910
You once vowed to my mother,

39
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,360
yet soon after, you cast us aside.

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,280
That is heartless.

41
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,800
Zhao Qingru has guarded
your family for years.

42
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,870
Yet you abandoned her.

43
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,870
That is dishonorable.

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,560
A man so cold and ungrateful as you

45
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,360
is not worthy of being my father.

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,240
I'm not worthy?

47
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,590
Li Jingchuan.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,240
Do you believe I'd kill you?

49
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,120
With your influence,

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,360
can you even kill me?

51
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,310
Dear,

52
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,170
this time, I'm here for you.

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,040
Your father hit you today

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,170
just to force you into casting me aside.

55
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,040
Even if this hadn't happened,

56
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,100
he would've found a way
to punish me anyway.

57
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,310
I know you were shielding me.

58
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,230
And what about you?

59
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
You took the lash for me.

60
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880
It must have hurt.

61
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,200
Yes.

62
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,070
My body is wounded.

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,270
But my heart is finally healing.

64
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,070
If I hadn't met you,

65
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,830
the pain in my heart

66
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,480
might never have eased in this lifetime.

67
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,710
And you?

68
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,240
Would you tell me
about the pain in your heart?

69
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,660
- My mother was sold into a brothel.
- I feel cold.

70
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,710
That place held her captive
for half her life.

71
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,160
She entrusted her heart to Li Hongshan.

72
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,630
But all she received
was deceit and abandonment.

73
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,750
And because she was carrying me,

74
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,570
she was cast out of the brothel.

75
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,150
My mother knew her days were numbered.

76
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,360
She feared I'd be left alone.

77
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,830
(Li Manor)
So, she brought me to Li Manor,

78
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,750
begging Li Hongshan to acknowledge me.

79
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,870
I can no longer protect you.

80
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
But if your father accepts you,

81
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,120
I can die

82
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,310
without regret.

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,160
No, I don't want you to die.

84
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,660
- For his reputation,
- Please don't die.

85
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,430
Li Hongshan took me in.

86
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,360
Our fates are so much alike.

87
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,110
Still,

88
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,320
though we've faced countless hardships,

89
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,730
we both found our way through.

90
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,000
Right?

91
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,500
(Stability Ensures Peace)

92
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,930
This Fragrant Concubine Treading on Snow
came from Xingwan.

93
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,200
The scent really is identical.

94
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,190
Is Xingwan truly the murderer?

95
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,040
If it were Shopkeeper Liu and Qin Ruoyi,

96
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,510
she does seem suspicious.

97
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,430
But on the day my mother died,

98
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,340
she stayed with you the whole time.

99
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,180
When would she have had time
to kill someone?

100
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,110
That's not right.

101
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,480
She wasn't with me the whole time.

102
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,730
She said she'd pick morning dew
to make tea.

103
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,480
So she left early.

104
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,350
When I arrived at Guanyin Nunnery,

105
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,520
she was already there waiting.

106
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,750
Jingchuan,

107
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,160
why join me at the nunnery

108
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,720
to offer prayers?

109
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,880
I had nothing else to do,
so I came for a stroll.

110
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,560
Why didn't you bring Yaochu along?

111
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,830
I see.

112
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,120
What do you mean?

113
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,950
You're such a fool.

114
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,000
You really think I killed your mother?

115
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,720
If that's the case,

116
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,390
Xingwan would be the prime suspect.

117
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,240
In this household,

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,360
I keep my guard up with everyone,

119
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,110
except Xingwan.

120
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Whenever she appeared,

121
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,340
she always made me feel

122
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,120
she was pure and kind-hearted.

123
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,630
But if it was all just an act,

124
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,800
that would be truly frightening.

125
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,160
Xingwan was taken in before I returned.

126
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,150
Zhao Qingru had just given birth
to Li Jingxu

127
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,390
and nearly died in childbirth.

128
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,040
She kept a young girl nearby
to bring some joy,

129
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,040
but since she wasn't a real Li,

130
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,830
she was bullied everywhere she went.

131
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,220
So, she followed me from a young age.

132
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,070
In my eyes,

133
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,120
she had always been timid and weak.

134
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,510
Was that just a disguise?

135
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,160
I must've overlooked something.

136
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,000
In such a scheming household,

137
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
she grew up safely.

138
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
How could she be simple?

139
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,340
But she bore no grudge
against my mother.

140
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,780
Why would she want her dead?

141
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,480
Why don't we just ask her?

142
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,320
Wait.

143
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,150
Right now, our only lead is the scent.

144
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,360
If Xingwan really did it,

145
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,030
she could easily claim
that Concubine Tang is slandering her

146
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,540
and refuse to admit it.

147
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,030
If it wasn't her,

148
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,910
wouldn't that harm your bond
as siblings?

149
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,840
Besides, the Fan Scorpion Poison
hasn't been found.

150
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,910
Let's not alert her just yet.

151
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,940
Then what should we do now?

152
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,920
Find someone

153
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,440
to follow her quietly.

154
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,750
Let's see if she does
anything suspicious

155
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,230
and check

156
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,910
whether she really has
the Fan Scorpion Poison.

157
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,630
Alright.

158
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,920
Wait.

159
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,040
General.

160
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,680
What's inside here?

161
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
This...

162
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,790
It's a calming potion.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,510
My lady hasn't been sleeping well.

164
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,200
So, we asked a physician to prepare it.

165
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,560
Go on.

166
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,680
Yes.

167
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,800
Jingchuan.

168
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,800
Jingchuan.

169
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,790
I saw your maid take medicine out.

170
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,960
Why?

171
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,940
Are you feeling unwell?

172
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
I've been waking up suddenly at night.

173
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,480
So, I drank some calming potion.

174
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,320
It's nothing serious.

175
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,600
Jingchuan,

176
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,630
has your injury healed?

177
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,200
I was just about to visit you.

178
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,630
It's fine.

179
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,230
Jingchuan,

180
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,240
I know you don't like Father.

181
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,630
But what Father said

182
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,440
does make some sense.

183
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,590
Xingwan,

184
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,870
you should know

185
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,750
Yaochu and I love each other.

186
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,550
I'd never cast my wife aside
for ambition.

187
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,680
Jingchuan,

188
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,000
you and Yaochu are so sweet.

189
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,590
My Lady!

190
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,110
My Lady,

191
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,560
the Master has asked for you.

192
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,870
Understood.

193
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,440
Does he call you over every day?

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,840
Father just woke up

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,750
and was met
with sudden troubles at home.

196
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,080
It's left him troubled.

197
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,600
He's asked me to speak with him often.

198
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,710
Go on then.

199
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,440
What's this?

200
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,720
I followed Zhenzhu all the way.

201
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,080
I saw her toss the leftover herbs
in a hidden spot

202
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
and step on them to bits.

203
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,930
I picked the remnants back up

204
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,260
and went to consult a physician.

205
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,560
The potion turned out to be...

206
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,350
Tell us.

207
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,970
It was a contraceptive potion.

208
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,440
My Lady,

209
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,840
that potion is bad for your health.

210
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,630
Shall I fetch the physician
to examine you?

211
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,870
Do you want everyone

212
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,720
to know about my shame?

213
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,630
I would never dare.

214
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,470
Leave at once.

215
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,650
Only when pain cuts deep into the bones

216
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,030
can hatred last forever.

217
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,390
Why would she drink such a thing?

218
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,120
Could it be she...

219
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
This matter must never be revealed.

220
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,350
Yes.

221
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,750
Leave.

222
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,540
She rarely socializes with anyone.

223
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,800
How could that be?

224
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,030
Given the situation,

225
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,660
they've been in contact
for quite some time.

226
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,960
Even if she was secretly seeing someone,

227
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,750
why would she kill someone?

228
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,710
That depends

229
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,030
on who her lover is.

230
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,980
(Qifang Pavilion)

231
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,160
These past few days,

232
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,000
she hasn't reached out
to anyone outside?

233
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,670
I've been following her.

234
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,090
I even checked everything
going in and out of her room,

235
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,500
but found nothing suspicious.

236
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,280
Could it be

237
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,450
that this person is inside the manor?

238
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,870
Wait...

239
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,390
What is it?

240
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,110
Impossible.

241
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,420
That's absolutely impossible.
