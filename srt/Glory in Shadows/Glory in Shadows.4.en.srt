=Episode 4=

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,480
General.

12
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,070
Nanny Sun tampered with the cushion.

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,040
Why didn't you tell?

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,590
General, didn't you say last night

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,040
you wanted to see my skills?

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,430
Are you satisfied with them now?

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,950
So this is the reason.

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,200
Or I'd have no right

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,230
to bargain with you.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,480
Can you help me now, General?

21
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,990
Alright.

22
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,920
I promised to protect your mother.

23
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,710
Thank you, General.

24
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,000
But if you end up gravely injured,

25
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,710
how would you manage the household?

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,350
General, you've fought for years.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,120
You wouldn't grasp the schemes in a household.

28
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,840
If I must rely on you every time,

29
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,430
how could I manage the household?

30
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,270
Come on.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,640
I'll see you back.

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,750
Have you gotten into character?

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,680
This show of affection was
meant to appease Old Madam.

34
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,590
Pay it no mind.

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,080
Shen Yaochu,

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,520
don't be so ungrateful.

37
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,120
I have overstepped.

38
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,310
Here.

39
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,680
Forget it.

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,080
Suit yourself.

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,630
Thank you, General.

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,120
The sordid affairs
within the household...

43
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,560
How could I possibly be unaware?

44
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,360
(This Li Jingchuan…)

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,590
(He picks on me,)

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,190
(yet still tries to play nice.)

47
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,360
(Seems there's no decent
soul in this family.)

48
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,310
Sister-in-law?

49
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,870
May I come in?

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,240
Come in, quickly.

51
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,030
Sister-in-law…

52
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,750
Your knee injury must be severe.

53
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,310
I brought you wound paste.

54
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,240
I… I… I…

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,960
Sister-in-law, you're remarkably strong.

56
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,640
You could even

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,840
endure such pain.

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,750
Nanny Sun has served
my mother for many years.

59
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,710
She's always been greatly valued.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,800
So…

61
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,080
Mother never paid much heed

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
to her devious tricks.

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,470
Today, you punished Nanny Sun.

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,750
You've avenged me,

65
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,600
and also all those she once

66
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,560
tormented before.

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,800
She treated you the same?

68
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,800
Aren't you the family's young lady?

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,120
How dare she mistreat you?

70
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,120
You might not know, sister-in-law.

71
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,310
I was actually adopted by the Li family.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,870
If the Li family hadn't fed me,

73
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,270
I would probably have

74
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,830
starved on the streets long ago.

75
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,310
So matters like this

76
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,560
don't mean much to me.

77
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,680
I've always been closest to Jinchuan.

78
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,190
Since he likes you,

79
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,390
I like you, too.

80
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,670
Sister-in-law,

81
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,310
can I come find you to play
more often from now on?

82
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,910
Of course you can.

83
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,000
(Seems Li Jingchuan's
sister is a decent lady.)

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,640
What did you say?

85
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,190
Li Jingchuan is alive?

86
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,240
He has returned?

87
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,610
Yes.

88
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,240
The Li Manor is holding a grand banquet

89
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,390
to celebrate General Li's
triumphant return.

90
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,790
So you mean…

91
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,950
Shen Yaochu is alive, too?

92
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,070
You may leave.

93
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,910
Yes.

94
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,600
Mother!

95
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,390
What should we do?
Shen Yaochu didn't die.

96
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,270
She's even become the General's wife.

97
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,360
If she asked General Li for revenge,

98
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,390
then we… We…

99
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,240
Why are you panicking?

100
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,520
That Li Jingchuan…

101
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,950
Could he really wipe out our family?

102
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,270
Well... If you had let me
marry him back then,

103
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,360
I'd be the General's wife now.

104
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,480
Are you out of your mind?

105
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,470
Mother!

106
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,800
Would you go to meet your end?

107
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,040
Li Jingchuan isn't dead, though.

108
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,950
Do you think the Li Manor
is a good place?

109
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,750
Li Jingchuan wasn't born
of the Old Madam.

110
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,430
If he hadn't left early
to join the army,

111
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,680
he'd have been gone long ago.

112
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,040
But now, he holds great power and rank.

113
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,560
If Shen Yaochu returns for revenge,

114
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,470
what will we do?

115
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,320
Write a letter

116
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,630
to your father immediately.

117
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,000
Tell him to return at once.

118
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,510
Say there's an urgent matter.

119
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,120
His inspection tour
should be nearly over.

120
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,300
Go, quickly.

121
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,150
Alright.

122
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,750
Shen Yaochu,

123
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,000
fortune truly favors you.

124
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,790
However,

125
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,480
as long as your mother
remains in my hands,

126
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,920
I doubt you'll cause much trouble.

127
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,720
He still hasn't woken up?

128
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
No.

129
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,270
I found the best physicians.

130
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,920
But they can only keep him alive.

131
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,070
Speak to your father now.

132
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,830
Perhaps he might hear you.

133
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,910
No need.

134
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,750
Your son has come to see you.

135
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,480
Do you hear that?

136
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,360
These two sons of yours,

137
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,680
do you favor Jingchuan more,

138
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,120
or is it my Jingxu you cherish?

139
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,310
This hairpin was your gift to me
on our wedding night.

140
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,720
I gaze upon it every single day.

141
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,430
I kept thinking about
the promises you made to me.

142
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,800
But you…

143
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,000
You deceived me instead.

144
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,600
You brought that woman and
her child into this household.

145
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,240
You let that courtesan

146
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,630
step right over me.

147
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,190
You turned me into a laughingstock
across the entire capital.

148
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,150
So…

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,070
I will make your life worse than death.

150
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,830
And you will watch closely

151
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,000
as I destroy that woman's
child with my own hands.

152
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,580
(Qifang Pavilion)

153
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,750
Madam!

154
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,040
How is it?

155
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,630
Madam, I've found out the details.

156
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,000
There is indeed a Madam Shen
living at Guanyin Nunnery.

157
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,120
It's said the General has arranged

158
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,000
for the masters there
to treat her with great care.

159
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,510
That's good.

160
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,920
By the way, Madam…

161
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
You're to return to your
mother's in two days.

162
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,270
Shall I start preparing in advance?

163
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,710
To my mother's?

164
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,720
Where is the General now?

165
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,440
I just passed by the study.

166
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,840
The lights inside were on.

167
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,360
Seems he's yet to rest.

168
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,350
Madam,

169
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,720
is the General not staying here tonight?

170
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,350
If he's not coming,

171
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,160
we'll invite him.

172
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,590
Madam.

173
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,510
It's Lady Ruoyi.

174
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,030
I greet you, General.

175
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,670
Who allowed you in?

176
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,630
I may have wed into the family early,

177
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,480
yet I've never greeted you, General.

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,150
Only today,

179
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,050
I caught a glimpse of you
from afar and came

180
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,320
to pay my respects.

181
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,790
Understood. You may leave now.

182
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,550
General, you're busy
with affairs all day.

183
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,630
Why not let me give you a massage?

184
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,160
My Lord.

185
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,750
Why aren't you resting yet?

186
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,280
Madam...

187
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,990
Ruoyi.

188
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,040
Massage.

189
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,080
This is…

190
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,550
Lady Ruoyi.

191
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,960
So Concubine Qin is here too.

192
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,720
Hope I'm not disturbing you?

193
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,440
If you know, why not leave?

194
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,440
(What's going on?)

195
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,750
(Could it be he favors
Lady Ruoyi's manner?)

196
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,870
Lady Ruoyi truly pleases the General.

197
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,870
She can even help relieve the weariness.

198
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,630
I'd like to learn.

199
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,080
Who brought this?

200
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,360
- It was from me...
- It's what I loathe most.

201
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,750
To the General.

202
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,720
Don't mind me, go on.

203
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,080
I'll just watch.

204
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,910
That's enough, you may leave.

205
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,440
G... General.

206
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,590
I said that's enough.

207
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,710
Leave.

208
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,790
Lady Ruoyi, leaving now?

209
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,390
I still wish to learn more from you.

210
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,960
Lady Ruoyi, you're still here?

211
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,200
Don't tug at me.

212
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,670
Aren't you afraid

213
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,270
others will call you jealous?

214
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,160
I fear nothing.

215
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,270
General, we are newlyweds.

216
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,750
I fell for you.

217
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,510
So others can understand

218
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,670
a touch of envy now and then.

219
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,960
General, let's go.

220
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,790
Let's return to our chamber.

221
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,440
I'll just sleep in the study.

222
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,080
You think I'm no good at massages?

223
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,790
Let me give you one.

224
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,750
Stop.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What are you up to?

226
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,080
Will you be free the day after tomorrow?

227
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,590
Two days from now?

228
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,550
The day you return to your mother's.

229
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,840
You want me to go with you?

230
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,280
Yes.

231
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,320
But didn't you say

232
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,280
you wouldn't need

233
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,360
my help in this family?

234
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,240
(The man's heart is far too petty.)

235
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,960
(You just want my help.)

236
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,960
Sometimes I speak without thinking.

237
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,670
General, please don't mind me.

238
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,000
The vow we made just yesterday

239
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,390
has already been cast aside today.

240
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,390
How am I supposed to trust you?

241
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,390
I offer my apology to you, General.

242
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,670
Stop playing pitiful.

243
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,000
You think I can't see through you?

244
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,870
Since you already know,

245
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,120
I won't force you.

246
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,840
Get some rest soon.

247
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,200
It's up to you.

248
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,260
(Steadfast Pursuit)

249
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,870
Madam, is the General truly not going?

250
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,040
It's fine.

251
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,080
I have my own way.

252
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,620
(Prefecture Governor's Manor)

253
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,320
I have prepared a gift for you.

254
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Do you like it?

255
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,300
