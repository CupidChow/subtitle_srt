=Episode 8=

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,120
Madam.

12
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,510
You haven't recovered yet.

13
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,760
You should lie down and rest.

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,350
It's all right.

15
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,790
Madam.

16
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,680
I heard that Nanny Sun
knelt until her legs gave out.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,710
The old Madam,
recalling her years of service,

18
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,680
gave her some money and sent her away.

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,790
But fate had it that
she met mountain bandits on the road.

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,350
She lost her life along the way.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,280
Every thought and intent has its cause.

22
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,000
What we face now is but the result.

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,070
Once, they held the knife,
and I was the prey.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,640
Now it's my turn to let them taste

25
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,070
the helplessness that once bound me.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,040
- General.
- General.

27
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,580
I have military duties to attend to.

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,860
Tomorrow, I'll be away for a few days.

29
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,170
I've had someone investigate
the Scorpion Venom.

30
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,870
Take good care of yourself.

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,680
Thanks, General.

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,240
General.

33
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,400
Let me help you rest.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
No need.

35
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,150
I don't want you to compromise yourself.

36
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,630
Such an relationship
doesn't interest me.

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
I help you

38
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,710
because I have my own reasons.

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,150
I feel no grievance.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,080
I have always been your wife.

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,630
Besides, I think you're right.

42
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,750
From now on,

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,750
I must live for myself.

44
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,680
What do you want me to do?

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,190
I want to be the lady of the house.

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Nuan'er.

47
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,200
Nuan'er!

48
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,430
Madam.

49
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,230
Where did this medicine come from?

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,080
The kitchen servants brewed it.

51
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,190
What's wrong, Madam?

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,120
It's just a bowl of herbal water,
with senna leaves added.

53
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,710
Madam, you haven't recovered yet.

54
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,910
How dare they do such a thing!

55
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,430
I'll confront them now.

56
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,240
Madam, We came to bring you
silver and charcoal.

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,400
Wait!

58
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,120
The official allowance for the wife
is twenty taels each month.

59
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,870
Why has Madam received only ten taels?

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,870
We were simply following

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,840
Concubine Qin's orders.

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,300
Then what about the charcoal?

63
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,520
According to the rules,

64
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,470
Madam

65
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,050
should receive the finest
Silver Bone Charcoal.

66
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,180
How could she be using Black Charcoal
like in the kitchen?

67
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,150
Besides, this isn't even a full jin.

68
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,630
It won't last through the day!

69
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,520
Madam, we only have Black Charcoal now.

70
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,590
And when the charcoal
was first burned this year,

71
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,950
there was naturally less to go around.

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,240
If you are unhappy,
bring it up with Concubine Qin.

73
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,590
We maids are only following orders.

74
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,960
Oh right, Madam.

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,360
If you know it's cold outside,
don't sit out there.

76
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,430
Stop right there!

77
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
Come back.

78
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,030
Madam.

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,120
Concubine Qin has gone too far.

80
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,190
They clearly

81
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,750
are trying to wear you down completely.

82
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,360
The more outrageous she acts,
the better.

83
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,390
A dog that bites doesn't bark first.

84
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,720
Madam, have you finished calculating?

85
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,070
It's merely ten taels of silver a month.

86
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,630
Even if we eat porridge
and pickled vegetables every day,

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,310
we'd still spend
more than ten taels each month.

88
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,510
Add in rouge and face powder,

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,870
and the daily use of incense
and candles,

90
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,270
how could ten taels a month
ever be enough?

91
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,990
Since Concubine Qin took over
the household,

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,310
her deductions have become
far too harsh.

93
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,950
You're still a concubine, after all.

94
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,390
How could you endure such humiliation?

95
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,630
That's just how it is.

96
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,660
I've heard Madam's situation
isn't any better either.

97
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,360
To survive in this inner chambers

98
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
is already no small feat.

99
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,800
But...

100
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,120
We can't be living on only mantou
and pickled vegetables forever.

101
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,270
The General isn't home.

102
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,920
Why don't you go and speak
with the Old Madam?

103
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,950
She refuses to even see me.

104
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,430
How could I possibly get a word in?

105
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,670
Xiaoru.

106
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,120
There are some fine rouge
and face powder in my dowry.

107
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,870
Take them and pawn them all.

108
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,230
Madam.

109
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,830
How did things come to this?

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,920
Using your own dowry?

111
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,680
Indeed, how did it come to this?

112
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,950
Madam, what brings you here?

113
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,320
Honestly,

114
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,520
I've been here for quite some time.

115
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Then you must've heard

116
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,270
every word I said, haven't you?

117
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,430
Don't worry. Sit down and talk.

118
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,480
I'd better not sit.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,070
You're good at arithmetic.

120
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,070
When I lived with my own family,

121
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,570
I often help my father
check the account books.

122
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,870
This is just a piece of cake.

123
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Then, could you do me a favor?

124
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,300
It would be helping yourself.

125
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,390
What do you want me to do?

126
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,870
Today isn't the usual day for distributing
the monthly stipends.

127
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,950
Why are you here so early to visit me?

128
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,800
I've just come up with a new idea.

129
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,240
To select a few capable servants
to act as stewards.

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,560
We'll hand over
the servants' wages to them,

131
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,770
and let them handle the distribution.

132
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,190
This way,

133
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,040
the efficiency will improve greatly,

134
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,480
and daily management
will become much easier.

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,560
I truly didn't

136
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,600
choose the wrong person for this task.

137
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,920
Old Madam, that compliment

138
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,390
seems a bit premature.

139
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,750
Shen,

140
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,720
what do you mean by that?

141
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,030
Madam.

142
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,820
I know you're dissatisfied
that the Old Madam has put me

143
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,990
in charge of managing the household.

144
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,030
But...

145
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,750
You shouldn't speak to Old Madam
like that.

146
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,150
Concubine Qin.

147
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,750
You should look through these

148
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,040
before trying to defend yourself.

149
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,390
What's going on with them?

150
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,110
Zhang Jun.

151
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,070
On the ninth of last month,

152
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
he brought a courtesan
from Hongxiu Pavilion home.

153
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,270
Didn't show up for work
until midday the next day.

154
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,510
Yesterday, drunk again,
he broke a potted iron tree.

155
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,030
Sun Bao'er.

156
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,750
On the thirteenth last month, after breaking
a glazed glass vase in the side yard,

157
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,990
she had someone glue it together
and tried to pass it off as intact.

158
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,680
Tang Xiaowan.

159
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,990
She withheld the allotted
Silver Bone Charcoal from each courtyard

160
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,630
and secretly sold it
at the northern market.

161
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,680
Madam, I swear I won't dare again.

162
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,390
In truth, a little attentiveness
would've uncovered this.

163
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,000
I had thought Concubine Qin

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,430
was planning to settle accounts later.

165
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,640
But to my surprise,

166
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,160
these people
not only escaped punishment,

167
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,390
they were even promoted.

168
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
Old Madam,

169
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,160
I had no idea about these things.

170
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,830
If I'd known they were doing wrong,

171
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,360
I definitely wouldn't have allowed it.

172
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,230
Is that so?

173
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,920
Then this false ledger
was the work of the servants too?

174
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,950
Bring it here and let me see.

175
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,260
(Ledger)

176
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,560
Ever since Concubine Qin
took charge of household finances,

177
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,670
she raised the monthly allowance
for the servants.

178
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
According to the ledger,

179
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,150
the total monthly allowance

180
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,840
for everyone in Li Manor
is one hundred and sixteen taels.

181
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,060
Even the pole carrier,
who gets the smallest monthly wage,

182
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,720
receives at least one tael each month.

183
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,240
But when I asked them,

184
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,030
they said they only received three qian.

185
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,230
Old Madam,

186
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,030
I really only received
three qian this month.

187
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,150
At first, I thought
I had done something wrong,

188
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,630
but Madam found out after asking around.

189
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,200
Someone had been withholding our wages!

190
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,080
Old Madam, please punish them

191
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,670
and help me get justice!

192
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,240
Old Madam, please see the truth.

193
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,550
Yes, I did steal from the manor before,

194
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,440
but I never once took anyone's wages!

195
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,030
Nor did I!

196
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,550
I distributed the wages according to

197
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,910
Concubine Qin's accounting.

198
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,720
Not a single coin short.

199
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,000
So if that's the case,

200
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,030
Li Manor should still have
over seventeen hundred taels.

201
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,320
There's less than seven hundred taels
left on the accounts now.

202
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,840
If it wasn't you all who did this,

203
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,600
then who took

204
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,200
the one thousand taels?

205
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,600
Who else could it be?

206
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,550
You promoted someone
who'd made mistakes to be in charge,

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,360
just so you could make them
do your bidding.

208
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,630
Don't you dare slander me!

209
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,340
The family rules of Li Manor state

210
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,450
that anyone using public funds
for personal gain

211
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,700
will be kicked out and sent to prison.

212
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,320
Old Madam,

213
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,750
please see the truth.

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,990
Old Madam, please see the truth.

215
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,750
You're welcome to search my room.

216
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,720
If I really took that thousand taels,

217
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,190
there would surely be evidence
in my room!

218
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,580
(Ledger)

219
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,440
You are wise as always.

220
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,200
Or Concubine Qin would've gotten us
into real trouble.

221
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,860
She grew arrogant and careless
after her small triumphs.

222
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,950
Her mistakes
were easy to uncover.

223
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,790
Still, it's thanks to
your great accounting skills.

224
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,270
Otherwise,

225
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,000
we wouldn't have resolved this matter
so easily.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,910
You're too kind.

227
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,720
Yet, the Old Madam chose
not to hand down any punishment.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,370
Is she trying to
just let this matter slide?

229
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,440
The missing thousand taels
still haven't been recovered.

230
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,720
There's truly no proof to confirm

231
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,200
that Concubine Qin kept them.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,030
I must come up with another plan.

233
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,200
Concubine Qin may look gentle and frail,

234
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,600
but she's so heartless.

235
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,840
Given her character,

236
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,720
I doubt she'll let this go so easily.

237
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,820
(Li Manor)

238
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,150
Madam, I think it's Concubine Qin.

239
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,440
Pretend to be me for now

240
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,030
and go lie on my bed.

241
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,720
Don't come out until I get back.

242
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,350
Madam.

243
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,840
Are you planning to follow them?

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,910
Isn't this...

245
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,550
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

246
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,390
Go now.

247
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,590
Madam.

248
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,580
(Yongle Bank)

249
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,900
(Yongle Bank)

250
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,120
Pretty one, don't run.

251
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,670
Just be good and give in to me.

252
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,600
There's a bed right over there.

253
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,360
You certainly know how to have fun.

254
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,360
Here I come.

255
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,030
The air is dry and the winds fierce.

256
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,030
Be cautious with the fire.

257
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,720
The air is dry and the winds fierce.

258
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,670
Be cautious with the fire.

259
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,600
You can't even handle a woman.

260
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,080
Useless fool.

261
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,680
Who could've known

262
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,320
that woman would be so fierce.

263
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,200
I got hit in the head.

264
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,320
You'll have to pay me more!

265
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,510
I can pay you more.

266
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,440
But you must help me with another act.
