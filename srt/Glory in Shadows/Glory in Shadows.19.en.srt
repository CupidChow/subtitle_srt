Escort Young Master Jingxu back to rest.

13
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

14
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,400
You two think you can

15
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,590
bring me down?

16
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,590
It is far too early for
such confidence, Old Madam.

17
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,310
Once we find the Fan Scorpion Poison

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,200
and prove you killed Qin Ruoyi,

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,710
no clever words will save you then.

20
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,630
What Fan Scorpion Poison?

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,680
I've never even heard of it.

22
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,190
And I didn't kill her.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,030
I have nothing to fear.

24
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,630
Even now, you're still hiding the truth.

25
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,710
Why would I need to hide anything?

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,240
Just the two of you?

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
Against me? Such arrogance.

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,030
Then what about me?

29
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,640
You...

30
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,870
You're awake?

31
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,590
Brother,

32
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,430
Father has awakened.

33
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,840
Is the case concluded?

34
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,400
You just woke up.

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,520
How do you know?

36
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,240
Wan'er told me everything.

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,630
Master, you've just woken up.

38
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,800
You haven't recovered...

39
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,640
That's fine.

40
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,870
I've been confined to this sickbed.

41
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,520
I've had quite enough of it.

42
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,310
However,

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,150
during all those years of my coma,

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,590
I was not entirely unaware.

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,560
Today, at the Court of Judicial Review,

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,150
you talked your way out of the charges.

47
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,030
Now you've returned to the Marquis Manor,

48
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,960
I, as the Marquis,

49
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,240
will conduct my own trial.

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Zhao Qingru,

51
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,990
kneel.

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,190
Kneel!

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,470
You wretch,

54
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,680
how dare you collude with others

55
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,280
to harm the descendants of the Li family!

56
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,190
While I lay in a coma,
you humiliated me again and again.

57
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,870
Every single of these matters,

58
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,630
others may not know,

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,800
but I know them all!

60
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,030
I was left unconscious for so long.

61
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,960
You were the one

62
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,750
who poisoned me, weren't you?

63
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,790
It was her!

64
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,120
Your precious daughter
found the poison for you!

65
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,150
I did not.

66
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,390
Mother, why do you falsely accuse me?

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,160
I've lived a sheltered life.

68
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,600
How could I know about poisons?

69
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,920
Besides, Father treats me so kindly.

70
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,000
He cherishes me deeply.

71
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,630
How could I ever harm him?

72
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,560
You deceitful girl!

73
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,480
I should have ended you!

74
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,600
Silence!

75
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,360
You wretch,

76
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,510
even now,

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
you're still trying to frame Wan'er!

78
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,830
Do you think that while I was in a coma,

79
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,510
I couldn't hear what you said

80
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,750
or know what you did?

81
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,800
Open your eyes and look clearly!

82
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,240
How dare you humiliate me like this!

83
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,870
If you truly could hear,

84
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,630
then you should know

85
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,270
why I did what I did!

86
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,750
We've been married for so many years,

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800
why do you still resent me so deeply?

88
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,630
Is it all because of Jingchuan and Yan?

89
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,430
So many years have passed,

90
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,480
yet you still can't let it go?

91
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,480
How easily those words escape your lips.

92
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,190
But they've haunted me
every sleepless night!

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,040
Back then, I defied my father's objections

94
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,680
and insisted on marrying you.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,160
I was a fool to believe you.

96
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,190
You promised me a lifetime of devotion.

97
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,870
But in the end,

98
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,160
I was the one left behind.

99
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,800
It was all because of that woman!

100
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,750
We hadn't even been married two years

101
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,720
when she came straight to
my door with that jerk!

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,160
Everyone in the capital knew.

103
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,430
She turned me into a laughingstock!

104
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,720
Don't you dare mention my mother.

105
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,520
Who would have known

106
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,600
that woman died the very next year,

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,430
leaving behind her son

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,480
who outshone my own at every turn.

109
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,360
How could I possibly accept that?

110
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,600
As the matriarch,

111
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,920
you were expected to be magnanimous

112
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,830
and treat concubines' children kindly.

113
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,950
This title of matriarch

114
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,430
has weighed on me my whole life!

115
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,920
Why must I be forgiving?

116
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,310
Why must I be magnanimous?

117
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,070
I refuse!

118
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,240
I want everyone who stand in my son's way

119
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,800
to die!

120
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,950
Zhao Qingru.

121
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,510
Zhao Qingru,

122
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,120
you are no longer fit to be the matriarch.

123
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,480
For your years presiding
over this household,

124
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,040
you will be told to have
succumbed to a sudden illness.

125
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,120
You'll spend the rest of your days

126
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,600
in the back courtyard.

127
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,470
No.

128
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,720
Master! Master!

129
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,800
I can give up the title of matriarch,

130
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
but Xu'er...

131
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,310
Xu'er is your legitimate son.

132
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,190
He must inherit your title.

133
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,310
It must go to Xu'er,

134
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,830
- not your eldest son!
- Let go!

135
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,480
I am not dead yet.

136
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,920
I still rule this household!

137
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,080
No.

138
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,510
Xu'er is your legitimate son.

139
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,480
He must inherit the title.

140
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,080
He must inherit the title.

141
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,550
I'll kill you.

142
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,390
I'll kill you.

143
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,670
- I'll kill you.
- Guards!

144
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,600
Take her away!

145
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,550
I'll kill you.

146
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,720
- Take her away!
- Let me go!

147
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,600
I'll kill you.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,550
My Xu'er is the rightful heir!

149
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,360
My Xu'er must inherit the title!

150
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,750
I'll kill you.

151
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,570
- My son is the heir!
- Announce her death!

152
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
Wan'er.

153
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,960
Father.

154
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,160
Come here.

155
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,750
Sit by my side.

156
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,320
My Wan'er has grown up.

157
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,390
You've become more lovely and graceful.

158
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,720
Thanks for your concern, Father.

159
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,000
During all the years I was in a coma,

160
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,630
you rarely came to see me.

161
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,960
I feared angering Mother,

162
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,480
so I dared not visit you.

163
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,270
That no longer matters.

164
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,390
That wretch is gone for good.

165
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,960
From now on, you can
stay by my side every day.

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,840
My Lady,

167
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,750
you've rubbed it red.

168
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,590
Leave.

169
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,800
- My lady...
- Go!

170
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,440
Why is it me?

171
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
