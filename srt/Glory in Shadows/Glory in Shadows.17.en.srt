11
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,070
Physician Feng,

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,950
is my daughter-in-law pregnant?

13
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,430
Old Madam,

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,920
Her Ladyship...

15
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,200
Her Ladyship must be mistaken.

16
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,120
She is not with child.

17
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,680
Are you certain?

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,200
I have examined her pulse carefully.

19
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,430
She is indeed not with child.

20
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,630
Thanks.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,840
Maid,

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,640
escort Physician Feng out.

23
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,190
This way.

24
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,760
How dare you, Shen!

25
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,200
You deceived me
by claiming you were pregnant!

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,320
Kneel!

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,400
I...

28
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,150
I just made a mistake.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,280
Was it a mistake,

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,070
or did you deceive me on purpose?

31
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,270
I...

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,520
Nanzhi.

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,680
These are the undergarments
you changed the other day.

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,750
There is menstrual blood on them.

35
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,630
You had your menses long ago,

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,280
yet you dared claim you were pregnant.

37
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,710
What crime should you answer for?

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,360
Old Madam.

39
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,830
I...

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Shen Yaochu,

41
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,280
you are full of lies
and hold human life in contempt.

42
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,840
Now you even
fake a pregnancy to deceive me!

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,520
Once I find the bodies of
Concubine Tang and Concubine Qin,

44
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,870
I will see you brought before the court.

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
No, General!

46
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,470
General.

47
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,870
Shen,

48
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,280
there is no one left to shield you now.

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,240
You have long shown me disrespect,

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,800
and I let it pass.

51
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,400
But you refuse to repent!

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,710
Today, you will kneel in the courtyard
and reflect on your sins.

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,120
Without my permission,
you are not to rise.

54
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,140
(Stability Ensures Peace)

55
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,470
Old Madam,

56
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,870
it's time to bathe the Marquis.

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,310
Tending to this living corpse
day in and day out

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,070
is truly tiresome!

59
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,630
But punishing Shen today

60
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,480
was truly satisfying.

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,060
I thought

62
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,510
she and Li Jingchuan were deeply in love.

63
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,510
Yet at the first setback,

64
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,360
they fell apart.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,120
How ridiculous.

66
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,580
(Stability Ensures Peace)

67
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,680
Judging by the dates,

68
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,720
my Jingxu should be back.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,840
Sister-in-law.

70
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,020
(Li Jingxu
Legitimate Son of Li Family)

71
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,880
Sister-in-law.

72
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,680
Are you the Second Young Master?

73
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,920
Please call me Jingxu.

74
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,160
I've been traveling for three years,

75
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,160
so you won't recognize me.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,840
But

77
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,950
why are you kneeling in the snow?

78
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,830
It's freezing. You will fall ill.

79
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,960
Please get up.

80
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,400
I made a mistake.

81
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
Old Madam punished me to kneel.

82
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,630
No matter the mistake,

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,270
you shouldn't suffer this way.

84
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,830
What if you fall ill?

85
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,920
(Why did Li Jingxu suddenly show up?)

86
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,430
Isn't Brother at home?

87
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,190
How can he let you kneel in the snow?

88
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,070
General is...

89
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,310
He is angry with me.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,070
Brother has served in the army

91
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,560
and doesn't cherish women.

92
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,600
Sister-in-law, please rise.

93
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,640
Sister-in-law,

94
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,240
Brother doesn't know, but I do.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,870
From now on, at home,

96
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,920
I'll protect you, all right?

97
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,640
Mother!

98
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,720
Jingxu is back!

99
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,030
He's back?

100
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,270
Why... why didn't he come see me?

101
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,560
I was so happy

102
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,190
that I rushed over to tell you.

103
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,760
Hurry.

104
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,070
Take me to see Jingxu.

105
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
What are you doing?

106
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,930
Mother,

107
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,190
I thought it was too cold

108
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,750
and wished Sister-in-law to go rest.

109
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,150
- JingXu!
- Mother,

110
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,830
she has a fragile constitution.

111
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,430
She cannot keep kneeling in the snow!

112
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,800
Consider this my plea on her behalf.

113
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,510
Since Jingxu pleads on your behalf,

114
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,430
I'll set aside the punishment.

115
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
Get back to your room.

116
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,630
Without my orders,

117
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,240
do not take a single step outside.

118
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,160
Thanks, Old Madam.

119
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,000
Thanks, Brother-in-law.

120
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,280
Li Jingxu!

121
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,910
Have you been bewitched

122
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,000
by that seductress?

123
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,480
She is Li Jingchuan's Principal Wife

124
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,910
and your sister-in-law!

125
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,390
So what?

126
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,870
You are to inherit your father's title.

127
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,480
If word spreads,

128
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,790
how will you hold your head up at court?

129
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,870
Mother, don't worry.

130
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,910
I have no interest
in another man's castoffs.

131
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,910
Shen Yaochu

132
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,150
is just a pawn I use

133
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,670
against Li Jingchuan.

134
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,240
But Li Jingchuan is truly lucky.

135
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,510
He survived that assassination.

136
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,870
Fortunately,

137
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,320
there is no evidence now.

138
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,320
By the way, Mother,

139
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,670
did that messenger Li Qiang die?

140
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,240
I have sent someone to silence him.

141
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,110
Good.

142
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,480
After that assassination,

143
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,000
he will surely be on guard.

144
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
But he may not

145
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,080
guard against this woman.

146
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,270
Once I have this
foolish woman under control,

147
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,390
I'll have her deal with Li Jingchuan.

148
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,550
Wouldn't we reap the rewards
without lifting a finger?

149
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,550
Li Jingchuan will divorce Shen soon.

150
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,670
She will be a useless pawn.

151
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,680
That's fine.

152
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,870
Don't worry, Mother.

153
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,150
I will never let Jingchuan
inherit the title.

154
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,870
Once that old man dies,

155
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,030
the marquisate,

156
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,790
and everything Li Jingchuan has,

157
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,840
will all be mine.

158
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,990
Do your knees hurt?

159
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,320
I'm fine.

160
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,910
I padded them secretly.

161
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,480
They'll be fine soon.

162
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,120
If we didn't put on a full act,

163
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,080
how would Old Madam believe that

164
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,720
you and I had truly fallen out?

165
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,320
Does this full act

166
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,480
include your tugging
and pulling with Li Jingxu?

167
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,800
Why are you smiling?

168
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,080
Do you mind?

169
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,630
Yes,

170
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,680
I do.

171
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,320
I forbid you from
having contact with other men.

172
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,790
That was never my intention.

173
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,360
Your brother is licentious, vile,

174
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,280
and hypocritical.

175
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,630
So I thought

176
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,830
using him

177
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,670
to gain Old Madam's trust

178
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,790
might serve our purpose.

179
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,750
Yaochu,

180
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,260
if that's the case,

181
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,390
the plan ends immediately.

182
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,560
General,

183
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,320
this concerns your assassination

184
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
and my mother's murder.

185
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,000
But it also concerns my wife.

186
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,630
If this plan

187
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,360
requires my wife to suffer humiliation,

188
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,920
I will not allow it.

189
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,920
What did you say?

190
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,750
