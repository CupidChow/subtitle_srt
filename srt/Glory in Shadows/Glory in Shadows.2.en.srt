(Li Manor)

13
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,790
Madam,

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,960
here's the Li Manor.

15
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,240
I cannot go inside.

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,920
If I enter, I will die for sure.

17
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,870
General Li would never let you die.

18
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,710
Please, go inside.

19
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,220
(Late Guardian General Li Jingchuan)

20
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,960
Halt!

21
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,710
Are you Lady Yaochu?

22
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,120
Yes.

23
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm the Prefecture
Governor's eldest daughter,

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,150
Shen Yaochu.

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,120
How dare you!

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,680
Now that you're in the Li Manor,

27
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,310
you only address yourself as Madam Li.

28
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,080
And who might you be?

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,400
I have long served at Old Madam's side.

30
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,280
You may call me Nanny Sun.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,120
So you're a servant.

32
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,840
I'm marrying the General today,

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,360
yet the Li family sends
only a servant to greet me.

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,310
Old Madam is unwell,

35
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,240
so she asked me to welcome you.

36
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,240
Since you're now part of the Li family,

37
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,630
you must abide by our household rules.

38
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,560
You came from outside the manor,

39
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,960
bringing dirt.

40
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,960
Please remove your shoes and socks

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,400
and walk barefoot
across this fire basin.

42
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,120
Only then can the filth be
cleansed from your body.

43
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,400
Take off my shoes and walk

44
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,080
barefoot over fire?

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
Madam, please.

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,910
General Li sacrificed for the empire.

47
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,430
Not even his remains could return home.

48
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,630
Yet in the whole Li family,

49
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,310
no one came for his memorial tablet.

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,560
You even pick on his rightful wife.

51
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,750
How is this justified?

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,800
Insolence!

53
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,800
This is the custom of the family.

54
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,360
Then I will be insolent.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,910
How can you become the lady of the Li family?

56
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,280
Yes.

57
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,590
I am blunt and unruly.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Your Li family

59
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,880
(Late Guardian General Li Jingchuan)
might as well wed another!

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,840
Guards!

61
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,560
Help the new bride brush away the dust

62
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,430
and purify her spirit with flags!

63
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,600
Remove her garments!

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,870
What's all this noise?

65
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,980
(Zhao Qingru
Old Madam of Li Family)

66
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
Old Madam.

67
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,000
The new bride shows no respect.

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,430
Her conduct is reckless.

69
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm cleansing her as part of the ritual.

70
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,950
You want me buried alive
with a dead man?

71
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,040
Keep dreaming!

72
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,040
To be buried as the rightful
wife is already

73
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
a blessing for you.

74
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,480
The new bride, Lady Yaochu,

75
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,600
was overcome with grief.

76
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,240
She struck the coffin and died,

77
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,600
and was laid to rest
beside my son, Jingchuan,

78
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,390
in the same burial.

79
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,950
I cannot die...

80
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
Old Madam?

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,630
Beat her to death on the spot!

82
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,910
(Mother...)

83
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,200
(Forgive me.)

84
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,430
(I did my best.)

85
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,920
Welcome the Guardian General
home in triumph.

86
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,500
(Xu Shan
Deputy General)

87
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,260
(Li Jingchuan
Eldest Son of Li Family)

88
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
(So he is...)

89
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,310
(Li Jingchuan.)

90
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,120
You're alive?

91
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,600
I barely made it.

92
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,480
Old Madam must be disappointed.

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,120
What nonsense?

94
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,520
Seeing you alive,

95
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,070
nothing makes me happier.

96
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,150
Is that so?

97
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,190
General, you may hold a great rank,

98
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,190
but before Old Madam,
you're still junior.

99
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,630
Why do you not dismount
to greet Old Madam?

100
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,230
Insolent servant!

101
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,480
You disrespect the General?

102
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,000
Old Madam,

103
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,360
are you saying I must kneel?

104
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,120
Between mother and son,
such formality isn't needed.

105
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,480
Yet since ancient times,

106
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,240
it has always been ruler before kin.

107
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,560
By our dynasty's rites,

108
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,680
should it not be you, Old Madam,

109
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,120
who salutes me first?

110
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,510
Just joking.

111
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,190
Why did you take it seriously?

112
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,950
I heard Lady Yanchu thought
I had perished,

113
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,040
was grief-stricken, and wished
to be buried with me.

114
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,510
Lady Youchu's unwavering devotion

115
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,630
is truly touching.

116
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,750
I told you,

117
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,960
General Li would never let you die.

118
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,150
Thank you, Old Madam, for my marriage.

119
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,510
But keeping a coffin
in the courtyard is ill-omened.

120
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,550
Let's skip the ceremony.

121
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,640
(Tang Yuzhu Second Concubine)
Stop crying, it's so upsetting!

122
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,440
Yuzhu,

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,150
(Qin Ruoyi Third Concubine)
we have waited two years for the General.

124
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,840
But who would have thought

125
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,320
that the General would pass away?

126
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,840
Does that mean we must spend our lives

127
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,600
being widows here in this manor?

128
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,960
If he's gone, we should just leave.

129
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
The world is vast.

130
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,480
Surely it can hold two women.

131
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
But we are already wed.

132
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,750
Whether we stay or go

133
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,870
is not for us to decide.

134
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
The General isn't dead.

135
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,080
What? What are you saying?

136
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,960
Am I not allowed to hear this?

137
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,390
Yuzhu,

138
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,440
the General is alive.

139
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,630
He has returned.

140
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,670
He's still alive?

141
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,270
The General is still alive.

142
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,630
If he's not dead,
why are you still in tears?

143
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,630
These are tears of joy.

144
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,840
Yet in my heart,

145
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,870
there's still a trace of resentment.

146
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,630
Why so?

147
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,030
Yuzhu, think about it.

148
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,150
Today, Old Madam

149
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,510
found the General a proper wife.

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,510
Thought she was to be buried with him.

151
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,600
But the General returned at such a time.

152
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,560
So tonight

153
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,720
would become the couple's

154
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,360
wedding night?

155
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,510
What else?

156
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,670
We've waited two years for the General.

157
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,270
Even the wedding night

158
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,790
should follow the order.

159
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,840
But Lady Yanchu is the rightful wife.

160
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,870
It's only fair she has
precedence over us.

161
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,000
You're right, Yuzhu.

162
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,870
The ceremony is over.

163
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,040
Shall I leave now?

164
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,320
It's not over yet.

165
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
Tomorrow morning,

166
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,480
you must pay respects to Old Madam.

167
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,630
General,

168
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,030
tonight is our wedding night.

169
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,750
If you choose to leave,

170
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,270
how will I explain to Old Madam?

171
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,960
What do you propose?

172
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Let's make a deal.

173
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,800
Tell me what it is.

174
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,790
His Majesty values

175
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,000
harmony within families above all.

176
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,120
Filial piety first.

177
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,670
That's why Old Madam

178
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,270
endured so many misunderstandings

179
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,270
just to find you a proper wife,

180
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,550
to silence the gossip.

181
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,510
But today, I noticed that

182
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,000
the rift between you
and your mother ran deep.

183
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,080
I heard that when you were away,

184
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,120
she married you two concubines.

185
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,630
Not much peace inside

186
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,240
this household, yes?

187
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,720
With the household in disarray,

188
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,320
if word reaches His Majesty,

189
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,960
it surely won't bode well.

190
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,440
Yuzhu,

191
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,000
just now, Xiaocui told me,

192
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,320
Lady Yaochu stood
in the Memorial Hall today,

193
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,720
and openly defied Old Madam.

194
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,000
If she lies beside the General tonight,

195
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,080
spinning tales about us,

196
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
then uses her sly charms to win

197
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,000
over the General's heart,

198
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,320
you and I

199
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,960
will be stuck with
such a foolish mistress,

200
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,720
and our days ahead will be hard.

201
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,440
What should we do now?

202
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,320
Yuzhu, wait a moment.

203
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,000
Something urgent just came up.

204
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,160
You… Go and rest.

205
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,480
Have some snacks.

206
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,320
I have something urgent to see to.

207
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,440
Fool.

208
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,390
I'll soothe the household for you.

209
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,720
You protect the one at Guanyin Nunnery.

210
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,110
Will that do?

211
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,200
Who exactly in the Guanyin Nunnery

212
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,240
that you care so deeply about?

213
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,230
She's my mother.

214
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,840
Alright then.

215
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,480
I'll think this over.

216
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,750
But don't stir any trouble again.

217
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,080
If you bear a child one day,

218
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
I could even arrange for your mother

219
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,910
to stay with you daily.

220
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,990
General.

221
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,510
When it comes to having heirs,

222
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,630
my efforts alone won't change much.

223
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,000
General, you must also give.

224
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,560
For a woman,

225
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,320
your courage is remarkable.

226
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,870
And why is that a problem?

227
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,750
(If offering myself could
make him protect my mother,)

228
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,200
(then why not?)
