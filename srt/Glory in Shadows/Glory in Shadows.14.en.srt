10

=Episode 14=

11
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,230
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,510
I should be asking you the same.

13
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,480
Back then,

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,840
you accused me of secretly meeting a lover.

15
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,350
But in truth,

16
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,590
the one meeting a lover is someone else.

17
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,870
You're the only witness here.

18
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,040
Even if you tell the General and Old Madam,

19
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,400
I will deny everything.

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,400
Besides,

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,590
I'm carrying the General's child.

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,350
They wouldn't harm me.

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,230
Is the General truly

24
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,840
the father of your child?

25
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,190
Nonsense!

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,350
Of course he is.

27
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,550
Qin Ruoyi,

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,200
there's still plenty of
herbal dregs under that tree.

29
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,070
And those herbs

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,560
won't last long, will they?

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,120
If I find a few physicians
to take your pulse,

32
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,870
who do you think you can fool?

33
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,950
Are you Lady Shen, Li's wife?

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,480
I won't let you bully Ruoyi!

35
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,790
Your lover is quite devoted.

36
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,710
Your Ladyship,

37
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,750
I was wrong.

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,240
I shouldn't have opposed you.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,870
Please spare me.

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,590
From now on, I'll follow
your lead in everything.

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,870
That won't be necessary.

42
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,910
I came alone today

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,310
to give you a chance.

44
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,400
Though we have grievances,

45
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,910
they are not irreconcilable.

46
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,520
I have no wish to take your life.

47
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,630
All you need to do is tell the General

48
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,910
to divorce you.

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,680
Then, the Lis and Qins can maintain peace.

50
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,360
I'll spare you and your lover.

51
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,360
You want the General to divorce me?

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,920
What?

53
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,080
Can't bear to lose the wealth and honor?

54
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,560
Or would you rather wait
until it's discovered

55
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,960
your child isn't a Li,

56
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,800
and be punished by drowning in a cage?

57
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,710
Yiyi,

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,240
agree to her.

59
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,360
Then we can live together as a family.

60
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,470
Yiyi!

61
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,270
Alright.

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,200
I agree.

63
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,000
I will leave

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,840
and never stand in your way.

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
That's all I have to say.

66
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,190
Take care of yourselves.

67
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,900
(Li Manor)

68
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,150
Your Ladyship.

69
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,800
Concubine Qin is waiting for me.

70
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,990
Is everything arranged?

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,360
I thought it over all night yesterday.

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,560
I came today especially to thank you.

73
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,120
There's no need.

74
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,120
Though,

75
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,030
you may lose the power,

76
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,000
but as a woman,

77
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,310
being able to flee
far with the one you love

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,390
may be a blessing.

79
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,830
You're right, Your Ladyship.

80
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,270
But

81
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,920
who said

82
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm giving up?

83
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,000
Ma'am!

84
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,440
Ma'am!

85
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,030
Ma'am!

86
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,000
Your Ladyship.

87
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,440
Your Ladyship!

88
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,390
Why did you push me,

89
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,330
Your Ladyship?

90
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,000
Are you alright, Your Ladyship?

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,240
No! Concubine Qin is bleeding!

92
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,390
Hurry! Do something!

93
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,510
Your Ladyship, what should we do?

94
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,600
Help! Now!

95
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,830
Is the medical potion ready?

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,510
Coming!

97
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,510
Give it to me. You can go.

98
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,430
Go fetch the General.

99
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,710
Yes.

100
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Here's the medical potion!

101
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,830
- Ma'am!
- It hurts!

102
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,000
- It hurts!
- Ma'am!

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What's wrong, ma'am?

104
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,910
Ma'am!

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,840
Ma'am!

106
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,560
Shen,

107
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,950
how dare you harm a child

108
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,600
of Li family in plain view of all?

109
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,750
What crime should that be?

110
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,350
As you said,

111
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,720
in plain view of all,

112
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,510
I wouldn't be foolish enough

113
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,240
to harm her child.

114
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,270
Even if Concubine Qin gave birth first,

115
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,750
her kid is a low-born scion.

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,830
As the Principal Wife,

117
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,310
you should treat the kid kindly.

118
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,800
Yet you're envious and cruel, unable to

119
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,480
tolerate even a concubine's child.

120
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,000
Since he's a concubine's child,

121
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,680
what need have I to wipe him out?

122
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,080
Blood!

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,430
Concubine Qin has miscarried.

124
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,120
The child may not survive!

125
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,510
Shen schemed to harm the Li child,

126
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,750
disregarded human life,

127
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,070
and lacks moral virtue.

128
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,040
Lock her up at...

129
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,350
No,

130
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,070
beat her to death here and now!

131
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,440
Stop.

132
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,830
I am the General's Principal Wife.

133
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,160
You cannot decide my fate on a whim.

134
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,830
I am the matriarch of the Li family!

135
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,600
You killed a child of the Lis,

136
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,270
so I have every right to punish you.

137
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,560
Guards!

138
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,080
I am pregnant.

139
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,470
What did you say?

140
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,560
I said,

141
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,750
I am pregnant.

142
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,590
Old Madam,

143
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,920
do you intend to harm the Li child?

144
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,630
You'd fabricate such a lie

145
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,190
just to escape punishment.

146
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,920
Whether it's a lie doesn't matter.

147
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,630
What matters is, if you punish me today,

148
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,110
you'll bear the crime

149
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,950
of harming a Li child.

150
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,070
Do you think I'll take your word for it?

151
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,510
Fetch a physician.

152
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,710
Wait.

153
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,600
I will not trust

154
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,000
a physician of unknown origin.

155
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,160
To protect a Li child,

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
I request an imperial physician.

157
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,000
The Imperial Medical Institute
is on leave today.

158
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,630
Where could I find one?

159
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,920
Do you think you're the Empress?

160
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,000
Then we'll wait until tomorrow.

161
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,480
If I am lying,

162
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,190
punish me then.

163
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,720
Consider it one more day of my life.

164
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,520
Very well.

165
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,040
When the imperial physician
checks tomorrow,

166
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,070
the truth will be revealed.

167
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,560
But today, you did harm Concubine Qin.

168
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,430
Lock her in the woodshed,

169
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,830
so she can't run away.

170
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,150
Yes!

171
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm not feeling well.

172
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,190
Try touching me if you dare.

173
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,920
Are you feeling better now, ma'am?

174
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,310
What about Shen Yaochu?

175
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,270
Has Old Madam punished her?

176
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,950
Old Madam was furious and said

177
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,430
she'd punish Her Ladyship at once,

178
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,040
but Her Ladyship claimed

179
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,270
she carries the General's child.

180
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,110
What?

181
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,360
How is that possible?

182
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,600
There was no sign at all.

183
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,440
Old Madam doesn't believe it either.

184
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,960
They'll invite an
imperial physician tomorrow.

185
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,630
She's been locked in the woodshed.

186
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,840
No matter what,

187
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,360
she did cause my child's death.

188
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,550
Even the General cannot shield her now.

189
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,160
General?

190
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,920
You weren't hurt, right?

191
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,560
That's good.

192
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,390
What happened last night?

193
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,240
Last night, Concubine Qin and I...

194
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,440
- After I caught her meeting her lover,
- Ma'am!

195
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,630
I spared her out of mercy,

196
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
but she set me up.

197
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,750
Never mind that.

198
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,110
I'll take you back.

199
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,320
Wait a moment.

200
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,790
Follow my lead this time.

201
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,200
Tomorrow, I need you to deliver a letter.

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,320
That's all I need.

203
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,840
It's getting late, General.

204
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,990
You should rest.

205
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,960
No rush.

206
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,870
Nothing urgent tonight anyway.

207
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,110
By the way,

208
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,750
I heard you told Old Madam that

209
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,240
you're carrying my child?

210
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,390
It was a way to protect myself.

211
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,270
If she truly summons
an imperial physician tomorrow,

212
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,840
how will you handle it?

213
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,600
Then I'll need you to stall her for a bit.

214
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,000
Stalling is only a temporary measure.

215
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,550
What if you truly conceive my child?

216
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,320
You…

217
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,390
Do you have to say this right now?

218
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,840
Then when?

219
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,750
I'm done talking to you.

220
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,040
Fine.

221
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,750
Whenever you say,

222
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,870
so it shall be.

223
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,680
I don't mind waiting.

224
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,320
You rode hard back home today,

225
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,510
so you must be exhausted.

226
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,240
Go back and rest early.

227
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,910
It's damp and chilling out there.

228
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,440
I'd rather return in the morning.

229
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,350
Tonight,

230
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,270
I'll stay here with you.

231
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,840
You don't have to do this.

232
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,480
Take a nap?

233
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,440
Be good.
