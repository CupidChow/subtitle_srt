(Qifang Pavilion)

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,040
Jingchuan.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,430
Jingchuan, don't go in.

14
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,710
Jingchuan.

15
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,270
I'm begging you.

16
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,120
Just let me keep a shred of dignity.

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,760
Li Xingwan,

18
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,310
have you lost your mind?

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,880
Jingchuan,

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,710
he forced me into this.

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,950
Li Hongshan forced me.

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,480
Let go of me.

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,800
Jingchuan... Jingchuan.

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
Jingchuan.

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,360
I'm begging you.

26
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,280
Can we leave here first?

27
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,150
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

28
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
You had joined the army then.

29
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,680
I was helpless in the manor.

30
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,840
When he forced me,
I even thought of ending my life.

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,840
But I couldn't accept it.

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,680
Why did it have to be me?

33
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,360
He's the one who deserves death.

34
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,990
Jingchuan,

35
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,190
I've been waiting for you

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,240
to come back to save me.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Well, I'm back now.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,770
Why did you hide this from me?

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,290
How could I even bring myself to say it?

40
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,310
That man...

41
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,630
That man is our father.

42
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,780
Tomorrow, I'll send you out of here.

43
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,470
To a place where no one knows you.

44
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,550
No.

45
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,120
I'm not leaving.

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,180
I don't want to leave you.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,430
I'll have someone take care of you.

48
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,430
You won't suffer his humiliation again.

49
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,120
As long as I can stay by your side,

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,360
no insult or pain

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,710
matters to me.

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,630
I once thought about killing him

53
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,840
and then myself.

54
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,800
But I couldn't bear to leave you.

55
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,800
I want to spend my whole life with you.

56
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,710
Xingwan, you...

57
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,550
Xingwan.

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
We are siblings.

59
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,800
No, we're not.

60
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,800
There's no blood tie between us.

61
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,030
We're not siblings.

62
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,350
Think back to when we were little.

63
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,280
The maids and servants here
used to bully us.

64
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,840
It was only you and me.

65
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,750
We depended on each other to survive.

66
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,750
Come here.

67
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,600
Only we could truly rely on one another,

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,440
Jingchuan.

69
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,070
In my heart,
you've always been my little sister.

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,430
Is this about Shen Yaochu?

71
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,160
If she weren't here,

72
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,070
would you stop seeing me
as just a sister?

73
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,910
So...

74
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,480
So you killed Mrs. Shen,

75
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,040
Shopkeeper Liu, and Qin Ruoyi

76
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,020
because you wanted to deal
with Shen Yaochu?

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,950
They stood in my way.

78
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,800
They deserved to die.

79
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,600
That day at the nunnery,

80
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,470
I claimed I was going
to gather morning dew.

81
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,360
I had Shen Yaochu's mother killed.

82
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,710
Initially, I planned to hide nearby

83
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,070
to watch Shen Yaochu grieve
over losing his mother.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,470
Unexpectedly,
Shen Yunxi stumbled upon me.

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,260
So, I turned it to my advantage

86
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,000
and used your hand

87
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,160
to kill Shen Yunxi.

88
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,680
Jingchuan, help me!

89
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,520
Jingchuan!

90
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,430
Shopkeeper Liu's death
was from my poison.

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,950
I secretly swapped the banknotes.

92
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,000
Yaochu,

93
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,000
this banknote receipt is fake.

94
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,400
After that,

95
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,870
I went to find Qin Ruoyi.

96
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,290
What are you doing here?

97
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,000
I told her to use the child

98
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,920
to frame Shen Yaochu.

99
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,830
Are you here to ridicule me, too?

100
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,870
Then I urged Tang Yuzhu

101
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,420
Of course.

102
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,300
- to mock Qin Ruoyi.
- The tables have turned.

103
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,430
I used the chance to silence Qin Ruoyi

104
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,920
and pin it all on Tang Yuzhu.

105
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,120
When did you become so ruthless?

106
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,830
Look at this manor.

107
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,050
It's filled with splendor and silk,

108
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,260
dripping in wealth and honor.

109
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,190
Yet it feels like a devouring abyss.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,120
I am trapped deep within.

111
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,510
Without some cunning,

112
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,600
how could I have survived until now?

113
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
But such schemes

114
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,800
shouldn't be used against the blameless.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,840
Blameless?

116
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,270
Who among them is blameless?

117
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,750
Shopkeeper Liu colluded with Qin Ruoyi.

118
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,680
Blinded by greed.

119
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,880
Does he not deserve his fate?

120
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,680
Qin Ruoyi, with her secret pregnancy,
stirred up trouble.

121
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,630
Shouldn't she die?

122
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,040
Yes.

123
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,950
Shen Yaochu's mother was blameless.

124
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,160
If anyone's to blame, it's Shen Yaochu.

125
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,530
She's the one who deserves such a fate.

126
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,680
Why didn't she die with her mother?

127
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,110
Li Xingwan,

128
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,920
after all these years,

129
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,600
today's the first time I truly see you.

130
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,440
No.

131
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
That's not true.

132
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,560
You don't know how deeply I love you.

133
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
No one in this world
loves you more than I do.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,120
Shen Yaochu has been using you.

135
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,480
She's not worthy of being by your side.

136
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,830
Only we are truly meant for each other.

137
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,950
Is it because you think I'm tainted?

138
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,110
It's all right.

139
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,560
I'll cleanse myself completely.

140
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,750
I'll even shed a layer of skin
if I have to.

141
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,340
What about the blood on your hands?

142
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,070
Can you wash the blood off completely?

143
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,950
They got what they deserved.

144
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,720
They should never have lived.

145
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,560
Shen Yaochu should be gone too.

146
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,590
Enough.

147
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,600
Let me tell you something.

148
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
Whether Shen Yaochu exists or not,

149
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,360
I only see you as a sister.

150
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,630
There's no affection beyond that.

151
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,400
No. That's not true.

152
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,120
No, I don't believe you.

153
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
No one in this world
loves you more than I do.

154
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,870
I even became a killer for this love.

155
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,310
Can Shen Yaochu do the same?

156
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,590
Xingwan,

157
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,430
love doesn't turn people into killers.

158
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,870
Jealousy does.

159
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,790
Come with me.

160
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,870
From today, you're not allowed
to leave the house.

161
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,200
Jingchuan.

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,840
Get up.

163
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,280
Can you still walk?

164
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,200
Jingchuan.

165
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,510
Xingwan,

166
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,350
you...

167
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,780
Jingchuan,

168
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,440
from now on, you belong to me.

169
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,030
Jingchuan, you're awake.

170
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,040
Xingwan,

171
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,930
what are you planning to do?

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,840
Jingchuan,

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,910
right now,

174
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,150
no one will fight me for you anymore.

175
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Don't touch me.

176
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,230
Jingchuan,

177
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,670
do you still remember?

178
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,550
When we were little,

179
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,360
I used to fall asleep
on your chest like this.

180
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,320
I wish we could go back to those days.

181
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,920
There's no turning back now.

182
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,750
You've made a grave mistake.

183
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,550
Don't make another one.

184
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,550
Mistake?

185
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,960
Where did I go wrong?

186
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,150
Right.

187
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,270
My only mistake

188
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,720
was not killing Shen Yaochu sooner.

189
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,000
Don't you dare!

190
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,990
Jingchuan,

191
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,870
one day, you'll understand:

192
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,600
The one who loves you most is me;

193
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,870
the one meant to stay by you for life
is also me.

194
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,480
I won't spare anyone

195
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,240
who stands in my way.

196
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,440
If you dare lay a hand on Shen Yaochu,

197
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,150
I'll never let you go unpunished.

198
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,910
What's so special about her?

199
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,960
I'm the one who grew up with you;

200
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm the one who truly cares for you.

201
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,750
How can you hurt me for her?

202
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,160
I'm sorry, Jingchuan.

203
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,840
Did I hurt you?

204
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,630
Jingchuan.

205
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,240
I'll give you a gentle kiss.

206
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,030
Please don't be angry with me, okay?

207
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,200
You make me sick.

208
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,510
I make you sick?

209
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,870
How could you say that?

210
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,150
Was what happened back then my fault?

211
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,360
Could I have resisted at all?

212
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,840
Do you know where we are?

213
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,080
This is the basement of Li Manor.

214
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,740
You've never been here before, right?

215
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,390
Before Li Hongshan
brought me here five years ago,

216
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,230
I didn't know this place existed either.

217
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,790
Just do as I say.

218
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,790
I don't want
to keep you locked in here.

219
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,320
Only when you follow my wishes

220
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,720
will I let you leave.

221
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,790
Jingchuan, don't worry.

222
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,630
I won't harm you.

223
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,670
But I will never let Shen Yaochu live.

224
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,200
Don't you dare.

225
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,200
Well? Did you find him?

226
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,080
My Lady,

227
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,460
the General isn't in the barracks.

228
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,190
I haven't heard from him
for a whole day.

229
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,080
Seal the news and keep searching.

230
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,390
Yes.

231
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,750
Keep yourself safe too.

232
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,800
Alright.

233
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,360
(Even Xu Shan can't find him.)

234
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,960
(Could Jingchuan really be in trouble?)

235
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,270
Nuan'er,

236
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,630
the manor is no longer safe.

237
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,720
Take these travel funds.

238
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,000
Help me deliver a letter.

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,140
The address is written here.

240
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,510
No, My Lady.

241
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,150
I'm staying here with you.

242
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,840
Do as I say.

243
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,140
This matter is just as pressing.

244
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,110
Be extra careful.

245
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,710
Go now.

246
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,390
(You foolish girl.)

247
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,710
(If you stay here,)

248
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,120
(you'll only distract me.)

249
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,510
(If you leave safely,)

250
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,630
(that will ease my worries.)

251
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,280
My Lady, the young lady is bathing.

252
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,120
Step aside.

253
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,790
Yaochu, why did you come so suddenly?

254
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,230
Where's Li Jingchuan?

255
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,440
Jingchuan?

256
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,550
I don't know.

257
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,960
Yaochu, what are you doing?

258
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,800
Li Xingwan,

259
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,650
I have no time for your pretenses.

260
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,450
Do you think I'm unaware
of what you've been up to?

261
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,120
What do you know?

262
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,080
The deaths of Shopkeeper Liu

263
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,390
and Qin Ruoyi,

264
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,270
or the fact that I killed your mother?

265
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,680
Li Xingwan,

266
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,750
I've never had a quarrel with you.

267
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
Why would you kill my mother?

268
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,270
Blame no one but yourself.

269
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,390
You chose to wed Jingchuan.

270
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,320
You took his love.

271
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,720
You harbor such feelings for him.

272
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,120
We grew up together side by side.

273
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,480
Jingchuan belongs to me.

274
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,750
I'm the one who suits him best.

275
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,950
What does that have to do
with my mother?

276
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,200
You should've come at me.

277
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,030
Don't you love your mother deeply?

278
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,080
Why didn't you die alongside her?

279
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,480
Do you know?

280
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,080
She called your name
until her final breath.

281
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,320
Yaochu.

282
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,960
Yunge.

283
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,120
Yaochu.

284
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,440
Yunge.

285
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,440
I'll kill you!

286
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,270
My mother carved
this jade pendant for her.

287
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,550
It matches the shape of her birthmark.

288
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,160
What is it?

289
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,080
Go ahead and kill me.

290
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,240
If you do,
you'll never see Jingchuan again.

291
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,960
Come on then.

292
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,440
Come on.

293
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,920
Go ahead.

294
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,600
How could it be you?

295
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,110
Heaven above.

296
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,400
Even heaven is mocking me.

297
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Why is it her?
