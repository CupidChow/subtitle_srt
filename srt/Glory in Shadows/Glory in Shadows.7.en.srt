11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,350
Madam only caught a cold.

12
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,590
Nothing serious.

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,280
She should be waking up by now.

14
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,510
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

15
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,150
No problem, General.

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,480
I'll go write a prescription
for Madam now.

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,000
Nuan'er, see the physician out.

18
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,960
Yes.

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,120
You've woken up.

20
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,120
Tell me, why am I still alive?

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,920
What nonsense are you spouting?

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
I planned and schemed so much,

23
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,950
all just to keep my mother alive.

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,400
If I had known it would end like this,

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,840
I would've gone to the grave

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,750
with your robes.

27
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,190
Perhaps then,

28
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,630
my mother might still be alive.

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,840
Are you saying your life doesn't matter?

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,960
My mother is gone.

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,520
What's the point of me living on?

32
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,870
All I ever wanted

33
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,960
was to find my younger sister,

34
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,240
and live a simple life with my mother.

35
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,560
Why is that too much to ask?

36
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,400
Why must I fight against Concubine Xie?

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,080
Why can't I just obey quietly?

38
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,870
Why couldn't the one
to die have been me?

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,520
Yaochu,

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,080
you must go on living.

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,310
Not as someone's daughter
or someone's wife,

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,470
but as a blade,

43
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,710
a blade that strikes
against all the injustice.

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,000
You must live on.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,960
You still have to avenge your mother.

46
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,030
I've already sent people
to examine the body.

47
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,520
The culprit may not be Shen Yunxi.

48
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,960
How did

49
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
my mother die?

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,450
The coroner has confirmed the cause.

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,840
Your mother was poisoned first,

52
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,080
then someone cut her throat.

53
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,520
What kind of poison?

54
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,080
Scorpion Venom.

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,660
This poison comes
from the Western Regions.

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,000
I've had someone search
Shen Yunxi's residence.

57
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,320
But nothing was found.

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,550
The one who killed your mother

59
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,600
may be someone else.

60
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,120
What are you doing?

61
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,590
General,

62
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,560
I'm all alone, with no support.

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,360
I have no one to turn to.

64
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,480
All I have is my own life.

65
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,070
If you

66
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,870
can help me find out how my mom died,

67
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,680
my life is yours.

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,520
I give you my word.

69
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,320
Mother!

70
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,150
Mother.

71
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,350
- Mother!
- Jingchuan.

72
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,660
(Jingchuan's birth mother Lady Yan)
Mother.

73
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,020
- Jingchuan, why are you here?
- Mother.

74
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,860
(Young Jingchuan)
Mother.

75
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,000
You must leave now.

76
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,750
- Mother.
- Leave now.

77
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,120
Your father doesn't want you
visiting me.

78
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,760
- Go now.
- Mother!

79
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,920
Mother.

80
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,870
They all say you're dying.

81
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,070
You can't leave me.

82
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,120
Please don't leave me all alone.

83
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,790
Mother.

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,640
Jingchuan.

85
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,950
Be good.

86
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,830
I can't give you anything right now.

87
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,560
Here in the Marquis' Manor,

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,830
you must live on, and live well.

89
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,950
You must make something of yourself.

90
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,270
Otherwise, I couldn't rest in peace.

91
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
Mother.

92
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,080
Mother!

93
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,830
Mother.

94
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,470
Mother.

95
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,270
General.

96
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,720
I have one more favor to ask of you.

97
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,040
My mother's greatest regret

98
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,480
was that she never found
my younger sister, Shen Yunge.

99
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
So,

100
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,040
please help me find her.

101
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,920
You have a younger sister?

102
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,400
Yes.

103
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,160
But she was sold by Xie Siyun

104
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,390
to a human trafficker
when she was still an infant.

105
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,480
We haven't heard from her since.

106
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,870
On her left shoulder,

107
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,950
there's a birthmark.

108
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,120
It's shaped like a flower petal.

109
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,560
My mother
carved this jade pendant for her,

110
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
matching the shape of her birthmark.

111
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,270
But we don't know

112
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,160
whether she's still alive.

113
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,030
Alright.

114
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,670
I'll help you find her.

115
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,360
Thank you, General.

116
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,720
Is this news certain?

117
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,430
I just sent someone to confirm it.

118
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,720
Madam Shen's mother was killed,

119
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,240
and the third young lady was injured.

120
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,870
The Shen family

121
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,000
is really making a huge fool
of themselves.

122
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,070
People from such a family

123
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
truly can't hold their heads high.

124
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,240
Old Madam, you are right.

125
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,920
But looking at things now,

126
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,630
it seems Jingchuan
does take her side quite often.

127
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,190
I failed to win the General's favor.

128
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
I'll try my best.

129
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,560
Forget it.

130
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,680
When a man gets carried away by desire,

131
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,310
he can't see straight anyway.

132
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,390
But in the inner chambers,

133
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,430
it is still us women who hold sway.

134
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,150
Yes.

135
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,320
Jingchuan will soon be leaving
on official business.

136
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,510
The General is leaving again?

137
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,550
Recently, I'm worn out

138
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,550
and can't deal with trivialities.

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,630
I'll entrust the house affairs to you,

140
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,270
so you can get some experience.

141
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,470
Really?

142
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,360
Old Madam, thank you.

143
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,360
I

144
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
will never fail your trust.

145
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,390
Then I'll go prepare.

146
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,110
Yes.

147
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,120
Idiot.

148
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,110
Madam.

149
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,030
The old Madam wouldn't even see you.

150
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,150
Yet she shows such favor
toward Concubine Qin.

151
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,000
How does that make any sense?

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
Now,

153
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,960
I've failed to
win the General's affection,

154
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,840
and lost the old Madam's favor.

155
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,270
How am I to endure life

156
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,080
in this vast Marquis' Manor?

157
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,140
(Prefecture Governor's Manor)

158
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
What is that you're wearing?

159
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,540
Who died?

160
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,510
What are you doing?

161
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,670
Tell me,

162
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,840
is Shen Yaochu dead?

163
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,720
Or is it her mother?

164
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,560
Who died?

165
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,080
Let go of me!

166
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,480
Who died?

167
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,670
You'll never defeat me in the end.

168
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,440
You're still alive.

169
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,320
Then the one who died was

170
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,630
your mother?

171
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,630
Shen Yaochu.

172
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,360
You turned me into this wreck.

173
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,120
And still couldn't save your mother.

174
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,630
You've lost.

175
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,320
Even with the General guarding you,

176
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,840
you still can't defeat me!

177
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,240
You gave Shen Yunxi the Scorpion Venom?

178
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,030
What Scorpion Venom?

179
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,200
Yunxi.

180
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,720
Where is Yunxi?

181
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,390
Your mother died from poison.

182
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,440
So you came to me for the antidote?

183
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,200
Tell me where Yunxi is.

184
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,870
Then I'll give you the antidote.

185
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,960
It wasn't you.

186
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,550
What do you mean?

187
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,040
It was me.

188
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,510
I killed her!

189
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,550
Yunxi has nothing to do with it.

190
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,120
I killed her!

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,510
Where did you send my sister back then?

192
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,990
Your sister?

193
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,000
You're looking for your sister?

194
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,710
Back then...

195
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,000
I sold her into a pleasure house.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,840
Take a guess.

197
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,630
Guess what she's become now.

198
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Shen Yaochu.

199
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,670
Now respectfully take me back

200
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,320
and address me as "Mother",

201
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,360
and I'll tell you

202
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,320
where that girl is.

203
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,800
How about that?

204
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,440
Don't go!

205
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,910
Tell me!

206
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,440
Where is Yunxi?

207
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,750
Oh right,

208
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,200
Shen Yunxi assassinated
the wife of the Prefect

209
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,120
and kidnapped the third young lady
of the Marquis' Manor.

210
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,440
She was shot dead

211
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,870
on the spot.

212
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,390
No.

213
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,480
No!

214
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,320
That's impossible.
