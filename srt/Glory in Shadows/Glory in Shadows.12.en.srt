11
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,550
My Lady!

12
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,280
My Lady, look.

13
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,020
(Fifth day, third month, Dog Year, You hour)

14
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,310
Qin Ruoyi really put on a fine show.

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,230
Let's return the favor
with a show of our own.

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,000
You summoned us all here
in the middle of the night.

17
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,920
What now?

18
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
I know

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,590
I disturbed Old Madam and all of you.

20
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,630
But a sharp pain

21
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,910
is gripping my chest.

22
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,560
It feels as if my whole body
is being pricked by needles.

23
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,680
Have you seen a physician?

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,960
Yes.

25
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,520
He found nothing unusual.

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,400
Then what is it?

27
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,630
Perhaps it's the sinister thing

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,080
has not been fully driven away.

29
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,310
Could we invite
that Taoist priest to come again

30
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,800
and cleanse the evil spirits for me?

31
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,150
Go invite him.

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,310
- Yes.
- Thanks, Old Madam.

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,120
Ma'am.

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,710
Old Madam,

35
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,150
the manor's troubles are no
mere lingering evil spirits.

36
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,360
This is a deliberate act of malice.

37
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,750
I have divined it.

38
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,520
In the due south of this manor,

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,430
a cursed object is hidden here,
meant to harm Concubine Qin.

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
What?

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,000
Old Madam,

42
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,750
someone must envy me
for carrying a child.

43
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,080
They want us dead!

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,000
Stop crying.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,800
Take more maids and search around.

46
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Yes.

47
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,710
This is the object

48
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,240
(Fifth day, third month, Dog Year, You hour)
that made Concubine Qin fall ill.

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,590
If it hadn't been found in time,

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,360
I'm afraid that

51
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,800
in a few days,

52
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,080
her life would be in danger.

53
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,710
Audacious!

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,960
Who used curse sorcery in the residence?

55
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,560
Where was it found?

56
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,550
It...

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,240
It was found under Her Ladyship's bed.

58
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,960
How could it be me?

59
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,630
Why would you wish me harm?

60
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,400
My child would only

61
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,400
be born of a concubine.

62
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,190
Why must you be so ruthless?

63
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,070
Concubine Qin, why are you so certain?

64
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,270
What if I was framed?
Someone could place it

65
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,430
in my room.

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,880
I know

67
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,430
you have never been fond of me.

68
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,390
Ever since I became pregnant,

69
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,360
you've seen me as a thorn in your side.

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,630
But the General is the father!

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,830
How could you be so cruel?

72
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,430
I'm not the only one

73
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,720
who detests you and sees you

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
as a thorn in my side.

75
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,310
What do you mean, Your Ladyship?

76
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,800
I did not want to say this.

77
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,600
But since Her Ladyship insisted

78
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,720
on pinning this matter on me,

79
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,800
I have no choice.

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,000
Old Madam,

81
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,310
Her Ladyship often spoke

82
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,830
of her envy toward Concubine Qin.

83
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,080
She must have

84
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,070
long planned to strike at Concubine Qin.

85
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,480
Shen,

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,630
do you have anything else to say?

87
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,440
Wait.

88
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,560
I have just divined

89
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,480
there is a second object.

90
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,510
There is another one

91
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,310
in the southeast.

92
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,960
(Southeast?)

93
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,310
(Isn't that my own courtyard?)

94
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,910
It's not me.

95
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,870
He said southeast, not you.

96
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
Why are you nervous?

97
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,270
It was found in Concubine Tang's room.

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,920
You dare to toy with me?

99
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,560
Tang,

100
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,510
we have always been on good terms.

101
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,000
How could you team up
with Her Ladyship to against me?

102
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,190
Enough with the act!

103
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Old Madam, this is all her act.

104
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,070
She was not possessed!

105
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,720
This is all a scheme she made up!

106
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,650
Old Madam,

107
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,310
do not be deceived by her!

108
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,800
Tang,

109
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,390
how could you make

110
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,360
such a lie to clear yourself?

111
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,950
I truly misjudged you.

112
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,270
Still playing the victim,

113
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,430
you wretch!

114
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,000
I didn't even touch her.

115
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,910
Old Madam...

116
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
Did you see?

117
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,870
Both of you, be silent!

118
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
The evidence is irrefutable.

119
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,070
You two are indeed suspicious.

120
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,430
Qin cannot possibly harm her own child

121
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,000
just to frame you.

122
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,030
Guards!

123
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,920
Take them both to the woodshed.

124
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,560
They shall face
the family discipline tomorrow.

125
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,670
Old Madam,

126
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,720
aren't you being a bit arbitrary.

127
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,160
What defense do you have?

128
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,510
May I ask, Taoist,

129
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,360
what is curse sorcery?

130
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,680
The puppet is the vessel for the curse.

131
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,310
By writing the victim's

132
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,240
Four Pillars of Destiny on it

133
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,780
and piercing it with needles,

134
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,270
the victim will share
the puppet's sensations

135
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,720
and suffer unbearable pain.

136
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,270
I see.

137
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,950
In that case,

138
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,270
it wasn't us trying to harm Concubine Qin.

139
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,390
It was Concubine Qin trying to harm us.

140
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,270
Fifth day, third month, Dog Year, You hour.

141
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,950
That is my birth hour.

142
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,270
22nd day, tenth month,
Rooster Year, Hai hour.

143
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,560
That's my birth hour.

144
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,480
The Taoist just said

145
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,240
whoever's birth data is written

146
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,000
is the one being cursed,

147
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,400
so,

148
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,070
the one targeting me and Concubine Tang

149
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,750
could only be you.

150
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,630
If I were her

151
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,480
and went to such effort,

152
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,480
I'd aim to kill two birds with one stone.

153
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,200
Go take a look.

154
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,560
Is there also one of these

155
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,600
in Concubine Tang's room?

156
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,350
Be careful.

157
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't worry.

158
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
You wretch!

159
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,000
She hold me.

160
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,110
Stop that!

161
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,200
You scared me.

162
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,200
It was you.

163
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
What a vicious scheme.

164
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,560
I'm vicious?

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,720
You're carrying the General's child.

166
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,080
No matter what, he will be the firstborn.

167
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,870
Why are you still so hostile

168
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,200
toward us

169
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,030
and use the curse sorcery on us?

170
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,350
Qin!

171
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,000
Look at what you've done!

172
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,230
Old Madam,

173
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,910
I had no knowledge of this.

174
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,440
Someone must have framed me.

175
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
That is possible.

176
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,990
After all,

177
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,840
all the clues came from the Taoist.

178
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,590
Taoist,

179
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,030
are you also envy Concubine Qin
for being pregnant

180
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,320
and plot against her?

181
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,160
Old Madam!

182
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,440
I was merely following orders!

183
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,920
Whose?

184
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,160
It was...

185
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,440
It was Concubine Qin.

186
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
She told me

187
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,630
to place the puppets
under false pretenses.

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,840
Old Madam,

189
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,360
I only did it for money.

190
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,270
Please spare my life.

191
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,750
How dare a charlatan deceive

192
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,320
the House of a Marquis!

193
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,590
Guards!

194
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,870
Hand him over to the Magistrate!

195
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,240
- Yes!
- Old Madam, spare me!

196
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,630
Please have mercy!

197
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,960
- Please have mercy!
- Go.

198
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,600
Please have mercy!

199
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,600
Qin,

200
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,240
you are pregnant and still not content.

201
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,320
You even tried to frame the Principal Wife!

202
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,440
Do you think I would not

203
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,390
punish you because you're pregnant?

204
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,030
Spare me, Old Madam!

205
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,350
I...

206
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,150
It was a moment of utter folly!

207
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,750
Old Madam,

208
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,240
for the sake of the child

209
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,550
of the Li Family I'm carrying,

210
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,510
please show mercy!

211
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,490
Guards!

212
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,350
Wait!

213
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,240
Lord Qin?

214
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,590
Father!

215
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,510
Ruoyi.

216
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,140
(Qin Ruoyi's Father)

217
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,120
Greetings, Old Madam.

218
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,080
Lord Qin, you arrived here at midnight

219
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,670
without even giving us notice.

220
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,910
Do you hold our Marquis House

221
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,240
in such low regard?

222
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,440
Old Madam,

223
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,790
I heard my daughter was pregnant

224
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,510
and rushed here to see her.

225
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,720
So, I neglected the time.

226
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,200
Please forgive me.

227
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,160
My apologies.

228
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,000
If so,

229
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,390
present your visiting card
and come tomorrow.

230
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,230
Wait.

231
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,550
Though I do not know what Ruoyi did wrong,

232
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,000
she is carrying General Li's child.

233
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,200
Moreover,

234
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,960
I have always been loyal
to the old marquis.

235
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,200
Please do not punish her hard, Old Madam.

236
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,630
Since you say it,

237
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,720
Qin shall be grounded for one month.

238
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,240
Without my command,

239
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,440
she is not to step outside her room.

240
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,800
I do not agree.

241
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,360
What argument do you have now?

242
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,480
Concubine Tang and I
nearly died today because of her.

243
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Yet she's only grounded.

244
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,870
Isn't that too light?

245
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,510
Old Madam is the matriarch!

246
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,270
How can you question
her decision so casually?

247
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,750
Here is the marquis manor,

248
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,270
not the private estate of the Qins.

249
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,200
You...

250
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,960
Old Madam,

251
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,030
I said that for the sake of

252
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,320
the Li family's offspring.

253
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Matters of my family

254
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,480
do not require your concern.

255
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
Greetings, Old Madam.

256
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,960
Please sit down.

257
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,720
General Li, you must be joking.

258
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,720
I only happened to witness this matter.

259
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,630
In fact, I came today

260
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,510
to discuss an important issue with you.

261
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,360
It concerns the Western Lands.

262
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:30,150
Why not leave this matter to Old Madam?

263
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Let's move to the study

264
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,960
to discuss it in detail there.

265
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,390
Affairs of the Western Lands

266
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,870
will be decided by His Majesty.

267
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,150
What right do you have to interfere?

268
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,800
Yes.

269
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,270
I have overstepped.

270
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,720
You did overstep.

271
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,670
Paying a visit at midnight without notice,

272
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,910
do you take me for a corpse?

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,080
I would not dare.

274
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,990
Get out.

275
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,550
Yes, General.

276
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,920
Father.

277
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,440
Father!

278
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,920
Jingchuan,

279
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,000
haven't you been staying at
the barracks lately?

280
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,750
Why have you come home today?

281
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,670
Lord Qin just returned from the border

282
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,600
and came straight to our residence.

283
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,550
Is it out of concern for his daughter,

284
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,360
or does he have other motives?

285
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,960
I don't understand

286
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,380
court affairs.

287
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,600
But you should understand
the rules of this house.

288
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,720
Concubine Qin committed a fault.

289
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
She should be punished.

290
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,120
General,

291
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,670
I...

292
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,390
For the sake of your pregnancy,

293
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,870
the punishment is suspended,
allowance halved.

294
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,600
You are grounded until the child is born.

295
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,030
If you dare offend Her Ladyship again,

296
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,270
I will punish you,
with no regard for the child.

297
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,910
Thank you, General.

298
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,630
My Lady.

299
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,120
What is it that?
Keep it hidden from me?

300
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,720
There's nothing that
needs to be hidden from you.

301
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,630
Then why that expression?

302
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,870
Why aren't you wearing that green robe?

303
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,360
That looks good on you.

304
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,720
Did you find out something?

305
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,960
I didn't find out anything.

306
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,870
Tell me.

307
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,080
Only if you won't scold me.

308
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,200
This has nothing to do with me.

309
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,800
Alright.

310
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,440
