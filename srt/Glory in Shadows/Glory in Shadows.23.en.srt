11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,660
(Li Manor)

12
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,430
Why are you here so early today?

13
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,320
I woke up early this morning.

14
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,480
So, I went to made some soup.

15
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,840
Father, please have a taste.

16
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,430
You look rather nice today.

17
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,990
Xingwan,

18
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,080
come here.

19
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,750
One.

20
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,190
What do you mean by that?

21
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,550
Two.

22
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,910
What exactly do you mean?

23
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,590
Three.

24
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,430
Well?

25
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,590
It's tormenting, isn't it?

26
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,150
Don't be afraid.

27
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,800
I won't let you die.

28
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,420
I'll make you suffer every day,

29
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,890
as if ants were gnawing at your bones.

30
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,360
So long as you obey me,

31
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,470
I'll give you one antidote each day

32
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,080
to ease the pain.

33
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,630
What are you trying to do?

34
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,680
Didn't you say you liked me?

35
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,680
Then marry me.

36
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,000
You've lost your mind.

37
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,240
Do you want our honor ruined?

38
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,120
I'd rather die than agree.

39
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,190
As I told you,

40
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,680
I won't let you die.

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,180
You've been bedridden for three years.

42
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,870
All your senses were sharp,

43
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,630
yet your body could not move.

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,870
That must've been unbearable, right?

45
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,680
Do you wish to taste that again?

46
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,750
This poison...

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,310
Zhao Qingru didn't do it.

48
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,680
It was you.

49
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,030
Zhao Qingru, that fool.

50
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,150
How could she know such a cunning trick?

51
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,360
Of course, I did it.

52
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,710
What exactly are you after?

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,590
I want to be the matriarch

54
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,870
of Li Manor.

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,220
(Li Manor)

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Marquis.

57
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,230
Father.

58
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,710
Father.

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,270
Father, you're finally willing
to see me.

60
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,120
I've missed you dearly,

61
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,960
Father.

62
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,830
Everyone has arrived.

63
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,160
Jingxu, why kneel?

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,200
Stand up.

65
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,870
What did you just call me?

66
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Get up first.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,390
The Master is about to announce
a joyful event today.

68
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,920
Master?

69
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,960
Master,

70
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,240
everyone is gathered.

71
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,640
Please, speak.

72
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,560
The matriarch has passed suddenly.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,560
The position of my wife is now vacant.

74
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,040
I have made my decision.

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,830
I will take Li Xingwan as my wife.

76
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,640
Father,

77
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,680
she...

78
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,070
She's your daughter!

79
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,510
I was never his real daughter.

80
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,630
Whether it's his daughter or his wife,

81
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,950
it's just a title.

82
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,390
I've merely taken on a different title.

83
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,520
Li Xingwan,

84
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,560
have you lost your mind?

85
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,240
Even if you're not bound by blood,

86
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,310
you've called him father for years.

87
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,510
And now you want to marry him?

88
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,360
Do you want our family

89
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,960
to become the laughingstock of the city?

90
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,310
If things get that lively,

91
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,760
all the better.

92
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,870
Do you even know what you're doing,

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,640
Li Xingwan?

94
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,480
How dare you call me by name?

95
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,950
I'm now your mother-in-law.

96
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,560
You ought to kneel
and greet me with respect.

97
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,390
Utter madness.

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,950
Once our wedding date is set,

99
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,370
this household will be lively.

100
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,920
Nonsense.

101
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,470
Father,

102
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,240
what has Li Xingwan done to you?

103
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,320
Tell me.

104
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,830
How could you let her become
the matriarch?

105
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,470
Jingxu,

106
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,630
you are a legitimate son.

107
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,390
The Master is getting old.

108
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,270
Many matters are beyond his strength.

109
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,720
I can no longer bear another child.

110
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,560
Once I become the matriarch,

111
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,600
you will be the sole legitimate son

112
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,600
and the only one worthy
to inherit the title.

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,430
What do you think of that?

114
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,150
You...

115
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,040
You're willing to be so generous

116
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,950
and let me inherit the title?

117
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,630
Li Jingchuan is a concubine's son.

118
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,340
Even with his great military feats,

119
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,560
he still has no claim to it.

120
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,030
Father.

121
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,150
Father,

122
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,000
really?

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,560
Can I inherit the title?

124
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,950
If you have any objections,

125
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,430
then I can...

126
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,440
No.

127
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,510
No objections.

128
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,350
No objections at all.

129
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,750
How should you address me now?

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,840
Mother.

131
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,480
Please accept my bow.

132
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,920
Excellent.

133
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,480
Excellent.

134
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,800
Why have you become like this?

135
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,720
Li Xingwan, you're crazy.

136
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,120
All of you are crazy.

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,840
Attendants!

138
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,830
Shen has shown no respect
for her mother-in-law

139
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,820
and has plotted against her husband.

140
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,750
Put her to death with the rod now.

141
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,270
What's this?

142
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,340
You're ignoring my orders?

143
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,070
I am now the matriarch

144
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,720
of this household.

145
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,240
Anyone who defies me

146
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,390
will end up just like Shen.

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Move, now!

148
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,680
Wait.

149
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,280
Mother,

150
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,600
I have long-standing grudges
against her.

151
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,000
Could you let me deal with her?

152
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
Very well.

153
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,750
She's yours.

154
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
Take care of her.

155
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,030
You wretched little thing.

156
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,030
You found Li Qiang
and intercepted the letter.

157
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,480
Look what trouble
you've brought upon me.

158
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,320
You've made me a cripple.

159
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,150
Today, I'll make you pay dearly.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,320
I've been wondering

161
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,750
what Li Jingchuan's treasured lady

162
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,440
is really like.

163
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,550
Even tied up, you're still defiant.

164
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,870
You passed out?

165
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,080
How dull.

166
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,360
Attendants!

167
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,260
(Li Manor)

168
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,150
Where is she?

169
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,790
Still not found.

170
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,070
She can't possibly get away.

171
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,350
She must still be in the manor.

172
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,330
Search for her at once.

173
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:57,870
- Yes.
- Yes.

174
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,540
(Elegant Spring Residence)

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,550
Let's see how far you can run.

176
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,840
Where did she hide?

177
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,680
Check over there.

178
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,800
Let's go.

179
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,440
Deputy Xu.

180
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,080
Lady Xingwan.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,480
Are you here for my brother?

182
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,600
No.

183
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,610
I'm here to find Mrs. Li.

184
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,510
Have you seen her?

185
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,510
Oh, Yaochu?

186
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,030
I think I saw her

187
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,550
heading toward the back mountain.

188
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,680
Thank you.

189
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,910
Jingchuan.

190
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,790
Have a sip.

191
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,720
Are you planning to die
alongside Shen Yaochu?

192
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,750
What did you say?

193
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,360
Yaochu is dead?

194
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,200
That's right.

195
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,200
Why would I ever let her live?

196
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,800
Jingchuan,

197
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,870
you'll never see her again.

198
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,670
Li Xingwan.

199
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,200
This may not be poison,

200
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,550
but it will drain your strength

201
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,080
and make you follow my lead.

202
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,750
Stop struggling.

203
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,390
I don't believe you.

204
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,900
I'm going to find her.

205
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,750
Give up already.

206
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,360
You can only be with me.

207
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,910
I am now the matriarch.

208
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,240
Everyone is at my command.

209
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,120
If I wish someone gone,

210
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
then they will be gone.

211
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,510
You're completely mad.

212
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,350
Jingchuan,

213
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,200
right now,

214
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,240
you have only me.

215
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,260
My Lady, she's still not found.

216
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,510
The manor isn't that large.

217
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,040
Where could she possibly hide?

218
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,350
Where is he?
