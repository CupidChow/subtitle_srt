00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,760
General

12
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,870
I, Yuzhu, have come
to attend to the General.

13
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,350
General?

14
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,310
I am here for you!

15
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,590
Is the General alone?

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,920
General?

17
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,920
General?

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,240
Who are you?

19
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,430
And who are you?

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,880
And who are you then?

21
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,760
I'm Tang Yuzhu, Second Concubine.

22
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
I've just married in.

23
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,350
Tell me, who am I?

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,400
Madam.

25
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,120
It was improper of me to overstep.

26
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,710
You came in without my consent.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,510
You barged into my chamber uninvited

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,120
and disturbed my wedding
night with the General.

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,560
What should we do?

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,400
General, give the word.

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,400
Have her sent away.

32
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,950
Please don't, General!

33
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,430
Madam,

34
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,560
I truly did not mean to disturb

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,430
you and the General.

36
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,030
It was...

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,280
It was Lady Ruoyi.

38
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,030
She said you even offended Old Madam.

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,400
Who knew what trouble

40
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,190
you were planning to stir?

41
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,120
I acted in haste for a moment.

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,310
That is why I resorted
to this poor plan.

43
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,560
Well,

44
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,080
let me plead your case.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,960
Consider it a favor you owe me.

46
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,990
Thank you, Madam.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
General,

48
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,840
perhaps we should just
let this matter rest.

49
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,590
Thank you, General.

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,630
You're quite clever,

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,120
using me for favors.

52
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,750
Driving a concubine out
on the wedding night

53
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,800
tarnishes both our reputations.

54
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,520
I suppose that makes sense.

55
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,410
Conduct wisely.

56
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,270
General,

57
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,200
you...

58
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,680
Are you leaving with her?

59
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,800
Since you want to work with me,

60
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,680
you must show me your skills first.

61
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,360
Tomorrow morning,

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,120
I'll see how you handle it.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
(This Shen Yaochu…)

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,030
(She must have a story.)

65
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,310
General, didn't you go today

66
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,750
to make the Shen Family back down?

67
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,120
Why change the plan all of a sudden?

68
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,240
I thought Madam Li would yield today.

69
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,600
But unexpectedly…

70
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,080
Her place in her family is precarious.

71
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,030
If I didn't let her in,

72
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,800
she might not survive.

73
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,430
The Tang and Qin families
are already involved.

74
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,310
No need to drag a helpless woman in.

75
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,400
No…

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,520
She's not helpless.

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,960
Old Madam.

78
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,560
Why have you come at such a late hour?

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
I heard that today,

80
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,310
Madam Li offended you, Old Madam.

81
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,080
I truly have been worried.

82
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,520
So I came to visit.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,590
You seem well-informed about the news.

84
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,310
The Old Marquis has been
bedridden for three years.

85
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,430
You've been managing
the household tirelessly.

86
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,950
I deeply admire your devotion.

87
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,520
Old Madam,

88
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,920
you are the model for all
women in the household.

89
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,630
What are you trying to say?

90
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,430
I've heard about today's matter.

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,720
It left me truly upset.

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,510
Yaochu was arrogant and rude,

93
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
and even dared to cross you.

94
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,390
I cannot possibly endure such things.

95
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,120
It's just a pity.

96
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,720
I am but a concubine.

97
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,720
While she is the rightful wife.

98
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,720
My filial devotion is sincere.

99
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,630
Yet I can't put it into action.

100
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,390
Keep a closer watch for me.

101
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,190
If she were to make a grave mistake
and be sent away from the household,

102
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,160
then I could rest a little easier.

103
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,070
I will be sure to stay vigilant.

104
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,310
Old Madam, please rest assured.

105
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,600
I shall take my leave now.

106
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,920
Madam Li has come to greet Old Madam.

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
The new wife, Yaochu,

108
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,230
is here to greet

109
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,160
her mother-in-law.

110
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,790
No hurry.

111
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,310
You probably haven't met
these two before.

112
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,600
Second Concubine, Yuzhu.

113
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,390
Third Concubine, Ruoyi.

114
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,240
Though you are the rightful wife,

115
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,190
you married in later than they did.

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,840
From now on,

117
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,270
you must learn proper manners from them.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
Yes.

119
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,950
I have heard

120
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,750
that Jingchuan was in
your chambers yesterday.

121
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,310
He stayed for barely an hour.

122
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,600
Is this what happened?

123
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,270
The General said he had
urgent matters at midnight

124
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,150
and then left.

125
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,720
If you failed to attend
to the General well,

126
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,800
and he departed displeased,

127
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,560
Old Madam may not blame you,

128
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,560
but matters of such weight

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,360
must never be met with falsehoods.

130
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Why would I lie?

131
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,190
You know the reason deep down.

132
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,000
Nanzhi.

133
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,800
Old Madam, please see.

134
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,310
On the wedding night, the bride
showed no sign of the first blood.

135
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,600
How reckless you are!

136
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,630
You concealed your unworthy
past to marry into the family?

137
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,240
You clearly hold
no regard for our family.

138
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,560
Yaochu,

139
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,390
how do you explain this matter?

140
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,630
Explaining alone will do me no good.

141
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,560
Please summon the General here.

142
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,640
Things will be clear.

143
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,390
Set the tea aside for now.

144
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,240
Did I say you could rise?

145
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,000
The General has arrived.

146
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,310
Old Madam, why summon me?

147
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,510
Last night was your wedding night.

148
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,120
Yet no bridal mark was
found on Yaochu's cloth.

149
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,630
Such a matter is a grave
offense in this house.

150
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,630
Yet she insists on seeking you out.

151
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,160
Tell me, why would that be?

152
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,520
- This...
- Jingchuan!

153
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,350
Xingwan?

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,840
Jingchuan...

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,840
You're alive.

156
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,750
Thank goodness, you survived.

157
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,550
(Li Xingwan Daughter of Li Family)
I'd never see you again.

158
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,400
Jingchuan...

159
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,470
- It's alright.
- Xingwan!

160
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,390
Look what a state you are in!

161
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,560
I greet you, Mother.

162
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,070
Didn't I send you to
Guanyin Nunnery to pray?

163
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,960
What made you come back on your own?

164
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,600
This morning, I heard
my elder brother returned safely.

165
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,960
I was overwhelmed with joy.

166
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,440
So I couldn't hold back.

167
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,550
I returned without

168
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
informing Mother.

169
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,270
I ask for forgiveness.

170
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,630
Enough.

171
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,030
You are...

172
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,870
My sister-in-law?

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,480
Sister-in-law, you've just married in,

174
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,720
and Jingchuan returned.

175
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,320
You truly are blessed.

176
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,720
Xingwan, mind your manners.

177
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,160
Go wait aside.

178
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,280
Yaochu,

179
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,200
I've already brought Jingchuan here.

180
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,590
Let's hear it.

181
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,240
How do you explain this?

182
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,510
Old Madam, I actually…

183
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,110
What's wrong?

184
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,990
My legs feel numb

185
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,110
from kneeling.

186
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,870
- Then stand up first.
- Hold on.

187
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,670
Let her explain
the matter clearly first!

188
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,110
Last night…

189
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,120
It was my first meeting
with the General.

190
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,360
We found ourselves in accord.

191
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,630
The General knew I was gravely injured.

192
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,630
He could not bear to see me suffer.

193
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,720
Yet his feelings could
not be restrained.

194
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,630
So, the General went out
in the middle of the night

195
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,670
for fear that overindulgence
might harm me.

196
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,960
As for the Blood-stained cloth...

197
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,510
The General said…

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,480
It was our Token of Love.

199
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
He'd kept it to himself.

200
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,590
So he took it.

201
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,390
I have no idea

202
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,840
where Nanny Sun got this silk cloth.

203
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,320
Why would she try to frame me?

204
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,160
I did no such thing!

205
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,150
I took it from your bed.

206
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,510
Stop slandering me.

207
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,440
Jingchuan,

208
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,200
is what Yaochu says true?

209
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,780
This…

210
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,720
To confirm it,

211
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,720
take a look inside General's robes.

212
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,910
See if that bloodstained
silk cloth is there.

213
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,030
The General said he'd keep it close.

214
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,200
General, you wouldn't lie, yes?

215
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,510
So the General didn't lie to me.

216
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,150
I'm deeply moved.

217
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,270
Such a tainted thing.

218
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,790
And you carry it with you?

219
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,080
What a misfortune.

220
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,510
Quickly, throw it away.

221
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,750
It's the Token of Love.

222
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,080
I shall naturally keep it safe.

223
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,870
Enough.

224
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,870
This matter is settled.

225
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,280
I'm exhausted.

226
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,870
You may all leave.

227
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,390
Wait.

228
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,150
Nanny Sun tarnished my good name.

229
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,120
She claimed I was impure.

230
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,360
If it weren't for
the General's feelings for me

231
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,790
and keeping this piece of cloth,

232
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,120
then today,

233
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Nanny Sun would have wronged me.

234
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,600
That's not true!

235
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,510
Old Madam,

236
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,560
General,

237
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,870
she accused me out of malice!

238
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,030
Are you implying

239
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,390
the General and I worked

240
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,630
together to frame you?

241
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,320
No, no, that's not it.

242
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,580
Old Madam,

243
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,030
please, you must stand up for me!

244
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,000
That is enough.

245
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,670
It's just a misunderstanding.

246
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,670
But this misunderstanding
nearly cost my life.

247
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,240
We can't just let it slide
so easily, can we?

248
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,910
Then what is it you want?

249
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,630
I've only just married in.

250
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,080
I fear others will say

251
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,550
that I bully the servants.

252
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,790
But if this isn't punished severely,

253
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,080
people will say
Old Madam can't keep order.

254
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,110
In that case...

255
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,800
Nanny Sun,

256
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,630
you will kneel here on the cushion

257
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,240
for ten full hours.

258
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,710
Old Madam?

259
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,160
Old Madam!

260
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,630
Do it as she says.

261
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,650
Old Madam!

262
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,440
You cannot turn your
back on me, Old Madam!

263
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,680
Sister-in-law.

264
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,710
Nanny Sun...

265
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,650
Jingchuan.

266
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,510
Kneel properly.

267
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,270
If one day you can rise again,

268
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,960
we shall meet once more.
