Only if you won't scold me.

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,430
This has nothing to do with me.

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,040
Alright.

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,680
You'll father someone else's child.

15
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,760
You can actually laugh at that?

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,640
So you knew it too.

17
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,190
So you knew?

18
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,480
Tell me first. How you found out.

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,310
A few days ago,
I overheard the servants talking.

20
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,670
In her courtyard,

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,480
a peach tree withered for no reason.

22
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,120
So I had Nuan'er look into it.

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,400
She found herbal dregs under the tree.

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,350
Medicine meant to delay the fetus's growth.

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,280
She had been taking it for some time,

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,200
which means she was already pregnant

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,350
before she slept with you.

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,200
How did you figure that out?

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,630
In truth,

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,120
I did not touch her that night.

31
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,870
I gave her a hallucinogenic potion.

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,200
Your concubine is carrying
another man's child.

33
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,000
You're magnanimous, General.

34
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,120
She isn't the one I love.

35
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,710
Why should I care about that?

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,520
Though, I am curious,

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,960
who the true father is?

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,480
If you're curious,

39
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,200
why not have Nuan'er look into it?

40
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,960
Why involve my maid?

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Alright,

42
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,840
you're swamped with military affairs.

43
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,680
Matters of the household

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,630
can only be managed by a woman.

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,560
Your knack for sarcasm

46
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,750
grows ever sharper.

47
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,750
My pleasure.

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,010
But I guess

49
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,190
you think Lord Qin

50
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,750
is behind your assassination.

51
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,750
That's why you keep it quiet.

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,080
You're right.

53
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,710
The peace talks about

54
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,150
the Western Lands have been obstructed.

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,590
And I was attacked at the same time.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,750
It's hard not to see

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
a connection.

58
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,360
Then tonight's visit was

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,590
likely not just to see his daughter.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,840
How so?

61
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,910
A father who truly loves his daughter

62
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,560
would never bear to kill her husband,

63
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,710
nor rush here from afar to visit her.

64
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,240
You seem to understand parental love well.

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,710
I never had a father's love,

66
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,080
so I know

67
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,190
what a father who truly
cherishes his daughter

68
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,910
should be like.

You had no one to rely on.

72
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,710
But from now on,

73
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,430
you have me.

Why are you avoiding me?

78
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,040
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

79
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,070
I wished to speak with you.

80
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,160
We met halfway.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,270
It seems fate brought us together.

82
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,790
Come here.

83
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,200
Let's have a chat.

84
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,320
Why are you standing?

85
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,710
Sit down.

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
These past days, I've been confused.

87
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,750
We used to get along so well.

88
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,950
Why have we suddenly become enemies?

89
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,240
Had I not sensed something amiss,

90
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
today, you and I,

91
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,240
might have fallen into
Concubine Qin's trap.

92
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,920
This place is like a battlefield.

93
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,160
The situation changes in an instant.

94
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,270
In this round,

95
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,600
who truly benefited?

96
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,440
Was it you, or me?

97
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,870
You're skilled with numbers.

98
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,830
Was this a losing deal for you?

99
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,200
I know

100
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,360
I am neither clever nor quick-witted.

101
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,160
In this household,

102
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,600
no matter whom I rely on,

103
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,720
I always end up being used.

104
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,160
Must one always depend on others?

105
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,950
I was born to a merchant family,

106
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,120
and never favored by the elite.

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,190
Marrying the General
as a concubine was no easy feat.

108
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,390
Though a concubine,

109
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,480
I brought some honor to my family.

110
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,680
Do you think everyone is as lucky as you,

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,310
born to be a Principal Wife?

112
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,200
Lucky, am I?

113
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,720
And what do you call luck?

114
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,390
Being wife or concubine of a noble clan,

115
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
or living in wealth

116
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,560
with fine clothes and delicacies?

117
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,480
The world is full of splendor,

118
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,160
yet so much sorrow remains hidden.

119
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,950
Have you thought of that?

120
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,720
Easy for you to say.

121
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,800
We are both pitiful souls trapped here.

122
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,400
If we climb higher,

123
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,430
perhaps we suffer a little less.

124
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,870
If there were a choice...

125
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,390
We have never had a choice!

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,840
We do have one.

127
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,110
Tang,

128
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
I'll ask you something.

129
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,920
Answer me honestly.

130
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,000
Do you truly love the General?

131
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,870
Does it even matter?

132
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,680
The truth is,

133
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,000
I haven't seen the General's face clearly.

134
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,720
I simply do not wish to

135
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,190
be despised or neglected,

136
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,680
left alonel and helpless.

137
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,870
If you are willing,

138
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,480
I will find a way

139
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,430
to help you leave here.

140
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,870
What nonsense is that?

141
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,630
Are you trying to get me into trouble?

142
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960
Don't worry.

143
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,480
I'll keep you safe.

144
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,920
Sister-in-law, it's me.

145
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,350
Wan'er, you're here.

146
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,060
Sister-in-law,

147
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,160
Mother had me
copy scriptures these past days.

148
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,600
I barely had time to visit you.

149
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,240
I have finally finished today,

150
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,360
so I came to see you.

151
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,390
Old Madam has been too strict with you.

152
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,070
I've grown used to it.

153
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,350
Oh, sister-in-law.

154
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,560
Is your injury any better?

155
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,120
I heard what happened that day.

156
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,390
Thankfully, Brother arrived just in time.

157
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,710
Otherwise...

158
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,720
I had no standing to speak up,

159
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,950
so I couldn't help you.

160
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,270
You're still young.

161
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,600
Just take care of yourself.

162
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,360
But seeing how Brother protects you,

163
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,600
I am at ease.

164
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,030
In the past,

165
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,390
he never showed such care

166
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,510
to any other woman.

167
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,800
But

168
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,790
Concubine Qin

169
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,910
is the first to bear his child.

170
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,960
The General having an eldest child

171
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,720
is joyous no matter what.

172
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,320
By the way,

173
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,630
I often saw Xiaocui,

174
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,360
Concubine Qin's maid,

175
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,790
sneaking out the back gate.

176
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,600
She seemed rather secretive.

177
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,550
I wonder if she's meeting a lover.

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,670
Today, I saw her leave again.

179
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,200
You're a young lady,

180
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,750
talking of lovers is unbecoming.

181
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,030
Sister-in-law,

182
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,750
stop lecturing me.

183
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,320
I was only guessing.

184
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,720
Sister-in-law, you're so kind.

185
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,670
I wish you were my elder sister.

186
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,150
I'd love to be your elder sister.

187
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,710
My Lady!

188
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,810
My Lady,

189
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,920
I just saw Concubine Qin

190
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,550
dressed as Xiaocui and went out.

191
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,740
(Han'an Inn)

192
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,280
Yiyi,

193
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,150
why are you so late today?

194
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,560
Kong,

195
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,120
when are you return home?

196
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,750
Return home?

197
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,750
Why should I go home?

198
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,000
I want to see our child born.

199
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,280
I want to

200
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,150
stay with you and our child.

201
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,510
But how?

202
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,030
Live in this inn forever?

203
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,750
The savings we had are nearly gone.

204
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,510
I'll find a way to earn tomorrow.

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,360
I will not spend your money anymore.

206
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,030
That's easy for you to say.

207
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,750
You failed the Imperial Exams.

208
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,800
How can you earn money?

209
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,750
Yiyi,

210
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,360
do you despise me?

211
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,720
That's not what I mean.

212
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,350
It's just...

213
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,480
We can't keep sneaking around like this.

214
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,480
Sooner or later, we'll be found out.

215
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,550
Then go ask Li Jingchuan to divorce you.

216
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,480
I can support you and our child.

217
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,390
Kong,

218
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,440
listen to me.

219
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,510
Our child being born in the marquis manor

220
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,720
is better than being with us, right?

221
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,240
Just do as I say.

222
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,560
Go home first.

223
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,790
Once you attain an official post,

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
I'll find a way to leave Li Manor.

225
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,920
By then,

226
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,670
we can be together forever.

227
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,750
But

228
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,510
what about our child?

229
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,670
There will be a way.

230
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,000
Trust me, will you?

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,390
Go home as soon as you can.

232
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,150
Take this for travel expenses.

233
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,150
I've been out too long.

234
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,200
It will raise suspicion.

235
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,630
I should go.

236
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,670
What are you doing here?

237
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,380
