00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,200
No matter what, the General is his father.

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,840
He may be born of a concubine,

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,310
but he will call me Mother.

14
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,040
Why wouldn't I be pleased?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,350
Even so, he will still be

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,400
the eldest child of the Li family.

17
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,070
Your pregnancy is a blessing,
Concubine Qin,

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,000
but do not let it cloud your judgment.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,040
The first trimester is critical.
Use the utmost caution.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Since you are unwell,

21
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,680
cease these idle thoughts.

22
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,280
Focus on rest and inner peace.

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,190
General, you have been toiling all day.

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
I have personally prepared

25
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,910
some chicken soup for you.

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
Leave it there.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,360
Is there anything else?

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,560
I am here at your command.

29
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,520
No need. You may leave.

30
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,990
Last time...

31
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,680
You favored Concubine Qin
in the study

32
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,960
last time, didn't you?

33
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,470
Why am I any different?

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,280
General, look at me.

35
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,000
I am not inferior to her in the least.

36
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,710
General!

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Have you no shame?

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,400
In broad daylight!

39
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,430
General!

40
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,030

What are you doing?

00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
You're my wife.

43
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,750
What do you think I'm doing?

44
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,120
You used to neglect both concubines.

45
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,960
But since you've favored Concubine Qin,

46
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,910
why not add Concubine Tang to the mix?

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,000
Why use me as your shield against her?

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,000
Is Concubine Qin your
only favorite, or are you

49
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,910

for Concubine Qin?

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
That sounds like

68
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,210
you are jealous.

but I do not?

76
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,800
Why does he favor them both,

77
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
yet deliberately shun me?

78
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,320
Why?

79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,040
I am his concubine too!

80
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,190
Shen Yaochu claims to be on my side,

81
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,720
yet she keeps him all to herself!

82
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,350
Ma'am.

83
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,390
Tang, why such a temper?

84
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,830
Instead of watching me, you should

85
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,680
worry about Her Ladyship.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,630
She and the General are inseparable now.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,120
Once she bears him a child,

88
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,240
your child will amount to nothing.

89
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,120
Shen is the Principal Wife.

90
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,120
You and I are merely concubines.

91
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,920
No matter our schemes

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,070
or the children we bear,

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,200
they are nothing

94
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,870
next to a legitimate heir.

95
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
What are you getting at?

96
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,070
Tang,

97
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,870
we have had only each other
to lean on in this manor.

98
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,120
Our bond

99
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,430
goes deeper than words.

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,720
Misunderstandings aside,

101
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,190
a common enemy now looms.

102
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,000
Why not bury the hatchet

103
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,270
and fight side by side?

104
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,510
You see the situation.

105
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,560
She is currently the favorite.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,360
Tang, are you truly content to

107
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,830
spend your life beneath her thumb?

108
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,150
Fine.

109
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,600
Once Shen is out of the way,

110
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,920
let our wits decide our fate.

111
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,350
Good.

112
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,400
It's a deal.

113
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,480
I shall take my leave.

114
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,730
Ma'am,

115
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,600
do you believe what she said?

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,160
She has crossed you before.

117
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,720
She is a plotter,

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,070
but I am no fool.

119
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,870
I am vulnerable now

120
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,510
and must seek allies.

121
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,310
Since we share the same rank,

122
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,750
she is my best option for now.

123
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,630
Why is your morning sickness so severe?

124
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,160
Have you seen a physician?

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,680
Yes, and I've been taking

126
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,510
the prescribed medicine.

127
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,950
But for some reason,

128
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,390
I still feel nauseous.

129
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
I can hardly keep anything down.

130
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,310
Tell your private kitchen
be more attentive.

131
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,360
Have them prepare whatever you crave.

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,830
We only have one cook.

133
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,510
No matter the dish,

134
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,040
the flavor never changes.

135
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,640
Oh, right.

136
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,920
I once tasted a pastry
made by Her Ladyship.

137
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,070
It was delicious!

138
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,750
Your Ladyship, that's amazing.

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,920
I would love to have a taste.

140
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
May I ask you to cook it for me?

141
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,520
After all,

142
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,190
you are this child's legal mother.

143
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,080
Me?

144
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,000
The lineage is everything.

145
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,800
As the Principal Wife,

146
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,600
it is your duty to ensure
the Li bloodline prospers.

147
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,720
It's just a bit of cooking.

148
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,120
I appreciate it, Old Madam.

149
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,830
What say you, Your Ladyship?

150
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,670
Very well.

151
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,430
But a pregnant woman's diet

152
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,630
is of utmost importance.

153
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,750
If someone were to tamper

154
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,870
with my dishes

155
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,270
and harm the fetus,

156
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,510
would I not be branded a child-killer?

157
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,120
The Li household is strictly governed.

158
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,030
Such a thing would never happen.

159
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,670
Yes, Old Madam.

160
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,150
But one must always guard against mishaps.

161
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,680
How about this?

162
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,600
When I cook,

163
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,480
you supervise from my side.

164
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,000
From picking the ingredients

165
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,550
to Concubine Qin tasting the final dish,

166
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,800
you shall witness it all.

167
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,390
Only then can the food be truly safe.

168
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,120
As the matriarch,

169
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,440
am I expected to be with
my son's concubine all day?

170
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,200
As the Principal Wife,

171
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,310
am I expected to

172
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
cook for your son's concubine all day?

173
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,960
Insolence!

174
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,750
The capital is full of renowned chefs,

175
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,510
yet you insist I cook for her.

176
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,150
Your intentions are as plain as day.

177
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,150
Sorry, I...

178
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,200
overstepped.

179
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,320
Old Madam, please do not be angered.

180
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,840
That was your brilliant plan?

181
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
She didn't take the bait. What can I do?

182
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,390
Reading?

183
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,680
What a scholar.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,720
What brings you here today?

185
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,200
Shouldn't you be with Concubine Qin?

186
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,360
And why would I be there?

187
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,960
She's carrying your child.

188
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,750
You ought to show her more care.

189
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,510
That sounds quite jealous,

190
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,870
My Lady.

191
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,270
I am the Principal Wife.

192
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,910
I should be magnanimous.

193
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,030
Don't flatter yourself, General.

194
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,320
Let us hope so.

195
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,780
So, you're not flattering yourself.

196
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,390
You're just far too promiscuous.

197
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,350
Did you have arsenic for lunch?

198
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,870
Your tongue is remarkably sharp.

199
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,040
My Pleasure.

200
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,390
Have less arsenic.
It's bad for your health.

201
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,390
My Lady!

202
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,390
My Lady,

203
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,000
Concubine Qin had a nightmare.

204
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,480
She claims something foul is afoot

205
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,670
and has woken the whole house.

206
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,200
Let her make a scene if she wishes.

207
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,510
My Lady,

208
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,840
should we go and see?

209
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,380
Why bother?

210
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,120
She can fuss all she wants.
I'm going to sleep.

211
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,630
What happened now?

212
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,200
Old Madam,

213
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,600
I have nightmares every night

214
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,440
and I feel unwell.

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
Last night...

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,390
Last night, I saw

217
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,200
a shadow drifting past my window.

218
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,630
I was petrified.

219
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,200
Nonsense.

220
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,510
Perhaps someone brought

221
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,390
something sinister into the residence.

222
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,240
For the sake of my child,

223
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,390
could we invite a Taoist priest?

224
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,840
It's also for your safety, Old Madam.

225
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,320
Alright.

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,200
Thank you, Old Madam.

227
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,030
(What are they brewing this time?)

228
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,940
My Lady,

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,030
Concubine Qin must be
up to something again.

230
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,910
She even roused the entire household.

231
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,790
Let her play her games.

232
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,870
The more she stirs, the more she trips.

233
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,600
And then, I have her.

234
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,670
Could Concubine Qin truly
be plagued by something sinister?

235
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,150
I heard the peach tree in her garden

236
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,870
has mysteriously withered for no reason.

237
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,110
Go take a look.

238
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,800
Yes.

239
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,000
Old Madam,

240
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,790
this manor is vast.

241
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,390
We must dip willow branches
in the talisman water

242
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,840
and sprinkle some in every room.

243
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,910
Only then can
these evil spirits be driven out.

244
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,670
Tell the maids to start sprinkling.

245
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,230
Yes.
