1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,259
What? She confessed
her feelings for you?

2
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:04,549
(Based on a webtoon on Naver,
"Pop Out Boy" by Nimni)

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,879
So? What did you tell her?

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:09,880
I told her
that there's someone I like.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,800
Did you run all the way here...

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:16,300
to tell me that?

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,260
(Pop Out Boy, Episode 6)

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,710
Yes.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,670
- Aren't you going home?
- Yes.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,879
I am.

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,710
My gosh, Matilda confessed
her feelings for Ye Joon,

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,840
but he has feelings
for someone else.

13
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,549
Anyhow, I can't believe you're all
on the same team except for me.

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,590
You're on our team too?

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,090
I've already told you I can't come
today because of my photoshoot.

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,340
And I've told you that
you have to do the research instead.

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,759
When did this conversation happen?

18
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,880
In the group chat.

19
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,799
Holding on to a 2G phone...

20
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,010
in this day and age
makes one incredibly lonely.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,049
We have to come up with a proposal
for a new app?

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,590
Come and sit here, will you?

23
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:25,299
- What is an app?
- An application.

24
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,010
YouTube and Instagram.

25
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,879
They're all mobile applications.

26
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,590
I see. Then is this an app too?

27
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:35,799
Turn that off at once.

28
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:38,129
I didn't bring my charger,
so I can't waste my battery.

29
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,549
I'll lend you mine.

30
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:44,959
It doesn't work for my phone.

31
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,209
How about an app that analyzes
the language of pets?

32
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,299
We can gather data on dogs' barks,
body language, and so on.

33
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,049
That's a good idea.

34
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,049
I have a cat.

35
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:01,590
There are many moments when I want
to know what my cat is thinking.

36
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,840
- I can relate to that.
- You have a cat too?

37
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:08,800
No.

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,509
I want to know
what my dear Seon Nyeo is thinking.

39
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:15,009
Am I your pet?

40
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,379
I actually had a similar idea.

41
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,590
You're even stealing my idea now?
After stealing Cheon Nam Ho from me?

42
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,669
No.

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,800
I guess we were
on the same wavelength.

44
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:33,210
Shall we take a quick break?

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,300
I'll surprise you at home later.
Look forward to it.

46
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,550
Okay.

47
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,710
"At home"?

48
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,710
Look forward to what?

49
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,340
I struggled to hold myself back.

50
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:51,340
Me too.

51
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:05,629
I'll make super spicy tteokbokki
for you.

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,050
I bought the special hot sauce
yesterday.

53
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,629
The spicier, the better. Thanks!

54
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,050
I can't believe this.

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,050
What did you want to talk about?

56
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:17,129
Why did you want to meet here?

57
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,509
Can I borrow your phone
for a second?

58
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,800
I cannot let you into my heart,

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,669
but I can certainly
let you use my phone.

60
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,590
I'm sorry.
I'll get you out tomorrow.

61
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,960
What?

62
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:40,879
What are you doing?

63
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,509
I may not be able to win your heart,

64
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:46,419
but I can stop you from going over
to Seon Nyeo's place today.

65
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,379
- Hey, Yoon Yi Na!
- Sorry, Cheon Nam Joon.

66
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,340
Hey, let me out! Yoon Yi Na!

67
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,710
The phone is turned off. Please
leave a message after the tone.

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,759
What's going on?
What's taking them so long?

69
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,210
(Yoon Yi Na)

70
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,550
Where are you?

71
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:07,419
- Are you with Cheon Nam Wook...
- Han Seon Nyeo.

72
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,379
It's your turn to experience...

73
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,050
what it's like to be left alone.

74
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,379
Don't tell me she killed him.

75
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,170
I am Cheon Nam Wook.

76
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,709
Breaking down a door is a piece
of cake for this lonely fighter.

77
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,089
That hurt.

78
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,509
Cheon Nam Wook.

79
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,379
Cheon Nam Wook!

80
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,920
If he's not here,
I have no idea where he could be.

81
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,009
Hello? Cheon Nam Wook
is locked up in here!

82
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,800
Cheon Nam Wook?

83
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,920
Ms. Cat?

84
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,800
My goodness. Come out.

85
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,459
Nice catch, right?

86
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:35,209
What?

87
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,629
What was that sound just now?

88
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:41,209
What?

89
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,129
It's locked.

90
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:46,839
Is this also
the Cheon Nam Wook effect?

91
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,879
This is unreal, like right out of
a romance comic.

92
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,459
Let us out! Cheon Nam Wook is here!

93
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,670
Han Seon Nyeo too!

94
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,259
- Sir!
- Sir!

95
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,800
The phone is turned off.

96
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,339
Please leave a message
after the tone.

97
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:11,959
(Still working on the project?)

98
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,129
Still working on the project?

99
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,670
- Let's go.
- Actually,

100
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,629
take me to school instead of home.

101
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,209
Be careful, Ms. Cat.

102
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,420
If it's too hard, shall I take over?

103
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,209
I can do it.

104
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:29,759
I'm sure of it.

105
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,959
The emergency key
should be here... Gosh!

106
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:34,300
Did you hurt yourself?

107
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,129
We're locked in here,

108
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,129
and a first-aid kid appears
now that I've hurt my hand.

109
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:44,879
It's like a scene from a drama.

110
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:46,959
Is this also
the Cheon Nam Wook effect?

111
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,459
Sit down.

112
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,379
Don't you know
you should cherish your body?

113
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,300
If you're struggling,
you can let others help you.

114
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:14,129
Okay, but why are you mad at me?

115
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:18,259
Don't act all tough
and end up hurting yourself.

116
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,839
Acting tough like that
all the time...

117
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,009
is hard, and it makes you lonely.

118
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,209
(Proposal for a New Mobile App)

119
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,550
I'm at school now.
Where are you guys?

120
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,959
"You guys"? I'm at home.

121
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,839
You're at home?
But I see their bags here.

122
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,300
Seon Nyeo and Nam Wook's.

123
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:47,709
I must be going crazy.

124
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,509
What is wrong with me, seriously?

125
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:51,709
What did you do?

126
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,459
I locked Cheon Nam in the storage
by the gym and came home.

127
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,920
Gosh, what do I do?

128
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:59,339
- Should I come now?
- What did you say?

129
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,170
Who did you lock up in there?

130
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:04,759
Cheon Nam.

131
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,089
Seon Nyeo is probably
still at school looking for him.

132
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,259
- Today is Friday, right?
- Then,

133
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,920
does it mean we're stuck here
until Monday?

134
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,129
I guess so.

135
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,629
I miss Mom.

136
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,129
Me too.

137
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,340
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

138
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,210
I thought you didn't like
talking about your mom.

139
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:39,340
Well, you're right.

140
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:41,879
But I'm surprised.

141
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:44,669
You intentionally avoided asking me
about my mom all this time?

142
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,799
I can take a hint after all.

143
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,629
Is that the only hint you can take?

144
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,340
Well, anyway... Thanks for that.

145
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:04,919
Hello? Anyone inside?

146
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,340
Hello?

147
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,049
My mom and I fought even that day.

148
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:14,759
- She told me to eat breakfast,
- Eat breakfast before you go!

149
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,259
and I yelled at her saying that...

150
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,879
- I had no time.
- No! I don't want breakfast!

151
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,379
Then I went to school...

152
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:23,509
and found out
that a celebrity was trending...

153
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,960
for using the phrase,
"Like how Seon Nyeo would."

154
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,340
In a way that I absolutely hate.

155
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,299
So I thought to myself,
"Gosh, I really hate this."

156
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:34,960
"This is all Mom's fault."

157
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:36,379
Even that day, I thought that.

158
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,049
Then my HR teacher ran in during
my class and told me to pack up.

159
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,129
I went to where I was told to go,
and it was the hospital.

160
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,509
A car accident?

161
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,799
My mom passed away because of me.

162
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,960
What?

163
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,419
She passed away
while giving birth to me.

164
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:05,379
And that's why
my dad hates me so much.

165
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:07,169
Oh, right.

166
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,460
I read about it in the comic book.

167
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:15,759
Right, you must have.

168
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,799
Come to think of it, all of this
is just a fictional story,

169
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:22,379
which means it's all fake.

170
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,379
How could that be fake?

171
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:26,590
What?

172
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:29,710
You're actually heartbroken
because of it,

173
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,759
so how could it be fake?

174
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:41,960
Is there anyone that you miss
among those you left behind...

175
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,259
inside the comic book?

176
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:46,340
Your friends there, for example.

177
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,590
Or Seon Nyeo in that world.

178
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,799
I didn't have any friends.

179
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:58,509
And as for Seon Nyeo...

180
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:02,340
I like this Han Seon Nyeo better.

181
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,090
Cut it out.

182
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:13,710
Shall I...

183
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,590
- just not go back?
- What?

184
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,340
If you're suddenly gone,

185
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,799
it will feel a little weird.

186
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:42,710
- I don't think I can do this.
- You can. You're almost there.

187
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:44,509
- I am?
- Yes, just a little more.

188
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,090
- I can't do this.
- Gosh!

189
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:05,103
Han Seon Nyeo.

190
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:12,062
Noh Ye Joon.

191
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,353
How did you know I was here?

192
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,723
Hey, are you all right?

193
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:18,892
You're okay, right?

194
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:22,473
Yes, I'm fine.

195
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,272
Is Yoon Yi Na
really going insane or what?

196
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,392
Well, not insane, but...

197
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:29,892
Seon Nyeo.

198
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:32,062
Help me up.

199
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:39,473
Thanks.

200
00:12:39,562 --> 00:12:42,723
Let me walk you home.

201
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:44,772
Sure.

202
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:52,642
Want to open a tteokbokki place
with me later on?

203
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:54,522
- We'll split the profit 90-10.
- Really?

204
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,022
- So I'll take 90 percent?
- Have you no shame?

205
00:12:58,312 --> 00:12:59,473
I'll take 90 percent, of course.

206
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:08,103
I'm in a good mood today,

207
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:10,853
so I'll make an exception
and do the dishes for you.
