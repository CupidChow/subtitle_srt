1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,440
No!

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,510
What? What's wrong?

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,610
2NE1 disbanded?

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,030
I bought this phone because of 2NE1.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,160

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,560
 Wifey!

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,900
 Kitten!

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,080
What!

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
 Come out here!

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,640
Now what?

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,500
Hey, Namwook!

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,990
Namwook! Get up!

13
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,100
Namwook!

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,300
I...

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,840
nearly died of a heart attack.

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,300
Hey! I was studying and you ruined my focus!

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,520
Isn't she adorable?

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,200
She reminds me of you, Kitten.

19
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,130
Don't call me out here for something so trivial when I study!

20
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,510
It's not trivial.

21
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,610
Kittens are so adorable though.

22
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,530
Don't listen to her, kitty.

23
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,880
Can you help me with this one?

24
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,520
What?

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,330
Eleven soccer players are trying to shake hands without leaving anyone out.

26
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,270
How many times must they shake hands?

27
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,000
Why figure it out? They can count as they shake hands.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,700
Yeah.

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,690
The question is too forced, it doesn't seem solvable.

30
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,800
Right?

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,240
It makes me dizzy.

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,700
- Me too. 
 - You too?

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,750
All done.

34
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,700
Kitten? Can I ask you something?

35
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,440
What?

36
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,160
Have you always been this pretty?

37
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,300
If you bother me one more time, you're done for.

38
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,480
Oh no. I'm doomed!

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,490
- What... 
 - Hey!

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,830
Why did you just do that?

41
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:03,430
The only way I can get you to notice me is like this, Cheon Namjoon!

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,030
It's Cheon Namwook!

43
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,380
Are you pulling an all-nighter again?

44
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,010
Yup.

45
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,100
Thanks to someone and his Namwook effect on Ina.

46
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,470
Hmm... Who could that be?

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,700
I have no idea.

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,250
Still, you can't stay up all night.

49
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,390
Get some rest.

50
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,730
It's not that I'm not sleeping. I can't!

51
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,360
You take it easy, all right?

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,870
Why do you work so hard at school?

53
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,370
It's intriguing.

54
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,730
The Sunnyeo I know did just enough.

55
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,630
Like Sunnyeo.

56
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,190
To you and your Sunnyeo, I'm sure good grades don't matter.

57
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,420
You'll forever be 18 in your comic book world.

58
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,130
That's not it.

59
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,290
I just want you to take it easy because this must be exhausting...

60
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,860
It looks like you don't understand because you're a comic book character, but...

61
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,980
My world is not like your fake one.

62
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,830
I'm focusing on my present.

63
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,790
Why are you so cold to me?

64
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,970
I couldn't care less whether you study or not but

65
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,370
don't make life difficult for me.

66
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,530
In this world, your sheer existence is a burden.

67
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,550
A burden?

68
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,740
It's not like I wanted to come here.

69
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,570
I'm here because of you!

70
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,110
That's why I let you stay,

71
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,390
feed you, put a roof over your head, and put up with how annoying you are!

72
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,860
Oh, so I should be thankful and keep quiet, huh?

73
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,650
Precisely.

74
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,740
Fine. I'm sorry I failed to see it before.

75
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,740
  My world is not like your fake one.

76
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,550
  In this world, your sheer existence is a burden.

77
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,680

78
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,890
It was all planned out, huh?

79
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,230
Everything I've ever known

80
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,680
was all made up.

81
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,470
  Coming to terms with his reality,

82
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,850
  Namwook couldn't sleep that night.

83
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,200
Namwook?

84
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,340
I was too hard on you last night.

85
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,140
I'm really sorry.

86
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,550
I hope he forgives me if I say that.

87
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,750
Namwook?

88
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,100
I'll leave first.

89
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,290
Okay... All right.

90
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,520
He's not here?

91
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,940
- But he left before me. 
 - What do you mean?

92
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,890
Why? Did you guys argue?

93
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,650
Sunnyeo.

94
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,610
I'm really sorry I poured water all over your notebook yesterday.

95
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,870
What's all this?

96
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,480
I'm not trying to call it even with this.

97
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,760
It's just my way of saying sorry.

98
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,560
I don't know what's gotten into me lately.

99
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm really sorry.

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,270
It's okay.

101
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,890
Thank you.

102
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,290
Thanks, Sunnyeo.

103
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,420
Namwook! Where were you today?

104
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,510
What is this?

105
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,880
Are these notes for me?

106
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,430
Yeah.

107
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,140
Thank you.

108
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,410
Did you eat?

109
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,600
Want me to take you out?

110
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,910
Is this some sort of strike?

111
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,000
Hi.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,830
Hey.

113
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,700
Namwook.

114
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,450
Hi.

115
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,580
He ignored me.

116
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,220
Is everything all right?

117
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,080
It's nothing.

118
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,710
I'm going to the school store.

119
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,260
You don't look fine.

120
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,150
The thing is, I know I messed up

121
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,020
so I tried to apologize.

122
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,480
But he won't talk to you at all?

123
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,650
Why did I like the Sunnyeo in the comic book?

124
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,940
In the comic book?

125
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,530
When people threw flour at Sunnyeo,

126
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,480
you rescued her from them and fell for her.

127
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,020
I did?

128
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,080
Here it is.

129
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,430
You saved her and gloated for helping her out,

130
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,690
saying she gave life meaning.

131
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,620
I know. Why did I say that?

132
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,570
The comic book Sunnyeo is very clumsy and very needy,

133
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,640
and you liked being there for her, right?

134
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,090
I thought I took care of her because I liked her.

135
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,710
This doesn't seem right.

136
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,630
That's what happens in the comic book.

137
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,350
- I don't get it. 
 - I see.

138
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,500
You're starting to like the real Sunnyeo over the one you knew, huh?

139
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,010
What did you argue about?

140
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,800
She said my sheer existence is a burden.

141
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,430
That was harsh.

142
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,600
She may say harsh things but she's not a terrible person.

143
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,070
Right?

144
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,300
But a bit mean.

145
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,070
Can't argue with that.

146
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,930
Should I get a part-time job so I'm less of a burden?

147
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,290
I do know of a high-paying gig with great hours.

148
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,380
I'm so sorry.

149
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,630
I didn't mean to hurt you.

150
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,140
I shouldn't have said that.

151
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,110
You're the cutest when you...

152
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,900
Eww, so gross.

153
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,750
No.

154
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,200
That's the least I can do to get him to forgive me.

155
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:18,030

156
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,670
Have some chocolate and stay strong, wifey!

157
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,130
Are you insane?

158
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,740
What?

159
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,160
Sunnyeo, are you okay?

160
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,690
This is all I get? Chocolate and a drink?

161
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,660
- What do you mean? 
 - Repay for passing the audition.

162
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,130
I went over your lines with you.

163
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,280
Shouldn't you congratulate me before saying that?

164
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,370
Don't you have lines to memorize?

165
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,730
Yeah.

166
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,300
I think I have to quit school.

167
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,610
Huh? Then, why are you here?

168
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,540
Sunnyeo, acting is like studying.

169
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,040
I'm here to analyze my script.

170
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,690
Why? You can't practice your lines here.

171
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,890
Do you hate it that much I'm here?

172
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,140
Not that much.

173
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,820
- Where's Minjung? 
 - Art lesson.

174
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,980
And Namwook?

175
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,680
I don't know.

176
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,040
I hope he's not having a pity party because we didn't go after him.

177
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,200

178
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,630
Minjung! Where'd you find that demigod?

179
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,660
- What are you saying? 
 - Half man, half god.

180
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,340
Hence a demigod.

181
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,690
 Message me when you get in.

182
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,290
Okay. Yejoon?

183
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,410
 What, Han Sunnyeo?

184
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,930
Congrats.

185
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:05,456

186
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
  Are you all right?

187
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,680
Namwook?

188
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,770
Are you okay to walk here?

189
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,780
Should we go around?

190
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,540
Sunnyeo!

191
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,930
I'm over...

192
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,260
my fear of cats!

193
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,210
- That's so Sunnyeo-like. 
 - What?

194
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,160
That's in a good way.

195
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,510
Take my hand if you're scared.

196
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,530
No thanks. Do you think I'll get scared over...

197
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,620
some silly cats!

198
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,640
Then, do you mind if I hold your hand?

199
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm scared.

200
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:11,560
Well, I suppose.

201
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,530
You're so different from the Sunnyeo I knew back home.

202
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,480
I mean that in a good way.

203
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,590
Thanks.

204
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,640
And I'm really sorry.

205
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,670
I'm sorry, too.

206
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,980
And... thanks.

207
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,110
I know why you're sorry but why are you thanking me?

208
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,810
  Today, I had a part-time job.

209
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,220
Don't move. Don't move a muscle.

210
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,670
Don't move. Stop. Right.

211
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,360
Put your arm up slightly. There you go!

212
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,320
Are you from the Louvre Museum or something?

213
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,850
You're like a work of art!

214
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,180
  After it was over, I felt myself again

215
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,500
  because I could finally move.

216
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,460
-   Good work today.   
 - Thank you!

217
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,240
- Would you like to do it again? 
 - Pardon?

218
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,770
Your proportions are like a work of art.

219
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,320
I thought you popped out of a comic book.

220
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,980
Oh. Actually, no thank you.

221
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,570
  Come to think of it,

222
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,560
  in the comic book,

223
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,120
  I was never able to move on my own accord.

224
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,390
  But out here for the first time ever, I can move to my heart's desire

225
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,460
  because you brought me here.

226
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,060
  Namwook told himself he'd one day surely

227
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,980
  tell Sunnyeo all this.

228
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,900
What are you thanking me for?

229
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,130
For lots of things.

230
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,080
Come on.

231
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,300
For giving up your wings to come down to earth for me.

232
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,900
You too, Sunnyeo.

233
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,970
Me too what?

234
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,220
You're the cutest when you smile.

235
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,620
You read it already?

236
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,480
"You're the cutest when you smile, Namwook.

237
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,210
So will you forgive me and smile for me?"

238
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,750
Don't read it in front of me!

239
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,240
"Because it was sunny, because it was cloudy,

240
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,990
because it just was,

241
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,080
yet not one day with you felt mundane."

242
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,070
Darn it! I only wrote it so you wouldn't be mad at me!

243
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,070
It worked.

244
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,290
I'm better now.

245
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,670
That's good to know.

246
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,490
It's so touching.

247
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,000
Should I read it again?

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,190
Stop it!

249
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,080
Oh, fine.

250
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,470
Where'd it go?

251
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,550
What?

252
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,930
You're pulling a prank on me, huh?

253
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,370
It's gone...

254
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,970
What's gone?

255
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,990
The comic books.

256
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,580
What?

257
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,742
-   You're good.  
 - Thank you.

258
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:18,000
  I can tell you practiced a lot.

259
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,470
  Have you ever had a crush?

260
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,940
Yes.

261
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,730
  What are you like in real life?

262
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,730
  If you have feelings for someone just like the guy in the script,

263
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,110
  do you let your feelings show?

264
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,980
I tend to try and not show how I feel.

265
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:49,150
I wouldn't want things to get awkward.

266
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:55,590
I would normally take my time to let her know,

267
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,550
so it doesn't get weird.

268
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,170
  But what if you lose her to someone else?

269
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,870
Then, I'd have to tell her.

270
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,920
I wouldn't want to lose her.
