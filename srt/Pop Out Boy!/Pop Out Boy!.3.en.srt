1
00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:03,462
(Based on a webtoon on Naver,
"Pop Out Boy" by Nimni)

2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,717
Seon Nyeo desperately hoped...

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:14,014
to be alone, surrounded only by
peace and quiet...

4
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:15,432
when she opened her eyes.

5
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,064
What the... Why didn't it work?

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,152
No!

7
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:29,905
Hey!

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,865
Why are you still here?

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,033
You said a kiss
would make you disappear.

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,245
I never said it was a given.
It was just my best guess.

11
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,287
Darn it!

12
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,832
(Pop Out Boy, Episode 3)

13
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,502
We need to find another way.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,088
But a kiss is the only thing
that makes sense.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,382
I get it.

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,718
Maybe it only works
if it's an act of mutual love?

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,264
Kissing you was bad enough.
Are you saying I need to mean it?

18
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,432
I need to try everything I can
to get back into the cartoon.

19
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,768
Deep down inside,

20
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,479
you want to keep me here.
Don't you, Ms. Cat?

21
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,647
- What?
- What?

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,403
What are you two doing?

23
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,782
"My heart is a fool."

24
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,618
"It only beats for one person."

25
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,245
"Don't come to me in my dreams."

26
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,830
- "I won't be able..."
- "I won't be able..."

27
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,790
- "to get you out of my mind."
- "to get you out of my mind."

28
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,753
I can't believe I just played out
a scene with Cheon Nam Wook.

29
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,673
Min Jung, how can you
accept this so easily?

30
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,800
Min Jung, how is it
that you know all the lines?

31
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,428
Because I've read the comic book
more than once.

32
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,931
You're exactly like
how I imagined you.

33
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,894
Still, you'd look better
with a haircut.

34
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,938
What's going on back there?

35
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,274
She's meeting her idol.

36
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,901
As if you know what a shaggy cut is.

37
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,569
Unbelievable.

38
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,530
Where are your A-pods?

39
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,825
In the trash...

40
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,119
thanks to Cheon Nam Wook.

41
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,331
What about this one?

42
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,749
I'm craving tteokbokki again.

43
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,834
Of course.
It's sweet like chocolate, right?

44
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,086
"I can't be friends
with you anymore."

45
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,256
"Actually, I won't."

46
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,718
"I want to constantly be with you."

47
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,764
"And I always think of you
when we're apart."

48
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,017
"What I feel for you
isn't friendship."

49
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,812
Oh, no. This is a mess.

50
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,108
- When's the audition again?
- Next week.

51
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,486
Your natural speech
is just fine though.

52
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,657
Don't think of it as acting
and talk like you normally would.

53
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,617
- Relax a bit too.
- Relax?

54
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,371
Can I give it a shot?

55
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,458
Be my guest.

56
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,509
"I can't be friends
with you anymore."

57
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,053
"Actually, I won't."

58
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,848
"I want to constantly be with you."

59
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,184
"And I always think of you
when we're apart."

60
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,606
"What I feel for you
isn't friendship."

61
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:12,901
Unbelievable!

62
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,904
- I just fell for you a little bit.
- Really? Was I good?

63
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,156
How do you feel about
an acting career?

64
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,535
You should.
It's like you were born for this.

65
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,454
Show yourself, Jungkook!

66
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,084
No?

67
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,545
I'll keep at it
until one of you show up.

68
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,257
Park Bo Gum!

69
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,554
If only my acting
was as good as Park Bo Gum's.

70
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,974
Why don't you take up
comedy instead?

71
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,101
You could be a success.

72
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,811
Kim Min Gue!

73
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,647
Seon Nyeo, I need your help.

74
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,149
With what?

75
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,985
Can you read some lines with me
on Saturday?

76
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,362
Sure.

77
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,742
I really want to do well.

78
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,996
It's not like you're new at this.

79
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,584
Being a model for three years
counts as acting experience.

80
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,470
Wife, here you are.

81
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,055
Wife?

82
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,432
- Don't call me that...
- You two.

83
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,851
When did this happen
between you two?

84
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,521
- It didn't...
- Seon Nyeo.

85
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,440
Who are you to steal
Cheon Nam away from me?

86
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,777
You got his name wrong.

87
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,862
It's Cheon Nam Wook, not Cheon Nam.

88
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,198
You stay close to me, Cheon Nam.

89
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,659
What are you doing?

90
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,329
This is great.
I couldn't be more grateful.

91
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,999
What the...

92
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,503
Why were our arms locked?

93
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,921
You initiated it.

94
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:57,631
Gosh, I'm sorry.

95
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,639
Is this the Cheon Nam Wook Effect?

96
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,559
Sweet!

97
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,688
The Cheon Nam Wook Effect.

98
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,858
That's what made
Yoon Yi Na act that way.

99
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,818
I have no idea.

100
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,236
Is there anything you actually know?

101
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,905
All I know about is...

102
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:23,949
you, Seon Nyeo.

103
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,165
Look at you enjoying this.

104
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,169
Didn't you have it yesterday too?

105
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,881
You see, I got this new roommate...

106
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,092
who has been driving me crazy
with his antics.

107
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,137
So you're stress-eating?

108
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,456
Ms. Cat, what is it?

109
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,168
You're still here?

110
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,921
Why are you still here?
It's been days!

111
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,088
And the exact number of days is...

112
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,091
Please tell me
that this is a nightmare.

113
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,010
I'm dreaming all of this, aren't I?

114
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,845
Tell me that this is all in my head.

115
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,347
What...

116
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,974
- do you mean by that?
- There's a chance...

117
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,310
you might be stuck in this world.

118
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,103
Will you keep on living here?

119
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,647
Why think so negatively?

120
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:37,981
It isn't like
how Seon Nyeo would think.

121
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,567
Don't you dare say it like that.

122
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:44,196
Don't associate my name
with being hopelessly optimistic...

123
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,948
because it deserves better.

124
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:50,160
Also, I'm not being negative.
This is me being real and logical.

125
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,412
- You'll be lonely to live alone.
- On the contrary.

126
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,705
It's so nice and comfortable.

127
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,835
It's dangerous for a girl
to live alone, so I can protect you.

128
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,963
Maybe I should demonstrate
my jiujitsu skills.

129
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,590
Is it really a bummer
to live with me?

130
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,592
Do you think I enjoyed this?

131
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,969
My goodness.

132
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,639
I'm one of the best kind
of roommate there is.

133
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:12,975
My pretty face says it all.

134
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,854
This is exactly
what makes you annoying.

135
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,982
All right, fine. I'll cut it out.

136
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,567
That's not all.

137
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:27,948
It's all...

138
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,701
inevitable.

139
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,081
Why won't you sleep at night?

140
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,083
Because I don't sleep.

141
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,878
I never did in the cartoon I'm in.

142
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,045
Hey.

143
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,673
Then find a way
to stay up all night quietly...

144
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,384
instead of waking me up like this.

145
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,344
Also...

146
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,889
Hey.

147
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,100
- Can you feed the cat elsewhere?
- Why?

148
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,729
Because I'm afraid of cats.

149
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,690
Ms. Cat is afraid of cats?

150
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,609
That's unexpected.

151
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,988
Won't you grow fond of them
once you get to know them?

152
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,281
Don't make me repeat myself.

153
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,450
It's like this.

154
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,410
I have no intention of continuing...

155
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,995
this awkward cohabitation...

156
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,413
with someone
that I don't get along with,

157
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,333
that I don't like,
and that doesn't pay rent.

158
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,419
I'm sorry. I'll do better.

159
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,173
Don't bother. I don't believe
that people can change.

160
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,050
Then what?

161
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,885
I've no money,

162
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,054
so how will I live on my own?

163
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,265
I'm not telling you
to move out right now.

164
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,019
Forget it.
We'll talk again some other time.

165
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,772
Where are you off to?

166
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,024
What I do on weekends
is none of your business.

167
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,195
What if she kicks me out?

168
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,248
The mood isn't right.

169
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,508
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing it properly.

170
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,098
"What else can it be then?"

171
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,975
"We're friends,
so it's a friendship."

172
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,444
"How about now?"

173
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,865
"Do you still see me
as just a friend?"

174
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,624
Why are you so much better
all of a sudden?

175
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,128
I am always this good.
I'm experienced, remember?

176
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,672
What? You're still not good enough
to boast about it though.

177
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,758
- Shall we call it a day then?
- Sure.

178
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,470
Wait. Are these the new A-pod Pros?

179
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,764
The ones you had
were fairly new too.

180
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:58,891
What I buy is up to me.

181
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,476
Lucky you.

182
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,271
If it weren't for Cheon Nam Wook...

183
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,319
Would you like my old ones?

184
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,238
What? No way. Really?

185
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,199
Take them.

186
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,951
Sweet!

187
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,996
Seriously? You've never been one
to give me anything.

188
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,499
How about some tteokbokki?

189
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,585
I was actually craving for some.

190
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,128
When are you not?

191
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,298
Wait, I don't think I can today.

192
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,593
I have a few things to do.

193
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,553
The offer is only valid for today.

194
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,015
You gave me this, so I'm good.

195
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,768
Seon Nyeo.

196
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,728
Yes?

197
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,230
At your place...

198
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,191
What about my place?

199
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,944
Has Cheon Nam Wook been there?

200
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,698
Yes, he has. Why do you ask?

201
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,827
Just watch your back.
It could get dangerous.

202
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,038
Cheon Nam Wook can be dangerous?

203
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,792
I guess he can if you consider
the amount of stress he's giving me.

204
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:18,762
Ms. Cat, you're home.

205
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,266
What on earth?

206
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,475
I did some chores.

207
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,270
I did the laundry
and made tteokbokki...

208
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,485
No one asked you to do this!

209
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,988
What? Sorry.

210
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,073
I just wanted to be of help.

211
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,325
Let me help.

212
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,454
Then just get lost.

213
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,249
That's how you can help me.

214
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,215
How could she?

215
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,884
Did she finally kick you out?

216
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,553
You held out
longer than I expected.

217
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,680
(Designer of the Month:
Jeon Hui Suk)

218
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,810
Why are you here though?

219
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,771
Oh, you must be here for a haircut.

220
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,858
No. Not mine, but yours.

221
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:14,985
What? No!

222
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,279
You can't trim away my pride.

223
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,741
You need a haircut if you wish
to stay at Seon Nyeo's house.

224
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,368
Why is that?
Does she like men with shorter hair?

225
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:27,331
No, but the style you have
isn't liked by anyone.

226
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,211
You know what? I need to get home.

227
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,798
Seon Nyeo must be
worried about me by now.

228
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,760
Is he gone?

229
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,138
Is he really gone?

230
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,853
It's quieter now.

231
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:56,443
Nice! Oh, yes!

232
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,239
Tell me how you'd
like your hair and...

233
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,532
Excuse me, over here!

234
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,741
Just a second, sir.

235
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,581
Whatever he says,
make sure his hair looks like this.

236
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,585
Extra will be charged
for the overall styling.

237
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:14,670
Are you paying?

238
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,672
Please don't worry about that.

239
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,508
I'm here today
with my mom's credit card.

240
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,386
- I'm at your service.
- I thank you in advance.

241
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,221
- Me too.
- The hair we were given...

242
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,639
is sacred by all means.

243
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,350
- When I join the military, I'll...
- Hold still, sir.

244
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,185
No, my sideburns!

245
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,397
Please don't trim them.
You're hurting my pride.

246
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,483
(Cheon Nam Wook)

247
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,568
Where are you?

248
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,903
Was I a bit harsh?

249
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,740
Could he be causing
trouble somewhere?

250
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,795
You always order in your meals.

251
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,673
I made this with love, Ms. Cat.

252
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,592
Now I feel guilty.

253
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,387
Tteokbokki topped with a fried egg?

254
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,397
Darn, that's good!

255
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,401
(Cheon Nam Wook)

256
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,444
At the front gate.

257
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,840
Ms. Cat.

258
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,176
What are you doing out here?

259
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,806
I thought you were
waiting out here all this time.

260
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,352
How's my hair?

261
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,646
Finally, you look like
you're from this century.

262
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:04,863
It looks good on you.

263
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,199
Really?

264
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,744
That being said,

265
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,749
could you perhaps
make more of your tteokbokki?

266
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,169
Is that why you came looking for me?

267
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,423
I'm sorry about before.

268
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,470
(Han Seon Nyeo)

269
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,555
Have you had dinner?

270
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,184
I was in the neighborhood,
and I bought some tteokbokki.

271
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:35,978
Should I leave it at the door?

272
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,813
- You'll make it, right?
- No.

273
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,023
- Why not?
- I'm still upset.

274
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,442
But I apologized earlier.

275
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:45,028
- Choose. Is it me or tteokbokki?
- Tteokbokki.

276
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,446
Am I that worthless to you?

277
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,031
Just make some more for me.

278
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,000
- Ms. Cat, the pot mat.
- The mat?

279
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:03,589
Fork.

280
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,719
- At this moment though...
- Are you kidding me?

281
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,304
Seon Nyeo and Nam Wook
had no idea...

282
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,308
that she only had a few days left...

283
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,478
to enjoy the tteokbokki he makes.

284
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,150
It's too much for you.

285
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,777
Right, but stick to that side.

286
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,988
- My fork was first.
- No, mine was.

287
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,326
Whatever.

288
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,953
And sometimes, accidents...

289
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,997
("Seon Nyeo and Nam Wook")

290
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,457
lead to great discoveries.

291
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,499
What on earth?

292
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,504
Your roof must be leaking.

293
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,218
Are you and the comic book
connected in some way?

294
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:53,722
My scar has been healing.

295
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:57,309
No way. Because the page
was stuck back together?

296
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,062
You're a genius!

297
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,357
Nice!
