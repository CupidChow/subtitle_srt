1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,960
   

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,570
 Sunnyeo desperately wished 

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,490
 when she opened her eyes, 

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,200
 she'd be in quiet solitude,  

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,740
 all alone. 

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,900
What the... Why didn't it work?

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,100
Hey! Why are you still here?

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,900
Why? You said the kiss would work!

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,280
I didn't say it would. I said it might.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,030
   
   

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,580
There's got to be another way.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,980
The kiss should've worked.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,510
I know!

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,690
Maybe we have to kiss after falling in love!

15
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,060
I don't want to kiss you at all! What do you mean love?

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,490
We have to do whatever it takes so I can go back.

17
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,680
I knew it.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,410
You don't want me to go back to the comic book, huh, Kitten?

19
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,450
What?

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,350
What are you guys doing?

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,610
My heart is a fool.

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,370
So it only beats for one person.

23
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,450
Stop returning to my dreams!

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,490
It makes me worried.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,540
I can't believe I'm saying lines with the real Namwook!

26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,430
Minjung! How is it so easy for you to accept?

27
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,740
Minjung, how did you memorize all that?

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,780
I've read "Sunnyeo and Namwook" numerous times, that's why.

29
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,720
You're exactly how I imagined.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,620
But you'd be even hotter if you cut your hair.

31
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,980
What are they doing?

32
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,080
Having a fanmeeting?

33
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,170
Where's your A-pod?

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,700
In the trash, thanks to Namwook.

35
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,470
I'm craving tteokbokki again.

36
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,080
I can't be friends with you anymore.

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,050
In fact, I won't!

38
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,920
When we're together, I don't want to leave your side.

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,210
And when we're apart, I can't stop thinking about you.

40
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,390
We...

41
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,480
We can't be friends like this!

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,900
Oh no...

43
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,440
What am I going to do with you?

44
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,150
When is the audition?

45
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,020
Next week.

46
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,490
Hey! Normally, you're so good with words.

47
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,310
Yejoon, stop trying to act. Just read it naturally.

48
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,350
Stop forcing it.

49
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,280
Stop forcing it?

50
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,240
Mind if I try?

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,030
If you want.

52
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,560
I can't be friends with you anymore.

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,840
I won't!

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,950
When we're together, I don't want to leave your side.

55
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,820
And when we're apart, I can't stop thinking about you.

56
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,160
We can't be friends like this.

57
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,940
Wow! Unbelievable!

58
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,290
I almost fell in love just now!

59
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,740
You mean it? Was I good?

60
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,770
Ever considered becoming an actor? Seriously.

61
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,700
- A little. 
 - No, he should come out good.

62
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,960
Come out, Jungkook!

63
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,240
No?

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,430
Fine. I won't stop until I get someone!

65
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,860
Park Bogum!

66
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,040
I wish I could act as well as Park Bogum.

67
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,720
Why don't you try being a comedian instead?

68
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,520
You would be a hit.

69
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,250
Kim Minkyu!

70
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,790
Sunnyeo, help me out.

71
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,060
With what?

72
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,060
Can you help me with my lines this Saturday?

73
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,720
Sure.

74
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,330
I want this to go well.

75
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,990
This isn't your first time acting.

76
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,290
You've been modeling for three years.

77
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,420
That's acting, too.

78
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,780
Wifey! There you are!

79
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,220
Wifey?

80
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,910
- I told you not to call me that... 
 - Since when...

81
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,760
were you two so close?

82
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,950
- We aren't... 
 - Sunnyeo!

83
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,480
Who do you think you are to take Namhee from me?

84
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,540
Listen. That's not his name.

85
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,780
It's not Cheon Namhee, it's Cheon Namwook.

86
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,400
Don't leave my side, Cheon Namhee.

87
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,480
What is the meaning of this?

88
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,190
Good riddance. Thanks.

89
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,720
Oh my!

90
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,580
Why are we linking arms?

91
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,320
You did that.

92
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,300
Sorry!

93
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,370
This must be the Namwook effect.

94
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,500
Can't get better than this!

95
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,890
The Namwook effect

96
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,420
is why Ina did that, right?

97
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,800
I have no clue.

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,320
Do you know anything at all?

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,680
What I do know is my...

100
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,450
feelings for you.

101
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,970
You really love it, huh?

102
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,170
You had some yesterday, too.

103
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,930
Tteokbokki, I mean.

104
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,960
I got a roommate out of the blue

105
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,020
but we don't get along and he stressed me out to no end.

106
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,040
You eat tteokbokki when you're stressed out, huh?

107
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,250
Kitten, what's wrong?

108
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,080
You're still here.

109
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,660
You're always around! Do you know how long it's been?

110
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,270
How long? Let's see...

111
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,020
Please tell me I'm dreaming. What? I'm dreaming, right?

112
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a dream, right? It's got to be.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,900
What... What do you mean?

114
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,360
You might not be able to return to the comic book.

115
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,100
You plan on living with me forever?

116
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,520
Don't be so pessimistic. That's not very Sunnyeo-like.

117
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,730
I told you not to say that.

118
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,180
Calling dumb blind faith "like Sunnyeo" isn't how I want my name used.

119
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,940
Besides, that wasn't pessimistic. It was realistic, logical.

120
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,510
Living alone is lonely, Kitten.

121
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,890
No, it's convenient. I love it.

122
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,190
It's dangerous for a woman to be living alone.

123
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,470
I can protect you.

124
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,430
Want me to show you my jujitsu moves again?

125
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,170
Do you hate living with me that much?

126
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,260
Do you think I enjoy this?

127
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,550
Don't I make the best roommate though?!

128
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,710
Starting with my looks.

129
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,290
This is exactly why I hate living with you.

130
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,130
Fine. I won't do it anymore.

131
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,350
There's more.

132
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,500
  All that happened  

133
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,060
  was meant to be.  

134
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,450
Why don't you sleep at night?

135
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,450
I never sleep.

136
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,890
I've never slept in the comic book either.

137
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,760
 Hey! 

138
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,370
 If it works for you, so be it! 

139
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,030
 But why rob me of my sleep, too? 

140
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,590
There's more!

141
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,310
 Hey! 

142
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,320
 Can you feed the cats somewhere far from here? 

143
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,270
 But why? 

144
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,520
 I'm afraid of cats. 

145
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,270
 You're Kitten, and you're afraid of kittens? 

146
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,660
 Didn't see that coming. 

147
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,670
 Sunnyeo, I bet once you get to know them, you'll like them too. 

148
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,190
 Don't make me repeat myself. 

149
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,540
We're nothing alike.

150
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,130
We have nothing in common.

151
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,740
You don't pitch in with rent or do chores.

152
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,320
I don't see why I have to live with

153
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,570
a guy I don't even like, putting myself out like this.

154
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,300
Get it?

155
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,220
I'm sorry. I'll be better.

156
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,890
I doubt it.

157
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,800
I don't think people change.

158
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,470
Then, what do I do?

159
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,490
I have nothing here.

160
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,760
You want to me get out, just like that?

161
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,310
I don't mean right now.

162
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,430
Never mind. Let's continue this later.

163
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,700
Where are you going?

164
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,930
Let's respect the other's privacy on the weekends.

165
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,990
What if she kicks me out?

166
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,140
It doesn't feel real that way.

167
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,390
What are you doing? You have to make the practice seem real.

168
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,370
What do you mean?

169
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,810
I said we're just friends because we are.

170
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,900
How about now?

171
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,570
Are we still just friends?

172
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,570
How'd you get so good suddenly?

173
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,930
I've always been good. I've been at it for three years.

174
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,240
Whatever. You're not good enough to be cocky yet.

175
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,860
Let's call it a day.

176
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,510
Okay.

177
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,770
The A-pod Pro?

178
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,760
But you just got the new ones.

179
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,420
It's up to me what I buy.

180
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,170
Lucky.

181
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,090
If it wasn't for Namwook...

182
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,130
Sunnyeo, want my old ones?

183
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,540
What?

184
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,870
Whoa! Are you sure?

185
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,860
You can have them.

186
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,700
Score!

187
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,950
Yejoon, this isn't like you. I can't believe you're actually giving them to me.

188
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,950
Want to get some tteokbokki?

189
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,400
I was just craving some.

190
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,830
When do you not crave it?

191
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,490
Hey. I can't go.

192
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,880
I have something to take care of.

193
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,310
But it's today or never.

194
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,800
It's okay. You gave me these.

195
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,070
Han Sunnyeo,

196
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,850
I was wondering...

197
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,100
What about?

198
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,750
Has Namwook ever been over your house?

199
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,770
Sure he has. Why?

200
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,520
Be careful of him. He could be dangerous.

201
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,830
Him? Dangerous?

202
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,410
True. He is a threat to my sanity.

203
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,470
You're home, Kitten?

204
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,060
What are you doing?

205
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,140
I did the chores!

206
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,000
I did the laundry and made tteokbokki with the ingredients from the fridge.

207
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,500
But I didn't tell you to do this!

208
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,170
What? I'm sorry.

209
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,960
I just wanted to help out.

210
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,100
I'll help you.

211
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,190
Will you get out of my face?

212
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,110
That's the only way you can help.

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,440
She's so mean.

214
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,270
She finally kicked you out, huh?

215
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,450
You lasted longer than I expected.

216
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,960
Why are we here?

217
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,140
Are you getting your hair cut?

218
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,340
No, I'm not. You are.

219
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,320
What? No!

220
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,250
My hair is my pride and joy!

221
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,780
If you want to stay with Sunnyeo, you need to cut it.

222
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,420
But why? Does Sunnyeo like short hair?

223
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,280
No one could like your hair as it is.

224
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,500
I can't. I have to go home.

225
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,610
Sunnyeo is probably worried about me right now.

226
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,380
Did he leave?

227
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,790
Is he really gone?

228
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,570
It's so quiet.

229
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,410
Woohoo!

230
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,960
Tell me the style you want.

231
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,350
Unnie. Unnie!

232
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,360
One moment.

233
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,130
No matter what he says, please cut it like this.

234
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,330
It'll be extra for the styling.

235
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,690
Will you be paying?

236
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,340
Don't worry about that.

237
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,190
Because I have my mom's credit card.

238
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,850
- I love you, my precious client. Of course. You can count on me. 
 - I trust he's in good hands.

239
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,480
You can't change what my parents gave me!

240
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,810
- I'll enlist in the army in two years... 
 - I said don't move.

241
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,980
My sideburns!

242
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,450
Please don't touch my sideburns!

243
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,970
They're my pride and joy!

244
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,440
     

245
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,640
Maybe I was too hard on him.

246
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,410
What if he's out there causing trouble again?

247
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,840
  You're always ordering in.  

248
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,650
  I made this with love for you, Kitten!  

249
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,500
What? He's making me feel bad.

250
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,290
A fried egg with tteokbokki?

251
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,130
Unbelievable!

252
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,960
  Out front.  

253
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,800
Kitten, why are you out here?

254
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,460
I thought you were standing out front scared to come inside.

255
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,580
How do you like my hair?

256
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,510
You finally look like someone from this era.

257
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,820
It looks good.

258
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,520
You mean it?

259
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,630
I was wondering,

260
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,540
can you make me more tteokbokki?

261
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,840
That's why you came outside?

262
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,870
I'm sorry about before.

263
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,480
     

264
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,490
    

265
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,020
    

266
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,950
 You'll make it for me, right? 

267
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,890
 No way. 

268
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,900
 Why not? 

269
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,660
 I'm mad at you. 

270
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,620
 I said I was sorry. 

271
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,180
 Choose. Tteokbokki or me? 

272
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,960
  Tteokbokki.  

273
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,900
  How could you say that?  

274
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,810
  Just make me some, will you?  

275
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,150
Kitten! Trivet!

276
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,860
Trivet?

277
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,000
Fork.

278
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:11,020
  At the time, Sunnyeo and Namwook didn't realize  

279
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,040
  that soon she wouldn't be  

280
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,450
  able to eat the tteokbokki he makes her.  

281
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,090
 Don't take that one. 

282
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,740
     

283
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,640
 That one is fine. 

284
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,590
  And sometimes, the greatest discoveries...  

285
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,850
Oh!

286
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,160
  ...are made by mistake.  

287
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,740
What the...

288
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,200
I think your roof is leaking.

289
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,040
Are you and the book connected?

290
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,790
My scar's nearly healed.

291
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,060
No way. Was it because I taped the comic book up?

292
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,970
You're a genius!
