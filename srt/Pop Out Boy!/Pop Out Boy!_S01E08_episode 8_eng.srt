1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,010
Yejoon.

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,214
Do you like me?

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,692

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,486
Yeah.

5
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:14,189
I like you.

6
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,676
  Yejoon, we're ready for you.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,323
Let's talk in person.

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,375
I want to say this looking at you.

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:29,396

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,398
- Hi. 
 - Hey.

11
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:35,192
Wow! A web series lead, huh?

12
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:37,429
You look different than usual.

13
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:38,981
What are you talking about?

14
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:41,240
He looks exactly the same.

15
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:46,228
It's not what you think. I didn't bring him.

16
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:48,573
You didn't, right?

17
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:51,491
I know. I doubt you would.

18
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,777
- Hi! 
 - Hello!

19
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:54,862
- Let me help you. 
 - Thank you!

20
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:56,748
It's heavy, isn't it?

21
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:03,605
Yejoon.

22
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:06,915
You can do the scene even without the actress, right?

23
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:08,484
Yes. I'll do my best.

24
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:10,128
Okay.

25
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:11,555
Scene nine, cut ten. Take one!

26
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:13,122
  Ready?

27
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,649
  Action!

28
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:17,677
Have I been well?

29
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,305
Are you asking just for the sake of it?

30
00:01:20,305 --> 00:01:21,890
What about you?

31
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,942
Have you been well?

32
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:25,385
  Cut!

33
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,296
It's not bad, but you're confessing your feelings

34
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:31,848
so try to express the change in emotion.

35
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:34,101
- Okay! 
 - Let's try that again.

36
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:37,712
Emotion... Emotion.

37
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,125
Scene nine, cut ten. Take two!

38
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,518
  Ready?

39
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,020
  Action!

40
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,049
Have I been well?

41
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:49,359
Are you asking just for the sake of it?

42
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:51,461
What about you?

43
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:52,863
Have you been well?

44
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:55,122
Cut! You sound like a thug.

45
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:57,374
You're not trying to fight her. Tell her you love her.

46
00:01:57,374 --> 00:01:59,061
  Smile a little.

47
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:00,420
Okay! Sorry!

48
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,988
All right. Let's try that again.

49
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,723
Take three!

50
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:05,817
Action!

51
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,756
Have I been well?

52
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,568
Are you asking just for the sake of it?

53
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,170
What about you?

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,463
  Cut!

55
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:21,440
Now, you sound like a psychopath.

56
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,260
Take nine!

57
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,104
Have I been well?

58
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,277
- Are you asking... 
 - No! Cut!

59
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,353
- Not like that. 
 - I'm sorry.

60
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,780
Why are you crying?

61
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,615
Scene nine, cut ten. Take ten!

62
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,134
Scene nine, cut ten. Take eleven!

63
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,864
When is Matilda getting here?

64
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,442
He's having a hard time getting into it without her.

65
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:49,444
About an hour later.

66
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:53,529
- This is awful... 
 - She's got such a busy schedule.

67
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:56,891
Oh! Should we have someone stand in for her?

68
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:58,695
Stand in for her?

69
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:02,597
Maybe we should go console him.

70
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:05,042
That might make it worse.

71
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,705
Excuse me.

72
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,533
Who, me?

73
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,055
Let's get you ready.

74
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:19,314
Oh. Can you take your watch off?

75
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:21,834
It might reflect the sun on camera.

76
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,988
Do I have to?

77
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,940
Only for a second.

78
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,257
Why make Sunnyeo fill in?

79
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,841
Why? It'll be fun.

80
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:57,252
Wow! Sunnyeo! Are you about to debut?

81
00:03:57,252 --> 00:03:59,063
Be quiet!

82
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,891
You look pretty.

83
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,538
It looks good on you.

84
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,615
Will you come this way?

85
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:17,320
Yejoon, say your lines to her. Okay?

86
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,044
I'm probably getting in the way, huh?

87
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,483
Not at all.

88
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,095
I think I got this now.

89
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,805
  Yejoon, let's do this!

90
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:42,923
 - You got this, right?  
 - Right.

91
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:44,117
 Let's go.

92
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,235
  Scene nine, cut ten. Take twelve!

93
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,463
  Ready?

94
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,540
  Action!

95
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,960
Have I been well?

96
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,122
Are you asking just for the sake of it?

97
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,234
What about you?

98
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,277
Have you been well?

99
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,763
That's nice.

100
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,332
Yeah?

101
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:09,526
Well, I haven't been well.

102
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,297
I like you.

103
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:20,575
And because of it, it's hard not being able to see you.

104
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,574
I never should've told you.

105
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,494
Then, at least it wouldn't be awkward seeing you.

106
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:31,739
I regretted it,

107
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:34,075
but what's done is done,

108
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:37,379
so I'll make it clear.

109
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,383
I really like you.

110
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,681
Director, are you going to say cut?

111
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,458
This is way too amazing.

112
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,419
When I couldn't make it on your birthday because of work,

113
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:58,399
I wanted to quit and just run to you.

114
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,561
When I got the call saying I passed my audition,

115
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,507
you were the first person I wanted to call.

116
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:12,610
And... when rumors about me dating that girl surfaced,

117
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:16,883
I worried you might think it's true.

118
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:19,645
It drove me crazy, so I had to go see you.

119
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,986
I don't want to lose you.

120
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,448
I always want to be with you.

121
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,171
Namwook, he's for real right now, isn't he?

122
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,365
  Cut! Okay!

123
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,218
  Okay! Let's prepare for the next scene!

124
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,449
Are you okay? What's wrong?

125
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,068
I'm fine... I'm okay.

126
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,005
Are you jealous? Oh no!

127
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,967
To the point of fainting from anger?

128
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,220
You were suddenly so amazing!

129
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,655
I was really moved just now. I mean it.

130
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:14,750
I should've done it like this from the start. I'm sorry.

131
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,494
I know, right? Go kneel with your hands up as punishment.

132
00:07:18,494 --> 00:07:20,597
Just kidding. Thanks for being so good.

133
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:24,458
- Thank you. 
 - You're his friend? Thanks for your help.

134
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,469
You said you wanted to talk in person.

135
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,680
Go ahead.

136
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:41,291
It turns out I got to say what I wanted,

137
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,588
but I can tell by your reaction how you feel.

138
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,098
- But I'm not going to say sorry. 
 - What?

139
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:59,651
If I do, it'll make it awkward between us.

140
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,701
Would you rather if I said sorry?

141
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,654
No, don't.

142
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,358
Try your best not to feel at fault for it.

143
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,296
I'll do my best not to feel embarrassed.

144
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,144
Okay.

145
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,500

146
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,355
  Hello.

147
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,824
  - Hi, you're here. 
 - Hello.

148
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:39,255
  How are you?

149
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:41,103
  I'm doing great.

150
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,590
Sunnyeo, Matilda's here. Do you see her?

151
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,743
Yeah, there she is.

152
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:50,336
Wow, she's gorgeous in person.

153
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,657
Hello.

154
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,543
Hi.

155
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:57,103
Hi...

156
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,354
- My eyes! 
 - What's wrong?

157
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,109
Your radiance is blinding.

158
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,227
I'm sorry. I can't really help it...

159
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:07,897
Sorry?

160
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,191
Make it up to me. Sit and talk a while.

161
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:12,175
Oh. Okay.

162
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,812
- What's your name? 
 - Cheon Namwook.

163
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:17,430
An extra? I've never seen you before.

164
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,083
I'm just here to watch. I'm in Yejoon's class.

165
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,962
Oh, I see.

166
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,573
Yejoon and I are close too. Let's be friends.

167
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:28,876
He and I aren't really that close.

168
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,853
Namwook, talent agencies are all over you, huh?

169
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:35,732
Not really. No one's ever approached me.

170
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:37,118
No?

171
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,195
They should show more initiative. What a letdown.

172
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:42,089
What do you mean?

173
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,409
How do they not notice how hot you are?

174
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:49,020
I'll tell my boss, and recruit you to my agency.

175
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:54,608
Hey, Kitten. Want to sit with us?

176
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:57,179
Sure.

177
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,265
Is she Yejoon's friend, too?

178
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,166
Yes.

179
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,226
Kitten?

180
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,336
Is that your nickname?

181
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,498
It's his pet name for me.

182
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:10,784
Pet name? Are you two dating?

183
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,848
We live together.

184
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,459
Live together?

185
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,629
Matilda, we need you on set.

186
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:24,623
Oh. Okay.

187
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,168
Namwook, will you grab my purse for me?

188
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,695
Here.

189
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,347
Thanks.

190
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,566
What are you, her slave?

191
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,060
- Let's be friends. 
 - Pardon?

192
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,745
Let's talk later. Bye!

193
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,226
Is this the Namwook effect?

194
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,903
Is this jealousy you feel?

195
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,657
- Cheon Namwook! Let's go home. 
 - Already?

196
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:52,952
I want to stay longer.

197
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,854
- What about you, Namwook? 
 - It'd be nice to stay.

198
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,150
Don't you want to see more of the shoot?

199
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,801
No, I want to go.

200
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:03,995
Either come with me or stay. Up to you.

201
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,643
So you want to stay, huh?

202
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:11,679
Well, I'll be leaving first.

203
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,689
I was going to go!

204
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,233
Kitten!

205
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,303
Wait for me!

206
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,304
What for?

207
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:22,731
Stay and watch Matilda since you like her so much.

208
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:24,750
I don't like her like that.

209
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,294
I don't know what's worse.

210
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:28,713
Her flirting or you just taking it.

211
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:30,256
It's just as bad.

212
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,649
You're no better. You did the same thing.

213
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,327
- What? 
 - What was that between you and Yejoon?

214
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:37,989
What are you talking about?

215
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,548
Exchanging glances like that then going off with him forever?

216
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,019
You're way worse, to be honest.

217
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,870
We went...

218
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,281
Never mind. Forget it.

219
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:49,883
You went to do what?

220
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,969
- Oh no! 
 - What?

221
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:55,105
My watch! Where'd it go?

222
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:58,265
What? The one I got you?

223
00:11:58,265 --> 00:12:01,028
I know I put it in my pocket.

224
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,023
You lost the watch?

225
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,291
While you were with Yejoon?

226
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,245
What's this got to do with Yejoon?

227
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,096
Do you...

228
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,558
have feelings for him?

229
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,103
Don't be ridiculous!

230
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:22,656
Never mind. I don't have to explain myself to you.

231
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,603
You're not my boyfriend, you know!

232
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,380
You're...

233
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,742
leaving anyway.

234
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,507
Hey! Where are you going?

235
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,337
Fine! Go!

236
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,262
She's so mean.

237
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,175
What are you doing?

238
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,527
Let's have fried chicken at Hyunjin's.

239
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:00,962
What?

240
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:03,332
What are you doing with his phone?

241
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,243
Oh. I dialed the wrong number.

242
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:09,138
Well, what are you doing?

243
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:13,164
I mean, I'm heading to Hyunjin's. Want to come?

244
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,254
Don't get mad.

245
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,788
Everyone makes mistakes. Don't curse.

246
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,144
Excuse me! Are you okay?

247
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:25,387
Hey!

248
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,405
Can anyone help me?

249
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,200
I don't see it. Where'd you drop it?

250
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,471
 Will you please look for it?

251
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:38,182
Come look for it yourself. I can't do it alone.

252
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:39,977
Alone?

253
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:42,671
Isn't Namwook with you?

254
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,415
Don't tell me... Is he with Matilda right now?

255
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:49,736
 What? What are you talking about?

256
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:51,947
 Namwook left with you.

257
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,716

258
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,051
Hold on. I have to go.

259
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,847
Hey! Where'd you go?

260
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:03,991
 Hello? This is Yeonli University Hospital.

261
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:05,878
I'm sorry?

262
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,547
 Cheon Namwook fainted and he's at our hospital now.

263
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,142
 This was the only number in his phone, which is why we called you.

264
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,980
Hello?

265
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,100
 Hello, this is Yeonli University Hospital.

266
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,100
 Did you... come pick Namwook up already?

267
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,404
What?

268
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,073
What are you talking about?

269
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:30,132
 Oh... I think he may have left on his own.

270
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,982

271
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,392
 Hello?

272
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:59,722
Namwook! What is your problem?

273
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:03,135
Why didn't you tell me you weren't feeling well?

274
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:07,279
If you were hauled off to a hospital, you should've stayed!

275
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,399
Why didn't you pick up?

276
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,789
Why'd you leave the hospital? What if you faint again?

277
00:15:20,737 --> 00:15:22,213
Here.

278
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,541
I went to find your watch.

279
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,254
Why are you...

280
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:33,532
Are you a fool?

281
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,690
♫  I think you already know how I feel,  ♫

282
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,060
♫  That's what you say sometimes  ♫

283
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,975
♫  My heart imagining you sleeping by my side  ♫

284
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:54,400
Don't ever leave my sight again.

285
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,960
♫  Little by little, goodbye. Slowly goodbye  ♫

286
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,130
♫  It's not until now that I'm feeling  ♫

287
00:16:11,227 --> 00:16:12,869
I found it.

288
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:15,947
Namwook.

289
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:19,451
I was upset thinking you left.

290
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:22,145
Can I get your number?

291
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:26,081
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't.

292
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:27,459
Why not?

293
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:30,554
My wife wouldn't like that.
