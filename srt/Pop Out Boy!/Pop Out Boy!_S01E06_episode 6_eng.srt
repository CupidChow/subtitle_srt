1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,959
What? She said she had feelings for you?

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:04,738

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:07,072
What did you say? What did you tell her?

4
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:10,868
I told her I had feelings for someone else.

5
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:14,889
You ran all the way here

6
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,433
to tell me that?

7
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:22,663

8
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:24,440
Yeah.

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,970
Are you going home?

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,721
Yeah.

11
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:30,656
I'm going.

12
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:33,493
Wow.

13
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:37,145
Matilda told you she had feelings for you, but you rejected her,

14
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:41,624
and told her you liked someone else?

15
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:53,200
I can't believe I wasn't assigned to your group.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,973
Are you in our group, too?

17
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:57,584
You know I can't go to the meeting because of a shoot, right?

18
00:00:57,584 --> 00:01:01,478
You know you have to do extra research, right?

19
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,813
When did you two talk about that?

20
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:04,447
Group chat.

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,592
I feel like I'm the only one

22
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,037
who has a flip phone.

23
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,275
Submit a proposal for a new app?

24
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,444
Come sit over here.

25
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:25,485
- What's an app?
   - An application.

26
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,280
Like YouTube, Instagram,

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,549
they're what you've been using.

28
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,265
Oh. Is this an app, too?

29
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:35,914
Turn it off now.

30
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:39,173
Don't waste my battery. I didn't bring my charger.

31
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:43,569
I'll lend you mine.

32
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:45,947
Yours doesn't work on mine.

33
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:50,785
How about an app that interprets what your pets say?

34
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:54,929
We can base it on collected data of pet sounds and movements.

35
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,633
Not bad.

36
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,269
I have a pet cat.

37
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:02,544
I often wonder what my kitty is thinking.

38
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:03,641
Me, too.

39
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:05,917
You have a kitten, too?

40
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:09,446
Actually,

41
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:13,699
I want to get inside Sunnyeo's head.

42
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,253
I'm not your pet!

43
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,122
I was thinking something similar.

44
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:21,918
Not only are you stealing Namho,

45
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:24,352
but you're stealing my ideas, too?

46
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:27,255
Of course not.

47
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:30,758
We must be on the same wavelength.

48
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,136
Let's take a short break.

49
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:40,600
You'll see when we get home.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,628
Okay.

51
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,154
Get home?

52
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:45,907
What's he going to do at home with her?

53
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,303
  I couldn't bear holding it in.

54
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,071
  Me neither.

55
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,992
I'll make the tteokbokki extra spicy.

56
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,188
I bought Buldak sauce yesterday.

57
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,398
Wow!

58
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,999
The hotter, the better. Thank you.

59
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,960
Unbelievable!

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,764
What did you want to tell me?

61
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:17,432
Why did you ask to see me here?

62
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:20,191
Can I see your phone?

63
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:23,102
Though I can't give you my love,

64
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,730
you can use my phone.

65
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:35,074
Sorry. I'll come let you out tomorrow.

66
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:36,507
What?

67
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:41,622
What is the meaning of this?

68
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,240
I may not be able to win you over,

69
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,140
but I can stop you from going to Sunnyeo's today.

70
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:48,921
Ina! You!

71
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:50,697
Sorry, Namjoon.

72
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,631
  Ina! Open this door!

73
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,434
  Yoon Ina!

74
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:58,181
 The wireless customer you called is not available at this time.

75
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:01,441

Huh? Why aren't they here?

76
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,492

77
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,713
Where are you? Are you with Namwook?

78
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,232
  Sunnyeo.

79
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:10,666
Now, you'll know

80
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,253
how it feels to be all alone.

81
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,117
I hope she didn't kill him.

82
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:20,826
I'm Cheon Namwook,

83
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:23,854
the Lone Fighter. A little door can't stop me.

84
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:31,921
Ouch...

85
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,618
Cheon Namwook.

86
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:44,617
Cheon Namwook!

87
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,357
If he's not here, where could he be?

88
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:57,782
Hello?

89
00:04:57,782 --> 00:05:01,367
I'm in here! It's me, Namwook!

90
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:04,946
Cheon Namwook?

91
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,969
Kitten?

92
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:15,055
Aigoo. Come on.

93
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:31,440
Proud of me?

94
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,290
What was that noise?

95
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:45,496
We're locked in.

96
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:47,747
Is this the Namwook effect, too?

97
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,175
It's like a comic book. How cliche...

98
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,316
Let us out!

99
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,718
I'm locked in!

100
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:00,944
Me too!

101
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,288
Hello?

102
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:03,363

103
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:10,286
 The caller you are trying to reach is not available. At the tone...

104
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:14,298
 Is the team meeting over?

105
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,278
  Let's get going.

106
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:20,986
Bro, can you take me to school?

107
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:24,533
Careful, Kitten.

108
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:26,360
Want me to try?

109
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,404
I can do it!

110
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:33,490
I'm sure there's an emergency key... Ouch!

111
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,503
Are you okay?

112
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,333
Not only are we trapped together,

113
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,910
but I hurt my hand and there's a first aid kit here?

114
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,980
It's like a TV drama.

115
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,232
Is this the Namwook effect, too?

116
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,584
Sit down, will you?

117
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:07,751
Why put yourself in harm's way?

118
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:12,004
If it's too much, you're allowed to ask for help.

119
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,308
Fine.

120
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,434
Why are you so mad?

121
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:19,480
Stop acting so tough and getting hurt like this.

122
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,076
I know how lonely it gets pretending you

123
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:24,202
can handle it all by yourself.

124
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,940

125
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm at school. Where are you guys?

126
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,805
  You guys? I'm home now.

127
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:46,889
Home? But Namwook and Sunnyeo's backpacks are still here.

128
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,616
  I must be out of my mind!

129
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:50,984
  What... What is wrong with me?

130
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:52,230
What did you do?

131
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,207
  I locked Namhee in the gym storage room before coming home.

132
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:57,542
  What am I going to do?

133
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:59,002
  Want me to meet you there?

134
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:00,684
What?

135
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:04,133
You locked who up?

136
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,492
Cheon Namhee!

137
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:08,529
  Sunnyeo probably went to school looking for him.

138
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,762
Today's Friday, right?

139
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,246
Right.

140
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,349
So we have to wait until Monday?

141
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:22,517
Probably.

142
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,905
I miss my mom.

143
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,100
Me too.

144
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:33,995
- I'm sorry. 
 - For what?

145
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:37,983
I thought you didn't like people talking about your mom.

146
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:41,060
Yeah, I suppose.

147
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,797
I didn't realize.

148
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:46,199
That's why you never asked about my mom?

149
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:49,745
I've got a keen sense, you know?

150
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:53,206
Only in this aspect.

151
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,562
But I guess... Thanks.

152
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:06,597
Excuse me! Anyone in there?

153
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:08,830

Hello?

154
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,925
My mom and I had an argument that day

155
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,086
- and she told me to eat before I left. 
 -  Have breakfast before you go!

156
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:19,108
- But I yelled saying I didn't have time to eat. 
 -  I don't want breakfast.

157
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,436
I just left for school.

158
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:27,163
A celebrity said "Like Sunnyeo'" the day before so it was a trending search.

159
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:29,769
But in the way I hate it being used

160
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:34,097
which made me so mad.

161
00:09:34,097 --> 00:09:35,640
I blamed my mom.

162
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,335
That's what I told her that day.

163
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:43,897
Then, during class, my homeroom teacher told me to get ready to leave.

164
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:47,584
We left and arrived at the hospital.

165
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:50,881
Car accident?

166
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:58,420
My mom died because of me.

167
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,415
What?

168
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:02,635
She died while giving birth to me,

169
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,168
so...

170
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,580
my dad hated me to no end.

171
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,999
Oh yeah.

172
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,944
I remember that from the comic book.

173
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,766
I see.

174
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:21,501
But it's all made up anyway.

175
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:24,456
So it's not even real.

176
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:26,068
It is real.

177
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:27,827
What?

178
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,905
You're hurting with her being gone,

179
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:33,332
so that makes it real.

180
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:44,772
Namwook, is there anyone you miss from the comic book?

181
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:47,872
Like the friends you had

182
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:52,001
or the Sunnyeo in that world?

183
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,956
I didn't have any friends.

184
00:10:57,956 --> 00:11:00,408
And Sunnyeo?

185
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:03,771
I like the Han Sunnyeo before me right now better.

186
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:06,215
Whatever.

187
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,815
Should I...

188
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,477
just stay?

189
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,228
What?

190
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,111
Well, it would feel

191
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:31,447
a bit strange if you were gone.

192
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,008
I can't do this.

193
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:43,669
Try harder. Try.

194
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,570
- Try harder? 
 - Yeah, just a bit.

195
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,456
I can't.

196
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:05,500
  Han Sunnyeo!

197
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:14,239
Noh Yejoon? How'd you know we were here?

198
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:15,802
Are...

199
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,677
Are you all right?

200
00:12:17,677 --> 00:12:19,905
Is everything okay?

201
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:23,458
Yeah. I'm fine.

202
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:26,820
Ina has seriously lost her mind.

203
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,771
I wouldn't say all that...

204
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:32,824
Sunnyeo, will you help me up?

205
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:39,500
Thanks.

206
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,585
How about I take you home then?

207
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:45,197
Okay.

208
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,461
Want to open up a tteokbokki restaurant with me?

209
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:53,673
With 9:1 of the profits.

210
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,765
Really? Me? Nine?

211
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:58,319
How could you even think that?

212
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,220
Obviously, the nine is me.

213
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,286
I'm in a good mood today,

214
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:11,738
so I'll do the dishes.

215
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,553

216
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,224

217
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:39,016

218
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:42,179

219
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:48,435

220
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:53,990

221
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,010

222
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:23,920

223
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,657
  Han Sunnyeo!
