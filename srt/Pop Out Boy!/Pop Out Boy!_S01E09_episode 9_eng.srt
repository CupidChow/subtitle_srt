1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:03,077
 Don't ever leave my side.

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,850

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,430
 Bye.

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,602
 You're just going to disappear?

5
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,788
 Just like that?

6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,340
 Cheon Namwook!

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,266
Cheon Namwook! No!

8
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,551
Kitten.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,982
Were you crying?

10
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,143
No.

11
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,319
Why would I cry?

12
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:47,831

13
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:51,915
I don't regret liking you.

14
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,972
Thank you for being my first love.

15
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,308
Get back safely and take care.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,320
Don't just sit there! Fine, I will go.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,465
Four words! That's all you need to say.

18
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,083
Fine. I will go?

19
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:13,188
See? It's got to be just like this scene.

20
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:16,400
Your birthday, July 2nd, exactly at 9:00 p.m.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,453
One mistake and you can't ever go back.

22
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,004
Then...

23
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:26,275
Anyway, we have to get it on one try.

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,739
But remember what you said yesterday?

25
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,252
To stay by your side?

26
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,305
What did you mean by it?

27
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,390
Nothing.

28
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,602
If I don't return to the book and stay by your side...

29
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,119
Don't be ridiculous.

30
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,105
I meant stay by my side until you go back because...

31
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,834
you worry me.

32
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,128
Is that all?

33
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,124
Namwook, let me see that thing.

34
00:01:57,935 --> 00:01:59,094
What thing?

35
00:01:59,094 --> 00:02:00,712

36
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:02,913

37
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,817
You don't know what a bucket list is, do you?

38
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:07,752
Sure I do. I know what it is.

39
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:09,780
World peace. Reunification of North and South Korea.

40
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,849
It's not for listing big wishes like these.

41
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:16,194
I wrote it when I didn't know better.

42
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,020
I wrote more in the back.

43
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:22,678

44
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:23,668

45
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:24,400

46
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:25,045

47
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,404

Huh?

48
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:28,882
I thought it'd be more special.

49
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,134
We did all this already.

50
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:33,311
But not after I'm gone.

51
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,310
Okay! Let's do it all then!

52
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,355
But I'm adding something.

53
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:48,101
- What? 
 - I'm not telling.

54
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,510
Why not? Tell me.

55
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,928
No.

56
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,737
I'll hold onto this.

57
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,902
Is there anywhere you want to go or something you want to buy?

58
00:03:15,902 --> 00:03:17,680
Sunnyeo,

59
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,175
you're suddenly being so nice, that it's unnerving.

60
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:24,512
You're fussing because I'm nice?

61
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,200
You won't remember if we do everything the same.

62
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:35,020
I'm doing this so you'll remember all that I do for you!

63
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,259
More special than an everyday routine, right?

64
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,918
Right!

65
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,152
How about now?

66
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,229
This feels special.

67
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,541
If you don't want to, we don't have to.

68
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:00,806
It's fine.

69
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,694
Hi.

70
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,670

71
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,511

72
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,279
I have three loves in this world.

73
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,450
Do you know what they are?

74
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,360
- What? 
 - Chocolate milk.

75
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,988
Strawberry milk.

76
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,632
And you. I love you!
 (T/N: Wordplay on the pronounciation of wooyou meaning milk.)

77
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:39,840
What? I know you heard me!

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,760

79
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,876

80
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:45,459
Watch out!

81
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,453
- What? 
 - You'll hurt yourself that way.

82
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:50,673
Then, how do I do it?

83
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,596
Stop!

84
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,984

85
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,845
 Sunnyeo and Namwook did their best

86
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,965
  to make each moment left really count.

87
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,793
See you.

88
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:12,553
Yejoon.

89
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,655
Whatever. Take care.

90
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,460
Sunnyeo,

91
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,304
do you mind if I give Namwook a hug?

92
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:23,780
Shouldn't you be asking me not Sunnyeo?

93
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,383
Go for it.

94
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,361
Here. Bring it!

95
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:31,088
Minjung!

96
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,610
You've been the best POP OUT BOY and friend.

97
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,381
Safe travels, Namwook.

98
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:45,976
I would have never been able to handle the tough times without you.

99
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:50,406
Thanks. Adios.

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,077
You're so lame.

101
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:54,903
Guys, it's late. Get going.

102
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:56,322
Okay.

103
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,817
Why? What are you two going to do after sending us off?

104
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:04,087
What? Minjung, get out of here when I'm asking nicely.

105
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:06,973
What? Are you going to hold hands again?

106
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:10,284
- Or kiss? 
 - Come on!

107
00:06:10,284 --> 00:06:13,250
Bye, Namwook! Get back safely!

108
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,430
Be happy, okay?

109
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,534
  - Come on, will you? 
 - Wait up!

110
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,900

111
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,818
Should we go inside?

112
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,470
Sure.

113
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,965
 They pushed aside the waves of sadness that came and went

114
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:36,120
 and left them behind as post-breakup problems

115
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,672
 for as long as they could.

116
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,600

117
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,490

118
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,153

119
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,215
Will you tell me what you wrote now?

120
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:59,201
Curious?

121
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,861
What is it?

122
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,303
Try to be natural.

123
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:11,287
Smile big and show some teeth.

124
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:12,891
Your expressions look a little forced.

125
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,642
Smile a bit bigger. A big smile.

126
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:18,178
- What are you doing, Namwook? 
 - Kitten!

127
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:21,881
You're smiling big now that your girlfriend's here.

128
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:24,843
- What? 
 - Will you stand over here?

129
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,154
Stay right there.

130
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:27,906
Imagine the camera is your girlfriend.

131
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:30,274
  Now, smile big!

132
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,100
  Nice! There you go!

133
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,173
  Now, you get what I mean.

134
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,634
  Oh... Can you try to be more natural?

135
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:45,389
You're terrible at this, Sunnyeo.

136
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,600
You weren't so great at first either!

137
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,219
Yeah, so similar.

138
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,588
Can you come here?

139
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:53,872
Will you get your girl to smile?

140
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,835
You're good at that. You were doing it earlier.

141
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:57,985
Like this?

142
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:59,728
Nice! There you go!

143
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,622
Bigger!

144
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,192
I love you! Sunnyeo!

145
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,864
Was taking photos together what was on your bucket list?

146
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:13,417
No.

147
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,098
It's to graduate with you.

148
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,028
You said bucket lists weren't for unrealistic wishes.

149
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,590
You know I can't graduate with you.

150
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,333
Why not?

151
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,588
I know a way.

152
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,451
There.

153
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,261
What do you think?

154
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,923
Do I look okay?

155
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,682
Wait here.

156
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,761
Here.

157
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,150
Now, we really look like we're graduating.

158
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,553
You didn't have to do all this.

159
00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:00,531
I already have the world's most beautiful flower.

160
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:03,291
- And that's... 
 - Me?

161
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,564
I can't believe you said that. I'm shook.

162
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,702
Let's just take pictures, okay?

163
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,095
Sunnyeo, what do you want to major in after graduation?

164
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:34,540
Poli-sci and IR.

165
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:36,325
Oh. Like a doctor?

166
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:39,135
No. Political Science and International Relations.

167
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:42,713
Wow. So you'll be a diplomat?

168
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:44,642
Perhaps.

169
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:49,561
It's my field of interest, so I'll decide once I get there.

170
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,490
- What about you, Namwook? 
 - Me?

171
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,295
It's never crossed my mind.

172
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,568
Cinema Studies and Theater?

173
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:09,182
You're implying that your good looks shouldn't be kept only for yourself, huh?

174
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:10,826
No.

175
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:14,379
I enjoyed being on set the other day,

176
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,283
and Matilda said I'd be good at it.

177
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,326
Matilda?

178
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,962
Are you still texting her?

179
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,597
Of course not!

180
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:26,582
Kitten, are you jealous?

181
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,661
Jealous? No way!

182
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,521
Yeah, you are. You are jealous.

183
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:34,700
Keep it up and you won't get your gift.

184
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,877
Gift? What gift?

185
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:40,396
Never mind. Let's forget I brought it up.

186
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:42,349
I take it back. You're not jealous.

187
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:46,217
I'll be really good!

188
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,472
What'd you get me?

189
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:50,391
Close your eyes.

190
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,475
It's for your graduation and your birthday.

191
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,918
Wow...

192
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:14,938
This one matches yours, huh?

193
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:26,000

194
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,598
It's just like the one I got you. Right?

195
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,379
 Knowing that she couldn't give him more time to stay,

196
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:39,190
 she figured a watch would be the next best thing to give.

197
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,890

198
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,204

199
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,474
I know you'll do just fine.

200
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:55,122
Say your lines to me.

201
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,375
Fine.

202
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,170
I will go.

203
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,007
Good work.

204
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,401
I don't regret liking you.

205
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:29,290
Thank you for being my first love.

206
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,546
Get back safely. Take care.

207
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:51,379
I won't do it.

208
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,324
I'm not leaving.

209
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,004
I can't go,

210
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,948
leaving you here alone.

211
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:13,520
♫  Our time is gradually stopping  ♫

212
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,990
♫  Little by Little, goodbye. Slowly goodbye  ♫

213
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,270
♫  It's not until now that I'm feeling it  ♫
