1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,710
Why did you call me up here?

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,837
To give this back.

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,632
Cheon Nam, isn't this yours?

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,968
As I said before,
his name is Cheon Nam Wook.

5
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,261
Right, it's ours.

6
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,471
"Ours"?

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,848
I'll give it back...

8
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:16,725
if you go on a date with me.

9
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,353
He will, if you give it back.

10
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,230
I will?

11
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,648
Is it not important to you?

12
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,986
("Seon Nyeo and Nam Wook")

13
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,491
- No!
- You can't!

14
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,617
Please calm down.

15
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,870
- Please don't.
- Don't do it.

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,497
(Pop Out Boy, Episode 5)

17
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,667
- You're buying a first date gift?
- Yes.

18
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,670
With what money?

19
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,463
With what I earned
working part-time.

20
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,508
But that barely
covers your expenses.

21
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,512
Isn't this pretty?

22
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,680
I guess it is.

23
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,973
Then this is what I'm getting.

24
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,475
Shouldn't you be this generous
to your landlady?

25
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,768
Maybe I've been too nice.

26
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,070
What the...

27
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,323
Why am I so sleepy today?

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,784
Just today?

29
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,578
You've been dozing off
nearly every day.

30
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,831
- Did you stay up all night?
- As if.

31
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,794
Why is everyone studying so hard?

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,963
Min Jung, you too?

33
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,340
I may be shameless,

34
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,508
but not when the exam is in an hour.

35
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,177
The Gapsin Coup.

36
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,761
- The coup...
- Is that today?

37
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,185
Nam Wook,
who has been more tired than ever,

38
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,062
spent his time sleeping
while others took the exam.

39
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,231
And like that,

40
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,276
the three days of exams were over.

41
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,489
Cheon Nam Joon,

42
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,951
why do you always seem burdened?

43
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,578
What do you mean?

44
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,248
You're burdened
with the weight of good looks.

45
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:08,003
I'm glad that at least
someone notices it.

46
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,131
What should we do on our date today?

47
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,635
- Where should we go?
- He won't get it back at this rate.

48
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,136
Get what back?

49
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,765
Oh, the computer marking pen.

50
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,391
I lent her mine.

51
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,601
So where's Nam Wook?

52
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,687
- He has a date.
- Nam Wook has a date?

53
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,856
With whom? Tell me!

54
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,485
We should have some fun too.

55
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,738
That's out of the blue,
but I love the idea.

56
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,073
What should we do?

57
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,783
Go singing or get some ice cream?

58
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,410
I asked him out on a date?

59
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,828
Me?

60
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,413
Have I lost it?

61
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,999
- Why did I do it?
- That's who Nam Wook...

62
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,417
is going out with?

63
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,670
Fancy seeing you
all gathered around.

64
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,256
Is it me you were waiting for?

65
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,432
A man of style always wear boots.

66
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,643
The key point would be
to stuff the pants into them.

67
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,271
Want to look fashionable?
Then add chains.

68
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,231
Wear a black vest
above a white t-shirt...

69
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,149
to look extra stylish too.

70
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,860
Wear a modern
and sophisticated fedora...

71
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,737
to add a little oomph
to a somewhat plain look.

72
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,322
What on earth did he do to himself?

73
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,992
So much for the haircut.

74
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,536
Yi Na would run
at the sight of this.

75
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,163
My gosh!

76
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,291
He looks so sharp...

77
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,585
that I might end up cutting myself.

78
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,712
It's like we're back in 2010.

79
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,631
Maybe the old trends
are making a comeback.

80
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,136
This is super hot.

81
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,637
Tell the fashion industry...

82
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,139
that...

83
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,434
a revolution has begun.

84
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:46,810
May I sit with you?

85
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,980
I'd like to be in the presence
of the revolutionary fashion leader.

86
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,319
If that's what you want, go ahead.

87
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,115
The darn Cheon Nam Wook effect.

88
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,162
Why would I sit with you?
I take that back.

89
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,374
You're Noh Ye Joon
of Yeolli High School, right?

90
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,001
Yes, that's me.

91
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,795
- My gosh!
- Gosh, we're huge fans.

92
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,089
Could we take a photo with you?

93
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,341
Of course.

94
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,718
Could you...

95
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,928
Me too?

96
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,388
Gosh, I'm embarrassed.

97
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,349
It doesn't have to be perfect.

98
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,768
Right, of course.

99
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,232
Ye Joon, you're a superstar.

100
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,568
Soon, we won't even be able
to take the subway with you.

101
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,153
Don't be ridiculous.

102
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,531
Don't be upset.

103
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:44,743
Nam Gi, you'll always be
the only celebrity in my heart.

104
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,829
Then I decline.

105
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,791
I'd rather only be a star
to someone else.

106
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,257
Is that so? The comic book
must not be important.

107
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,633
Why don't I keep...

108
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,973
- You guys look good together.
- Thanks.

109
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,516
The same goes for you two.

110
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,810
- Us two?
- You and him.

111
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,563
- That's absurd.
- Don't be ridiculous.

112
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,647
See?

113
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,569
Hold on a second
because my radar is pinging.

114
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,362
- In what way?
- Answer me.

115
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,614
Is it her or her?

116
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,449
What's this?

117
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,326
A selfie you took with Matilda...

118
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,120
that was posted on
her social media account.

119
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,122
What's wrong with practicing lines
with a co-star?

120
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,000
Then, is she your choice?

121
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,472
There's no better way for a group
to have fun than playing pool.

122
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,892
Who plays pool these days?

123
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,895
Why? It sounds like fun.

124
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,230
You look so cool.

125
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,650
Nam Joon, how is this played?

126
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,070
Lay out your left arm
and align your grip with the bridge.

127
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,616
I don't get it. Can you show me?

128
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,868
Seon Nyeo,
have you played pool before?

129
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,244
What do you think?

130
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,537
Your arm goes like this.

131
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,582
- Like this?
- Steady the top arm...

132
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,459
and keep the bridge on the table.

133
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,086
- What stays on the table?
- This.

134
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,547
How about a bet?

135
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,007
I think I got the hang of it.

136
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,092
You see, there's one thing
I'm not good at.

137
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,970
I don't lose
in situations I don't want to.

138
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,682
This is one of those situations.

139
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,184
I want to win by all costs.

140
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,273
Copy what he does.

141
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,818
- What are you doing?
- Darn, the chalk.

142
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,445
I got it all over my fingers.

143
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,783
(Referee)

144
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,497
Nam Joon, nice!

145
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,629
Yes!

146
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,466
No, wait.
Hold it further to the back.

147
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:05,801
No helping.

148
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,264
You've got this.

149
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,850
- Yes!
- Nice!

150
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,978
(Referee)

151
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,694
Darn it.

152
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,658
- It went in.
- You win!

153
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,078
Nice!

154
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,165
(Referee)

155
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,876
What the heck was that?

156
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,794
Sorry.

157
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,673
Thanks for this.

158
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,467
This isn't much of a prize though.

159
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,219
Tell me about it.

160
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,097
How about the losing team
also buys dinner?

161
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,975
Sorry, but we need to be elsewhere.

162
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,519
We? As in you and me?

163
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,937
Bye.

164
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,939
Where are we going?

165
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,941
I should at least know that.

166
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,694
Come with me and I'll tell you.

167
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,820
I'll also give you your comic book.

168
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,699
I need to get going too
to practice my lines.

169
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,243
Of course, you're never one to stay.

170
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,661
See you tomorrow, superstar.

171
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,206
- Seon Nyeo.
- Yes?

172
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,957
I'll get going.

173
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,169
Sure. Bye.

174
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,595
Who is it that you have eyes for?

175
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,597
What are you saying?

176
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,475
Is it the man of your destiny
or the long-term best friend?

177
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,560
I've only been focused
on the former,

178
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,813
but ending up with the latter
seems like...

179
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,857
the more compelling story.

180
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,317
You and your nonsense.

181
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,904
I'm not a character in your comics,

182
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,906
so stop trying
to write my story for me.

183
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,034
It's not like I'm telling you
what to do.

184
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,078
Anyway, tell me. Which one is it?

185
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,707
I'll help you get together
with the man of your choice.

186
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,753
What? You didn't get it back?

187
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,630
Yes, she forgot and left it at home.

188
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,383
And you believed her?

189
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,469
This is her way
of getting more dates out of you.

190
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,889
- Is that so?
- Did you agree to another date?

191
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,307
- When?
- Tomorrow.

192
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,228
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

193
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,480
Why? Don't tell me you're jealous.

194
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,650
Gosh, you're even cuter
when you're jealous.

195
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,777
Jealous, my foot.

196
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,280
I'm just worried that
you won't get your comic book back.

197
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,781
I'll get it back tomorrow.

198
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,200
No.

199
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,244
I'll retrieve it myself.

200
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,374
What am I wearing?
This is an odd ensemble.

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,419
Dress like you did yesterday again
and I won't let you walk with me.

202
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:46,879
I don't mind...

203
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,338
since you chose this for me.

204
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,633
Until when are you going
to walk with me?

205
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,510
Why? Can't I come with you?

206
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,055
The Cheon Nam Wook effect might
be activated if Yi Na sees you.

207
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,770
So Cheon Nam Wook...

208
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,689
Did you come in his place?

209
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,107
I'm glad.

210
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,195
Right. So did you bring
the comic book?

211
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,863
Yes.

212
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,074
I'm sorry it took me so long.

213
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:19,203
I haven't been
feeling myself lately.

214
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,291
Seon Nyeo, I admire you, you know.

215
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,295
You're way better
than the Seon Nyeo in this book.

216
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,173
I see. Thanks.

217
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,676
I have no idea
why I gave you such a hard time.

218
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,555
Also, I don't know
why I even like Cheon Nam...

219
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,350
I'm sure it's not your fault.

220
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,686
Here you go.

221
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,529
Did you think it'd be this easy?

222
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,623
Hey!

223
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,880
I'll keep this safe for you.

224
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,465
Let me put it in your bag.

225
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,473
- You won't believe this.
- Believe what?

226
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,975
Let me send you something.

227
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,645
"Matilda and Noh Ye Joon,
Rookies Fall in Love."

228
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,647
- What the...
- "Noh Ye Joon and Matilda,"

229
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,858
"Rookies Fall in Love on Set."

230
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,484
Is it true?

231
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,904
I can't believe he didn't tell me.

232
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,949
- What is it?
- It's Ye Joon.

233
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,243
Apparently, he and Matilda
are dating.

234
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,245
Really?

235
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,126
- Where are you?
- I'm on my way home.

236
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:50,878
Why?

237
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,425
Seon Nyeo,
I have something for you.

238
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,969
Really? What is it?

239
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,642
Ta-da.

240
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,899
You're giving me
what you didn't give to Yi Na?

241
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,401
It was always meant for you.

242
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,158
Thanks.

243
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,129
I see you were together.

244
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,839
What are you doing here?

245
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,176
It isn't true.

246
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,472
- What?
- The news article.

247
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,891
It isn't true.

248
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,019
I'm not dating her.

249
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,397
I don't even like her.

250
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,362
I see.

251
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,743
Did you run all the way here
to tell me that?

252
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,755
We're here.

253
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:18,841
Where exactly are we?

254
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,302
The place where I'll be
confessing my love to you.

255
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,847
I like you, Nam Young.

256
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,266
I'm sorry to tell you this,

257
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,226
but my name isn't Nam Young.

258
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,772
Also, I like someone else.

259
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,023
Who?

260
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,984
Han Seon Nyeo?

261
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,699
I'm sorry...

262
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:48,871
for being a jerk who only has room
for one woman in his heart.

263
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,791
You know your story
has a sad ending, right?

264
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,544
You may be happy now,
but it won't last.

265
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,546
Well, we're writing
a different story!
