Who on earth...

3
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,438
are you?

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,859
Me? I'm a lonely fighter.

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,403
I'm Cheon Nam Wook.

6
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,700
Han Seon Nyeo!

7
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,875
Are you okay, Ms. Cat?

8
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,170
No.

9
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,589
This isn't okay.

10
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,884
Why is he so cheesy?

11
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,135
Gosh, I hate him.

12
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,971
Why? I thought he was hot.

13
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,764
You're fine with him calling her
Ms. Cat?

14
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,351
- Doesn't that make you cringe?
- That's why I read this comic book.

15
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,770
Why are you still reading that?
It came out a decade ago.

16
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,274
You've known her for a decade.
Why don't you try to like her?

17
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,359
The main character has
the same name as you.

18
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,778
On top of that, your mother
bought a house with this.

19
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,613
You should be so grateful.

20
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,656
Are you kidding me?

21
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,618
I had been teased because of that
for a decade when I was young.

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,454
We only have the same names,
but I hate her character.

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,748
And I hate my mom even more
that she used my name...

24
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,792
without my permission
for a lame cartoon like this.

25
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,338
This isn't a lame cartoon.
It's one of the classics.

26
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,631
Classic, my foot.

27
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,426
This is a classic romance cartoon...

28
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,595
that contains
the sentiments of the 2000s.

29
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,639
This cartoon comes
with every cliche you can think of.

30
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,683
That was revolutionary.

31
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,562
What's revolutionary?

32
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,731
Your popularity?

33
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,984
Ye Joon, you went viral again.

34
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,447
Let me see. "Noh Ye Joon".
"Noh Ye Joon's photoshoot".

35
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,741
You're ranked eighth now.

36
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,744
Are you rigging the online
ranking system nowadays?

37
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,915
What? Why is "like how Seon Nyeo
would" going viral again?

38
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,082
What?

- Yes.
- Yes.

45

Don't strain yourselves
and get hurt.

46
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,095
Like the slang you have nowadays,
run like how Seon Nyeo would.

47

- Okay.
- Okay.

Get ready.

50
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,997
Seon Nyeo,
you don't have to try this hard.

51
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,499
Good job.

52
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,338
You told us to run
like how Seon Nyeo would.

53
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,217
Anyway, Seon Nyeo.
Do you do everything the opposite?

54
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,427
Why do they keep using that phrase?

55
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,597
That character is
clumsy, frail, and passive.

56
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,600
Would you be happy if your name
was used to represent her?

57
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,854
Easy, easy.
Don't be so stressed out.

58
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,565
But your birthday is in seven hours.

59
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,776
So what's my birthday present?

60
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,237
So what kind of food will you order?

61
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,824
Hey.

62
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,661
You'll be mad if I ask you
to walk me to my house, right?

63
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,872
Why not? I'll walk you home.

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,582
- Really?
- Yes.

65
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,791
If you give me 10 dollars.

66
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,835
Gosh, forget it.

67
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,170
Okay. See you later.

68
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,553
Perhaps, that could
have been foreshadowing.

69
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,139
Why are there so many cats here?

70
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,686
I saw a lot of cats,
especially that day.

("Seon Nyeo and Nam Wook")

72

A man who called Seon Nyeo Ms. Cat
showed up that day.

73
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,903
Was that a coincidence?

74
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,406
Why not? Why can't you come?

75
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,910
The shoot hasn't ended yet.

76
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,579
Come on. You've been modeling
for three years now.

77
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,539
- The shoot is running long?
- I'm really sorry.

78
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,334
- Ye Joon, we'll resume!
- Okay.

79
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,462
I'll give you
a present tomorrow. Bye.

Hey, I must have eaten spoiled food.

82
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,348
Hey, you guys are doing
another prank, right?

83
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,350
I hope that was the case too.

86

They were telling the truth.

90

It wasn't a prank
or a trick for April Fool's Day.

I really didn't want
to be alone today.

that it's you.

You're only glad? How disappointing.

166
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,338
- "Mister"? I'm only 18.
- Your address.

167
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,551
- Seongnam Metropolitan City...
- Not Seoul Metropolitan City?

168
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,052
That kind of city doesn't exist.

169
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,263
That can't be.

170
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:01,518
Then, you're telling me
that you don't have a place to go.

171
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,062
Do you have anyone's phone number?

172
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,283
What?

173
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,412
This is the only phone number
I have.

174
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,630
I've got to go.

175
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,759
- Where are you going?
- I need to go to school.

176
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,429
What about me?
I have no place to go.

177
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,558
I was living a good life.

178
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,894
But I was brought here
because of you.

179
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,396
Whatever. Stay here for now.

180
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,731
Really?

181
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,942
Only until you go back.

182
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,528
Thank you. Thanks,

183
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,780
Ms. Cat.

184
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,123
Seon Nyeo, I am so sorry.

185
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,460
My older brother brought some pieces
of sashimi from his part-time job.

186
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,129
I didn't know that it had gone bad.

187
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,258
Seon Nyeo,
your birthday isn't over yet.

188
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,093
- Let's have a party today.
- Yes.

189
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,846
We spent a lot of money
for your birthday present.

190
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,639
I don't have work today.

191
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,642
Min Jung and I will go to your place
after school today.

192
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:26,353
- No.
- Why not?

193
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,608
My house is a mess.

194
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,902
We've seen plenty of mess before.

195
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,654
- Right. Let's go to your place.
- No.

196
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,657
I have...

197
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,368
monstrous garbage at home.

198
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:46,915
My acorns!

199
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,793
(The homepage doesn't exist.)

200
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,339
This isn't the world I live in.

201
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,425
(My Birthday, April 1, 2020)

202
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:00,220
What?
She even has the same birthday...

203
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,847
with Ms. Cat.

204
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,895
Do you like it?

205
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,522
Isn't this expensive?

206
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,567
I told you we spent a lot of money.

207
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,069
Min Jung chose that one.

208
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,363
And I picked the case for it.

209
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:23,202
You got me an expensive present.
I don't need things like that.

210
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,413
But I'm so grateful for it. Awesome.

211
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,123
Thank you. I'll use it well.

212
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,258
I must have left my earbuds at home.

213
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,844
I should put them on
as soon as I get home.

214
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,016
I'm sure I left them here.

215
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,936
It's your birthday today, Ms. Cat.

216
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,897
I told you to stop calling me that.

217
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,316
I got a present for you.

218
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,235
Close your eyes.

219
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,028
Are you trying to trick me again?

220
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,696
Gosh, no.

221
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,827
Okay. I'll close my eyes.
Stop saying your cheesy lines.

222
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,374
Give me your hand.

223
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:14,753
Gosh.

224
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,299
It's mine.

225
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,346
Do you want me
to throw out your trash?

226
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,307
I didn't bring anything
when I was transported here.

227
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,894
But I had that in my pocket.

228
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,272
I don't need this.
I already have mine.

229
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,691
Don't be like that.

230
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,026
Why do you have earbuds
without the wire?

231
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:39,778
It's breaking my heart.

232
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,321
Earbuds without the wire?

233
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,116
- Hey.
- What?

234
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,869
What did you do with them?

235
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,579
What did I do?

236
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,875
I threw them out.

237
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:58,714
(Three days into their cohabitation)

238
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:02,509
Even after that, Nam Wook continued
to make Seon Nyeo furious...

239
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,969
in many different ways.

240
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,018
Can I use your smartphone?

241
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,272
Here.

242
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,610
Thank you, Wifey.

243
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,654
What? "Wifey"?

244
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:26,241
Hey. You used up all of my data!

245
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,868
Didn't I tell you
to connect it to Wi-Fi?

246
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:32,414
That's odd. I definitely had it on
the whole time.

247
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,209
Really?

248
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,921
My love signal for you
was always on.

249
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,218
(Seven days into their cohabitation)

250
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,594
I'm so stressed out!

251
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:47,471
I want tteokbokki.

252
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,143
What is this?

253
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,854
Even if this world is out to get me,

254
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:59,525
I'll protect the love of my life.

255
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:01,568
Who is this?

256
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,570
Darn it. Delete.

257
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,573
(Noh Ye Joon)

258
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,242
Hello?

259
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,910
Hey, was your account hacked?

260
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,538
I'll talk to you later.

261
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,249
Hey! You!

262
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,128
What have I done wrong?

263
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,506
What's she saying?

264
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,466
I wouldn't say I lived like a saint.

265
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,303
But I don't think I was evil
in this life to deserve this.

266
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,390
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

267
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,100
Who was that guy yesterday?

268
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,727
Guy?

269
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,980
The guy on your Instagram page.

270
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,902
Seon Nyeo.
Someone is looking for you.

271
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,280
Me? Who?

272
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:48,740
(Cheon Nam Wook)

273
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,289
Seon Nyeo, do you want me to die?

274
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,923
(Cheon Nam Wook)

275
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,724
Don't disappear on me.

276
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,059
Without you,

277
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,646
I can't breathe.

278
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,777
Did you get that, Ms. Cat?

279
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:35,829
(Preview)

280
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,623
I want to kiss you.

281
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,251
Of course.

282
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,670
I'll help you kiss her
in three days.

283
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,047
She said she doesn't want to.

284

(Credit Cookie)

285
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,194
A path paved by others...

286
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,656
doesn't suit
a lonely fighter like me.

287
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,664
What a nutcase.
