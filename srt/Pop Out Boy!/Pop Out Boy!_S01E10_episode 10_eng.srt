1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:01,335
I won't do it.

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,038
 I'm not leaving.

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:09,941
 I can't go, leaving you here alone.

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,431

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,092
What...

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,755
What have you done?

7
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,652
I really want to graduate with you.

8
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:29,530
I want to turn 18 and go to college with you.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,724
I can't stop thinking about building a future with you.

10
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:34,417
How could I just...

11
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,203
leave?

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,975
But you can't stay.

13
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,962
Don't you think I dream of it, too?

14
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:46,797
I prayed every night

15
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:50,465
promising I'd be good for life if only you could stay.

16
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,745
But the reality is

17
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,126
you'll die if you stay.

18
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,743
Still,

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,672
I want to stay with you longer.

20
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:09,252
Even if it's just for the small things we do every day.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,905
I want to spend my time with you

22
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,824
for just a bit longer.

23
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,996
We even got matching watches.

24
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,331
Let's not waste the chance

25
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,308
to wear them together.

26
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,240

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,767
What are you doing here?

28
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:34,793
What? Am I not allowed?

29
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,624
I didn't make him stay.

30
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:40,834
He chose to.

31
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,634
You're out of your mind. Aren't you?

32
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,540
- Namwook, want anything? 
 - Who me?

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,471
Just say it. And it's yours.

34
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:52,696
Yejoon, you're unbelievable.

35
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,448
Since when were you two so close?

36
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,325
You've never even bought me anything!

37
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:57,784
Things are different for him.

38
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,870
But we've been friends longer!

39
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:02,033
Then, tell me what you want too.

40
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:04,700
Really? Can I really tell you?

41
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,184
Sure. I'll try to forget it right away.

42
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,449
What? Why would you say that?

43
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:13,950
That doesn't make sense.

44
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:19,122
You're so photogenic.

45
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:20,648
Aren't I?

46
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,570
But you're not, Kitten.

47
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,365
You're too beautiful in person.

48
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,681
I look good, huh?

49
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,310
Use that one for my funeral.

50
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,577
What?

51
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,254
I'm kidding.

52
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:44,999
When I die, I don't want a funeral.

53
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,359
Just think of me once a year.

54
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,419
How could you joke about that?

55
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,421
It's not funny!

56
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,227
They say enjoy it if you can't avoid it.

57
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:58,412
Sunnyeo, don't take it so seriously.

58
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,554

59
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,688
- What's up? 
   - Sunnyeo! He gets another try!

60
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:07,688
What?

61
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,197
  Look, see?

62
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:10,524
  July 7th at 7:00 p.m.

63
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,769
It says the date and everything.

64
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:15,028
So he has another chance to

65
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,722
return to the comic book if we do this?

66
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:18,581
Yup.

67
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,617
If it's July 7th...

68
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,218
That's tomorrow.

69
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,150
- Are you going to go? 
 - Yes, obviously!

70
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,359
He'll die if he stays.

71
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,752
Obviously? What do you mean?

72
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:35,115
You stayed because you didn't want to go back, right?

73
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,658
Right.

74
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:38,827
I wouldn't have either.

75
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,436
Or rather,

76
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,708
I probably couldn't.

77
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,226
What about you, Sunnyeo?

78
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:49,271
Isn't it easier knowing that Namwook is

79
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,939
still alive somewhere?

80
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,541
Is that how you feel?

81
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,303
What do you think, Sunnyeo?

82
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,268
I won't get to see you either way.

83
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,171
I support whatever you decide.

84
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,866
I...

85
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,014
want to stay here.

86
00:04:14,014 --> 00:04:18,325
At least I can do whatever I want to here

87
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,301
while I'm still alive.

88
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,705
You'll regret it less that way?

89
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:29,766
Still, I want you to really think it through.

90
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,439
It's a big decision.

91
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,276
Even if he decides to return,

92
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,569
he might die before then.

93
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,145
Minjung!

94
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,848
Why would you say that?

95
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,575
It's true.

96
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:44,868
I'm just saying, be careful.

97
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,844
You never know.

98
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,674
 Mind if I come in?

99
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,925
Not at all. Come on in.

100
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,157
Namwook...

101
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,835
What's up?

102
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:13,054
I was thinking...

103
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,966
Can I sleep over?

104
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,053
Don't get the wrong idea.

105
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,264
What I mean is,

106
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:25,325
tonight may be your last night.

107
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,703
Something might happen to you...

108
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,012
Sure.

109
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,482
I'm okay with that.

110
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,946
You're so brave, Sunnyeo.

111
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:39,422
What do you mean?

112
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,957
You asked to sleep over. What if I make moves on you?

113
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:44,886
You're not the type.

114
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,079
Then, what type am I?

115
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,348
Now you're even cute, huh?

116
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,058
Whatever.

117
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,489
Namwook.

118
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,110
Aren't you scared?

119
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,987
Of what?

120
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:20,705
Of dying.

121
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,941
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.

122
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,304
I'm terrified...

123
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:33,150
of someone close to me leaving like that.

124
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,006
When my mom died,

125
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:40,750
I wasn't mentally prepared at all,

126
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:44,632
so it was really hard on me.

127
00:06:44,632 --> 00:06:48,516
Because I knew it was coming this time,

128
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,945
I thought I'd feel better than last time. But...

129
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,456
But?

130
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,735
It doesn't feel much different.

131
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,021
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,967
I can't stay by your side.

133
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,402
Are you...

134
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,541
still set on not leaving?

135
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:15,952
Yeah.

136
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:23,940
But I like my life better now with you in it.

137
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,557
It is hard to say goodbye and all,

138
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:34,741
but I'm still grateful for you and the time we spent together.

139
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,009
Do I sound selfish?

140
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,470
No.

141
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,631
I'm grateful for the time I got with you.

142
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,629
To be honest,

143
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,032
I don't want you to die,

144
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,146
because...

145
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,728
I like you, Namwook.

146
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,751
What was that for?

147
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,612
Sorry.

148
00:08:23,612 --> 00:08:26,072
But I don't think you should sleep.

149
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,340
Did I sleep?

150
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,883
This won't do. Get up.

151
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,224
Tell me if you feel sleepy again. I'll pinch you.

152
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,963
Once more and I'd be bleeding.

153
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:42,964
Drink some more.

154
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:45,634
Falling asleep could be tragic!

155
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:49,335
I'm not sleepy at all.

156
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,322
I have to run to the bathroom for...

157
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,492
You sure you're not sleepy?

158
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,518
Positive.

159
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,081
You swear?

160
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,559
I swear.

161
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,945
Namwook, don't wander off. Wait for me here.

162
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,329
Okay, I'll be right here.

163
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,746
Excuse me!

164
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:16,181
I'm sorry,

165
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,541
but can you toss us that ball?

166
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:22,192
I guess I'll have to show them what I can do.

167
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,855
Thank you.

168
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,606
I knew it!

169
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:43,908
I knew this would happen.

170
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,795
I never should've had so much coffee.

171
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:49,464
I should've held it a bit longer.

172
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,409
I only got one kiss.

173
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:55,887
How could you leave without a goodbye?

174
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,348
You said you'd stay and wait for me!

175
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:01,008
Why didn't you keep your word?

176
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,486
I wanted to tell you something.

177
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,498
To be honest,

178
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,973
even if it's in the comic book, I still want you to live.

179
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:16,866
I wanted you to remember us

180
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,978
and stay alive somewhere out there.

181
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:22,939
I'd be so lonely holding on to these memories

182
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:26,109
all by myself.

183
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:27,627
I wanted to tell you this...

184
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,679
So how could you leave me?

185
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,618
Sunnyeo.

186
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,898
I'll do as you say.

187
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:54,809
I, too, will hold on to our memories and

188
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,116
live well.

189
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,462

190
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,367

191
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,202
Can you really do it this time?

192
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:22,072
I'll do it perfectly.

193
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,164
Sunnyeo.

194
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,478
I like you too.

195
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:41,689
And I've been meaning to tell you.

196
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,720
Thank you for bringing

197
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:51,841
me into this world and granting me all these moments.

198
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,267
I should be thanking you.

199
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:14,590
♫  Our time is gradually stopping  ♫

200
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,160
♫  Little by little, goodbye. Slowly goodbye  ♫

201
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,530
♫  It's not until now that I'm feeling it  ♫

202
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:31,660
♫  You'll remember me as well as I do  ♫

203
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,920
♫  You and me  ♫

204
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,380
♫  Thank You  ♫

205
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:46,470
♫  The two of us who were happy  ♫

206
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,600
♫  Remember me  ♫

207
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,272

208
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,291
  Namwook returned to the comic book safely.

209
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,955
  At times, it felt as if it were all just a dream.

210
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:08,152
 Some evidence remained that proved it wasn't a dream.

211
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,628
  And the way he changed us became

212
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,805
  some of the evidence.

213
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,320
- That sounds delicious. 
 - I'll add a fried egg on top too.

214
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,121
I love tteokbokki.

215
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,056
Look. Everyone's been wearing chains lately.

216
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,623
- Chains? 
 - Yeah.

217
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,501
That kid started this trend.

218
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,545
What was his name?

219
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:52,279
Cheon Nam... Cheon Nam...

220
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,126
Cheon Namwook!

221
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,877
How's he doing?

222
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,274
I have no idea.

223
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,818
What's with him?

224
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,245
Yejoon.

225
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,158
Will you... please take those chains off?

226
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:31,342
All the other kids are wearing them because of you.

227
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,330
Why would I take them off? They complete my look.

228
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,134
The chains...

229
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,038
put me in a good mood.

230
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,543
You're not Namwook.

231
00:14:43,543 --> 00:14:46,886
I mean, how could you bring chains back into fashion?

232
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,263
Didn't you know retro fashion is back in trend?

233
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,947
Hey. Hi.

234
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:53,876
I just transferred today.

235
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:57,265
I'm Park Jiwon.

236
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:59,640
- I'm... 
 - Han Sunnyeo?

237
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,801
  Han Sunnyeo, as in "Like Sunnyeo"?

238
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,319
Yup.

239
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:08,813
But I'll show you what that saying really means.

240
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,665

241
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,837

242
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,423

243
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,984

244
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,095
Hello?

245
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,555
Yeah, I'm on my way.

246
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,364
  I know you're just packing up!

247
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:35,601
  You better not be late today. It's my birthday, remember?

248
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,478
I won't be late.

249
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,772
I'm nearly there.

250
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,942
  I'm starving!

251
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,642
Coming up!

252
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:51,890

253
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:54,227

254
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,377
Are you sure you followed his recipe?

255
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,821
Yeah, every last step.

256
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:05,573
It doesn't taste like it.

257
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,316
What do you mean?

258
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,784
Let's order in.

259
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:27,216
What could've possibly fallen to make such a loud sound?

260
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,765
Did you hang an elephant on your wall?

261
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:34,018
But there's nothing that would fall...

262
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:36,586
What? I just got chills.

263
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,249
Yejoon, go take a look.

264
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,392
Why should I? I'm a guest.

265
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,079
The host should go.

266
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,882
Yeah.

267
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,336
Show us what being like Sunnyeo is all about!

268
00:16:50,336 --> 00:16:52,512
Listen, being like Sunnyeo

269
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:57,112
means to love and cherish myself, all right?

270
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:04,129
Guys. I'm opening it, okay?

271
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:05,733
I'm sure it was nothing.

272
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,034
Yeah, open it.

273
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,596
Move!

274
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,700
