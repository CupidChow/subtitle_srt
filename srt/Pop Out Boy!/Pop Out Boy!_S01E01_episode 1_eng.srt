1
00:00:01,985 --> 00:00:04,946

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:15,900

3
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:20,169
Who the heck...

4
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:22,413
are you?

5
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:24,774
Me?

6
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,259
The Lone Fighter,

7
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:29,337
Cheon Namwook.

8
00:00:32,474 --> 00:00:34,234
Han Sunnyeo!

9
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:40,974
Are you okay?

10
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,775
Kitten?

11
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:46,370
 No.

12
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,290
I'm not okay.

13
00:00:49,056 --> 00:00:52,003
Cheon Namwook is so cheesy. I can't stand him.

14
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:53,936
What? I think he's hot.

15
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:56,732
You're okay with him calling her Kitten? Doesn't it make you cringe?

16
00:00:56,732 --> 00:00:59,358
That's what makes it so fun.

17
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:02,428
Why read a comic book from ten years ago?

18
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:05,382
Try to like it more since it's been ten years.

19
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:07,192
You and the lead character have the same name,

20
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:10,053
and your mom bought your house thanks to this comic book.

21
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,446
You should be grateful.

22
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,764
Are you kidding me?

23
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:16,561
I've been teased for a decade thanks to this book!

24
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,688
We may have the same name, but I hate her personality.

25
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,348
What I hate even more is

26
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:25,284
how my mom used my name for this awful comic without my permission!

27
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:26,753
Awful comic?

28
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,413
But it's a classic.

29
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:30,248
Classic? Please!

30
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:35,261
It captures the essence of the 2000s in the form of a romance comic book.

31
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,915
The fact that it contains every cliche there is

32
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:40,666
makes it revolutionary.

33
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,287
What's revolutionary?

34
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:46,239
Your fame.

35
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,898
Yejoon, you topped the trending search again.

36
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,221
Let's see.

37
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:54,370
Noh Yejoon. Noh Yejoon photoshoot.

38
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,449
Now, you're eighth.

39
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,690
Are you controlling the trending terms?

40
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,899
Why is "Like Sunnyeo" trending, too?

41
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:04,382
What?

42
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:05,951

43
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,485

44
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:08,780
Darn it!

45
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,679
You all know I don't factor in the fitness test for your grades, right?

46
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,524
Okay!

47
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:14,217
Avoid getting hurt from overexertion.

48
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:17,102
Like you kids always say, run like Sunnyeo. Got it?

49
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:18,888
Got it!

50
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,434

51
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,228
Ready?

52
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,045
Oh, Sunnyeo!

53
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:44,297
You didn't have to run so hard.

54
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,240
Good job.

55
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:52,438
You said to run like Sunnyeo.

56
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,100
Oh, Sunnyeo. Why do the opposite of what you're asked?

57
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,960
Why does everyone say "Like Sunnyeo"?

58
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,289
She's clumsy, weak, and passive.

59
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:03,975
Why use my name to describe such traits!

60
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,338
Whoa!  Whoa! Calm down. Stop stressing.

61
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:10,448
It's your birthday in just seven hours.

62
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:12,675
So... what will you give me?

63
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:16,135
So what food will you be ordering?

64
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,135
Will you be mad if I ask you to walk me home?

65
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,081
No, I'll walk you.

66
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:28,339
- You will? 
 - For â‚©10,000, I will.

67
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:29,927
Never mind.

68
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:32,128
See you later!

69
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,953
 It might have been foreshadowing.

70
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,180
Why are there so many cats around?

71
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:48,494
 She kept running into cats that day.

72
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:53,541
 Was it really by chance that the boy who calls Sunnyeo kitten

73
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,653
 appeared that day?

74
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,304
What?

75
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,314
Why can't you come?

76
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:02,769
My shoot is not over yet.

77
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,061
Yeah, right!

78
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,748
Late because of a shoot? You have three years under your belt.

79
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:07,706
I'm really sorry.

80
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,608
 Yejoon, let's continue the shoot!

81
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:11,417
Coming!

82
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,354
I'll bring your gift tomorrow. I have to go.

83
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:17,565
What do you want?

84
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:21,675
Sunnyeo, I think I have food poisoning.

85
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:24,412
Minjung, you guys are pranking me. Right?

86
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,583
I wish this was a prank, too!

87
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,544
Why do you guys try to prank me the day before April Fool's Day?

88
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:32,304
You're so predictable.

89
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:33,758
I really have to go.

90
00:04:33,758 --> 00:04:34,967
I'm really sorry about this.

91
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:36,610
Hey!  Hey!

92
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:38,294
Hello?

93
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,967
They were serious.

94
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:48,544
It wasn't a prank or an April Fool's Day joke.

95
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:56,312
I really didn't want to be alone today.

96
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,672
What?

97
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,910
What's going on?

98
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:21,203
What was that?

99
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,790
Darn it...!

100
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:41,701
"Happy...

101
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:44,511
18th birthday."

102
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,580
"Thanks."

103
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,864
"I wished for someone to be by my side."

104
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:55,093
 I'm relieved that someone is you.

105
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:58,474
 Relieved?

106
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:00,368
 That hurts.

107
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:06,081
 I feel like I'm going to die

108
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,750
 when you're not around.

109
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,907
 Can I... get a kiss?

110
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,171
"Can I... get a kiss?"

111
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:29,570
Unbelievable. It makes me cringe.

112
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,741

113
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:33,292
Why would mom write such a cheesy book?

114
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,885
 A kiss?

115
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:36,787
 If you want.

116
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:51,928
What's wrong, Kitten?

117
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,729
You suddenly don't want to kiss?

118
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:56,498
What? Kitten?

119
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:58,659
By the way,

120
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,653
where are we?

121
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,880
Whoa!

122
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,910
A crime is being committed.

123
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,046
Yes, by you! This is trespassing!

124
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:11,574
Not that.

125
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:13,641
Because the two of you

126
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,793
are so beautiful,

127
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:21,515
I nearly had a heart attack.

128
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:22,251
You crazy psycho!

129
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,869
I was wondering where you got your good looks, Kitten.

130
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:28,272
Now, I see you got them from your mom.

131
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,359
Kitten?

132
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,313
 POP OUT BOY!

133
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:39,549
Kitten.

134
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:42,262
So it is what I'm thinking.

135
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,896
Kitten.

136
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,090
Is it...

137
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,367
2020?

138
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:52,454
I know it's hard to believe,

139
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,077
but I think this is where you came from.

140
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:04,684
You're right.

141
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,611
Everything we've gone through is right here in this book.

142
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:09,447
I know this is a shock to you too but...

143
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,240
Wow! Incredible!

144
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,859
Kitten, how did you escape the book first?

145
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,316
Will you stop calling me Kitten?

146
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,984
I'm not the Sunnyeo you know.

147
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,869
No?

148
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:26,271
I guess I had it wrong.

149
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:31,007
But you look just like

150
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:34,680
the Kitten I take care of.

151
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:41,844
Get out! Get out!

152
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:46,692
You crazy... You crazy jerk!

153
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:53,040
It was a dream?

154
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:03,551
It was a dream.

155
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:06,129
It was a dream!

156
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,739
That was the worst dream ever.

157
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:09,390
What?

158
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,301
Did you have a nightmare?

159
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,881
You know what?

160
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:19,208
I suddenly have a scar right here.

161
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:23,320
I wonder if it happened on my way here.

162
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,542
Name?

163
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,877
Cheon Namwook

164
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,228
Date of birth?

165
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:42,039
July 2, 1993.

166
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,252
Mister, you're 28.

167
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,850
Don't call me "Mister"!  I'm 18 years...!

168
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,090
Address?

169
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,342
Seonnam, the capital of...

170
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:52,743
Don't you mean Seoul?

171
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:54,719
There's no such place.

172
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,304
That can't be...

173
00:09:57,304 --> 00:10:02,564
So you have nowhere to go?

174
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:04,912
Do you know anyone's phone number?

175
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,432
What?

176
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:21,020
It's the only phone number I know.

177
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:30,195
I have to go.

178
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:32,657
Where are you going?

179
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:34,400
I have to get to school.

180
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,185
What about me?

181
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:38,370
I have nowhere to go.

182
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,016
I had a fine life back at home,

183
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,652
but I came here for you.

184
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:46,595
Whatever! Stay here for now.

185
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:48,080
Really?

186
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,891
Just until you go back!

187
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:55,435
Thank you! Thank... you... Kitten.

188
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,413
Sunnyeo, I'm so sorry.

189
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:08,916
My brother brought home sushi from his work

190
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,460
and I had no idea it had gone bad.

191
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,463
Sunnyeo, it's still your birthday. Let's have the party today.

192
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:18,784
Yeah. We went all out just for you.

193
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:20,789
I don't have any plans today.

194
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:23,856
Minjung and I can go to your place after school.

195
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:25,584
You can't!

196
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,377
Why not?

197
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:32,423
My place is... way too messy.

198
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:33,761
That's old news to us.

199
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:34,903
Yeah, we'll just come over.

200
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,562
You can't!

201
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:42,406
There's a huge load of trash at my place.

202
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,631
My blog!

203
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,184

204
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:51,760
Oh no...

205
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,113
This isn't how it is in my world!

206
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,324

207
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:02,619
Even her birthday's the same as my Kitten's.

208
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,185
What do you think?

209
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:11,180
This must have been so expensive.

210
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,699
I told you we went all out.

211
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,485
Minjung picked that out,

212
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,137
and I got you the A-pod case.

213
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:23,564
Guys, I don't really need these. They're way too expensive.

214
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:26,396
Thank you so much!

215
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:29,013
Thanks. I love them.

216
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:39,199
I must have left my A-pod at home.

217
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,843
I'll put them in the first thing I get home.

218
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:47,232
I know I left them here.

219
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:49,702
I saw it was your birthday today, Kitten.

220
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,013
I told you not to call me that.

221
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,065
I got you something.

222
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,442
Close your eyes.

223
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,386
You're up to no good again, huh?

224
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,579
What are you saying?

225
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,132
Fine.

226
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:06,792
I'll close my eyes, so stop being so corny. Okay?

227
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,006
Give me your hand.

228
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:15,094
What?

229
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:20,149
It used to be mine.

230
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,845
You're using me as a trash can?

231
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,198
I came here empty-handed.

232
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:31,000
Luckily, I had those in my pocket.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,377
No thanks. I already have earphones.

234
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:35,948
Don't be like that.

235
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,659
Why hold on to earphones when the wire is missing?

236
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:40,053
It breaks my heart.

237
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,495
Earphones with missing wire?

238
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:44,432
Hey...

239
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,325
Don't tell me... What did you do with them?

240
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,403
What else?

241
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:53,715
I threw them out.

242
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,839

Even after that incident,

243
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,860
 Namwook continued to drive Sunnyeo up the wall.

244
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:11,940
Can I use your smartphone?

245
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,696
Here.

246
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,300
Thanks, Wifey.

247
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:22,919
What? Wifey?!

248
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,722

Hey!

249
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:26,240

You used up all my data!

250
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,741
I told you to turn the Wi-Fi on.

251
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:30,219
That's strange.

252
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:33,380
I did turn it on.

253
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,349
You did?

254
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:39,809
My signal of love for you is strong.

255
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:44,118

256
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:46,251
I'm so stressed out!

257
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,303
I'm craving tteokbokki.

258
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,192
What's this?

259
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,412

260
00:14:56,412 --> 00:15:00,425

261
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:01,760

262
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,652
Darn it! Delete!

263
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:03,611
Delete!

264
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,072

265
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,116
Hello?

266
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:10,666
 Sunnyeo, did you get hacked?

267
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:13,611
I'll call you back.

268
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:16,055
Hey! How dare you!

269
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:21,462
What did I do to deserve this?

270
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,513
What?

271
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:25,207
I can't say I've always been good,

272
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:29,544
but I wasn't so bad to deserve being punished like this.

273
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:31,605
I don't know what you're saying.

274
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,949
Who was that guy yesterday?

275
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,576
Guy?

276
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:38,971
The guy from your Instagram.

277
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,308
Sunnyeo! Someone's looking for you.

278
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:47,127
For me? Who?

279
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:56,087
Sunnyeo! Are you trying to kill me?

280
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,873
Don't ever leave my side.

281
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,884
Without you,

282
00:16:18,252 --> 00:16:20,454
I can hardly breathe.

283
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,718
All right, Kitten?

284
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:47,970

285
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:54,268
The Lone Fighter

286
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:57,421
takes the road less traveled.

287
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:05,163
What a nutjob.
