1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:02,419
Don't leave me ever again.

2
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:08,383
(Based on a webtoon on Naver,
"Pop Out Boy" by Nimni)

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:12,930
Goodbye.

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,061
This is how it ends?

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,438
Just like that?

6
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:22,981
Nam Wook!

7
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,567
Nam Wook... No!

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,447
When did you two become friends?

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,698
We're not.

10
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,909
Ms. Cat.

11
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,494
Sorry about that.

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,205
Anyway, you both did a great job.

13
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,624
Did you cry?

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,127
What? Why would I?

15
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,464
(Pop Out Boy, Episode 9)

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,176
"I don't regret falling for you."

17
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,972
"Thank you for being my first love."

18
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,474
"I wish you a good life."

19
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,436
Don't just sit there.

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,023
All you have to do is say,
"I'll get going."

21
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,317
"I'll get going."

22
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,739
See this?
The scene must be reenacted.

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,826
July 2, your birthday, at 9pm sharp.

24
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,996
If you get it wrong once,
you can never go back. And then...

25
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,419
Anyway, you have one shot at this.

26
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,674
About what you said
last night though.

27
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,468
You told me to stay by your side.

28
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,305
What did you mean by that?

29
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,515
Nothing much.

30
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,728
- What if I didn't return...
- As if that makes sense.

31
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,107
I meant you should stay with me
until you went back.

32
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,151
We can't have you wandering off.

33
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,570
Is that all?

34
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,491
Anyway, bring me that thing.

35
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,036
What thing?

36
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,830
(1. Get a cat with Ms. Cat,
2. 2NE1 getting back together)

37
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,709
You don't know
what a bucket list is, do you?

38
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,920
Of course, I do.

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,796
World peace or the reunification
of North and South Korea...

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,758
aren't what you wish for
on a bucket list.

41
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,427
I wrote those
before I learned of that.

42
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,262
There's more on the back.

43
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,143
(Walking to school with Seon Nyeo,
Studying with Seon Nyeo,)

44
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,103
(Doing laundry with Seon Nyeo,
Grocery shopping with Seon Nyeo)

45
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,230
What on earth?

46
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,565
I thought there'd be
something meaningful.

47
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,734
We already did all of these.

48
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,736
But this'll be for the last time.

49
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,912
All right, then. We'll do them all.

50
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,831
I'm adding one to the list though.

51
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,210
- Which is what?
- It's a secret.

52
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,128
- Why is that? Let me see.
- No way.

53
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,020
I'm keeping this.

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,779
Is there anywhere you want to go
or anything you want to have?

55
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,155
Seon Nyeo,

56
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,451
I can't wrap my head around
your sudden nice gestures.

57
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,787
Now you hate that I'm nice?

58
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,542
It won't be memorable
if I don't do anything different.

59
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,796
The last thing I want is for
you to forget how nice I was.

60
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,464
I don't want to have wasted my time.

61
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,342
So I should ask
for something different?

62
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,427
That's right.

63
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,604
I figured that this would make
the experience special.

64
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,025
If you don't want to,

65
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,861
I'll let go.

66
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,407
I'm good.

67
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,169
Hi.

68
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,345
(Walking to school with Seon Nyeo)

69
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,932
There are three types of milk
in this world.

70
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,017
Do you know what they are?

71
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,560
Enlighten me.

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,355
Chocolate milk, strawberry milk,

73
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,774
and I love you!

74
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,780
Why are you pretending
like you didn't hear me?

75
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,909
(Grocery shopping with Seon Nyeo)

76
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,829
- What?
- You'll hurt yourself that way.

77
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,873
How else can I chop these?

78
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,046
Stop!

79
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,759
(Cooking with Seon Nyeo)

80
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,929
To make most of his remaining time,

81
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,266
Seon Nyeo and Nam Wook
did their very best.

82
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,227
I'll get going then.

83
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:11,979
Noh Ye Joon.

84
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,899
It's fine. Just take care, okay?

85
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:21,321
Seon Nyeo, can I give
Nam Wook a hug?

86
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,490
Why are you asking
for her permission and not mine?

87
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,908
Go ahead.

88
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,413
You, get over here.

89
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,622
Park Min Jung!

90
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,836
You were a great friend
who popped out of a comic book.

91
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,175
Goodbye, Cheon Nam Wook.

92
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,593
If it weren't for you,

93
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,387
I wouldn't have made through
these tough times.

94
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,931
Thank you.

95
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,184
Adios.

96
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,644
What a piece of work.

97
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,480
- It's late. You should get going.
- Sure.

98
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,109
Why?

99
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,862
Why do you need us
to go home so early?

100
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,114
Don't be ridiculous
and get going while I ask nicely.

101
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,240
Why?

102
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,783
Are you going to hold hands again?

103
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,286
Or maybe there will be a smooch?

104
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,370
Come on.

105
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,830
Bye, Nam Wook!

106
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,415
I wish you a good life.

107
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,791
Be happy!

108
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,086
- Come on.
- Fine!

109
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,470
- Shall we head in?
- Sure.

110
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,975
I wanted to ignore
the subtle moments of sadness...

111
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,145
and leave them as something
I needed to move on from...

112
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,814
after he finally leaves.

113
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:41,985
What's your take on this?

114
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,904
- This?
- Yes.

115
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:44,988
Well...

116
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,406
What?

117
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,160
Funny, right?

118
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,828
(Watching TV with Seon Nyeo
all night)

119
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,124
Let me know
what you added to the list.

120
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,377
Do you want to know?

121
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,254
What is it?

122
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,138
Look natural
and smile so that your teeth show.

123
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,768
No, the expression is too stiff.
Give me a bigger smile.

124
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,020
Nam Wook, what are you doing?

125
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,397
Ms. Cat!

126
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,608
Seeing your girlfriend
puts a big smile on your face.

127
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,736
- What?
- Come this way for a second.

128
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,113
Stay right here.

129
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,823
Think of the camera
as your girlfriend...

130
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,533
and give me a bigger smile.

131
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,369
Nice, that's it.

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,415
My gosh. You finally
understand my directions.

133
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,171
Can't you act a bit more natural?

134
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,798
You're awful at taking photos.

135
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,050
You weren't good
at the beginning either.

136
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:48,886
She's right.

137
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,430
Boyfriend, step over here.

138
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,932
Put a smile on that face.

139
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,143
Just do what you did earlier.

140
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,394
- Like this?
- Yes.

141
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,855
That's what I'm talking about.

142
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,064
Be bolder.

143
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,443
I love you, Seon Nyeo.

144
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,573
Was taking photos together...

145
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,450
what you wanted to do?

146
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,910
No.

147
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,830
(Graduating together)

148
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,081
Graduating together.

149
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,337
I thought you said
the wish can't be far-fetched.

150
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,757
How can I possibly
graduate with you?

151
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,717
Why not?

152
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,805
There's always a way.

153
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,018
There you go.

154
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,354
How do I look?

155
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,356
Does it suit me?

156
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,066
Just a second.

157
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,195
There.

158
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,492
Now you really look
like you're graduating.

159
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,662
This wasn't necessary, you know.

160
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,957
I already have
the prettiest flower in this world.

161
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,750
And it's...

162
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,835
Me?

163
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,841
I'm flustered to hear you
say it yourself.

164
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,719
Let's just take the photos.

165
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,281
Seon Nyeo, what do you
want to study in college?

166
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,199
PS and D.

167
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,118
Like an orthopedic surgeon?

168
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,453
No, it stands for
political science and diplomacy.

169
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,291
Wow, does that mean
you'll be a diplomat?

170
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,876
I guess I could.

171
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,837
It's what I'm interested in,

172
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,505
so I'll think about it as I study.

173
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,717
- What about you?
- Me?

174
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,512
I've never put any thought into it.

175
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,351
Theater and film?

176
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:08,525
Is it because you want the world
to see how handsome you are?

177
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,277
No.

178
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,572
What I saw on set the other day
seemed like fun.

179
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,242
Also, Matilda said
I had what it takes.

180
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,452
Matilda?

181
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,246
Are you still in contact with her?

182
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,081
Of course not.

183
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,293
Ms. Cat, are you jealous?

184
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,878
As if.

185
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,257
You are, right? You are.

186
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,301
Keep at this
and I won't give you your gift.

187
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,802
My gift?

188
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,721
What kind of gift?

189
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,349
It's nothing. Let's forget about it.

190
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,226
Of course, you aren't jealous.

191
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:45,437
I won't say another word about it.

192
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,773
So what's the gift?

193
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,566
Close your eyes.

194
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,575
It's to celebrate your birthday
and graduation.

195
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,377
What...

196
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,588
Is this...

197
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,091
a matching watch?

198
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,983
It's just like the one I gave you.

199
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,401
Right.

200
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,530
Seon Nyeo couldn't
give Nam Wook more time,

201
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,032
so she settled for a watch.

202
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,534
- It's pretty.
- I know.

203
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:44,079
(T minus 30 minutes)

204
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,583
You can do this, right?

205
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,339
What must you say?

206
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:57,759
"I'll..."

207
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,470
"get going."

208
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,391
Good.

209
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,576
"I don't regret falling for you."

210
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,373
"Thank you for being my first love."

211
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,588
"I wish you a good life."

212
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:50,646
No.

213
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:54,608
I won't go.

214
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,196
I can't...

215
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,115
just leave.
