1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,850
Why'd you call us up to the rooftop?

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,550
Here. I wanted to give it back.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,970
Cheon Namhee, is this yours?

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,510
His name isn't Cheon Namhee.

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,840
It's Cheon Namwook.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,350
Yeah! That's ours!

7
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,010
Ours?

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,330
You can have it back if you go on a date with me.

9
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,920
He'll go on a date with you if you give it back.

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,120
I will?

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,250
You must not need it.

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,930
No!

13
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,494

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,950
No!

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,510

Calm down.

16
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,050
- Careful. 
 - Don't do it.

17
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,700

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,030
Buy a first date gift?

19
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,810
Yeah.

20
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,730
With what money? You're broke.

21
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,650
With what I made at my part-time job.

22
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,320
You have to chip in for rent, not buy a gift!

23
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,440
This is pretty, isn't it?

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,780
It is pretty.

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,431
I'll get this then.

26
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:58,515
Hey! Focus on getting on your landlord's good side!

27
00:00:58,515 --> 00:01:00,450
I've made things too easy for you, huh?

28
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,210
Why am I so sleepy today?

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,410
Today?

30
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,394
You always nod off.

31
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:19,640
Did you pull an all-nighter?

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,850
Of course, he wouldn't.

33
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,340
Why is everyone studying so hard?

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,790
Minjung, even you?

35
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,230
I have a conscience, you know.

36
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,710
The exams are in an hour.

37
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,700
What? That was today?

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,850
 Namwook was very sleepy,

39
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,050
 so he spent most of the exam napping.

40
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,400
 And then,

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,230
 the three days of exams came to an end.

42
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,460
Cheon. Nam. Joon.

43
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,520
Hey, is it hot in here?

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,780
No, not really.

45
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,500
I guess it's just you that's hot.

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,740
At least someone appreciates me for what I am.

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,380
  What do you want to do on our date? Where should we go?

48
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,110
He can't get it back like that.

49
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,300
Get what back?

50
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,150
Oh. My pen.

51
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,410
I lent it to him.

52
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,710
- Where's Namwook? 
 - He has a date.

53
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,330
He does?

54
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,000
With who?

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,160
Tell me!

56
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,920
Let's get out of here and have some fun.

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,290
That's random.

58
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,910
What? Love that idea.

59
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,320
Where do you want to go?

60
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,550
Karaoke? Ice cream?

61
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,660
Asked him out on a date?

62
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,090
I did?

63
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,900
I asked Namho out? Why?

64
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,100
Namwook is on a date with her?

65
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,940
 Why are you all here?

66
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,950
 Are you waiting for me?

67
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,320
♫  Almost Paradise. Brighter than the morning  ♫

68
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,550
  A must-have for hot guys is military boots to match his outfit.

69
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,660
 Tuck your pants into the boots.

70
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,120
 Want to know what's trendy?

71
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,290
 Chains are good.

72
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,350
 Wear a black vest with a white t-shirt.

73
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,150
 Making sure you look stylish.

74
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,730
 Add a fedora for a modern, trendy look.

75
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,040
 It'll add a little flair to any mundane look.

76
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,780
What the heck is he wearing?

77
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,010
I just gave him a nice haircut!

78
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,300
Ina will surely decide not to see him again.

79
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,620
Is he insane?

80
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,610
Your incredible sense of style makes me fall for you harder!

81
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,290
You look like you're from 2010.

82
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,550
They say retro is the most stylish of all.

83
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,440
A style icon indeed.

84
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,770
Alert the fashion industry that

85
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,470
the revolution has begun.

86
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,930
Mind if I sit with you?

87
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,800
I'd like to sit at the same table as the man who revolutionized fashion.

88
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,180
In that case, absolutely.

89
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,880
That darn Namwook effect.

90
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,390
Why would I sit with you?

91
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,010
I take that back.

92
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,780
Are you Noh Yejoon of Yeonli High?

93
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,430
Yes. That's me.

94
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,710
I'm a huge fan!

95
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,260
Can we get a picture with you?

96
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,790
Of course.

97
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,550
Can you by any chance...

98
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,190
Oh. Me too, huh?

99
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,700
I'm feeling a bit shy.

100
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,150
  Please take it however you want.

101
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,600
Oh. Right.

102
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,440
What a real celeb you are!

103
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,030
Get any more famous and we won't be able to ride the metro together anymore.

104
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,550
Whatever.

105
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,650
Don't worry about it.

106
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,460
Namki, you're the only real celebrity I see.

107
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,590
Ah.

108
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,760
No thanks.

109
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,570
I only want to be a celebrity to one person.

110
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,430
Yeah?

111
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,340
I guess that comic book isn't all that important.

112
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,400
I guess I can just keep...

113
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,850
You make a cute couple.

114
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,780
Thanks. You two make a cute couple, too.

115
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,640
- You two? 
 - You.

116
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,410
- Whatever! 
 - Whatever!

117
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,110
Just look at you two.

118
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,870
Just a minute.

119
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,920
My intuition is telling me something.

120
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,610
- About what? 
 - Who is it?

121
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,350
Her? Or Sunnyeo?

122
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,120
- What's that? 
 - This is a selfie you took with Matilda. She posted it.

123
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,850
I'm allowed to do readings with my co-star.

124
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,740
Then, is it Sunnyeo?

125
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,920
Right.

126
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,260
Pool halls are best for hanging out in a group.

127
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,460
Pool halls are so out these days.

128
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,280
What? I think it'll be fun.

129
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,910
You're so awesome!

130
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,680
Namjoon, how do you play pool?

131
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,490
Stretch your left arm out to create a straight line 
 between the bridge and your grip.

132
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,130
How?

133
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,170
Will you help me with my stance?

134
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,180
Sunnyeo, have you ever played pool?

135
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,390
Of course not.

136
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,130
- Put your arm out like this. 
 - Like this?

137
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,250
Keep your torso still.

138
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,080
Keep this part steady.

139
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,230
- Keep what steady? 
 - Over here.

140
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,810
Play and bet something!

141
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,380
I think I got it.

142
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,010
There's one thing I'm not good at.

143
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,830
Losing at a game I want to win.

144
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,910
Like right now. I want to beat her so bad.

145
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,530
Do what I did.

146
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,680
- What are you doing? 
 - This darn chalk!

147
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,300
Sunnyeo, it's all over my hand now!

148
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,780
You go like this.

149
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,540

150
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,650
Namjoon!

151
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,600
Not there. A bit higher.

152
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,640
You can't do it for her!

153
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,090
Hit it very lightly.

154
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,210
- There you go! 
 - Nice!

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,030

156
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,530
- It went in! 
 - You win!

157
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,510
Woohoo!

158
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,710
Nice!

159
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,670
What are you doing?

160
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,230
Sorry.

161
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,670
Thank you.

162
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,190
This is all we get? Weak.

163
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,750
That's true.

164
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,040
How about losers buy dinner? What'd you say?

165
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,350
Sorry.

166
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,030
We have somewhere to be.

167
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,530
We do?

168
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,820
As in you and me?

169
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,650
Bye.

170
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,210
Where are you taking me?

171
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,980
Can't you tell me?

172
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,610
Come with me and you'll find out.

173
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,590
I'll give you your comic back, too.

174
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,660
I have to get going, too.

175
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,280
I have lines to memorize.

176
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,470
I figured you were hanging out more than usual.

177
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,870
Bye, superstar.

178
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,620
Sunnyeo.

179
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,860
Yeah?

180
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,080
I'm leaving.

181
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,820
Oh. Okay. Bye.

182
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,430
- Who do you like more? 
 - What are you talking about?

183
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,510
The man of destiny your mom made for you or Yejoon, your friend?

184
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,620
I thought it was Namwook this whole time,

185
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,940
but I realized today the better, more modern-day story would be to choose

186
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,190
Yejoon over Namook, don't you think?

187
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,210
What are you talking about?

188
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,900
Hey! I'm not your comic book character!

189
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,510
I don't have to live my life the way you want me to.

190
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,500
I'm not saying you have to.

191
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,770
Why? Who do you like more?

192
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,360
I'll help you get who you want!

193
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,810
What? She didn't give it to you?

194
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,240
She said she left the comic book at home.

195
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,440
And you believed her?

196
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,170
She's just trying to get more dates out of you!

197
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,870
- You think? 
 - So? Are you two going out again?

198
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,000
- When? 
 - Tomorrow.

199
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,660
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

200
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,240
Why do you ask? Jealous?

201
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,970
You're even cuter when you're jealous, Kitten.

202
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,710
Jealous? No way.

203
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,170
I'm just worried you won't get the comic book back.

204
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,030
I'll get it from her tomorrow, no matter what.

205
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,870
Don't. I'll get it from her.

206
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,990
I can't believe this. Can it be more awkward?

207
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,750
If you dress like yesterday, I'm never hanging out with you again.

208
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,300
I'm okay with looking awkward since you picked it out for me.

209
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,730
Are you going to keep following me?

210
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,880
Why? Can't I come with you?

211
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,110
When Ina sees you, the Namwook effect may get worse.

212
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,630
Ina, Namwook...

213
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,910
You came in his stead?

214
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,930
What a relief.

215
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,780
Right. Well, did you bring the comic book?

216
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,200
Yup.

217
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,830
I'm sorry it took me so long to return it.

218
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,160
I feel so out of control lately.

219
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,040
Sunnyeo, I think you're really amazing.

220
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,020
The Sunnyeo from the comic book

221
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,390
can't compare to you.

222
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,310
I see.

223
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,690
Thanks.

224
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,880
I don't know why I tormented you like that.

225
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,740
Why do I even like Cheon Nami?

226
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,170
It's probably not your fault.

227
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,300
It's yours.

228
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,280
Is that what you thought I'd say, just like that?

229
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,000
Hey!

230
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,350
Hey. I'll take this.

231
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,240
I'll put it in your bag.

232
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,600
 - Daebak 
 - What?

233
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,870
  I'll send you something interesting.

234
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,321
-   Matilda and Yejoon, new actors who just became a couple.   
 - OMG.

235
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,250
  Yejoon and Matilda became a real couple thanks to the drama?

236
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,730
Is this for real?

237
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,760
I'm hurt. Why didn't he tell me?

238
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,210
What?

239
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,310
Yejoon. An article just popped up saying he's dating Matilda.

240
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,030
Oh. Really?

241
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,172
  What are you doing?

242
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,780
  About to head home.

243
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,410
  Why?

244
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,790
Sunnyeo, I have something to give you.

245
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,820
Something to give me? What?

246
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,140
Tada!

247
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,680
You're giving it to me because you couldn't give it to Ina, huh?

248
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,110
It was for you from the start.

249
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,680
Thanks.

250
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,700
You two were together?

251
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,600
What are you doing here?

252
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,130
What you saw isn't true.

253
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,490
What?

254
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,400
The article isn't true.

255
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,870
I'm not with her.

256
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,280
I don't even like her.

257
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,620
You ran all the way here to tell me that?

258
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,954
 - We're here. 
 - Where are we?

259
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:22,870
 Where I'll confess my feelings for you.

260
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,570
 I like you, Namyoung.

261
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,930
 I'm sorry.

262
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,700
 My name isn't Cheon Namyoung.

263
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,870
 And I have feelings for someone else.

264
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,910
 Who?

265
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,670
 Han Sunnyeo?

266
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,140
 I'm sorry.

267
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,570
 I only have enough room in my heart for one girl.

268
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:53,098
 You know Sunnyeo and Namwook have a sad ending, don't you?

269
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,550
 Your happiness won't last!

270
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,470
 She and I have nothing to do with that story.
