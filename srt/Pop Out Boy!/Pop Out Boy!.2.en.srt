1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:01,710
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,757
I want to kiss you.

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,644
(Based on a webtoon on Naver,
"Pop Out Boy" by Nimni)

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,064
(Pop Out Boy, Episode 2)

5
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,192
- Why would I kiss you?
- Wait, hold on.

6
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:30,948
What would you do if I had to
kiss you to return to the cartoon?

7
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,866
- What?
- I mean, think about it.

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,826
When you read the line,
"Can you kiss me?",

9
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,829
I jumped out of the cartoon.

10
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,873
And in the cartoon,
I was about to kiss you.

11
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,334
I have a good feeling about this.

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,253
Even just the thought of it
sickens me.

13
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,381
Oh, I see.

14
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,133
You actually don't want me
to go back. Right, Ms. Cat?

15
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,135
Stop calling me "Ms. Cat".

16
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,388
That makes you look
even more like a cat.

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,183
Don't do anything cheesy
especially in front of my friends.

18
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,104
Hi, guys. I'm Cheon Nam Wook,
a lonely fighter.

19
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,148
Are you guys my cutie-pie
Ms. Cat's friends?

20
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,904
You know that this is like
straight out of the cartoon, right?

21
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,032
So a newbie transferred
to our school, and you know him?

22
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,076
And his name happens
to be Cheon Nam Wook?

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,037
You guys also... I mean, you know
the character, Cheon Nam Wook?

24
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,209
Of course. Cheon Nam Wook
is the most perfect character...

25
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,752
in the history of romance comics.

26
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,968
Well, he's not that perfect.

27
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,636
Why on earth
did I say that just now?

28
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,805
- Are you feeling all right?
- Well, anyway...

29
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,351
I have to say, he looks exactly like
that cartoon character.

30
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,688
From his hairstyle
to the way he talks...

31
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,815
It's the style that was popular
10 years ago.

32
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,153
But he still looks so cool.

33
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,030
He really is
straight out of the cartoon.

34
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,037
- What was that?
- What's up with that gross tone?

35
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,707
The character, Cheon Nam Wook,
in "Seon Nyeo and Nam Wook"...

36
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,293
was modeled after this guy.

37
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,712
- How long have you been friends?
- What?

38
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,547
I thought
we were your only friends...

39
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,174
because of your bad temper.

40
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,800
I've been too nice to you.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,093
Do you want a taste
of my "bad temper"?

42
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,014
Anyway, you never told us that you
had a friend named Cheon Nam Wook.

43
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,391
We're not friends.
He's just a guy I know.

44
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,977
He's closer to my mom.
Right, Nam Wook?

45
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,896
Oh, I see.
Is he your mom's friend's son?

46
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,233
Nam Wook, why did you transfer
to our school?

47
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,275
Did you move to this area?

48
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,735
No, because I missed her.

49
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,695
My dear Seon Nyeo.

50
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,158
What? I can't believe he can say
something so cringe-worthy...

51
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,369
without even batting an eye.

52
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,913
He can do it
because he has no shame.

53
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,086
Hey, do you really have
feelings for Seon Nyeo?

54
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,296
I want to kiss her.
That I know for sure.

55
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,632
My gosh, that's how
you express your feelings for her?

56
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,343
How honest and refreshing.
I like that.

57
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,761
Why do you ask?

58
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,889
I'd love to see Seon Nyeo
dating someone.

59
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,392
And if you happen to be that guy...

60
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,936
We'd be the cutest couple on earth.

61
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,857
No, it'll be entertaining because
you're so not right for each other.

62
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,610
I'll help you kiss her
in three days.

63
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,778
Seriously?

64
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,412
Seon Nyeo always has her guard up.

65
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,124
Catch her off guard
when she's least expecting it.

66
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,667
Seon Nyeo.

67
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,963
Why are you staring at me?

68
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,674
What? Am I giving you butterflies?

69
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,509
No.

70
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,096
I'm going to punch you.

71
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,223
After that, show her
that you're a man too.

72
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,933
Flaunt your manly charm.

73
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,476
Now!

74
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,737
The world in 2020...

75
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,823
was very different from the world
I was used to in 2010,

76
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,950
the year I came from.

77
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:06,205
And I wanted to check...

78
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,917
if a kiss with Ms. Cat...

79
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,920
would send me back
to the world inside the cartoon.

80
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,590
I have to check.

81
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,177
Wait.

82
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,180
I don't care about other things,
but just remember...

83
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,016
- that I learned jiujitsu.
- I surrender.

84
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,102
Wait up, Ms. Cat.

85
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,527
What? Aren't you the handsome guy...

86
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,363
who's 185cm tall?
The lonely fighter, Cheon Nam Wook.

87
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:40,739
What?

88
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,159
"Lonely fighter"?
What did I just say?

89
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,494
Are you losing your mind?

90
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,578
I'm sorry...

91
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,290
I suppose even Cheon Nam Wook...

92
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,418
is like an obedient puppy
when he's with his girlfriend.

93
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,963
- What? "Obedient"?
- I'm not his girlfriend!

94
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,923
(Han Yi Deun)

95
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,174
I'm sorry!

96
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,053
This is happening
because of you, right?

97
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,222
I'm very used to things like this.

98
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,475
Doesn't everyone deal with bullies
provoking them at least once a day?

99
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,810
No, not at all.

100
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,272
- I'll carry that for you.
- No need.

101
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,982
- What is it, Yi Na?
- What?

102
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,651
It's nothing.

103
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,153
Seon Nyeo, what's your type?

104
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,031
I've never really thought about it.

105
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,451
Then think about it now.

106
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,123
Someone who looks cool when
he's focused on what he has to do?

107
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,586
What do I have to do now?
Eat my lunch.

108
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:39,798
What else?

109
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,384
I'd like someone who's quick-witted.

110
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:45,971
The bulgogi is almost gone.

111
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,809
I'll go bring some more.

112
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,103
More bulgogi.

113
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,856
How random.

114
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,327
What the...

115
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,579
Are you all right?

116
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,248
- Hey, Yoon Yi Na.
- Yoon Yi Na.

117
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,002
- Yes?
- You just knocked my juice over.

118
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:18,754
You can't just walk away like that.

119
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:20,881
My gosh!

120
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,468
I'm so sorry. How did that happen?

121
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,803
I'm sorry, Seon Nyeo.

122
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,681
Is she actually sorry or not?

123
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,308
Oh, no.

124
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,185
Can I please have more bulgogi?

125
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,189
Oh, come on. Give me a little more.

126
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,067
Gosh. A little more, please.

127
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,318
Your uniform is soaked.

128
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,737
Do you want to wear mine instead?

129
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,448
No, it's okay.

130
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,079
Thanks.

131
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,751
It's all your fault.

132
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,170
What?

133
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,214
I mean,
what Yi Na did to me earlier.

134
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,591
Weird things have been happening
nonstop since you showed up.

135
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,387
So you think everything is my fault,
Ms. Cat.

136
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,474
What can I do to send him back?

137
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,436
I told you. A kiss is the answer.

138
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,648
Even in fairy tales, a kiss removes
the curse and solves all problems.

139
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,150
I guess you're confused.

140
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,987
The girl you're meant to be with
is Han Seon Nyeo in that cartoon,

141
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,154
not me!

142
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,119
But now, you're...

143
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,539
the one for me.

144
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,380
Hashtag, lonely fighter.

145
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,632
Hashtag, keep in touch.

146
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,967
He doesn't even have a smartphone.

147
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,138
- Seon Nyeo.
- Yes?

148
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,473
- The snack shop?
- Sure!

149
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,810
How could she not like me?

150
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,441
You see, it's good to have
a healthy dose of self-confidence,

151
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,984
but you have too much of it.

152
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,737
I mean,
unless she likes someone else...

153
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,787
No way.

154
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,665
Do not...

155
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,376
make that kind of face
in front of other guys.

156
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,546
Don't drift away from me.

157
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,967
What the... You piece of trash.

158
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,140
Seriously, you and your temper.

159
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,392
How could you throw trash
at someone?

160
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,774
Do they still have apple juice?

161
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,359
Yes. Only a few though.

162
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,818
Really?

163
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,239
Hey, we've got to run.

164
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,032
Why? Gosh.

165
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,246
What's their relationship?

166
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,581
They've been close friends
for 5 years since 7th grade.

167
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,293
Don't tell me
Seon Nyeo has a crush on that guy.

168
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,215
What? Come on, of course not.

169
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:09,967
It's all good then.

170
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,552
But it doesn't mean you can...

171
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,595
just trust that nothing would ever
happen between them.

172
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,305
In romantic dramas,
you always see...

173
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,099
the female leads
with their close guy friends.

174
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,226
It shows how relatable it is
as a subject matter,

175
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:23,105
and many couples were actually
friends before they started dating.

176
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,649
- You're good.
- I'm pretty good, right?

177
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,985
- Nice!
- Yes!

178
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,988
- Nice!
- Darn it.

179
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,155
I love you, Han Seon Nyeo!

180
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,163
Stop it.

181
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,584
Stop it, seriously!

182
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:45,794
What's with him?

183
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,186
- What's going on?
- Hey, why hit the same team?

184
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,228
- Aren't they the same team?
- What's with her?

185
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,064
Hey, she almost got hurt.

186
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,737
Are you all right, Ms. Cat?

187
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,449
I'm fine,
but I'm not okay with your lines.

188
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,451
Here.

189
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,453
Why should I eat yours?

190
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,206
- I don't want to see you listless.
- Whatever, I don't want it.

191
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,540
My stomach is upset now.

192
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,419
- By the way, where's Nam Wook?
- Hey!

193
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,048
Hearing his name is making me
all anxious for some reason.

194
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,550
I feel as though
he'll suddenly show up.

195
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,221
What's this?

196
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,432
- Nice!
- Go, Han Seon Nyeo!

197
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,809
- Congratulations!
- Go, Han Seon Nyeo!

198
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,520
So cool!

199
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,438
- Han Seon Nyeo!
- "I give you permission!"

200
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,235
My kitty cat, Han Seon Nyeo.

201
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,865
I give you permission
to fall for me.

202
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,453
Would you let me...

203
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:03,956
kiss you?

204
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,087
I never told you to do
something like this.

205
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:13,632
So? I bet you probably want
to let me kiss you by now.

206
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,178
Why on earth
are you doing this to me?

207
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:19,972
She doesn't want to, okay?

208
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,856
I have to avoid him at all costs.

209
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,148
Who knows what he'll do next?

210
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:34,820
Microphone check.
Han Seon Nyeo, are you listening?

211
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,783
There's something wrong with me.

212
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,870
I have 2 eyes and 2 ears,

213
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,622
but there's only one person...

214
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:47,833
I can see and hear.

215
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,504
It's strange, isn't it?

216
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,672
Hey, why do you even like him?

217
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,882
There's more.

218
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,676
I can't stand it when I see you
with another guy.

219
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,555
Especially Noh Ye Joon. I absolutely
hate seeing you with him.

220
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,643
That being said, Seon Nyeo...

221
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,105
Do I have feelings for you?

222
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,405
What's this about?

223
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,657
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

224
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,242
Let's kiss.

225
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,287
What? Are you sure?

226
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:29,082
You said you didn't want to do it.
Why are you being like this?

227
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,420
Because I'd rather just get it
over with to send you back.

228
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,966
- Deal?
- Deal.

229
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,530
(Credit Cookie)

230
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:04,952
Darn it.

231
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,745
(Lonely fighter)

232
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,921
Is this Seon Nyeo's place?
