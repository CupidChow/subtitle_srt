1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,180

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,440
Hey. You don't live alone, you know.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,150
Put some clothes on.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,840
Why?

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,120
Are you finally feeling something for me?

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,410
Fine.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,140
I'll be careful.

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,730

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,090
A tour of a college campus is fun.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,490
What a big campus.

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,100
Yeah. I can't believe I'm at a college.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,060
Namwook, what do you want to major in?

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,900
I can't go to college.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,830
When I go back to the comic book, I'll be 18 forever.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,650
You're going back?

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,180
Yeah.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,100
Click!

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,110
Look, I got a watch. Isn't it pretty?

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,720
Huh? A watch?

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,290
You don't like watches and rings, saying they get in the way.

21
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,320
It was a gift. From Namwook.

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,730
What?

23
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,660
He got you a gift?

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,240
Look.

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,830
- You don't have to wear it if it's uncomfortable. 
 - It's not though.

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,170
If you only kept it because it was a gift, you can give it to someone else.

27
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,230
I'm keeping it!

28
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,600
So... where should we go?

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,360
I hear the waffles are good here.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,170
Want to get some?

31
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,300
No thanks.

32
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,560
I'm not hungry.

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,070

34
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,290
Then, let's split into pairs. Okay?

35
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,530
Wait up, Namwook!

36
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,930
Unbelievable.

37
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,300
What's gotten into Namwook?

38
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,680
Wow. Seoyeon University swag!

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,220
If I study with this, do you think I'll get into this school?

40
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,140
Aren't schools like this for people like Sunnyeo?

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,610
Why do you make everything about her?

42
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,050
What did you buy?

43
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,500
Huh?

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,910
Are you filming a tragic movie or something?

45
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,930
You're not terminally ill.

46
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,240
We're all terminally ill.

47
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,010
We're closer to death each passing day.

48
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,130
What are you doing?

49
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,770
I'll let Sunnyeo slide, but not you!

50
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,320
My notebook!

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,740
Darn it. Darn Namwook effect...

52
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,870
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,340
But since I'm not with Sunnyeo,

54
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,020
she's safe from the harassment.

55
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,320
It's infuriating to be at the receiving end.

56
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,950
Sunnyeo's so patient. A real saint.

57
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:10,030

58
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,110
- How is it? 
 - Good. Totally.

59
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,990
Sweets work wonders when you're mad.

60
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,300
Stop getting it all over yourself.

61
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,670
I'm doing just fine, all right?

62
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,880
- Isn't that Noh Yejoon? 
 - It is!

63
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,730
- Is that his girlfriend? 
 - I think so. He caressed her face.

64
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,640
What are you doing?

65
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,740
We were... Are you Noh Yejoon?

66
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,810
We're just shocked to see you.

67
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,160
Yes, I'm Yejoon.

68
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,100
- Want to take a selfie together? 
 - Yes!

69
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,260
I'd prefer my friend not to be in the photo.

70
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,760
Oh, she's just a friend.

71
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,010
Thank you.

72
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,790
Wow. A celeb!

73
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,510
How amazing. Even college students recognize you.

74
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,700
I'm confiscating this.

75
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,990
What?

76
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,740
You don't have the right to.

77
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,260
I know. But you're not going to wear it anyway.

78
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,710
  I wasn't even wearing it that long,

79
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,270
but I miss it.

80
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,570
- Cheon Namwook. 
 - What?

81
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,650
Did I do something wrong?

82
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,210
No. You didn't.

83
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,900
Then, why are you being like this?

84
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,440
Just a couple days ago,

85
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,220
you were considering staying for good.

86
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,010
But now you want to go back?

87
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:10,734
Why?

88
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:14,660
Because I changed my mind.

89
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,550
- What? 
 - Your wish was for me to move out of your place.

90
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,300

91
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,970
So... you're...

92
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,400
I mean... This kid is...

93
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,930
You popped out of this book?

94
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,910
Yup. The real Namwook.

95
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,510
Stop playing.

96
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,070
That's the normal response to have.

97
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,380
Fine, if you don't believe me.

98
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,350
Why pour water on it...

99
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,740
Now, do you believe him?

100
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,200
Minjung! How long have you known?

101
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,340
It's been a while now.

102
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,170
You kept me in the dark all this time?

103
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,730
Would you have said, "Oh! I see."

104
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,470
And simply believed us?

105
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:14,608
Namwook, you can stay at my place.

106
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,390
What?

107
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,890
Sunnyeo, you couldn't be comfortable with him living here.

108
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,000
That's true, but I'm used to him now.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,160
I did bring him out. I should take responsibility...

110
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,480
Okay. I'll move in with you.

111
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,010
That's wonderful! Isn't it?

112
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,150
Come on in.

113
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,180
It doesn't really make Sunnyeo happy,

114
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,060
so I'm holding on to it.

115
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,130
It's not her style either.

116
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,540
I don't agree with you.

117
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,940
Actually, Sunnyeo likes it a lot.

118
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,240
I'm sure it was fleeting.

119
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,990
You don't know Sunnyeo deep down.

120
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,810
Don't act like you and Sunnyeo are so close.

121
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,502
We've been friends for over four years.

122
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,090
So what if it's been four years?

123
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,390
You've never lived with her.

124
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,700
Ramyeon is served!

125
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,090
You know what, Minjung?

126
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,430
They say people change right as they're about to die.

127
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,670
Are you suggesting Namwook is about to croak?

128
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,250
Yup. I'll kill him.

129
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,430
Sunnyeo, what are you so mad about?

130
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,070
How could I not be?

131
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,310
Just a couple days ago, he...

132
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,790
Something happened between you two, huh?

133
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,540
Right? Right?

134
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,710
Stop! Nothing happened.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,190
Think about it after you eat.

136
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,930
I'll have one bite.

137
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,646

138
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:17,950
Why are you wearing that?

139
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,265

140
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,020
You said I could wear whatever I wanted.

141
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,390
Just eat your ramyeon.

142
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,650
Darn it...

143
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,750
Watch it, will you?

144
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,320
I was just about to say the same.

145
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,700
- So what will we have tomorrow? 
 - Ramyeon.

146
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,690
- And the day after? 
 - Ramyeon.

147
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,120
Sunnyeo ordered something different every day for us.

148
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,930
And I made tteokbokki for us.

149
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,360
But I don't want to make you any.

150
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,670
Listen, even this ramyeon is too good for you.

151
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,570
So eat up and go back, will you?

152
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,130
You have to go back anyway, right?

153
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,010
Do you think Sunnyeo is a tough cookie because she acts like she is?

154
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,290
You lived with her so you should know better.

155
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,910
I know.

156
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,580
She can't stand seeing people around her go.

157
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,210
And she makes it tougher on herself trying to pretend she's okay.

158
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,830
So she'll be hurt because of me, huh?

159
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,820
So leave as soon as you can.

160
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,080
I was going to.

161
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,040
Because I'll be the one to stand by Sunnyeo's side to help her through it.

162
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,000
  Namwook couldn't stand the fact

163
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:07,180
  that he couldn't stay by Sunnyeo's side.

164
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,920
Bye!

165
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,010
I don't want to leave.

166
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,060
Since Namwook moved out, can't I move in?

167
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,300
Are you that obsessed with me?

168
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,890
Not really. You're all right, but I love your house.

169
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,190
Whatever. Hearing your loud mouth at school is more than enough for me.

170
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,380
Hey!

171
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,910
But what if Namwook really dies?

172
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,480
What are you saying? Why would Namwook die?

173
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,310
He's been acting like his days are numbered.

174
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,260
He was going to write a bucket list, too.

175
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:50,212
  What are you reading?

176
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:52,610
What? Nothing.

177
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,242

178
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,480

179
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,800

180
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,990

181
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,156

182
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,210

183
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,670

184
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,540

185
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,950

186
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,740
  The character who comes out to the real world will slowly waste away.

187
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,870
  If he or she does not return,

188
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,730
  eventually, all life will be drained.

189
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,510
  And...

190
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,400
  become deceased.

191
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,940
We need to talk.

192
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,983

193
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,880
You'll die if you don't go back.

194
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,440
Is this why you've been so cold to me?

195
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,570
If you knew, you'd worry.

196
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,940
Why?

197
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,570
Do you think I'd ask you to stay?

198
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,200
You'll die if you stay! Of course, I'd let you go!

199
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,260
We won't get to see each other anyway.

200
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,280
It's better if you hate me.

201
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,170
Maybe for you that's better. But not for me!

202
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,090
This is important to me, too!

203
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,090
We worked so hard together to get you home!

204
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,670
  And you hid this from me?

205
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,890
Were you planning on hiding it from me forever?

206
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,760
What if something happens to you?

207
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,970
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,920
Hey, Cheon Namwook. Cheon Namwook!

209
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,270
  Sunnyeo realized at that moment

210
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,550
  that she didn't want to be apart from Namwook.

211
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,160
Han Sunnyeo.

212
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,470
Cheon Namwook. Let's go home.

213
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,688
Okay.

214
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,290
But I have something to give you before we go.

215
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,560
What?

216
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,100
I take it back. Don't give it to anyone.

217
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,160
Keep it to yourself.

218
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,070
Okay. I won't let anyone else touch it.

219
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,610
Is this the Namwook effect?

220
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,770
In comic books or dramas,

221
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,260
people accidentally touch their hands.

222
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,050
Nope. I did it on purpose.

223
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,860
- Kitten, you must be starving. 
 - A little.

224
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,520
That didn't sound like a little.

225
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,790
I thought it was an earthquake.

226
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,640
I'll run home first to soak the rice cakes.

227
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:09,714
Hey! Stop running. You'll fall!

228
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:11,830
I'll be fine!

229
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:19,284

Han Sunnyeo, what are you doing?

230
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,730
This is unexpected. You never call first.

231
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,490
We talk on the phone all the time.

232
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,140
But I always call you first.

233
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,960
You do?

234
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,860
Anyway, Namwook moved back in with me.

235
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,320
He's not feeling well,

236
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,120
and I don't want anything bad happening to him.

237
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,800
I think it's best if he stays with me.

238
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,770
Is that really necessary?

239
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,170
Yeah.

240
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,890
Han Sunnyeo,

241
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,920
I rarely stop you from doing what you want,

242
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,550
but I don't want you doing this.

243
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,230
Why not?

244
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,490
Why are you trying to stop me?

245
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,410
I don't like seeing you get hurt.

246
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:30,154
Yejoon.

247
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,620
Do you like me?

248
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,550
  Yeah.

249
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,800
  I like you.

250
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,740
♫  Little by little, goodbye. Slowly goodbye  ♫
