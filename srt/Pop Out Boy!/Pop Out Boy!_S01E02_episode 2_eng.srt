1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,593
Why are you here?

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:07,789
To kiss... you.

3
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,852

4
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,464

5
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:24,274
Why would I kiss you?

6
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,142
Wait!

7
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:31,262
What if I could only return to the comic book if you kissed me?

8
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:32,735
- What? 
 - It might work.

9
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:34,977
After you said the line

10
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:36,411
"Will you kiss me?"

11
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,038
I popped out of the comic book.

12
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,024
It was right before we kissed.

13
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,609
I'm onto something here.

14
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,061
I'm getting the creeps here.

15
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,406
I get it.

16
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:50,451
You don't want me to go back, huh, Kitten?

17
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,511
Stop that. Don't call me Kitten.

18
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,663
That makes you more like a kitten.

19
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:57,015
Don't you dare do anything cheesy in front

20
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,859
of the other kids.

21
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,002
Hi.

22
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:02,629
I'm Cheon Namwook, the Lone Fighter.

23
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,948
Are you my adorable Kitten's friends?

24
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,902
This situation is just like the comic book.

25
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:12,322
He's a new transfer,

26
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:14,324
but you guys know each other?

27
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,251
And his name is Cheon Namwook?

28
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:20,094
You know me? I mean the comic book character, "Cheon Namwook"?

29
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,541
Of course.

30
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:26,442
Namwook is the epitome of romance comic book characters.

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,925
No, he's not.

32
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,812
Why would I say that?

33
00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:36,054
Are you feeling okay?

34
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,891
Whatever!

35
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:41,435
But he's so much like the comic book character,

36
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:44,881
from his hairstyle to the way he talks.

37
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:47,724
Outdated style from 10 years ago.

38
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,637
But you're still so handsome.

39
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:53,413
You really are a POP OUT BOY!

40
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,478
What?

41
00:01:58,478 --> 00:01:59,703
Why would you say that?

42
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:02,104
Well, he is...

43
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,458
You can think of him as the real model of

44
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,417
Cheon Namwook from "Sunnyeo and Namwook."

45
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,070
How long have you been friends?

46
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,029
What?

47
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,964
We're the only friends you have,

48
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,799
because of your nasty personality.

49
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,784
Want to see my nasty personality then?

50
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,122
You never told me you had a friend named Namwook.

51
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:21,750
He's not my friend, but just a guy I know.

52
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,977
You were more closer to my mom than me, right?

53
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,355
Oh, a mama's friend? 
  (Like "Mama's boy", it's a boy friend that a mother really likes)

54
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,114
Namwook, why did you transfer to our school?

55
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:30,592
Did you move?

56
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:34,318
I came because I missed my Sunnyeo.

57
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,598
What?

58
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,601
How could he say something

59
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,627
that cheesy so brazenly?

60
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,105
Because that's how he is.

61
00:02:46,844 --> 00:02:49,695
Do you really like Sunnyeo?

62
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:51,421
I'm sure I want to kiss her.

63
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,214
Whoa!

64
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,782
What a way to be honest!

65
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:56,618
How refreshingly candid. I like that.

66
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:57,604
Why?

67
00:02:57,604 --> 00:03:01,290
I want Sunnyeo to have a boyfriend.

68
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,750
And if that was you...

69
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,695
We'd make the cutest couple in the world?

70
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:10,562
Not quite. The complete opposite! It'd be hilarious.

71
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:13,525
I'll help you get that kiss in three days!

72
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:15,036
You will?

73
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,338
 Sunnyeo's very guarded.

74
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,524
 So you need to catch her off guard.

75
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:29,092
Sunnyeo.

76
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,555
What are you looking at?

77
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,500
- What? Feeling butterflies? 
 - No.

78
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,054
I want to punch you.

79
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,458
  Then, show her you're a real man!

80
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,475
  And tell her how you feel.

81
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,884
  Right now!

82
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,554
  Spring, 2020.

83
00:03:57,554 --> 00:04:00,557
  The world had changed so much since 2010,

84
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:03,101
  the year I had come from.

85
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:07,320
  And I wanted to see if

86
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,842
  I could return to my world

87
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:13,761
  if Kitten and I kissed.

88
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,798
I have to check.

89
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,360
- You're dead. 
 - Ouch.

90
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,170
I suggest you remember this!

91
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,347
I learned a little jujitsu!

92
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,656
You win! You win!

93
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,902
Kitten, wait up!

94
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:36,401
Are you the 185cm tall

95
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:39,461
handsome Lone Fighter, Cheon Namwook?

96
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:41,473
What?

97
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:43,325
The Lone Fighter?

98
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,326
What was that about?

99
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,410
Are you insane?

100
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,978
I'm sorry...

101
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,615
Even Namwook the Great can't do a thing

102
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:54,086
when he's with his girlfriend, huh?

103
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,878
- I'm not weak! 
 - I'm not his girlfriend!

104
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,699
Sorry!

105
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,360
This is all your fault, right?

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,639
This is how my daily life was back home.

107
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,517
Don't hoodlums attack other guys once a day, too?

108
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,769
Nope.

109
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,130
- Let me get that. 
 - No!

110
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,439
What are you looking at?

111
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,681
What?

112
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:17,961
Nothing.

113
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:20,695
Sunnyeo, what's your ideal type of guy?

114
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,098
I never really thought about it.

115
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,935
Then, think about it right now.

116
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,789
Someone who's focused on the task at hand.

117
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,134
  Focused on tasks?

118
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,552
  Right now, it's to eat my lunch.

119
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,089
What else?

120
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,075
It'd be nice if he was observant.

121
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,696
  She's out of bulgogi.

122
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,525
I'll get you more bulgogi.

123
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,456
Why?

124
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,867
Oh no! What was that?

125
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,030
Are you okay?

126
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,898
Ina. Ina.

127
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,692
Yeah?

128
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:17,569
You just spilled this on me.

129
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,796
Shouldn't you say sorry?

130
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,372
Oh my!

131
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:23,283
I'm so sorry.

132
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,368
Why did I do that?

133
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,495
Sorry, Sunnyeo.

134
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,373
Does she really mean it?

135
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:31,833
Oh no.

136
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,336
Can I have more bulgogi?

137
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:38,021
Oh, come on! Can I get a bit more?

138
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,082
Oh, come on! A bit more, please.

139
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:42,219
You're soaked.

140
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,579
Do you want to switch uniforms?

141
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,806
No thanks.

142
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,515
I'm okay.

143
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,400
It's all your fault.

144
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,887
What?

145
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,322
Ina wasn't herself today.

146
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:05,116
And everything's been bizarre since you got here!

147
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:07,411
So you think everything's my fault, huh,

148
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:09,011
Kitten?

149
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,215
What do I do to send him back?

150
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,713
I told you, a kiss.

151
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:18,713
You know, kisses cure curses in fairy tales.

152
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:20,590
It solves everything.

153
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,473
You really don't get it, do you?

154
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:25,070
Your girlfriend is the Sunnyeo in that book,

155
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,788
not me!

156
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,760
But you're

157
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:36,314
the one now.

158
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,350

159
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:43,672

160
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,590

161
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,516
He doesn't even have a smartphone.

162
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,437
Sunnyeo.

163
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,480
Yeah?

164
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,772
School store?

165
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,290
I'm down.

166
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,568
How could a girl not fall for me?

167
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:02,398
You know, being confident isn't bad,

168
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,260
but you're being arrogant right now.

169
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,478
Unless she liked someone else...

170
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,353
  No way!

171
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,040
  Don't you dare

172
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,037
  show that side of yourself to anyone else!

173
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:25,338
  Don't leave me.

174
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,549
Darn it.

175
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,683
You jerk!

176
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,524
Watch your temper, will you?

177
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:38,159
How could you throw trash at me?

178
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,840
Is there more apple flavor?

179
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,801
Yup. Only a few.

180
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,385
Really?

181
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:50,822
We have to run!

182
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,873
What for?

183
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:57,245
Are they close?

184
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:00,665
Close friends of five years, since seventh grade.

185
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,199
What if Sunnyeo has feelings for him?

186
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,912
What?

187
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,907
Definitely not.

188
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:10,401
What a relief.

189
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:14,162
But don't let your guard down completely.

190
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:17,432
  Teen dramas always have "just friends" who are of the opposite sex.

191
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,184
  It's a recurring theme

192
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:23,504
  and a lot of couples actually start out as friends.

193
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,100
- You are good 
  - Good?

194
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:33,130
I love you, Sunnyeo!

195
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,679
Don't!

196
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,208
I said stop it!

197
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,819
What's wrong with him?

198
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,128
Hey, why are you throwing it at us?

199
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:04,520
Hey.

200
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,131
You could've hurt her.

201
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,078
Are you okay? Kitten?

202
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm fine.

203
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,433
But I'm not ok with your words.

204
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,226
Here.

205
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:20,036
Why are you giving me that?

206
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,454
You're the worst when you're all pouty.

207
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,523
No thanks!

208
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:24,265
I don't feel well right now.

209
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,876
I haven't seen Namwook around.

210
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,769
Minjung!

211
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,614
Bringing him up gives me anxiety!

212
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:33,323
I'm scared he might suddenly show up.

213
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,603
What's all this?

214
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,034
  My Kitten, Sunnyeo,

215
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,623
  I give you permission to like me.

216
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:01,802
  Will you

217
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,980
  kiss me?

218
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,170
This isn't what I meant you should do!

219
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:14,212
Well? This probably made you want to kiss me too, huh?

220
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,693
Why are you doing this to me?

221
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:20,430
She said no.

222
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:28,897
I have to avoid him at all cost.

223
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:31,199
Who knows what he'll do next?

224
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,568
  Sunnyeo, can you hear me?

225
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:40,000
I haven't been myself lately.

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,410
I have two eyes and two ears,

227
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,564
yet my eyes and ears can only see and hear

228
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:48,407
one thing.

229
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,655
Strange, huh?

230
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,574
  There's more.

231
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:58,143
  I can't stand seeing you talking to other guys.

232
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:02,410
  And worst of all is when you're with that Yejoon!

233
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:05,734
  So I was thinking, Sunnyeo,

234
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:07,451
  do you think

235
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,821
  I've fallen for you?

236
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,872
What the heck are you doing?

237
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,072
- Let's do it. 
 - Do what?

238
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:22,600
Kiss.

239
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,068
What? Are you sure?

240
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,564
You said you didn't want to.

241
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:30,191
Why the change of heart?

242
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:34,094
Because I want you to leave so badly that I'd even kiss you.

243
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,622
- Yes? 
 - Yes.

244
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,440
♫  Hello Stranger. I get attracted more and more  ♫

245
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,820
♫  I get closer  ♫

246
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,400
♫  To you without thinking  ♫

♫  I get more curious   ♫

248

♫  As time passes by, more more more  ♫

249
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,890
♫  Why is this happening? Who the hell are you?  ♫

250
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,780
♫  Stranger   ♫

251
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:09,500

252
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,084
Is this...

253
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,787
Sunnyeo's place?
