1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:01,502
Ye Joon,

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:05,255
do you have feelings for me?

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,550
(Based on a webtoon on Naver,
"Pop Out Boy" by Nimni)

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,178
Yes.

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,597
I do.

6
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,268
Ye Joon,
the shoot is about to start.

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,105
Let's talk in person.

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,025
I'd prefer to talk face to face.

9
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,112
(Pop Out Boy, Episode 8)

10
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,991
- Hi.
- Hey, you.

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,244
My, now that
you've landed this lead role,

12
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,329
you definitely look different.

13
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,580
Different, my foot.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,207
He looks exactly the same.

15
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,796
Don't get the wrong idea.
I didn't ask them to tag along.

16
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,881
Right?

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,426
Of course, why would you?

18
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,845
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

19
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,680
- Let me carry this for you.
- My gosh, thank you.

20
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,181
- That looks heavy.
- No, it's okay.

21
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,350
All right, let's go.

22
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,773
Ye Joon, the actress isn't here yet.

23
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,817
But you can make it look like
she's here, right?

24
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,277
Yes, I'll do my best.

25
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,570
Let's roll.

26
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,572
Scene 9, cut 10, take 1!

27
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,698
Ready.

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,867
Action!

29
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,952
How have I been?

30
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,413
Are you asking
because you have nothing to say?

31
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,373
What about you?

32
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,917
How have you been?

33
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,127
Cut.

34
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,504
It wasn't bad,

35
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,381
but you're confessing your feelings
in this scene,

36
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,842
so try to express those emotions.

37
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,552
- Okay.
- Let's try again.

38
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,262
Emotions...

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,306
Focus on the emotions.

40
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:39,933
Scene 9, cut 10, take 2!

41
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,268
Ready.

42
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,604
Action!

43
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,648
How have I been?

44
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,734
Are you asking
because you have nothing to say?

45
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,613
What about you? How have you been?

46
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,656
Cut! Are you a thug or something?

47
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,159
You're here to confess
your feelings to her, not to fight.

48
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,410
Try to smile a little.

49
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,329
Got it. I'm sorry.

50
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,039
All right.
Let's get right back into it.

51
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,248
Take three!

52
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,417
Action!

53
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,964
How have I been?

54
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,092
Are you asking
because you have nothing to say?

55
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,929
What about you? How have you been?

56
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,263
Cut.

57
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,891
That kind of looked like
a psychopath.

58
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,352
Take nine.

59
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,437
How have I been?

60
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,900
- Are you asking because...
- No!

61
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,818
Cut, cut. Don't do that.

62
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,238
- I'm sorry.
- Why would you cry?

63
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:36,657
Scene 9, cut 10, take 10!

64
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,991
Scene 9, cut 10, take 11!

65
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,872
When will Matilda get here?

66
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,292
He's struggling to focus as he's
acting out the scene without her.

67
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,044
She'll be here in an hour.

68
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,129
This is crazy.

69
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,257
Matilda's schedule is always packed.

70
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,093
Oh, how about we use a stand-in?

71
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,928
A stand-in?

72
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,932
Shall we try
to make him feel better?

73
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,309
That will disturb him even more.

74
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,272
Excuse me.

75
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,150
Me?

76
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,947
All right. Let's get you ready...

77
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,366
Oh, do you mind
taking off your watch?

78
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,868
It might end up in the frame.

79
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,122
Do I have to take it off?

80
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,165
It'll only be for a moment.

81
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,215
Why must Seon Nyeo stand in
for the actress?

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,092
Come on! It'll be fun.

83
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,279
Look at you, Seon Nyeo!
Are you making your acting debut?

84
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,488
Be quiet.

85
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,200
You look pretty.

86
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,955
That looks great on you.

87
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,790
This way, please.

88
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,381
Ye Joon, try saying those lines
to this lady here.

89
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,386
I hope I'm not being a nuisance.

90
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,975
Not at all.

91
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,354
I think I can do a good job
this time.

92
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,490
Ye Joon, let's do a good job.
You got this!

93
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,908
Thank you.

94
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,034
Let's roll.

95
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,494
Scene 9, cut 10, take 12!

96
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,748
Ready, action!

97
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,126
How have I been?

98
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,423
Are you asking
because you have nothing to say?

99
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,469
What about you? How have you been?

100
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,097
That was good.

101
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,767
Really? I haven't been doing well,
to be honest.

102
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,397
I like you.

103
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,234
I have feelings for you.

104
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,028
I had a hard time
because I couldn't see you.

105
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,574
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.

106
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,702
Then I could at least see you
whenever I wanted.

107
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,247
I did regret it,

108
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,166
but I've already told you anyway.

109
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,628
I'll say it again.

110
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,550
I really like you.

111
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,557
Aren't you going to call cut?

112
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,058
I love the vibe right now.

113
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,438
On your birthday,
I couldn't be there because of work.

114
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,608
Honestly, I wanted to drop
everything and run to you.

115
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,736
And when I got the call
about getting the role,

116
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,657
I wanted to tell you
before anybody else.

117
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,747
Also, when the rumors spread
about me dating another girl,

118
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,751
I was so worried
that you might believe the rumors.

119
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,004
I was worried sick. That's why
I went to see you right away.

120
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,302
I don't want to lose you.

121
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,681
I want to be with you all the time.

122
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,273
Hey, isn't he telling her
how he actually feels?

123
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,449
Cut.

124
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,326
Okay!

125
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,578
It's a go! Let's get ready
for the next scene.

126
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,624
Hey, are you okay?

127
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,834
What's wrong?

128
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,336
Don't worry. I'm okay.

129
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,048
Is it because you're jealous?
My goodness.

130
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,342
Are you about to faint
because you're fuming mad?

131
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,096
Why are you suddenly doing so well?

132
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,265
I was truly touched.
I really mean it.

133
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,685
I should've done a better job
from the start. I'm sorry.

134
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,437
That's right. Go stand over there
with your hands up.

135
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,316
- Just kidding. Well done. Thanks.
- Thank you.

136
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,443
I should thank your friend too.
Thank you for your help.

137
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,703
You said you wanted
to talk face to face.

138
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,205
Speak.

139
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,624
I actually ended up...

140
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,460
telling you the gist
of what I wanted to say.

141
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:45,841
But that look on your face is
telling me what your answer will be.

142
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,808
- I'm not sorry.
- What?

143
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,560
If I feel like I owe you an apology,

144
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,979
then things will get awkward
between us.

145
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,902
Would you rather see me feel bad?

146
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:07,988
No.

147
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,618
Do your very best
not to feel bad for me.

148
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,495
And I will do my very best...

149
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,664
not to be embarrassed.

150
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,544
Okay.

151
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,015
- Hello.
- Hello.

152
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,934
- Hello, good to see you.
- Hello.

153
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,061
How are you feeling today?

154
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,479
I feel great.

155
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,856
- Isn't the script amazing?
- It's so engaging.

156
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,025
Hey, Matilda is here.
Did you see her?

157
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,819
Yes, I see her right there.

158
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,863
My gosh, she's so gorgeous
in person.

159
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,199
Hello.

160
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,410
- Hello.
- Hello.

161
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,703
Hello...

162
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,664
- Gosh, my eyes!
- What's wrong?

163
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,793
You're so dazzling
that I almost went blind.

164
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,213
I'm sorry. It's not something
that I can control.

165
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,466
If you're sorry,
please have a seat here. Let's chat.

166
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,301
Oh, sure.

167
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,888
- What's your name?
- I'm Cheon Nam Wook.

168
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,015
Are you playing a minor role?
I've never seen you before.

169
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,393
I'm just here
to check out the shoot.

170
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,019
Ye Joon and I are classmates.

171
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,980
Oh, I see.

172
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,649
Ye Joon and I are close,
so just talk casually to me.

173
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,235
Ye Joon and I are not that close.

174
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,531
You must've gotten approached
by many entertainment agencies.

175
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,742
No, never.

176
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:36,869
Really?

177
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,037
I thought everyone at my agency
always worked hard.

178
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,038
I'm disappointed.

179
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,331
Why?

180
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,418
I can't believe they haven't noticed
a handsome guy like you.

181
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,297
I should tell the CEO of my agency
to sign with you.

182
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,134
You're back, Ms. Cat.

183
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:53,927
Do you want to sit here?

184
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,555
Sure.

185
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,850
- Is she also Ye Joon's friend?
- Yes.

186
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,268
"Ms. Cat"?

187
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,562
Is that your nickname?

188
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,608
I'd call it a term of endearment.

189
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,152
What is your relationship with him?

190
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,073
We live together.

191
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,743
You two live together?

192
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,664
Matilda, you should get ready
for the shoot.

193
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,832
Right, okay.

194
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,169
Nam Wook, can you pass me my purse?

195
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,213
Here you go, sister.

196
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,089
- Thanks.
- No problem.

197
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,300
"Sister"? You two just met.

198
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,052
You can just call me Matilda.

199
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,054
- Pardon?
- Let's talk later.

200
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,388
See you.

201
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,185
Is this also
the Cheon Nam Wook effect?

202
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,437
Are you getting jealous again
or what?

203
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,858
Cheon Nam Wook, let's go home.

204
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,902
- Already?
- I want to watch the shoot.

205
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,031
- What about you, Nam Wook?
- I kind of don't want to leave.

206
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,034
Don't you want to stay
and watch more?

207
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,244
No, I'm leaving.

208
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,247
You can either leave with me
or stay.

209
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:08,752
So you don't want to leave, right?

210
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:10,879
Okay. Bye, then.

211
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,923
I was going to leave with you!

212
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,425
Ms. Cat!

213
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,262
Wait up, Ms. Cat.

214
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:21,932
What? Why didn't you stay and watch
your dear friend Matilda's acting?

215
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,434
My "dear friend"?
What are you talking about?

216
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,228
The guy who just goes along...

217
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,982
with the flirting is no better
than the girl who initiates it.

218
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,734
Look who's talking.
What about you, then?

219
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,363
- What did I do?
- You and Ye Joon were ridiculous.

220
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,948
What on earth are you talking about?

221
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,074
Your eyes were locked on each other.

222
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,118
Then you two disappeared
for a while.

223
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,870
Let's be honest. Who's worse?

224
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,162
Ye Joon and I...

225
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,165
Forget it.

226
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,334
What? What did you guys do?

227
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,379
- My gosh!
- What's the matter?

228
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,174
My watch. Where did it go?

229
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,300
What?

230
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,343
The watch I got for you?

231
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,012
I clearly remember
putting it in my pocket.

232
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,806
You lost it?

233
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,350
When you were with Ye Joon?

234
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,604
What does Ye Joon have
to do with this?

235
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,480
Don't tell me...

236
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:13,901
Do you have feelings for him?

237
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,487
What on earth are you talking about?

238
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,159
Let's drop this.
Why should I even explain myself?

239
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,870
You're not my boyfriend!

240
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:26,747
You have to...

241
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,043
You have to go back eventually.

242
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,718
Hey, where are you going?

243
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,597
Fine! Go!

244
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,146
Did she have to word it like that?

245
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,901
Hey, where are you?

246
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,653
Let's have fried chicken
at Hyun Jin's place.

247
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,113
What?

248
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,282
Why are you answering his phone?

249
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,703
Oh, I dialed your number by mistake.

250
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,413
What are you up to?

251
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,251
I'm meeting up with Hyun Jin.
Do you want to join us?

252
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,421
Why are you so cranky?

253
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,006
You didn't have to swear at me.

254
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,847
Excuse me, hey! Are you all right?

255
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,515
Is anybody around?

256
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,020
No, it's not here.
Where did you drop it?

257
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,730
Can you take another look around?

258
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,983
Why don't you come here
and look for it?

259
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,235
I can't do it alone.

260
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,319
Alone?

261
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,905
Aren't you with Nam Wook?

262
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:47,452
Don't tell me
he's hanging out with Matilda now.

263
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,329
What? What are you talking about?

264
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,206
He left with you earlier.

265
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,792
(Cheon Nam Wook)

266
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,086
Hey, I have to go.

267
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,507
Hey, where are you?

268
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,260
Hello, I'm calling
from Yeolli University Hospital.

269
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,053
Pardon?

270
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:08,974
He was transported to our hospital
after passing out on the street.

271
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,477
I called you because this is
the only number saved on his phone.

272
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,064
Hello?

273
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,733
Hello,
this is Yeolli University Hospital.

274
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,320
Have you already picked up
Mr. Cheon Nam Wook?

275
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,323
Sorry? What do you mean?

276
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,161
Then I guess he left on his own.

277
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,082
(Cheon Nam Wook)

278
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,767
Hello?

279
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,024
Hey, what is wrong with you?

280
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,069
Why didn't you tell me
if you weren't feeling well?

281
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,905
If you fainted
and were taken to the hospital,

282
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,448
you should've just stayed there!

283
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,492
You didn't even answer my calls.

284
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,957
What if you sneak out like that
and faint again?

285
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,839
This.

286
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:24,675
I went to look for this.

287
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:29,680
Seriously...

288
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:32,891
Are you an idiot?

289
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,619
Don't leave me ever again.

290
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,130
If you get it wrong once,
you can never go back.

291
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,174
You'll die if you stay here.

292
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,968
You were a great friend.

293
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,136
You're leaving?

294
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,345
Yes.

295
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,265
I'll leave.

296
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,070
Found it.

297
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,324
Nam Wook.

298
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,327
I was sad,
thinking that you had left.

299
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,288
Can I have your number?

300
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,875
I'm sorry. I don't think
I can give you my number.

301
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,877
Why not?

302
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,588
Because my wife won't like that.
