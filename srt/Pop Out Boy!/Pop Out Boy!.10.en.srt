1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,376
No.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,254
I won't go.

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:06,882
I can't...

4
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,343
just leave.

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,348
(Based on a webtoon on Naver,
"Pop Out Boy" by Nimni)

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,643
What...

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:20,979
What on earth are you doing?

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,941
I really want to graduate with you.

9
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:28,445
I want to go to college
and turn 20 with you.

10
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,949
I keep thinking of
our future together.

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:33,909
So how can I leave?

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,912
I can't.

13
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,124
But we can't do that.

14
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,378
Do you think
I've never imagined those things?

15
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,839
I prayed every night that...

16
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,883
I'll be a good person for the rest
of my life if you could stay.

17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,011
But it just can't happen.

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,350
You'll die if you stay here.

19
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,310
Still...

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,896
I want to stay with you
for a bit longer.

21
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,443
Even if we do nothing special
and just hold hands together,

22
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:13,115
I want to stay here with you
for a bit longer.

23
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:17,995
I mean, it's such a shame.

24
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,497
We even have matching watches now.

25
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,666
We should wear them together.

26
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,132
(Pop Out Boy, Episode 10)

27
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,508
Why are you here?

28
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,261
Why? Can I not be here?

29
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,639
I obviously didn't ask him to stay.

30
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,892
It was his decision.

31
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,977
You're crazy.

32
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,854
You must be losing your mind.

33
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,733
Hey, is there anything you want?

34
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,359
- Me?
- Just tell me.

35
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,944
I'll buy it for you.

36
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,863
Hey, what on earth
has gotten into you?

37
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,156
Why are you suddenly acting
all friendly?

38
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,200
You've never done that for me.

39
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,784
His situation is different
as you know.

40
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,703
But we've been friends for longer.

41
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,079
Then you can tell me too.

42
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,166
Really? Can I really tell you
what I want?

43
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,710
Yes, tell me. I'm just going
to forget all about it.

44
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,547
- What? What does "forget" mean?
- What?

45
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,383
Is it possible to forget words
that you heard?

46
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,932
- You're quite photogenic.
- Right?

47
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,020
But you're not
that photogenic, Ms. Cat.

48
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,607
You look much prettier in person.

49
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,031
Isn't this such a great photo?

50
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,243
This should be my funeral portrait.

51
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,620
- What?
- I was just kidding.

52
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,873
Don't hold a funeral for me.

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,000
Instead, just think about me
once a year.

54
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,378
Is that a joke?

55
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,754
It's not funny at all.

56
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,550
As they say,
"If you can't avoid it, enjoy it."

57
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,719
Try not to take it too seriously.

58
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,638
(Park Min Jung)

59
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,478
- What's up?
- Hey, there's one more book!

60
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,106
- What?
- Look. You see this, right?

61
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,317
July 7, 7:00pm.
The date and time are specified.

62
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,530
So he has one more chance
to go back into the book?

63
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,073
- Just follow this?
- Yes.

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,410
July 7? That's tomorrow.

65
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,999
- Are you going to go back?
- Of course, he has to.

66
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,168
He'll die if he stays here.

67
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,669
Right, I know that.

68
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,298
But didn't you decide to stay
because you don't want to go back?

69
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,258
That's right.

70
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,135
I wouldn't have gone back either.

71
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,053
No.

72
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,724
I wouldn't be able to.

73
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,851
What about Seon Nyeo though?

74
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,729
Wouldn't it be easier for her
if she could think...

75
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,522
that Nam Wook is alive somewhere?

76
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,275
Really?

77
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,737
What do you think, Seon Nyeo?

78
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,534
Either way,
I wouldn't be able to see you again,

79
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,454
so the choice is yours.

80
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,499
I...

81
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,003
want to stay.

82
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,216
Here, I can at least live
however I want.

83
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,593
As long as I'm alive.

84
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,096
You think you'll have less regrets
this way?

85
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:29,061
Still, you should
really think about it.

86
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:31,980
It's an important decision,
you know.

87
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:36,235
But the thing is,
even if he decides to go back,

88
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,653
he could die before he goes back.

89
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,737
- Hey!
- Hey!

90
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,156
How could you say such a thing?

91
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:46,245
Well, I was just trying to say that
he should be careful. Just in case.

92
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,258
Can I come in?

93
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,093
Yes, come in.

94
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:07,808
Well...

95
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,352
Do you have something to say?

96
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,729
The thing is...

97
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,358
Shall we sleep together?

98
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,152
I mean, don't get me wrong.

99
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,238
What I'm saying is...

100
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,908
This might be
our last night together.

101
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,245
And just in case something
happens to you...

102
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:29,746
Sure.

103
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,915
Sounds good.

104
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,588
You're brave, Han Seon Nyeo.

105
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,131
Why do you say that?

106
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,884
I can't believe you suggested this.
What if I do something to you?

107
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,386
I know you're not that kind of guy.

108
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,313
What do you mean
by "that kind of guy"?

109
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,573
You're even going to be cute now?

110
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,533
Cut it out.

111
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,915
Cheon Nam Wook.

112
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,920
- Aren't you scared?
- Of what?

113
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,214
Death.

114
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:22,966
I'd be lying...

115
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,260
if I said I wasn't scared at all.

116
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,429
I'm terrified...

117
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,601
of the thought that someone
could just vanish before my eyes.

118
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:40,150
When I lost my mom,
I wasn't mentally prepared at all,

119
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,111
so it was really hard.

120
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,116
But this time, I was able
to somewhat prepare myself mentally,

121
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,246
so I thought
it'd be a little easier.

122
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,998
And?

123
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,960
But that's not really the case.

124
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,672
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,175
For not being able
to stay by your side.

126
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,136
Hey.

127
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,891
You still don't want to go back,
right?

128
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:15,727
Right.

129
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,274
I have to say, I'm much happier...

130
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,235
than the time
when I didn't know you.

131
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,281
Having to say goodbye to you
is hard,

132
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,867
but I'm happy...

133
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,787
that I got to know you
and spend time with you.

134
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,209
Am I too selfish?

135
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,045
No.

136
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,548
I'm happy too.

137
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,925
That I got to know you
and spend time with you.

138
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:50,971
To be honest,

139
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,349
I don't want you to die.

140
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,646
Because...

141
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,071
I like you, Nam Wook.

142
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,419
- Why did you slap me?
- Sorry.

143
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,214
You shouldn't fall asleep.

144
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,299
I fell asleep?

145
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,176
This isn't good. Get up.

146
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,183
Tell me if you get sleepy again.
I'll pinch you.

147
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,188
I'll bleed if I get sleepy again.

148
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,272
Drink up.

149
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,108
You absolutely
shouldn't fall asleep.

150
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,695
Hey, I'm not sleepy at all.

151
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,073
Then let me go to the bathroom...

152
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,575
Are you sure you're not sleepy?

153
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,786
Yes, I'm sure. 100 percent.

154
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,416
- For real?
- Yes, for real.

155
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,378
Don't go anywhere. Wait here, okay?

156
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,630
Okay, I'll be right here.

157
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:17,349
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you,
but could you throw that over?

158
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:21,186
Must I step in again?

159
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,447
Thank you!

160
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,166
See? I knew this would happen.

161
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,420
I shouldn't have had
too much coffee.

162
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,338
I should've tried to hold it.

163
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,675
I only got to kiss him once.

164
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,220
I can't believe he left
without even saying goodbye.

165
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,432
You said you wouldn't go anywhere
and wait right here.

166
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,350
How could you not keep your promise?

167
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,645
There's something
I wanted to tell you.

168
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,857
To be honest,

169
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,653
I want you to stay alive even if
it's just inside the comic book.

170
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,574
With all these memories intact.

171
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,328
I want you to stay alive,
wherever that may be.

172
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,289
Remembering and missing you
all alone...

173
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,000
would be too lonely
and heartbreaking.

174
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,878
I wanted to say that to you
in person.

175
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,130
How could you leave like this?

176
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,135
Seon Nyeo.

177
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,357
I'll do that.

178
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,485
I will remember...

179
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,904
all our memories together...

180
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,824
and stay alive.

(Time left: 1 minute)

183
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,219
You can do a good job this time,
right?

184
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,223
Yes, definitely.

186
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,820
I like you too.

And...

188
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,826
I've really wanted to tell you this.

189
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,996
Thank you so much...

190
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,208
for bringing me to this world...

191
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,003
and for all the precious memories.

192
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,684
I'm the one who should thank you.

Nam Wook returned to
the comic book world safe and sound.

197
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,283
There are times when we feel
as though it was all just a dream,

198
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:07,120
but there are a few pieces
of evidence that prove it was real.

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,920
And we've all changed a little.

200
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,964
I'd say
that's one piece of the evidence.

201
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,395
- That sounds so good.

I see many guys
with that thing these days.

00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,491
- The chains?
- Yes.

206
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,076
That guy used to wear it.

207
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,786
What was his name?

208
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:51,790
Cheon Nam? Cheon Nam...

209
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,086
Cheon Nam Wook!
I wonder how he's doing.

210
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:01,758
I wonder too.

211
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,569
What's with him?

Hey.

213
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,283
Can you please take off
those chains?

214
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,746
All the other guys are wearing it
because of you.

215
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,249
Why should I take it off?
This is what makes the look.

216
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,585
Wearing it...

217
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,255
feels nice.

218
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,758
Are you Cheon Nam Wook?

219
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,553
I can't believe
it's become the latest trend again.

220
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,263
Don't you know
about the newtro trend?

- Han Seon Nyeo?

225
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,276
Seon Nyeo
as in "like how Seon Nyeo would"?

226
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,614
Yes. But I'll show you
what it means to be like...

Yes, I'm on my way now.

You're probably just packing up now.
I don't even need to see.

234

You'd better not be late today.

235

It's ready!

239
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,990
You made us wait for an hour.

Did you actually follow the recipe?

00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,462
Yes, I followed it to a tee.

246

It tastes different.

to make such a thud?

Did you hang an elephant on the wall
or something?

There's nothing that could fall
in the room.
