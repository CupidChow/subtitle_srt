1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:01,376
No!

2
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,253
What's wrong? Did something happen?

3
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:04,880
2NE1 disbanded?

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,218
I bought this Lollipop phone
because of them.

5
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:11,887
(Pop Out Boy, Episode 4)

6
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,973
(Based on a webtoon on Naver,
"Pop Out Boy" by Nimni)

7
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:16,975
Wife!

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,855
- Seon Nyeo!
- What?

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,398
Come out for a second.

10
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:24,942
What now?

11
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,362
Hey, Nam Wook!

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,532
Cheon Nam Wook, wake up!
Cheon Nam Wook!

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,702
I almost died
from cuteness overload.

14
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,872
Hey, I was studying.
You totally ruined it!

15
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,208
Isn't it so cute?

16
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,252
I think it looks like you, Ms. Cat.

17
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,048
Don't disturb me with stupid things
like this when I'm studying.

18
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,968
"Stupid"? How could you say that?
They're so cute.

19
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,845
Cover your ears, kitty.

20
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,682
- Can I ask you about this?
- What is it?

21
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:04,106
"11 soccer players want
to shake hands with everyone."

22
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,692
"How many times will they
have to shake hands in total?"

23
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,820
Why even ask? They can keep count
while shaking hands.

24
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,489
Yes, totally.

25
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,701
The question itself is so ridiculous
that I can't solve it.

26
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,869
Right?

27
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,037
- It almost made me dizzy.
- Same here.

28
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,164
- You too?
- Yes. Bam!

29
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,251
All done.

30
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,379
Ms. Cat,
can I ask you something too?

31
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,881
What is it?

32
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,924
Ms. Cat.

33
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,385
When did you become so pretty?

34
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,515
If you bother me one more time,
I'll seriously teach you a lesson.

35
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,439
Darn it. My day's been ruined.

36
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,408
- Hey, look.
- What's going on?

37
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,534
What are you doing?

38
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,537
I figured I had to do
something like this...

39
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,789
to get your attention,
Cheon Nam Joon.

40
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,251
His name is Cheon Nam Wook.

41
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,341
Are you going to pull
another all-nighter?

42
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,468
Yes.

43
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,347
Thanks to someone who caused
the Cheon Nam Wook effect...

44
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,431
on Yoon Yi Na.

45
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,767
My gosh, I wonder who that is.

46
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:23,894
I really have no idea.

47
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,109
Still, you need to get some sleep.

48
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,444
Take it easy.

49
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,947
It's not like I don't want to sleep.
I just don't have time to sleep.

50
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,324
You take it easy.

51
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,117
Do you really
have to study that much?

52
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,206
This is pretty fascinating.

53
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,750
The Seon Nyeo I knew always
took it easy and never overdid it.

54
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,002
Like how Seon Nyeo would.

55
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,427
You and your dear Seon Nyeo
don't have to study...

56
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,975
because you can live as 18-year-olds
forever in the comic book.

57
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,935
No, what I'm trying to say is...

58
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,437
I just want you to take it easy
because this must be exhausting...

59
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,398
I think you don't get it
because you're a cartoon character.

60
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,401
But this world is different
from the fake world you're from.

61
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,903
I live in the real world.

62
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,947
Why are you...

63
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,575
so cold to me?

64
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,953
I don't care whether you study
or how you live your life,

65
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,247
but at least
try not to inconvenience others.

66
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,791
In this world, you're a nuisance
to begin with.

67
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:33,797
"Nuisance"?

68
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,175
It's not like I wanted
to come out to this world.

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,677
Have you forgotten
who brought me out?

70
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,137
No, that's why
I'm taking care of you.

71
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,555
I'm providing you
with a room and food...

72
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,432
while putting up
with all your antics.

73
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,394
So I should just keep my mouth shut
if I have any shame?

74
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,062
I'm glad you know.

75
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,985
Fine, it took me this long
to take the hint.

76
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,167
But this world is different
from the fake world you're from.

77
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,128
In this world, you're a nuisance
to begin with.

78
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,630
("Seon Nyeo and Nam Wook")

79
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,719
So all of this was already decided?

80
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,430
Everything I knew...

81
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,017
was actually fake.

82
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,270
Finally faced with reality,

83
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,108
Nam Wook couldn't fall asleep
that night.

84
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,320
Hey, you know...

85
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,406
I was too harsh on you yesterday.

86
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,534
I'm really sorry.

87
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,538
Will he accept my apology
if I say that?

88
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,749
Hey.

89
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,001
I'm heading out.

90
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,213
Oh, okay.

91
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,759
He's not here?

92
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,263
He left home before I did.

93
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,139
What do you mean?

94
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,933
What's going on? Did you guys fight?

95
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,405
Seon Nyeo.

96
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,908
I'm really sorry for spilling water
on your notebook yesterday.

97
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,827
What's all this?

98
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,454
I'm not trying to call it even
for what I did with these.

99
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,832
I wanted to tell you
that I'm really sorry.

100
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,879
Even I have no idea why I'm acting
in such a way these days.

101
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:38,881
I'm really sorry.

102
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,383
It's okay.

103
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,636
Thanks for this.

104
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,471
Thank you, Seon Nyeo!

105
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,570
Hey, where were you all day?

106
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,330
(Types of double sentences)

107
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,128
What's this?

108
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,048
Did you do this for me?

109
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,050
Yes.

110
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,595
Thanks.

111
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,933
Have you eaten anything?

112
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,809
Shall I buy you something tasty?

113
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,440
Is he giving me
the silent treatment or what?

114
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,860
- Hi.
- Hey, you.

115
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,280
Hey, Cheon Nam Wook.

116
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:47,908
Hi.

117
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,415
He ignored me.

118
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,834
Did something happen?

119
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,377
No, it's nothing.

120
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,714
I'm going to the snack shop.

121
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,594
Your face is telling me
that something's up.

122
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,890
You see,
I know that I owe him an apology.

123
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,142
So I was going to
apologize to him, but...

124
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,602
But he won't even talk to you?

125
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,069
Why did I even like Seon Nyeo
in the book?

126
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,863
You mean, in the comic book?

127
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,699
The scene where she had flour
thrown on her.

128
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,868
You saved her in that scene
and fell for her.

129
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,619
I did?

130
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,872
Here it is.

131
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,041
Helping and saving her
made you so happy.

132
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,127
You said she made you realize
why you were born.

133
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,421
Right.

134
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,882
Why on earth did I say that?

135
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,761
The character, Seon Nyeo,
is clumsy and all over the place,

136
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,472
so maybe you liked her
because you could look after her.

137
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,308
Not the other way around?

138
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:57,978
Something's not quite right.

139
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,857
Well, that's how it's portrayed
in this comic book.

140
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,651
I don't get it.

141
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,613
Oh, are you beginning
to like the real Seon Nyeo...

142
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,699
more than the Seon Nyeo in the book?
Is that it?

143
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,661
By the way, why did you guys fight?

144
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,955
She said my existence itself
is a nuisance.

145
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,790
Gosh, that's mean.

146
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,045
She can say harsh stuff,
but she's actually not that mean.

147
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,713
You know that, right?

148
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,508
She does have a mean side though.

149
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,260
Right, I agree.

150
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,596
Should I get a part-time job?

151
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,306
So that I wouldn't be
such a nuisance.

152
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,603
I do know of a high-paying
short-term part-time job.

153
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,566
"I'm really sorry."

154
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,653
"I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings,"

155
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,112
"but I was too harsh on you."

156
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,287
"When you smile, you look so..."

157
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,042
This is making me cringe.

158
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,169
No.

159
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,214
I need to write at least this much
to appease him.

160
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,815
I hope the chocolate
cheers you up, wife.

161
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,778
- Are you crazy?
- What?

162
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,158
Seon Nyeo, are you all right?

163
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,915
You got me the chocolate and
this soda, so you'll call it even?

164
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,876
- What do you mean?
- You got the role, so treat me.

165
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,546
Hey, I helped you
practice your lines.

166
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,465
That's the first thing you say?
You won't even congratulate me?

167
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,178
By the way, doesn't it mean
you have to memorize all your lines?

168
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,181
Yes, I'll probably have to give up
on studying.

169
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,725
What? Then why are you here?

170
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,146
Hey, an actor must study acting.

171
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,565
I'm going to analyze
the script here.

172
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,860
But why here? You can't
even practice your lines here.

173
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,573
You really can't stand me, can you?

174
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,325
No, you're not that bad.

175
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,036
- Where's Min Jung?
- In her art class.

176
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,499
What about Cheon Nam Wook?

177
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,211
I don't know.

178
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,048
Maybe he's all lonely
because we're not tending to him.

179
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,014
("I draw what I want to draw.")

180
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,103
Park Min Jung,
where did you find that halfie?

181
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,731
- "Halfie"? What do you mean?
- Half-Korean and half-deity.

182
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,858
He is a halfie.

183
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,320
Message me when you get home.

184
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:54,863
Will do.

185
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,741
- Hey, Ye Joon.
- What, Han Seon Nyeo?

186
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,202
Congratulations.

187
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:05,374
(Cheon Nam Wook)

188
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,048
Are you all right?

189
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,770
- Cheon Nam Wook.
- Can you walk through the tunnel?

190
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,064
Or shall we take another route?

191
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,067
Han Seon Nyeo!

192
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,528
It's just a cat.

193
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,532
I'll beat it.

194
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,661
- Just like how Seon Nyeo would.
- What?

195
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,496
It's a compliment.

196
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:46,874
You can hold my hand...

197
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,792
if you get scared.

198
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,628
There's no need. I'm not...

199
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:53,755
I'm not a wimp!

200
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,427
Then...

201
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:01,680
may I hold your hand?

202
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,058
I'm scared.

203
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,145
Well...

204
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,106
Sure, whatever.

205
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:24,953
You know,

206
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,748
you're very different
from the Seon Nyeo I knew.

207
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,375
It's a compliment.

208
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:32,586
Thanks.

209
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,340
And I'm really sorry.

210
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,842
I'm sorry too.

211
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,386
And...

212
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:43,847
thanks.

213
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,434
I understand why you're sorry,
but why are you thanking me?

214
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,315
I had a part-time gig today.

215
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,734
Don't move. Please stay still.

216
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,737
Don't move. Stop. Good.

217
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,031
Raise your arm a little, please.

218
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,449
Yes, that's it!

219
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,076
Are you from the Louvre Museum?

220
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,662
There's a sculpture right here.

221
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,331
I felt so liberated
when it was over...

222
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:11,917
because I could move
however I wanted.

223
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,503
- Great work today.
- Thank you.

224
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,463
What do you say?
Would you like to do it again?

225
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,842
- Pardon?
- You're perfectly proportioned.

226
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,302
I thought you popped out
of a cartoon or something.

227
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,223
I'll have to pass on the offer.

228
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,434
Then I realized...

229
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:34,982
that I never moved the way
I wanted to in the comic book.

230
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,695
It was only after I came here
that I could move however I wanted.

231
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:45,450
Because you got me
out of that world.

232
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,457
"I have to make sure
I say this to Seon Nyeo one day."

233
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,751
That is what Nam Wook
thought to himself.

234
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,336
Why did you thank me?

235
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:59,047
- Because of a bunch of things.
- Come on.

236
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,634
For returning your angel wings...

237
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,803
and descending into this world?

238
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,807
- You too, Seon Nyeo.
- What?

239
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,642
You also look prettiest
when you smile.

240
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,811
You read that already?

241
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,943
"You look prettiest when you smile,
Cheon Nam Wook."

242
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,363
"So forgive me already
and show me your smile."

243
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,823
Why are you reading it
in front of me?

244
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,201
"Because the weather was good,
because the weather was bad,"

245
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,702
"and because the weather
was good enough,"

246
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,122
"every moment I spent with you
wasn't boring at least."

247
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,000
Gosh! I forced myself to write it
to make you feel better.

248
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,293
Mission accomplished, then.

249
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,545
This totally made my day.

250
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,381
I'm glad to hear that.

251
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,800
It's so touching.

252
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,845
- Shall I read it aloud once more?
- Gosh, stop it.

253
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,430
Okay, all right.

254
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,307
Goodness.

255
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,229
- Where did it go?
- What's wrong?

256
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,023
Will you pull another prank on me?

257
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,235
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

258
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,196
The book.

259
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,198
What?

260
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,163
- He's going on a date.
- Nam Wook is?

261
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,873
With who?
Who's he going on a date with?

262
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,500
Why? Are you jealous?

263
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,210
Jealous, my foot.

264
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,963
What? A confession?

265
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,298
("Seon Nyeo and Nam Wook")

266
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,180
You're good.

267
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,559
- Thank you.
- You must've practiced a lot.

268
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,726
Yes.

269
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,145
Have you ever had
a one-sided crush on someone?

270
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,483
Yes, I have.

271
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,277
What are you usually like?

272
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,030
Let's say you have a crush
on someone like this character does.

273
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,907
Would you say you tend to show it?

274
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,872
First off,

275
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,917
I think I try not to show it.

276
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:01,920
Because that...

277
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,007
might make her uncomfortable.

278
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,967
So I usually...

279
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,471
take my time to get close
to that person so that...

280
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,266
I don't make her uncomfortable.

281
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,936
But what if you lose her
because you took it slow?

282
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,529
Then I should tell her...

283
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,366
because...

284
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:33,744
I can't lose her.
