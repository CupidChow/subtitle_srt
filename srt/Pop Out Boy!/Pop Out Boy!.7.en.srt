00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:02,878
(Based on a webtoon on Naver,
"Pop Out Boy" by Nimni)

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,260
You don't live here alone, you know.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,803
I'd rather you get dressed.

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,472
Why?

5
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,187
Do you now see me in a romantic way?

6
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:24,858
Fine.

7
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,529
I'll be careful from now on.

8
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,492
(Pop Out Boy, Episode 7)

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,869
Isn't it nice to be
on this field trip?

10
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,454
We get to see a college campus.

11
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,082
Tell me about it.
Who knew I'd experience this?

12
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,917
Is there a major you wish to study?

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,460
Why would I think of that...

14
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,130
when I'll be 18 forever
once I return to my comic book?

15
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,301
- You're going back?
- Yes.

16
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,722
Snap.

17
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,189
I got a new watch. Pretty, right?

18
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,440
A watch?

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,110
You always said
that watches irritate you too much.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,988
It was a gift from Nam Wook.

21
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,531
Is that so?

22
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,032
He gave you a gift?

23
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,493
Yes, this.

24
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,204
You don't have to wear it
if it bothers your wrist.

25
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,873
It doesn't.

26
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:24,376
You can also give it away
if it's a waste to throw out.

27
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,461
I said I'm going to wear it.

28
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,465
Well, that's that. So where to next?

29
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,342
I hear the waffle
is to die for here.

30
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,594
Why not get some first?

31
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,345
I'd rather not.

32
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,472
I'm not in the mood.

33
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,147
Then let's move
in teams of two for now.

34
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,732
Nam Wook, wait for me!

35
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,443
Unbelievable.

36
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,403
What's up with him today?

37
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,700
Seoyeon University, swag on.

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,077
Will studying with this improve
my chances of getting accepted?

39
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,246
Isn't this place for
smart ones like Seon Nyeo?

40
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,040
Does every road
lead to her in your mind?

41
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,375
Anyway, what is it that you bought?

42
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,796
Don't tell me you've given yourself
a tragic backstory today.

43
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,340
Does it begin
with a terminal illness?

44
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,636
All of us are living
on a time limit.

45
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,389
We draw closer to death every day.

46
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:31,985
What on earth?

47
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,072
I can accept him and Seon Nyeo,
but not him and you.

48
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,034
My notepad.

49
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,495
The darn Cheon Nam Wook effect.

50
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:43,997
Sorry about that.

51
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:47,584
Still, staying away from Seon Nyeo

52
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,337
keeps her from being targeted.

53
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,883
It's definitely infuriating
to be harassed like this.

54
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,095
Seon Nyeo has been a saint
all this time.

55
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,778
- Is it good?
- Yes, totally.

56
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,282
Nothing subsides the anger
quite like sweet snacks.

57
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,585
Still, don't get so much
on your face.

58
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,838
How I eat it is my business.

59
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,719
- Isn't this Noh Ye Joon?
- It is.

60
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,262
Is that his girlfriend?

61
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,972
Probably. He just touched her face.

62
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,098
What exactly are you doing?

63
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,769
Well... You're Noh Ye Joon, right?

64
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,146
We were fascinated, that's all.

65
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,982
Yes, I'm Noh Ye Joon.

66
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,276
- Would you like to take a selfie?
- Absolutely.

67
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,826
I'd rather leave
my friend out of it.

68
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,454
- I see. She's your friend.
- Thank you.

69
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,705
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,499
Nice one, superstar.

71
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,586
I can't believe that
college students recognize you too.

72
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:21,970
I'll take this.

73
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,432
What? No one gave you that right.

74
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,435
I know,
but you were done wearing it.

75
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,736
It's not like I wore it much,

76
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,449
but now I kind of miss it.

77
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,876
- Nam Wook.
- What is it?

78
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,797
Did I do something to upset you?

79
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,341
No, you didn't.

80
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,592
Then what's with the attitude?

81
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,469
A few days ago,

82
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,221
you were wondering
if you should stay.

83
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,099
But today,
you say you're going back.

84
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,435
Why?

85
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,022
I've changed my mind, that's all.

86
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,358
- What?
- I thought you wanted me...

87
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,860
out of your house.

88
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,492
("Seon Nyeo and Nam Wook")

89
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,452
So you're saying...

90
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,455
that you... No, this boy...

91
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,624
You're the character
from this comic book?

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,210
Yes, I'm the real Cheon Nam Wook.

93
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,173
Is this a joke?

94
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,800
That would be the normal response.

95
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,803
I guess I can't
force you to believe me.

96
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,221
("Seon Nyeo and Nam Wook")

97
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,893
Must it always be water?

98
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,147
Is it more believable now?

99
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,692
Min Jung, how long have you known?

100
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,111
It's been a while.

101
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,864
So you three have been lying to me?

102
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,617
As if you would've believed us...

103
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:07,951
if we told you.

104
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,416
Nam Wook, you can stay at my place.

105
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,667
What?

106
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,587
Seon Nyeo, this must be
too uncomfortable for you.

107
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,340
It is, but I've gotten used to it.

108
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,343
Besides, I made him pop out,
so it's my responsibility to...

109
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,637
Sure. I'll stay at your place.

110
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,058
Isn't this great?

111
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,563
Come on in.

112
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,163
It didn't seem useful to Seon Nyeo,

113
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,374
so I took it from her.

114
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,252
It's not even
in the style she likes.

115
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,797
That's not true.

116
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,303
Seon Nyeo liked the design, you see.

117
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,348
Maybe she was only
briefly intrigued.

118
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,975
There's more to
the Seon Nyeo you know.

119
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:15,769
You make it sound like
you know her well.

120
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,855
I've known her for four years.

121
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,400
So what if you've been friends
for four years?

122
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,403
It's not like you've lived with her.

123
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,617
Gosh, that's hot.

124
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,411
Here's our ramyeon.

125
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,163
Min Jung, did you know...

126
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,418
that people only change
when they're close to dying?

127
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,712
Are you saying that
Nam Wook is going to die?

128
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,548
Yes, I'll kill him
with my own two hands.

129
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,844
Why are you
so upset about this anyway?

130
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,888
Of course, I'm furious.

131
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,599
Up until a few days ago, he said...

132
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,353
Something happened, didn't it?

133
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,564
I'm right, aren't I?

134
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,065
No. Don't be ridiculous.

135
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,235
Eat first, think later.

136
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,155
Okay, just a bite.

137
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:17,956
Why on earth are you wearing that?

138
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:18,957
(Noh Ye Joon Fanclub, the 1st)

139
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,293
You said the choice was mine.

140
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,253
Let's just eat.

141
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,097
Darn it.

142
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,017
Watch it, will you?

143
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,686
Likewise.

144
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,569
- What will we eat tomorrow?
- Ramyeon.

145
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,946
- And the next day?
- Ramyeon.

146
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,575
Seon Nyeo and I
ate something different every day.

147
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,285
I even made tteokbokki for her.

148
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,580
But you're not someone
I want to cook for.

149
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:03,168
In my case, I'd rather not waste
my ramyeon on you.

150
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,712
So leave while I ask nicely.

151
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,216
You have to go back soon anyway.

152
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,177
You know,

153
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,180
Seon Nyeo may talk wildly,
but that's not who she is.

154
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,140
You were her roommate,

155
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,184
so that much
you would've figured out.

156
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,436
I did.

157
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,272
She has a hard time...

158
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,858
forgetting those
who were in her life.

159
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,486
She then makes it harder
by trying to seem she's okay.

160
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,906
Then she'll have it rough
because of me.

161
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:35,951
So leave as soon as possible.

162
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,036
I was going to.

163
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,830
I'll be the one...

164
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,332
to stay by her side.

165
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,838
(Noh Ye Joon Fanclub, the 1st)

166
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:48,964
Jeez, it's now all mushy.

167
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,099
And that's what Nam Wook detested.

168
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,021
He hated how he couldn't stay...

169
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,398
by Seon Nyeo's side.

170
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,318
Bye.

171
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,988
But I don't want to leave.

172
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,201
Can't I live here
now that Nam Wook is gone?

173
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,619
Do you love me that much?

174
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,705
No, I only like you a fair amount.

175
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:22,831
It's your house that I love.

176
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:26,126
Whatever. I can only take so much
of your loudness at school.

177
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,336
Darn you.

178
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,881
Hold on.

179
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,343
What if Nam Wook really dies though?

180
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,429
What are you talking about?
Why would he die?

181
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,766
He's acting like someone
living on a limited time frame.

182
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,560
Why else would he
write a bucket list?

183
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,316
What are you reading?

184
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,944
Oh, it's nothing.

185
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,104
What Seon Nyeo likes. Tteokbokki.

186
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,898
What Seon Nyeo hates.
Pushing her against the wall,

187
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,276
stereotyping her,
and interrupting her studies.

188
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,884
("Pop Out Boy",
Utilize Cheon Nam Wook's character)

189
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,096
(Caution)

190
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,222
Caution.

191
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,977
If the character that popped out
doesn't return to the comic book,

192
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,647
it will gradually
start to sleep more...

193
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,191
and lose its vitality.

194
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:13,942
In the end,

195
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,487
it will die.

196
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,034
We need to talk.

197
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,212
You'll die if you don't return.

198
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,131
Is this why you've been
giving me the cold shoulder?

199
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,550
I knew this would worry you.

200
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,012
Why? Did you think
I'd beg you to stay?

201
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:45,265
Wouldn't I have understood
since the alternative is death?

202
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,475
Either way,

203
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,560
we won't be able to meet again.

204
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,647
I thought it'd be better
to be the bad guy.

205
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,192
That's only better for you.

206
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,610
It's hardly that case for me.

207
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,570
Do you think
this only matters to you?

208
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,657
We both frantically looked for a way
to help you return.

209
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,450
But this is what you choose to do?

210
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,036
What would you have done
if I had never found out?

211
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,789
What if something happened to you?

212
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:09,915
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,125
Hey, Nam Wook. Nam Wook!

214
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,339
This is when Seon Nyeo realized...

215
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,844
that she didn't want
Nam Wook to leave her.

216
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:28,892
Seon Nyeo.

217
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,310
Nam Wook.

218
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:32,771
Let's go home.

219
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,316
Sure.

220
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,443
But first,

221
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,613
there's something I must give you.

222
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,032
What?

223
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,215
I take back what I said.

224
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,342
Don't give this to anyone else.

225
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,345
This is yours to keep.

226
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,391
Sure. I won't let
anyone else have it.

227
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:23,780
Is this also
the Cheon Nam Wook effect?

228
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,409
In TV dramas and comic books,

229
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,537
hands always brush against
one another like so.

230
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,334
Actually,
I was doing that on purpose.

231
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,183
Ms. Cat, you must be super hungry.

232
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,853
- Only a little.
- That growl says otherwise.

233
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,024
I thought it was the rumbling
of an earthquake.

234
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,192
Darn it.

235
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,780
I'll run ahead
and soak the rice cakes in water.

236
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,701
Hey, don't run.
You might end up tripping.

237
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,036
I'm fine!

238
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,544
Seon Nyeo, what's up?

239
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,394
This is a surprise.
I didn't expect you to call.

240
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,312
We've talked on the phone before,
you know.

241
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,439
Yes, but I was always
the one to call.

242
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,275
Is that so?

243
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,278
Anyway,

244
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,989
I called to say that
Nam Wook is back at my house.

245
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,618
He's not doing well,

246
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,289
and I didn't want anything
to happen to him.

247
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,917
I think he'll be better off
staying with me.

248
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,131
Must it be this way?

249
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,884
Yes.

250
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,343
Seon Nyeo,

251
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,931
I've always supported your decision,

252
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,809
but I don't think I can this time.

253
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,769
Why not?

254
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,647
Why are you against it?

255
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,317
Because I don't like it.

256
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:25,861
I don't want you to get hurt.

257
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:29,531
Ye Joon,

258
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:32,743
do you have feelings for me?

259
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,081
Yes.

260
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,293
I do.
