1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
At this moment,

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,530
there are a group of boys dreaming of forming a boy group

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,990
-who want to make the world fall for them. 
 -Hello.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,630
[The first stage, admission evaluations, begins now]

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,880
Good luck.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,300
What?

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,250
Not gonna lie, I got goosebumps.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,980
He wants to be ranked first in Grade 1.

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,940
♫Looking towards someone♫

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,560
That performance was at the level of a talent show.

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,890
It meant, "You did very badly."

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,420
Through the admission evaluation,

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,610
he enters Grade 3.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,080
Grade 2.

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,020
He already debuted?

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,810
Yeah.

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,580
His in-ear monitors are different.

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,800
He debuted, so his microphone is different.

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,820
Hello.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,130
I am Moon Hyunbin. I was born in 2000 and I am 24 years old.

21
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,260
I am currently active as the leader of Ciipher.

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,860
-You're still active... 
 -Yes.

23
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:36,940
Before I debuted, I thought I only needed to debut.

24
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,720
Everyone was surprised.

25
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,759
I took part in a survival show and debuted,

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,600
so why must I come?

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,700
There's only one thing to say.

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,620
There are a lot of handsome and talented people.

29
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,340
But we only know about a minority of them.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,940
Instead of waiting and thinking about making it one day,

31
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:04,620
it's better if I act on opportunities to get closer to my dream.

32
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,470
There's no need to wait then.

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,460
-Can I warm up? -Of course.

34
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,120
Do as you wish.

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,250
Okay.

36
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,290
I'm so curious.

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,740
He has a lot of stage experience.

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,810
He'll definitely make it.

39
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,520
♫You got it♫

40
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,460
♫She got it♫

♫I don't want to be found out♫

45

♫A sharp gaze♫

51
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,010
Did the mic fall off?

♫Me & you♫

53
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,410

♫Hold me♫

57
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,430
-First of all, Hyunbin. 
 -Yes.

58
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,200
You're the leader of Ciipher, right?

59
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,630
Yes, that's right.

60
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,620
But is this okay?

61
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,980
But with this kind of stage...

62
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,160
But with this kind of stage...

63
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,250
When you were preparing for it, did you think it was the right move to participate?

64
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,770
You are already in a group, but you still came.

65
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,030
I think you should be better prepared before you come.

66
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,700
So unfortunate.

67
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,880
I thought he would make it because he has debuted.

68
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,580
There was nothing exciting about his performance.

69
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,960
The costume is nice.

70
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,250
The next contestant is...

71
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,540
This is the last one. Please.

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,580
These Thai contestants' pronounciation

73
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,060
will get very good at the end.

74
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,290
-Their Korean pronunciation. 
 -From practice?

75
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,970
Yes.

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,930
I also have a friend named Nichkhun.

77
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,380
Hello.

78
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,260
-YAYA. 
 -YAYA.

79
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,210
-Susu. 
 -Yaya.

80
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,630
What a celebrity.

81
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,960
1,420,000?

82
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,500
14... Wow.

83
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,210
Your follower count on social media...

84
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,400
is quite similar to mine.

85
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,030
Wow, you're really famous.

86
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,120
With this number of followers from 16 dramas,

87
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,200
his dramas must have been hits.

88
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,610
Indeed.

89
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,550
Let's enjoy YAYA's performance now.

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,550
Susu.

91
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,159
-Susu. 
 -Susu.

92
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,260
Good luck!

93
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,130
Go!

94
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,120
♫There goes my heart beating♫

It'll be well-received at a fan meeting, right?

101
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,000
It feels like that.

102
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:43,800
♫That you are the reason♫

103

Hello, everyone.

106
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,660
Thank you.

107
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,890
You sang my favorite song.

108
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,760
You didn't prepare a dance?

109
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,780
I only prepared the chorus. Can I dance?

110
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,290
There's a chorus?

111
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,630
I don't understand.

112
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,620
♫But you don't know how I feel♫

113

♫I can't see♫

122
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,710
♫Are you playing hard to get♫

123
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,190
I don't understand.

124
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,800
Why did you come here when you're so popular?

125
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,490
You know dancing is important,

126
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,150
but you only prepared the chorus.

127
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,210
And I don't think you practiced well for the chorus either.

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,620
Those who are relaxed when they come here

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,900
make people uncomfortable.

130
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,980
It's a matter of life and death for others.

131
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,250
Now, let's welcome the next contestant.

132
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,990
I'm looking forward to this.

133
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,060
-This one? 
 -Yes.

134
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,250
He looks like he will be really popular.

135
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,050
He's still a kid. He's 15 years old.

136
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,160
On the whole...

137
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,310
My goodness.

138
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,460
-Hello. 
 -Hello.

139
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,140
-Hello. 
 -Hello.

140
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,170
Welcome.

141
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,860
He's so tall.

142
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,610
What kind of proportions are these? Amazing.

143
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,460
So tall.

144
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,490
Wait, you're only 15. But you look tall.

145
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,160
What's your height?

146
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,440
I'm 182 cm.

147
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,220
You grew so fast.

148
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,730
I should've done my best.

149
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,760
I didn't know I wouldn't grow tall.

150
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,690
You're not short.

151
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,030
Thank you.

152
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,050
I envy you.

153
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,820
I think my charm is in my height and proportions.

154
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,250
I'm pretty tall among my peers.

155
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,160
I'm over 10 cm taller than my friends.

156
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,580
In my neighborhood...

157
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,690
I'm embarrassed to say it myself.

158
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,910
I'm famous because I'm handsome.

159
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,450
I've been popular since I was in elementary school.

160
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,660
It's still the same in middle school.

161
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,070
It's my first time singing and dancing.

162
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,730
I only had a month.

163
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:29,020
One month... Can I ask what you've learned?

164
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,790
-I learned the basic skills of dancing, 
-Yes.

165
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,960
and stretching my body.

166
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,940
and stretching my body.

167
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,750
Stretching your body?

168
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,440
Of course.

169
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,340
I think I'm learning basic skills too.

170
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,570
Fast and slow.

171
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,250
You do this, then you retract slowly.

172
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,000
You do this, then you retract slowly.

173
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,770
That's right.

174
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,430
I remember I practiced this for a few months.

175
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,580
Fast and slow.

176
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,980
I only learned bouncing.

177
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,510
One month, it was really one month.

178
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,110
Yes, you did this too, right?

179
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,670
Right.

180
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,220
It's hard.

181
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,730
There will be sudden stops.

182
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,620
Yes.

183
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,670
Gyurae, right?

184
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,610
Yes.

185
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,150
That's all I'm doing now.

186
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,900
Our little chick trainee, Kim Gyurae's

187
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,430
song choice for today

188
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,600
is the energetic "RHYTHM TA."

189
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,880
Because I only had a month,

190
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,510
and "RHYTHM TA"'s dance focuses on basics.

191
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,080
We're curious too, little chick trainee.

192
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,990
Show us your performance.

193
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,090
Good luck.

194
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,220
Good luck.

195
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,430

197
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,620

210

215
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,240
Amazing.

216
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,850
His performance is like this even though it's only been a month, amazing.

217
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:01,900
What?

218
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,130
He's so powerful.

219
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,060
I'm serious about this.

220
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,020
I think...

221
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,690
you're very talented.

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,100
-Thank you. 
 -Yes.

223
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,450
Now, to enter the Second Grade, please insert your student ID card.

224
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,120
I've been emphasizing potential.

225
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,830
He might have the greatest potential among all the contestants.

226
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,980
That's right.

227
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,630
His movements shocked me.

228
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,960
It's impossible to reach this level after just a month of practice.

229
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,880
That's right.

230
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,460
-He has sense. 
 -Yes, he has sense.

231
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,600
He got a shock.

232
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,020
He got a shock.

233
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,290
-Hello. 
 -Hello.

234
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:13,010
Now, to enter the First Grade, please insert your student ID card.

235
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,860
He won't be able to make it.

236
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,350
I think he won't be able to make it.

237
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,280
It's hard to say.

238
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,940
-It's hard to say. 
 -No way.

239
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,840
Maybe... Maybe he took all of our hearts.

240
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,310
It won't do.

241
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,470
He won't get to the First Grade.

242
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,500
Who knows?

243
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,260
Whatever.

244
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,550
Was I good enough for First Grade?

245
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:24,880
Were they too concerned with me being a little chick trainee?

246
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,660
It happened.

247
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,570
-We... 
 -I told you no one knew what would happen.

248
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,140
-Goodness. -We were all mesmerized by him.

249
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,770
We were all mesmerized by him.

250
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,570
-But if we only look at this... 
 -Should we re-record?

251
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,620
He's already celebrating.

252
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,860
We can only fall for him.

253
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,830
Will the next contestant please come in?

254
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,420
Handsome.

255
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,080
He's handsome in a degenerate way, right?

256
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,040
He's very thin.

257
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,470
He's just bones.

258
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,340
I think I can carry him.

259
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,650
My body feels weak.

260
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,710
Hello. I look sickly, but I'm energetic on stage.

261
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,640
I am Jin Myungjae, and I am 23 years old.

262
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,840
Why did you say you look sickly?

263
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,300
Because I always hear people saying that

264
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,470
-I look sick. 
 -Do they often say that?

265
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,270
Yes.

266
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,160
-It says you have asthma. 
 -Yes.

267
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,120
You are sick.

268
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,720
So you have asthma.

269
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,210
I heard it's hard to sing and dance, right?

270
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,250
Sometimes it's hard.

271
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,400
I take asthma medication every day.

272
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,460
When my symptoms are serious, I use a nebulizer.

273
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,730
I can't breathe after dancing for three minutes.

274
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,970
I'll just lie down.

275
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,670
Why do you still want to be an idol?

276
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,740
There's only one reason.

277
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,890
It's the only way to become happy.

278
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,740
Yes, my happiness is here too.

279
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,670
I really respect him.

280
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,859
Let's see the performance of Jin Myungjae,

281
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,230
who is working hard to become an idol.

282
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,150
I look sickly offstage,

283
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,950
but on stage, I will be the most energetic

284
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,180
to beat everyone.

285
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,980
The concept suits him.

286
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,120
Nice pose.

287
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,120
♫You wants to erase my memory♫

288
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,510
♫I'm poison♫

289
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,670

291
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,810

292
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,370

293

♫Continue to love me viciously♫

312
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,250
Is he okay?

313
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,330
How do you feel after that level of exercise?

314
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,960
I'm okay.

315
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,050
I can hold on.

316
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,420
I like sickly charm,

317
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,780
so after watching this performance,

318
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,380
I should think, "Wow, a sickly charisma."

319
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,030
But your performance

320
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,690
made me worry that you were in pain or going to collapse.

321
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,120
I feel like I have to take care of him.

322
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,470
It breaks my heart.

323
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,640
I think this has nothing to do with a sickly charm concept.

324
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:19,050
You don't have sickly charm.

325
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,220
In the future, if you want to go for the sickly charm concept...

326
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,000
This is just sickness.

327
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,780
This is sickness.

328
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,540
Are you really okay?

329
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,420
Why are there so many First Grades?

330
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,660
There are too many First Grades.

331
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,870
Not First Grade?

332
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,990
I heard the sound of First Grade.

333
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,310
Are they all going to go to First Grade?

334
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,560
There's no TO for First Grades.

335
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,040
May the next boy enter.

336
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,620
He's so handsome.

337
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,760
He must be popular.

338
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,200
That kind of dance.

339
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,100
The dance was a bit messy.

340
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,510
It's a bit not connected.

341
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,430
Thank you.

342
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,040
♫ Dan dan dan dan dance get ya dancing shoes ♫

343
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,170
What's with him?

344
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,940
♫ Hannam-dong, UN Village hill ♫

345
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,010
♫ We watch the moon on the hill ♫

346
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,550
♫ It's bright enough with you here ♫

347

♫ Show them your trophy ♫

353
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,100
What's going on?

354
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,420
What's going on?

355
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,430
♫ A very exciting dream ♫

356
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,960
♫ Stepping over reality, keep roll ♫

357
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,630
♫ Walking in the late night without restraint, that flow ♫

358
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,100
♫ It's too perfect, a strong look ♫

359
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,080

362
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,040

365
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,550
♫ Kick, kick, kick, kick back ♫

366
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,590
♫ We got that kick kick ♫

367
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,290
♫ Kick kick kick back ♫

368
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,020
♫ You know we did did did did did did that ♫

369
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,110
It left an impression and your expression was great.

370
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,700
You know how to sing it the right way.

371
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,900
I think this is the best performance for me.

372
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,490
They can't come out together just because they're from the same company.

373
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,530
This can also be a disadvantage.

374
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,250
I feel sorry.

375
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,090
I feel bad for him cause I think it's all because of me.

376
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,880
They're so cute.

377
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,410
Thank you, everyone.

378
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,340
Through the admission evaluation,

379
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,480
everyone has received their grade

380
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,290
The Third Grades who didn't receive any

381
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,010
or only one producer's vote.

382
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,440
The Second Grade chosen by two to three producers.

383
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,040
The last is First Grade chosen by all producers.

384
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,450
Now everyone, please move into the dorm

385
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,190
and officially join Fantasy Boys.

386
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,210
Finally.

387
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,020
My heart's fluttering.

388
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,410
Everyone's ready to move in today, right?

389
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,390
Yes.

390
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,380
Yes, of course.

391
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,890
First Graders, as outstanding students

392
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,480
can move into the dorm immediately now.

393
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,240
As expected, all the Second Grade students can move into the dorm too.

394
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,720
Nice!

395
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,300
Nice! Well done.

396
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,550
But...

397
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,740
But...

398
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,060
Everyone in Third Grade

399
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,570
will be held back for now.

400
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,040
will be held back for now.

401
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,330
Does that mean we might be eliminated?

402
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,050
Do we move in later?

403
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,470
Unfortunately, you can't move in right now.

404
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,230
It's really starting now.

405
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,740
How will you be evaluated in First Semester?

406
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,240
May Main Producer, SOYEON, please introduce it.

407
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,900
The best mentor.

408
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,220
In the first semester where I will be the main producer,

409
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,190
we will be evaluating everyone's idol DNA with the MV that has been

410
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,860
voted in by everyone.

411
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,390
You can do it.

412
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,310
This is...

413
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,020
I'm looking forward to it.

414
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,680
Next, let me introduce the first group song

415
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,360
everyone will be evaluated by in Fantasy Boys, Fantasy.

416
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,070
Finally.

417
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,680
Wow. Is the group song called Fancy?

418
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,260
What? What?

419
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,700
Wow, what is this?

420
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,180
The choreography.

421
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,950
I was shocked when I first heard it.

422
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,450
I think it's a song that fits "youth" very much.

423
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,130
It's a song that lights up a youth's dreams.

424
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,760
Wow, it's addictive.

425
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,500
What do you think about the group song?

426
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,570
Very good.

427
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,750
It's very good.

428
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,990
It's very good.

429
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,000
There will be a difference in screen time for the MV

430
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,310
Those in First Grade can't relax yet.

431
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,870
Everyone will practice the same song

432
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,880
and be reevaluated.

433
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,900
What? What?

434
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,110
You're all dead.

435
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,320
This is what I look forward to the most.

436
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,970
Also, although Third Graders can't move into the dorm yet,

437
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:18,430
but through practice, you will also be filming this MV together.

438
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,420
Among those in Third Grade,

439
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,560
the five boys who get the most votes

440
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,650
will have your idol DNA acknowledged and get admitted.

441
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,330
Five?

442
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,120
Five?

443
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,900
Five among them?

444
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,490
Only five?

445
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,670
In that case, those in Third Grade have to work even harder than everyone else.

446
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,020
Yes, that's right.

447
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,440
To show a new Moon Hyunbin.

448
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,310
To show my development.

449
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,420
I need to be acknowledged no matter what.

450
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,030
I want to show my determination to stay.

451
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:58,830
If I am not determined, I might be eliminated.

452
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,560
Though it's hard,

453
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,970
but this is a new experience.

454
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,510
Through challenging, I will overcome these difficult moments.

455
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,770
The position for the first group stage

456
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,020
will be decided by votes through Fantasy's MV.

457
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,400
Whoa, this is crazy.

458
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,000
What?

459
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,160
What is this?

460
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,810
What is this?

461
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,660
- This level? - It was this level?

462
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,170
Wow, so this is First Grade's room?

463
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,280
Amazing.

464
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,400
Turns out we live with the Second Grade.

465
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,770
There are about 30 beds here.

466
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,010
We are using this with the Second Graders.

467
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,570
Wait. Find your own beds.

468
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,090
The old and weak have the lower bunk.

469
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,660
The old and the weak have the lower bunk.

470
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,760
Come out!

471
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,460
No!

472
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,400
I will sleep by myself.

473
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,590
I have to be alone.

474
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,350
- Use that. - Use that.

475
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,730
It's good. It's good.

476
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,190
What is this?

477
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,280
A gift for First Grade.

478
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,460
First Grade is slightly different.

479
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,430
Can I open it?

480
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,550
So many things?

481
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,310
What?

482
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,940
Compared to what's inside,

483
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,300
I'm more happy about having "First Grade" written on it.

484
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,710
Can we go there?

485
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,920
There's a gym here.

486
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,340
There's a gym here.

487
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,780
What? A gym?

488
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,810
This is Daehyeon's zone.

489
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,060
He's so handsome.

490
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,180
So handsome.

491
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,040
One more.

492
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,710
No, no.

493
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,260
Do you want to sleep together?

494
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,490
What's going on?

495
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,690
Please line up and come in.

496
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,160
One room?

497
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,160
This is really dorm life.

498
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,910
I was thinking it's really starting now.

499
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,360
I was excited and nervous,

500
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,600
I thought I should work hard.

501
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,740
It was really big and it looked like squid game.

502
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,800
It's no joke.

503
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,040
It's so noisy.

504
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,830
How can we sleep here?

505
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,940
We're going to sleep in the same room.

506
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,770
It's so noisy.

507
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,460
I want to go home.

508
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,380
Goodness.

509
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,000
It's the first time I'm sleeping together with dozens of people.

510
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,140
How can we sleep there?

511
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,400
How did you decide on the bed?

512
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,060
First come, first served.

513
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,820
Get out of the way.

514
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,470
First come, first served?

515
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,140
First come first served!

516
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,020
That's my bed.

517
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,300
What should I do?

518
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,730
Is there no lower bunk left?

519
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,260
None left.

520
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,530
This is my bed.

521
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,700
Seokhee, does only Second Grades have this?

522
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,570
First Graders had a lot more things.

523
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,040
Look.

524
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,100
Why is the color different from the beginning?

525
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,870
Come here.

526
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,560
First Grade is...

527
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,170
What?\

528
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,520
They even have blankets. How can this be?

529
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,970
Is it different?

530
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,390
Is this pajamas?

531
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,180
We have pajamas.

532
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,420
A set for 15 people.

533
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,760
Second Grade don't have pajamas.

534
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,320
Second Grade don't have pajamas.

535
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,670
Then, can I just steal one?

536
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,490
Then, can I just steal one?

537
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,980
Don't mess with First Grade.

538
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,000
How...

539
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,640
I was happy at first when I received it.

540
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,440
But when I heard only First Grade had pajamas,

541
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,430
I wanted to get promoted to First Grade.

542
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,210
They have started to split between First and Second Grade already.

543
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,490
That's when I felt it.

544
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,070
♫ You can do it, you can ♫

545
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,280
♫ You can ♫

546
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,780
♫ Isn't this more attractive ♫

547
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,600
♫ Isn't this ♫

548
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,130
It'd be great to be promoted to First Grade.

549
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,460
It's a grade everyone wants.

550
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,370
When the First Grade door didn't open,

551
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,920
my self-esteem was broken unknowingly.

552
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,010
This isn't my position.

553
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,420
Of course I want to get First Grade.

554
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,640
Though I was happy that the door opened,

555
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,270
but I'm going to work harder to get First Grade.

556
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:20,680
We can do it.

557
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,330
We can create miracles!

558
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,820
We can do it!

559
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,680
There's no impossible.

560
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:34,530
Hello.

561
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,240
- Hello. - Hello.

562
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,600
Nice to meet you.

563
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,280
I'm the vocal trainer

564
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,130

566
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,920
I can't guarantee everyone can stay,

567
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,280
but we will try our best to help

568
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,770
more people move into First Grade.

569
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,530
So please keep up with us as much as you can.

570
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,570
- Okay. - Okay.

571
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,200
All the best.

572
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,710

In the low and high notes,

576
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,500
you were able to sing at a stable tone,

577
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,990
which I think is a good thing.

I'm thinking about where I can put Beomjun in for this song

588
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,000
as I was listening to you sing.

589
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,910
But...

590
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,850
Beomjun and I are both rappers.

591
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,450
So I take him as my rival.

But it's not a Fantasy people want to see.

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,300
But it's not a Fantasy people want to see.

599
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,760
It's just a Second Grade Fantasy.

600
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,989
Because I'm a rapper. I don't think I will get a vocal part,

601
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,389
so I think I'll focus on dancing more than vocal.

602
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,710
Let's go, Daehui.

603
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,300
Let's go!

604

Go! Go!

605
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,620
Second Grade's Ace.

606
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,060
Daehui should do the best.

607
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,870
I think Daehui sings very well.

608
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,580
Daehui sings well.

609
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,960
I think it's Daehui.

00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,780
I don't think there's a big difference with First Grade.

616
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,530
With that, I was more hopeful that

617
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,790
there will be a reversal during the grade reevaluation.

618
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,450
Thank you.

619

-Are you okay? -Okay.

627
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,920
In a word, I'm in trouble.

628
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,270
If I want to catch up with others,

629
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,880
I must practice hard.

630
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,740
Being ranked Second Grade,

631
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,480
means we need to work harder, right?

632
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,530
Please. I hope I can get into First Grade.

633
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,800
I must go to First Grade.

I’ll do everything to get to First Grade.

636

But we can't let him go there though.

Because it's First Grade, So there's no need to worry.

666
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,120
♫ The heart flutter you've been imagining ♫

667
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,020
♫ The fantasy you've been waiting for ♫

668
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,640
♫ The heart flutter you've been imagining ♫

669
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,480
♫ The fantasy you've been waiting for ♫

670
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,270
♫ Everything you've dreamed of ♫

671
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,370
♫ We can do all of that now ♫

672
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,280
- Stop the music. 
♫ It's starting, you and me♫

673
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,240
♫ You and me ♫

674
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,310
♫ Oh a fantasy for you ♫

675
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,390
♫ Oh a fantasy for you ♫

676
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,510
But Gyurae...

677
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,730
Is it...

678
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,590
because you can't rich the pitch?

679
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,910
Yes. Because my throat is hurt,

680
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,530
so I can't go too high.

681
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,840
Play a tune. Let him sing it.

682
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,320
Sing it.

683
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,540
♫ The heart flutter you've been imagining ♫

684
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,850
♫ The heart flutter you've been imagining ♫

685
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,340
♫ The heart flutter you've been imagining ♫

686
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:14,080
- You've been imagining. - You've been imagining.

687
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,650
♫ You've been imagining ♫

688
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,650
♫ You've been imagining ♫

689
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,240
Now, listen to it before you sing.

690
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,560
Do you know you sang it wrong?

691
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,840
- The tone you're singing is different from what you're hearing. - Yes.

692
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,040
How are you in First Grade?

693
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,720
How are you in First Grade?

694
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,570
No matter how much I try to understand it,

695
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,480
I think

696
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,680
- your sense of tone is not very good. - Yes.

697
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,170
I have nothing to say.

698
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,980
Actually, among the Second and Third Graders,

699
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,040
- there are many peers who sing better than you, Gyurae. - Yes.

700
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,290
But you're in First Grade, you can't sing like this.

701
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,950
Don't you feel sorry towards them?

702
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,310
- Yes. - Right?

703
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,350
If your dream is to be a singer, you have to match it.

704
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,160
You have to match your hard work to your singing.

705
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,650
You didn't do your best just now.

706
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,660
You're just glossing over it.

707
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,120
Yes.

708
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,990
I think it's hard on the whole.

709
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,170
For a song with such a high vocal range, I thought about whether I could sing it.

710
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,170
I think I still have a lot of shortcomings.

711
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,710
One and two and three, four

712
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,730
and five, six, seven, eight.

713
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,270
Up.

714
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,350
Middle, down.

715
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,670
Da da da.

716
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,400
Gyurae, you're too slow. Your arm is too slow.

717
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,080
Again.

718
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,730
One, two, three, four.

719
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,650
Five, six, seven, eight.

720
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,100
Gyurae, the rhythm is wrong. Again.

721
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,960
One more time.

722
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,970
Gyurae, do it again.

723
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,860
One. Again.

724
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,580
- Gyuerae, you're always slow. - Yes.

725
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,180
Okay. Let's do the hand movements again.

726
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,660
Gyurae, raise your hand.

727
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,110
Gyurae, your hand. The other side.

728
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:02,840
Gyurae.

729
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,930
Gyurae! Gyurae! There's no leg movement!

730
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,390
Gyurae, look in the mirror. Look at yourself.

731
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,020
In any way, I trained for way too little time.

732
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,630
Compared to everyone else, I'm way behind.

733
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,900
Can I stay here? I've been thinking about that.

734
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,220
Only if a miracle happens can I stay at First Grade.

735
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,940
Are you giving up singing?

736
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,450
This is bad.

737
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,100
Fantasy.

738
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,250
Fantasy.

739
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,800
- I'm going crazy. - Fantasy.

740
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,780
- Just trust me. - Just trust me.

741
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,260
- Follow me. - Follow me.

742
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,830
Quickly. Just like this.

743
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,730
Five, six, seven, eight.

744
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:44,720
- Just trust me. - Just trust me.

745
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,650
That's wrong.

746
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,240
Five, six, seven, eight.

747
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,550
Just trust me and follow me.

748
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,710
Follow–

749
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,920
- Follow me. - Follow me.

750
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,540
Stop for a while.

751
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,560
- Follow me. - Follow me.

752
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,150
I couldn't sleep.

753
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,290
I'm not good enough,

754
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,920
but I'm more passionate than others.

755
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,210
So I practiced hard.

756
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,470
Hello.

757
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,040
Hello.

758
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,560
Everyone here is in Third Grade.

759
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,870
How did you get into Third Grade?

760
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:35,470
♫ Maniac lost my mind like a screw, maniac ♫

761
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,250
Why do you want to be a singer?

762
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,040
It was like a talent show.

763
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,160
The five boys with the most votes

764
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,420
can get admitted.

765
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,370
At the first, I really hated it.

766
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,540
Am I not talented in this?

767
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,210
Instead of thinking about going up,

768
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,240
I felt a setback first.

769
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,790
I didn't have the courage to say it.

770
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,920
I don't think I have the courage to show my performance.

771
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,380
Have you heard?

772
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,430
What will happen to you?

773
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,300
Only five.

774
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,120
If there are five out of 20,

775
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,850
only one quarter of them can survive.

776
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,700
I hope you can show all your strengths.

777
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,800
You need to show us why you can be in the top five.

778
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,180
Got it?

779
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,970
- Yes. - Yes.

780
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,970
So now you have to sing.

781
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,860
The one who wants to sing first can volunteer.

782
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,670
Long Guohao?

783
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,220
Yes.

784
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,040
You want to come forward?

785
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,250
During the entrance evaluation,

786
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:51,390
producer SOYEON said I was not good at finding the place where my voice comes out from.

787
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,790
♫ We're livin' in  a different time zone ♫

788

♫ The day and night are the opposite ♫

789
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,850
But I got the courage.

790

Okay.

802
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,600
Long Guohao, why do you think you're in Third Grade?

803
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,020
I have no feelings.

804
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,350
You're just not doing it.

805
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,270
I will enjoy the stage.

806
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,280
I'm not bragging.

807
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,800
Even if 50 people sing together here,

808
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:43,230
my voice will still stand out.

809
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,480

00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,420
Well done.

816
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:26,280
I don't think you're in Third Grade because you can't sing.

817
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,820
From the point of view of vocal,

818
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,520
you're the most stable and cool singer.

819
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,730
But in Fantasy Boys where we are selecting idols,

820
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:38,490
you have a color that doesn't suit this place.

821
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,720
You have a color that doesn't suit this place.

822
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,500
Your style is too outdated.

823
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,400
I think you should be objective towards yourself.

824
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,360
It gives off a different scent.

825
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,510
It's a scent that shouldn't be here.

826
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,060
I thought I ruined my stage then

827
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,690
which was why I received these comments.

828
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,010
What I showed today,

829
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,540
I just showed myself, I didn't make any mistakes,

830
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,860
but I got words like "You don't suit an idol."

831
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,990
It's like I'm being denied.

832
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,850
I'm going to end it here.

833
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,540
My voice...

834
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,220
Is one that's not needed?

835
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,590
That's what I thought.

836
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,280
Okay.

837
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,460
- Good luck. - Yes.

838
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:50,250
How did you debut?

839
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,680
Hyunbin was the most surprising.

840
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,570
I was surprised.

841
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,640
I want to get acknowledgement from the producers again no matter what.

842
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,180

Thank you.

848
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,660
It's a pity that you're in Third Grade given your strength.

849
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,940
Honestly, I was surprised to hear him sing.

850
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,910
He sang very well and handsomely.

851
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,180
It's a pity for him to be in Third Grade.

852
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,090

- He's so good. - He's singing so well.

862
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,840
Your pronunciation is the best among all the foreigners.

863
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,290
You're the best at singing too.

864
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,970
Why are the Third Graders doing so well?

865
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:24,100
How can I get into top five?

866
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,070
If I can't make it,

867
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,160
I hope I won't regret it.

868
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:31,680
Because I want to.

869
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,310
- This day is so fulfilling -To touch.

870
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,720
- This day is so fulfilling -To touch.

871
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,960
My legs are weak.

872
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,430
I'm starving.

873
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,200
I want fried chicken.

874
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,460
What?

875
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:08,820
Why is there so much food?

876
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,330
What?

877
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:14,760
Why is there so much food?

878
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,770
Can I?

879
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,440
Can I?

880
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,460
Soul, is it okay if we eat?

881
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,570
Of course.

882
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:22,630
Come on.

883
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:26,840
- What's this? - Let's eat.

884
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,340
I was thinking what this was, why is there so many of it in your luggage.

885
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,690
Try it.

886
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,300
Yappie, yappie, yap.

887
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,420
The Second Semester's mission.

888
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,230
I want to sing an old song.

889
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,290
Songs from the 2010s. It was the golden period.

890
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,000
Everyone here knows that.

891
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,330
I'm glad we're all the same age.

892
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:43,990
Age?

893
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,620
No, the kids really don't know them.

894
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,810
Gyurae doesn't know Girls' Generation.

895
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,270
I thought Tae Yeon was not Girls' Generation.

896
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,060
I thought she was a solo singer.

897
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,360
If the bell drum and Dam Da Di...

898
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,620
He's here too.

899
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,280
Do you know "Genie"?

900
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,250
"Genie."

901
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:56,990
Is it a drama?

902
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,320
Drama...

903
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,940
- Genie. - Okay, okay.

904
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,750
- I can't imagine that. - It's been confirmed.

905
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,280
Then I'll...

906
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,470
Fiction in fiction.

907
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,060
I won't forget.

908
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,760
I always shed tears in a trance.

909
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,130
Just like this, I became a little depressed.

910
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,530
Just like this, I became a little depressed.

911
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,460
Billibaba Billibaba.

912
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,670
Billibaba Billibaba.

913
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,300
His eyes seem to be scared.

914
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:25,030
From Ichiro's point of view,

915
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,560
it could be scary.

916
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,450
Do you trust me?

917
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,020
We are the cool kids.

918
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,270
I'm so tired.

919
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,310
I have to do well tomorrow.

920
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:38,020
You can do it.

921
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,440
You have to do well.

922
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,200
That's right.

923
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,550
What are you doing?

924
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,310
Here.

925
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,090
There's only one left.

926
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:52,730
Let me borrow it for you.

927
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,760
Why are these the only socks left?

928
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,050
Here.

929
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:58,580
Hwang Jaemin, you're amazing.

930
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,500
Love you.

931
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,530
Why are they so cute?

932
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:09,390
What's with these squirrels?

933
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,690
What are these babies?

934
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:13,650
Did we receive this?

935
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,600
Is it mine?

936
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,670
It's pajamas.

937
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,540
Pajamas? Where's mine?

938
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:19,720
You don't have one.

939
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,290
How's the atmosphere in First Grade?

940
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,520
The First Grade's atmosphere is quite harmonious.

941
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,550
We are very nervous though.

942
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:37,100
Everyone wants to advance to First Grade

943
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,070
so everyone is nervous.

944
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:39,530
You'll come tomorrow.

945
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,960
Yes, I'll go there tomorrow.

Fantasy.

955
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,610
Is the jukebox not turning off?

956
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,050
What's going on?

957
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,330
Sleep, Yu Junwon.

958
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:12,080
I feel the difference between the First and Second Grade.

959
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,180
Which class do you think I can get tomorrow?

960
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:14,950
First Grade.

961

Target.

962
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,300
My target is First Grade too.

963
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:19,860
To keep it there.

964
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,730

973
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,750
Now it's public who we've picked.

974
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,000
It's really interesting.

975
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,740
It's all here.

976
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:36,880
It's in blue.

977
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,130
We finally identified the culprit.

978
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,390
Hello.

979
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:41,750
Hello.

980
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:42,720
It's the Second Grade.

981
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,940
Hello.

982
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,610
Hello.

983
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,250
Hello.

984
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,650
Everyone's wearing the same tracksuit.

985
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,250
Hello, hello.

986
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:54,880
They're really close.

987
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,030
We've gotten so much closer.

988
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:57,920
Yeah.

989
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:58,720
I can see them clearly.

990
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,690
Yes.

991
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,390
Hello.

992
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,660
- Hello. - Hello.

993
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,340
- Hello. - Hello.

994
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:06,160
- Hello. - Hello.

995
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,370
Oh, First Grade.

996
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:09,760
Their voice is different.

997
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,080
They are all confident.

998
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,540
Oh, First Grade.

999
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,850
Close the door.

1000
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,720
Ling Qi. Close the door.

1001
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:27,140
When you came in,

1002
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,890
the First Grade boys look brighter.

1003
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,140
A lot brighter.

1004
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,030
- Right now, we're in a tough state. - I can feel it.

1005
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,410
We'll do our best.

1006
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:41,190
Come on!

1007
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,410
Come on!

1008
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,070
Come on!

1009
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,890
You can do it! You can do it!

1010
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,740
So passionate.

1011
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,930
Let's do our best.

1012
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,200
In the first semester, "Idol DNA"

1013
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,210
is a semester where the public evaluates how charming you are.

1014
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:02,230
The final ranking of the first semester is completely on the fans' vote.

1015
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:07,260
How much screen time do you get in your first MV

1016
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:09,410
is the main point of First Semester's study.

1017
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:14,250
The number of trainees in First Grade

1018
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,320
which has the most amount

1019
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:19,820
of screen time in Fantasy's MV has been fixed.

1020
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:25,980
There will be

1021
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,130
14 of them.

1022
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:38,760
According to the Interim Reevaluation, those in the First Grade could also fall to Second Grade.

1023
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:43,550
There is also a chance for those in Second Grade to rise to First.

1024
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:49,230
There's one more important thing I have to tell you.

1025
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:55,660
Those who emerge as First Grade after today's reevaluation

1026
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:59,460
will get a very good benefit.

1027
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,310
What could it be?

1028
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,240
Gosh.

1029
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:07,570
It's endless.

1030
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:11,000
They will get the chance to

1031
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,390
perform Fantasy Boys' theme song "Fantasy"

1032
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:16,460
on MBC Show! Music Core.

1033
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:21,420
Really?

1034
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:22,850
That's it.

1035
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:24,350
Let's go together.

1036
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:27,160
No way.

1037
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,280
I really want to go.

1038
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:30,670
Really.

1039
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,360
How are those in Second Grade feeling?

1040
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,210
You have to make it to First Grade, right?

1041
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,160
Yes.

1042
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,010
You have to make it to First Grade, right?

1043
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,800
Yes.

1044
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:38,850
Nice.

1045
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:40,200
Now, those in First Grade,

1046
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,180
shouldn’t you keep your seat in First Grade?

1047
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,420
Of course.

1048
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:45,580
Can you keep it?

1049
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:46,640
Yes.

1050
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,890
Good.

1051
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,340
- We have to go to First Grade. - Of course.

1052
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,900
Main Producer for this semester, Producer SOYEON,

1053
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:57,360
which part do you think is the most important in this interim reevaluation?

1054
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,990
Those in Fantasy Boys who are prepared,

1055
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,390
how many of them are amazing

1056
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:05,900
and can show it to us,

1057
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:08,940
we will keep them in First Grade.

1058
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,580
Very well.

1059
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:17,640
I saw a few who might not be able to stay in First Grade.

1060
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:23,790
Now, let’s see the first stage of those in Second. Grade.

1061
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,740
Go! Go! Go!

1062
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,430
Go! Go!

1063
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,870
Get ready. Come on.

1064
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,500
This song has a high vocal range.

1065
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:35,020
Even if it’s out of tune, you should sing it with confidence.

1066
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,110
There's a teacher inside.

1067
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,130
♫ The heart flutter you've been imagining ♫

1068
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,800
♫ The fantasy you've been waiting for ♫

00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,510

00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,410

1071
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,120
♫ Look over here, isn't this getting more attractive ♫

1072
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,950
♫  It's like a recipe customized for you ♫

1073
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,560
♫ Shining brightly, that's me ♫

1074
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,310
♫ Just trust me, follow me♫

1075
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:36,820
♫ Can you feel me? ♫

1076
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,500
♫ Oh oh ♫

1077
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,510
♫ Let's see who will win ♫

1078
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,130
♫  I can't miss this chance ♫

1079
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,870
♫ With your color and mine ♫

00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:47,740

1082

♫ I'll show you fantasy, fantasy ♫

1083
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:59,950
♫ Miracle fantasy ♫

00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:02,920
♫ It's gonna be fantastic ♫

1085
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,250
♫ Fantastic ♫

1086
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,070
♫ It's starting, you and me ♫

01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,760

1088
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,760

1089
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:13,800
♫ Miracle fantasy ♫

1090
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:18,240
♫ Baby, we gon' make you higher ♫

1091
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,670
♫ Fantasy ♫

1092
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,640
What's interesting is

1093
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,680
there is a dance teacher here.

1094
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:35,820
He has this magic where I can only watch him dance.

1095
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,220
Magic.

1096
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:39,940
I can't beat Shiryu. I can't.

1097
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,360
I can't even think of him as my opponent.

1098
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,090
But, wow. Just like this.

1099
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,560
With Shiryu's skills,

1100
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,090
it's better to practice singing and perform alone.

1101
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:49,440
If I'm in the same group with Shiryu,

1102
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,940
the other members have to keep up with Shiryu.

1103
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,840
- Or Shiryu will... - If not Shiryu will go down.

1104
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:59,440
Shiryu will dance less well.

1105
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:11,360
I need to work with others to form a team.

1106
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:15,260
It's the problem I need to face now.

1107
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,230
It's my turn now.

1108
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,280
Let's meet in First Grade, okay?

1109
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,110
Let's meet in the First Grade.

1110
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,100
Let's meet in the First Grade.

1111
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,100
Let's meet in the First Grade.

1112
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,640
Teamwork. Teamwork.

1113
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,240
Why aren't you cheering for me?

1114
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,030
I wanted to tell you when it's your turn,

1115
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,170
but I'll cheer for you now.

1116
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:37,650
Now let's see the second stage of the Second Grade.

1117
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,150
Come on! Come on!

1118
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,890
It's Soul's turn now.

1119
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,060
I see.

1120
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,730
I didn't know.

1121
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,260
Daehui. Daehui's singing.

1122
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:53,240
Daehui will do great.

1123
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,320
Daehui will definitely do great.

1124
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,430
Santa's there too.

1125
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:59,500
Soul and Santa.

1126
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,240
Yesterday, Santa,

1127
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,240
while we were already sleeping, he was still practicing late at night.

1128
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:37,080
♫ The heart flutter you've been imagining ♫

1129
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:40,780
♫ The fantasy you've been waiting for ♫

01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,430
♫ Fantasy ♫

1151
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:40,530
Thank you.

1152
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,860
Daehui did well.

1153
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,060
I think Daehui sang this song the best

1154
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:46,010
among all the teams that has performed till now.

1155
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,410
Thank you.

1156
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:58,320
Soul's vocal range is higher than I thought. I’m surprised.

1157
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:06,130
I think it's the most suitable vocal range among all now.

1158
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:10,370
Santa, does the vocal range not suit yours?

1159
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,700
- Yes. - That's right.

1160
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,870
When watching Santa dance,

1161
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:18,090
it felt like you didn't work the hardest you can

1162
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,730
it felt like you didn't work the hardest you can

1163
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,150
and performed.

1164
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,920
What a pity for Santa.

1165
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,920
He has been practicing a lot.

1166
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,060
I think I need to practice more in the future.

1167
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,760
If I want to keep up with others, I need to practice harder.

1168
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,840
But it doesn't matter.

1169
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,600
Come on.

1170
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,940
I think it's better than the previous team.

1171
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,070
Thank you.

1172
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,010
- If they're better than the previous team... - Firstly, I...

1173
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,410
In this situation,

1174
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:59,950
I want to tell all the trainees something.

1175
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,920
What the producers said has been decided.

1176
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,460
Because

1177
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:11,530
only those who show their charm

1178
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:13,030
can have things to be said about.

1179
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:16,200
If you weren't mentioned today,

1180
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,370
you can't think "seems like I did decently,"

1181
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:22,370
but "I haven't been seen."

1182
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:24,060
This is very important.

1183
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,060
Please think about it.

1184
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:31,250
Daehui is amazing.

1185
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:32,980
Clean and crisp.

1186
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,670
Great.

1187
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,420
K-soul is also great.

1188
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,560
You're great.

1189
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,660
I didn't show how we practiced.

1190
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:41,760
No, it's great.

1191
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,830
I should've gotten first grade in our first show.

1192
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:48,320
But I only got the second grade.

1193
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,680
I can’t accept to be in the second grade.

1194
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,610
So I hope I can get back my position at the first grade.

1195
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:55,820
Will be they nervous

1196
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:56,580
if they go up there?

1197
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:59,100
They're already nervous. They'll be more nervous if they go up there.

1198
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,780
Anyway, get the first grade.

1199
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:04,250
No more, no less. Just perform as uaual.

1200
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,420
Jaemin's hands are shaking a lot.

1201
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:08,090
Take this.

1202
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:08,790
No.

1203
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:10,020
Why are you so nervous?

1204
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:13,060
The feedback is horrible.

1205
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,760
Great. What's wrong?

1206
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,870
Will my position be taken away?

1207
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,400
Don't think like that.

1208
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,790
Imagine we're already at the Music Center.

1209
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:21,660
Take that thought with you.

1210
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,070
Can we go into the waiting room?

1211
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,040
Can we have a sandwich at Music Live?

1212
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:27,860
That's

1213
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,910
from another live program.

1214
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,010
Now,

1215
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:37,350
it's time to meet boys of the first grade.

1216
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:38,280
Come on!

1217
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,300
Come on!

1218
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,420
-Gyurae. -Gyurae.

1219
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,220
I'm looking forward to his performance.

1220
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,410
-To Gyurae's performance. -Yes.

1221
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:51,160
It would be great if he made progress today.

1222
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,400
Gyurae. Gyurae. Gyurae.

1223
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,970
He should be demoted.

1224
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:57,970
He really...

1225
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:01,470
What should I do?

1226
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:04,710
I felt more nervous than at the solo stage.

1227
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,640
I couldn't breathe since then.

1228
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,820
Junwon looks so relaxed.

1229

01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:19,210
How do you feel, producers?

SEUNGYOON?

1262

In this team,

1263
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,920
Gyurae,

1264
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,090
I can't tell what your level is.

1265
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:42,500
If you can't grow fast,

1266
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:46,800
it's hard to survive here

1267
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:48,439
with your current strength.

1268
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,910
I really hope you can do well.

1269
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:00,120
Actually, your current strength is

1270
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:02,850
at the third grade.

1271
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:04,850
Even worse than the third grade.

1272
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,560
To be honest, I agree with her.

1273
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,430
Most of boys of First Grade were selected for their strengths.

1274
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:16,420
They all displayed everything on the stage so that they were selected.

1275
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,040
I was only selected to First Grade for potential.

1276
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,420
I don't think I'm good enough.

You were good at dancing, weren't you?

1292

I think a few will be adjusted.

-Some first-graders need to be adjusted? -Right?

1294

I’m curious how many at First Grand and Scond Grade

1295

will be adjusted.

Please.

Although we still need to discuss,

1298
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:43,010
two to three will be adjusted.

1299
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:44,210
OK. Two to three will be adjusted.

1300
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,190
Thank you.

1301
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:56,450
First, I want Wooseok to be promoted.

1302
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:57,640
He can attract fans.

1303
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,160
What about Taeseon?

1304
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,570
Taeseon is very attractive to me with his appearance.

1305
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:04,710
But I don't agree with his strength.

1306
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,210
But I think it's okay to ignore his strength a little bit.

1307
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:14,720
Is it fair to promote him

1308
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:20,730
because of his appearance?

1309
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:26,380
I think it's okay to choose one person  among them based on looks.

1310
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:29,630
Junwon is average.

1311
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:35,470
He can't be in the second grade.

1312
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:39,340
-I don't think anyone needs to be ajusted among these. -Yes.

1313
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,010
What do you think about Gyurae?

1314
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:45,180
-It doesn't make sense. -I think we can demote him a little bit more.

1315
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:47,650
K-soul.

1316
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:50,360
I really recommend.

1317
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,930
He has the temperament of idols.

1318
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:53,840
Switch xx with K-soul.

1319
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,230
Their images are overlapping.

1320
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:04,840
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1321
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,270
From now on,

1322
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:08,270
we will announce the adjustments for BOY FANTASY

1323
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:11,840
in the first semester.

1324
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,710
I'm suddenly nervous.

1325
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:19,450
There's no room to go up. There's only room for descent.

1326
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:21,570
I feel like my blood is draining.

1327
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:24,790
There's a reason to be in the first grade.

1328
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:28,030
I must get to the first grade.

1329
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:31,510
I really look forward to

1330
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:33,830
the decisions made by the four producers.

1331
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:38,540
Now, boys in the first grade, please come to the stage.

1332
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:45,460
Really.

1333
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:48,910
I'm scared.

1334
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:51,420
It's more scary to get off after getting on.

1335
01:13:57,310 --> 01:14:01,160
Which of the 15 boys

1336
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,790
will be adjusted?

1337
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,030
I was very nervous.

1338
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:12,670
I'm scared.

1339
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:16,340
Good work, everyone.

1340
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:24,220
The first boy that demote from the first grade to the second grade is...

1341
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,950
If a miracle happens, I can stay in the first grade, right?

1342
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:45,970
Kim Gyurae.

1343
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:51,810
Kim Gyurae. Good job.

1344
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:56,880
Those who are called

1345
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,920
can go to the Second Grade zone.

1346
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:01,820
Okay.

1347
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,260
-Good job, Gyurae. -Good job.

1348
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:11,830
You're already good.

1349
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:20,200
Then the second one that demotes from the first grade is

1350
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:25,140
Ha Seokhee.

1351
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,710
Ha Seokhee.

1352
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,350
Moon Hyeokjun.

1353
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:34,390
Park Mingeun.

1354
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:39,160
We've been thinking about it for a long time.

1355
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:45,160
I hope you don't be too sad. So the next boy is...

1356
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:47,130
The next boy is...

1357
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,400
-Anyone else? -Next, the producers'...

1358
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:06,250
The next boy is Ling Qi.

1359
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:07,990
Ling Qi.

1360
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,330
I thought he would go to a higher grade.

1361
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:17,210
Why?

1362
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:19,930
I'm disappointed in myself too.

1363
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,440
OK, next,

1364
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:33,080
I don't think I did well either. I think I'll be demoted.

1365
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,020
Oh Hyeontae.

1366
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:41,690
Oh Hyeontae.

1367
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:52,760
What should I do?

1368
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,060
All right. Up till now,

1369
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:02,890
we have finished annoucing the boys who demote

1370
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:06,340
from the first grade to the second grade.

1371
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,480
Now,

1372
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:17,620
let's announce the boys who have been transferred from the second grade to the first grade.

1373
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:20,490
I hope I can go to the first grade.

1374
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:23,860
I don't think I've shown everything I've practiced.

1375
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,230
I don't know.

1376
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,270
The first one that transfers

1377
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:33,670
from the second grade to the first grade is...

1378
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:37,680
I'm going to take my place back.

1379
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:45,380
Kim Daehui.

1380
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:47,050
Kim Daehui.

1381
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,050
-Congratulations. -Thank you.

1382
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:56,350
The next one that transfers

1383
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:59,760
from the second grade to the first grade is...

1384
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:08,770
Taeseon.

1385
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,770
Taeseon.

1386
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,620
Kim Wooseok.

1387
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:21,320
Kim Wooseok.

1388
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:33,260
K-soul.

1389
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,000
K-soul.

1390
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,240
I've got the first grade.

1391
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,580
I'm finally in my original position.

1392
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:52,520
The last boy

1393
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:56,490
who will be transferred from the second grade to the first grade is...

1394
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,160
Hikari.

1395
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:08,500
-Hikari. -Hikari. Hikari.

1396
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,480
I think I'm going to cry.

1397
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:26,150
To be honest, I feel sorry,

1398
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:29,720
but I hope I can accumulate strength and go back.

1399
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:42,980
♫ Let's see who will win ♫

1400
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:46,400
Please vote for your boy from now on.

1401
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:05,820
That's how the special effects show.

1402
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:08,230
-Is this Jinmyung at the front? -It's Jinmyung.

1403
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:09,440
-It's Jinmyung. -It's Jinmyung.

1404
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,790
Did they use my shots?

1405
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:15,700
-I think we did it. -It's our first shot.

1406
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,640
Jinho.

1407
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,010
I'm so jealous.

1408
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:27,380
I want to stand in front too.

1409
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,750
The sky is really beautiful.

1410
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,750
-What a pity. -There are few shots of us third graders.

1411
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,290
Why? Why are there few shot of us? What a pity.

1412
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:37,470
It would've been nice if there were more.

1413
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:39,720
-Aren't these too few?- It's mine.

1414
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:42,330
-That's too much. -It's mine.

1415
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:43,190
It's mine.

1416
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,360
-Hello. -Too much.

1417
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,930
-Hello. -Too much.

1418
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:57,920
-Hello. -Hello.

1419
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:58,760
Get up.

1420
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,540
-Get up. -You startled me.

1421
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:02,210
So suddenly?

1422
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:07,380
It's been a while since we met. How're you doing?

1423
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,580
Good.

1424
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:11,920
I'm here today because...

1425
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:17,230
-You are not enrolled for the time being. -Yes.

1426
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:22,300
To see how much you've improved

1427
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,720
in your status quo, today,

1428
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:30,410
-I'm here to do in-process evaluation for you. -Wow.

1429
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,780
Awesome.

1430
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,080
Wait.

1431
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:39,910
For those who have shown excellent strength

1432
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:42,420
in today's evaluation,

1433
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:50,530
regardless of the previous voting results, one of you will be selected for promotion today.

1434
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:53,760
My goodness.

1435
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:59,200
I can't lose to these people.

1436
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,330
I'll spare no effort to perform.

1437
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:04,980
This is ultimately my last chance.

1438
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,840
I'll show the boys what I've been practicing.

1439
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,620
I have the grit.

1440
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,150
Then...

1441
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:15,790
Let's review one by one.

1442
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:17,790
One person?

1443
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,790
Who will go first?

1444
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:21,730
Someone who's confident.

1445
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,570
If there's nobody, I'll pick someone.

1446
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,240
Jinmyung.

1447
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,310
Hello.

1448
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:42,910
Fighting!

1449
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,990
That's exactly excitement how I pictured

1450
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:50,420
Show me what you got.

1451
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:08,170
♫That's exactly excitement how I pictured♫

1452
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:11,840
♫Fantasy that you've been waiting for♫

1453
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:15,610
♫Everything you've been dreaming of♫

1454
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:19,420
♫We can do it for you now♫

1455
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:27,680
♫Oh oh oh oh I won't miss this opportunity♫

1456
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,300
♫With the color of you and me♫

1457
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:31,140
♫To the colorful world♫

1458
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,500
Too fast.

1459
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:36,000
I'll show you Fantasy Fantasy

1460
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,100
It's gonna

1461
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,100
fantastic fantastic...

1462
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:43,710
How could you give up halfway?

1463
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:45,110
I'm sorry.

1464
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:47,980
Why haven't you learned all the lyrics?

1465
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:49,980
You practiced for a long time.

1466
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:55,550
It's my fault because I can't sing well.

1467
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:56,800
I don't have the confidence in singing.

1468
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,890
So I spent more time dancing instead of dancing.

1469
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:03,660
We didn't ask you to sing the whole song.

1470
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:07,900
I think you should at least sing half of it.

1471
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:10,870
I even doubt whether you tried your best.

1472
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:12,870
I even doubt whether you tried your best.

1473
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:17,170
If you did your best, in fact

1474
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:21,710
I think you should reflect on your talent.

1475
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:23,110
It's a pity.

1476
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:28,250
She didn't tell me directly to move on,

1477
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,250
but that's what she meant.

1478
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:37,790
Next, Jaeyoung.

1479
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:40,910
Break a leg!

1480
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:42,170
Fighting, Jaeyoung! Fighting, Jaeyoung!

1481
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:43,770
It's Jaeyoung.

1482
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,570
-Fighting! -Fighting!

1483
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:49,640
I haven't warmed up my voice. It's is bad.

1484
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:55,780
I'm a talent who deserves to be here.

1485
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:58,350
I want everyone to see that possibility.

1486
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:00,260
I think it's very important.

1487
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:06,120
♫That's exactly excitement how I pictured♫

1488
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,830
♫Fantasy that you've been waiting for♫

1489

♫We can do it for you now♫

1491
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,740
-The rhythm and the dance are out of sync. -♫We can do it for you now♫

1492
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:20,500
I'll show you...

1493
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,920
The rhythm and the dance.

1494
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,810
-Was I like this too? -It's gonna be fantastic fantastic.

1495
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:25,780
It wasn't that bad, right?

1496
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:28,880

1501
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:44,580
Fantasy

1502
01:25:57,550 --> 01:26:01,550
What a pity. You know it's really a pity.

1503
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:03,410
Yes, it's such a pity.

1504
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,190
I can't help you. This is your true ability.

1505
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:09,790
You're right.

1506
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:19,500
Repeat the It's gonna be part.

1507
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,500
It's gonna...

1508
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:22,770
I'm sorry.

1509
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:24,580
My throat. It feels weird today.

1510
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:31,540
-Jaeyoung, please stop talking. -So I think...

1511
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:32,740
Please stop.

1512
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,740
What about it? Are you going to quit?

1513
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:36,740
No, of course I will sing.

1514
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,950
It's gon...

1515
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:46,080
I can't sing like this too.

1516
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,370
You can't sing like this.

1517
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:48,750
It's gon...

1518
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:50,890
The sound should come out from the middle.

1519
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:52,750
It's gon...

1520
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:56,670
Sorry.

1521
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:59,840
I don't think I'm able to sing it now.

1522
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:03,170
If you can't, do you still want to be a singer?

1523
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:08,350
No, I'll give it a try.

1524
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:12,780
Jaeyoung, every time I ask you,

1525
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:15,390
-you say, "I can't sing." -Yes.

1526
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:18,190
I don't know what to do.

1527
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:21,320
Anyway,

1528
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:22,690
let's put rap and dance aside.

1529
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:25,530
You should change your mindset first.

1530
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:26,900
Got it.

1531
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:29,170
Do you really understand?

1532
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,470
-Right? -Yes.

1533
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,470
Thank you.

1534
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:36,510
Thank you.

1535
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,820
Who's next?

1536
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:57,290
Me.

1537
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:02,530
Captain Moon.

1538
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:03,440
Fighting!

1539
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,060
Fighting! Fighting!

1540
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:06,140
I was so scared.

1541
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,440
I felt like the sky was falling.

1542
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:13,840
It was the most difficult time in my life.

1543
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,550
It's all in the past anyway.

1544
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:18,480
So what if I regret it?

1545
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,820
I've been thinking about it.

1546
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,590
I'm at this level. Why couldn't I show it?

1547
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:26,460
I thought I could do it well.

1548
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:28,430
So I worked really hard.

1549
01:28:33,490 --> 01:28:36,070
The Interim Reevaluation is the chance to save everything.

1550
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:38,580
It's not the same. It's not simply an evaluation.

1551
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,900
It can save someone.

1552
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:43,250
I want to show the results of my practice.

1553
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,710
I was strict with myself.

Thank you.

1566

Really great.

1567
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:26,500
I'm impressed.

1568
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:29,720
At the last evaluation, I think you chose the wrong song.

1569
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:33,390
This song "FANTASY" really suits you.

1570
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:38,740
Hyunbin could really threaten

1571
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:42,600
a boy in First or Second Grade.

1572

-Let's see, Hayato. -Can I be the next one?

1576
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:50,260
Sure.

1577

-Let's go. -Fighting.

1578
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:55,380
Okay.

Hayato. Hayato.

1580
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:05,420
I've been a backup dancer

1581
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:07,860

Before your show, I expected you to be good.

1587
01:30:24,570 --> 01:30:25,760
That's what I thought.

1588
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,240
But it wasn't as good as I expected. I'm surprised.

1589
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:31,480
I was very upset when I got third grade.

1590
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:35,150
I was very frustrated for a week.

1591
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:39,260
But I gradually became skilled after practice.

1592
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:45,630
I want the producers to see my presence.

1593
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:47,700
To show my presence to the producers,

1594
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:50,900
I've worked very hard.

1595
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,470
I didn't want to give in.

1604

Thank you.

1605
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:30,170
Have you lost weight?

1606
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,240
Yes.

1607
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:33,510
It seems as if you're a different person.

1608
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,720
Self-management is really important now.

1609
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,250
Dancing and singing practices is important,

1610
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:43,850
self-management is also a competency.

1611
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,540

Thank you.

1622
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:25,430
The teacher said I should practice 5 times harder than others.

1623
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:29,870
I've been practicing. There wasn't a break.

1624
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:33,830
That's why I can see today's performance.

Thank you.

1627
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,240
My foundations are far from good.

1628
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:44,010
So I have to try to show

1629
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:46,680
what I've practiced.

1630
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:49,850
When I was practicing,

1631
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:55,330
I realize I haven't taken anything so seriously.

1632
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:01,600
Let me think about it.

1633
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,550
Please leave for a while.

1634
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:04,290
-Okay. -Okay.

1635
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:05,120
Get out.

1636
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:10,140
First of all, there's a boy who's quite good.

1637
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:17,250
A boy who's skills improved greatly.

1638
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:21,550
A boy who's skill can be

1639
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:25,720
upgraded to the First or Second Grade.

1640
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:31,160
Now there's also boys who didn't showcase

1641
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:34,330
fully their skills in the first evaluation.

1642
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:37,000
But I have to choose one, right?

1643
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:47,680
I choose...

1644
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:52,160
The practice is over.

1645
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,310
We need to clean up now.

1646
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:54,550
Come on here.

1647
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,030
Here. Here.

1648
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:04,420
Another bed.

1649
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,760
Will there be another boy?

1650
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:08,670
Boys, I'm here!

1651
01:34:08,670 --> 01:34:09,730
What's going on?

1652
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,730
What's going on?

1653
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:15,670
What's going on?

1654
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:18,910
Boys, I'm here!

1655
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:19,980
What's going on?

1656
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:21,980
What's going on?

1657
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:25,280
What's going on?

1658
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,370
What's going on?

1659
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:28,370
Boys, I'm here!

1660
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:29,820
What's going on?

1661
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,590
Boys!

1662
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:38,030
What's going on?

1663
01:34:38,030 --> 01:34:39,000
What's going on?

1664
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
What's going on?

1665
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:43,070
What's going on?

1666
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:48,000
Boys, where's my bed? Where is it?

1667
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:49,710
Over there.

1668
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:50,230
Over there.

1669
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,680
This way.

1670
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,410
What's going on?

1671
01:34:55,410 --> 01:34:58,880
He got it first today.

1672
01:34:58,880 --> 01:34:59,880
I see.

1673
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:02,450
That's great.

1674
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,090
Congratulations!

1675
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,090
Thank you.

1676
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:08,560
I want to tell my friends in First and Second Class.

1677
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,400
Just wait. I'll show you everything I got.

1678
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,030
I have the determination.

1679
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,260
To be honest, now in Third Grade,

1680
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,130
only five out of 20 can survive.

1681
01:35:45,550 --> 01:35:49,670
If you want to stay, you must do your best.

1682
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:54,900
I'm determined to stay no matter what.

1683
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:58,340
So I can't fail.

1684
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:09,850
I've been practicing nonstop in First Grade.

1685
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:14,490
Daehyeon, smile a bit more. You look emotionless.

1686
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:17,430
I'll do my best and give my best performance.

1687
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,330
Hyeontae, less facial expression and more power.

1688
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:23,210
I've dropped to the second level,

1689
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,330
I'll do my best to return to First Grade.

1690
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,950
Now, male idols

1691
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:30,950
must show power in their dances.

1692
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:35,730
Very powerful.

1693
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:36,780
Not enough power.

1694
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:38,540
Hikari, one more time.

1695
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:39,570
Almost there.

1696
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:40,370
Slow down.

1697
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:41,600
Don't look left and right.

1698
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,680
Much better.

1699
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:47,320
Many people want to stand in the center.

1700
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:49,160
They want to stand at the top of the stage.

1701
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:06,010
After School Excitement Season 2

1702
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:08,350
I'm SOYEON, the main producer of the first semester.

1703
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:12,180
I'm here to evaluate the Fantasy Boys

1704
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:15,090
who have passed the competitive Admission Evaluation

1705
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:17,890
and the First Idol DNA.

1706
01:37:17,890 --> 01:37:20,990
The final group stage of the first semester

1707
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:24,760
The final rank of the first semester after the global voting will be announced soon.

1708
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,900
Now, let's meet the Fantasy Boys.

1709
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:31,770

1793
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:08,260
The final grading of Fantasy Boys by global vote

1794
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:09,560
is going to be pronounced now.

1795
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:16,770
I'm really in a talent show!

1796
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:19,100
It's really starting.

1797
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:22,600
I'm standing in the same place I saw on TV.

1798
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:25,770
The 3rd place is…

1799
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:30,750
-3rd place. -3rd place?

1800
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:33,720
-3rd place. -3rd place.

1801
01:45:52,650 --> 01:45:53,540
Hong Sungmin.

1802
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:56,270
Hong Sungmin.

1803
01:46:02,570 --> 01:46:04,980
First of all, I was the first one to be called.

1804
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:07,750
So I was under a lot of pressure.

1805
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:10,790
Before I took the 3rd place seat,

1806
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:14,820
I kept thinking “Am I dreaming now?”

1807
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:22,800
The 4th place is…

1808
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:25,270
4th place.

1809
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:27,440
The 1st place and 2nd place will be published last, right?

1810
01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:30,210
-It looks like the 1st and 2nd place will wait until the end. -Yes.

1811
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:35,680
YA YA.

1812
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:38,210
YA YA.

1813
01:46:40,150 --> 01:46:40,980
YA YA.

1814
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:41,950
YA YA.

1815
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:44,590
YA YA.

1816
01:46:44,590 --> 01:46:45,750
YA YA.

1817
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:46,720
YA YA.

1818
01:46:48,490 --> 01:46:49,390
YA YA.

1819
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,230
I don't really care about it.

1820
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:54,460
But I have a strange feeling.

1821
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:04,510

the debut of Fantasy Boys is in your hands.

1834
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:49,490
Let's start voting now.

1835
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:57,830
Really handsome.

1836
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:00,160
So cute.

1837
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:01,470
Very handsome.

1838
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:04,070
The main character of the Heartthrob Part is…

1839
01:48:05,890 --> 01:48:08,100
No matter what, we have to get the Heartthrob Part.

1840
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:11,170
It's a talent show, you can't be too kind.

1841
01:48:11,170 --> 01:48:12,090
I want it.

1842
01:48:12,090 --> 01:48:13,340
I want to be the Part.

1843
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:14,070
Me too.

1844
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:15,770
If I give it to you,

1845
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:17,180
it'll be your song.

1846
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:21,150
I've lost all my parts.

1847
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:24,120
How should I say this?

1848
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:26,790
I feel like I can't do it anymore.

1849
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:28,020
It's so sad.

1850
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:29,360
Because I can't understand.

1851
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:32,190
So it's just... it's really difficult.

1852
01:48:32,190 --> 01:48:35,160
It's weird. It feels like we're idiots.

1853
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:36,820
Like we're stupid.

1854
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:48,380
The voting results will be released soon.

1855
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:50,950
