00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,710
Can you please not ignore me?

168
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,746
Are you sure you've thought it through?

169
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,181
I've always wanted to apologize to you.

170
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,551
Trust me.

171
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:35,087
I just didn't have the right time to tell you.

172
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,030
So you have really no idea what I want?

173
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,794
Any hints?

174
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,497
What do you think?

175
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:50,367
I, Ye Guang, swear that I will tell you everything from now on.

176
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,371
Forgive me, okay?

177
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,844
Okay?

178
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,215
Okay?

179
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,220
Okay?

180
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,956
It hurts.

181
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,026
Idiot.

182
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,299
It's not that I can't forgive you.

183
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,338
I want ten Ye Guang massage coupons,

184
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,276
and you should buy me lunch for a month.

185
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,879
Do you mean like this?

186
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,390
And

187
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,719
lunch for a month?

188
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,453
Right.

189
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,889
You are the best.

190
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,892
Hold on.

191
00:13:56,786 --> 00:14:00,890
[I'm really sorry about that day. Can we meet and talk?]

192
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,043
Do you want to eat anything?

193
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,578
Not really.

194
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,847
I am not very hungry, either.

195
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,282
Shall we order some drinks first?

196
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,051
Excuse me, we would like to order.

197
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,491
A'Jian.

198
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,194
A'Jian.

199
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,980
Sorry, may I help you?

200
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,207
Shopkeeper, two persons.

201
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,778
Two mochi. Thanks.

202
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,113
Ye Guang.

203
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,881
Thanks.

204
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,158
I didn't even know there was such a store near the school.

205
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,927
The mochi here is awesome.

206
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,529
That's why I bring you here to try.

207
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,331
Thank you.

208
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,402
How did you know that I love to eat mochi?

209
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,041
What's wrong?

210
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,130
I have class later.

211
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,781
There's still some time. I should be able to make it.

212
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,084
Are you sure?

213
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,155
Two mochi.

214
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,422
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

215
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:28,527
- This mochi tastes better when it's hot.
- Thanks.

216
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,834
Does it taste good?

217
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,719
When will you stop ignoring me?

218
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,692
Why should I stop ignoring you?

219
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,727
Then can you let me explain?

220
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,860
There's nothing to explain.

221
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,099
I'm a little tired today.

222
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,934
Wait.

223
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,670
Just tell me a time

224
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,739
when we can meet for a meal.

225
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,210
Let me think about it.

226
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,380
Go back to rest early.

227
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,992
Teacher, sorry. I'll discuss it with his dad to see what to do.

228
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:10,996
Okay. By the way,

229
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,932
I will still pay you the hourly fee for today's class.

230
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,534
Never mind. We can talk about it another time.

231
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,302
- Teacher.
- Hello, Mr. Ye.

232
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,871
I'm sorry you came here in vain.

233
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,205
It's okay.

234
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,408
This brat is way too naughty.

235
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:27,944
No, his grades in recent classes actually have not declined.

236
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:29,248
He is not very focused,

237
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:35,120
but I feel that he has become more lively and cheerful recently.

238
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,322
You can care more about him.

239
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,358
I still have classes later. I'll take my leave.

240
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,658
- Thank you.
- Okay.

241
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:41,860
- Take care. Thanks.
- Goodbye.

242
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,861
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

243
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,363
Bye-bye.

244
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:48,301
See? Even the teacher said that Guang Guang has been acting weird recently.

245
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,454
Sorry to bother you.

246
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,189
Thank you.

247
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,626
Guang Guang, where have you been?

248
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,062
You didn't answer the phone. And we were worried sick about you.

249
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,031
My phone ran out of battery.

250
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,001
Phone ran out of battery?

251
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,136
Where have you been?

252
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,641
I had a meal with my friend.

253
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,350
Had a meal?

254
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,147
Were you so busy eating that you forgot to attend the tutoring class?

255
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:38,951
The teacher waited downstairs for an hour and couldn't find you.

256
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,687
Do you know how humiliated I will be in the supplementary education field?

257
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,822
Okay, talk nicely.

258
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:47,192
Even if you go out for a meal, you should tell us in advance.

259
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,030
I was delayed because of the meal.

260
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,931
- It's not a big deal.
- You...

261
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,990
Not a big deal? Not a big deal?

262
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,339
You were late for class.

263
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,107
Did you do your homework?

264
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,110
Did you memorize the English words?

265
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,378
How about French? And IELTS?
(T/N: International English Language Testing System)

266
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:09,047
You can't even do your part well,

267
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,149
and you still want to eat? You starve to death!

268
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:14,619
Control your emotions. Control your emotions.

269
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,124
Ye Guang, you made a mistake.

270
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,060
And your attitude is still so bad.

271
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,061
Apologize to your dad.

272
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,500
Dad, sorry.

273
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,703
Kneel down in your room and reflect on yourself.

274
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,105
Don't get up until I allow you. Piss off.

275
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:43,382
This kid is getting more and more rebellious. Outrageous!

276
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,751
Should we ask an expert for help?

277
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,690
It can't go on like this.

278
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,392
Call Professor Wu and ask him to look into it.

279
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,360
Professor Wu?

280
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,265
Right, Professor Wu.
