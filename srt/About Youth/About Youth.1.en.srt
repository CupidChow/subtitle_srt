I will call you later. Bye-bye.

162
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,900
Bye-bye.

163
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
He's amazing.

164
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,300
We agreed not to tell him.

165
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,000
But you won't give me the ticket.

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
You are partial to him.

167
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
Then what are you going to do about it?

168
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,600
He's just a high school student.

169
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,800
- So what if he's a high school student?
- Are you jealous?

170
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,200
What a fool.

171
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,000
- You are a fool.
- All right, stop it.

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,700
- Let go.
- Okay.

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,700
Am I very heavy?

174
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,000
No.

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,600
Why isn't my boyfriend here yet?

176
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,400
Shall we help you take a rest at the side first?

177
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,700
Just put me down first.

178
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,900
Never mind.

179
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,900
- Baby.
- Why are you so late?

180
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,200
Are you okay? Thank you.

181
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,800
- It hurts so much.
- Where?

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,600
Isn't that Qiu Qiu's boyfriend?

183
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,400
Really?

184
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Shall we tell Qiu Qiu?

185
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,000
Mom, I am back.

186
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Happy birthday.

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,600
- You have received many gifts.
- Yes.

188
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,800
Look, I ordered your favorite food for you.

189
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,000
Love you, Mom.

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
It looks tasty.

191
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,200
By the way, I helped you ask for leave from Teacher Justin.

192
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,300
Enjoy your birthday leave today.

193
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,400
Is this okay for my dad?

194
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,600
Hello.

195
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,619
Yes, we are already going out.

196
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,987
Yes, plus half an hour of high-speed rail.

197
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay, hold on for us.

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay.

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,500
Darling, are you ready? They are hurrying us.

200
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,400
That's what I am paying you for.

201
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Get it done.

202
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,800
I will give you a day off.

203
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,300
Tomorrow, remember to make up for the things which you've fallen behind with.

204
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,900
I'll come back and test your French.

205
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,000
Also, your grade on the last chemistry test was really poor.

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,400
I changed the teacher for you. Take it seriously.

207
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,200
After today, you are one year older. Be more sensible.

208
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,600
When I was your age─

209
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,700
Guang, this is a gift for you from both of us.

210
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,800
We will be out for several days. Call me if anything happens, okay?

211
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,300
Happy birthday.

212
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Mom, I am back.

213
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,500
Perfect timing.

214
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,200
Try this.

215
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,000
It smells good.

216
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,995
Why is there so much meat left today?

217
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I specially left it for my son.

218
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,500
Take a try.

219
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,546
How is it? Did I succeed?

220
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,600
Did I succeed?

221
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,000
How is it?

222
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,300
Why does it taste so much like what Dad made?

223
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,400
It does?

224
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,988
This way, I can cook it when we miss him.

225
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,100
Let's go to eat there.

226
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,258
- Does it still hurt?
- A little bit.

227
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,727
- I'll go back and apply ice for you.
- Sure.

228
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,711
- Who's that?
- My classmate.

229
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,451
- Hello.
- Hello.

230
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,254
Hello, I am busy now. I can't meet you today.

231
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:32,122
- Maybe another day, okay? Bye-bye. 
- It's so late.

232
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:34,125
Let's go. It's okay.

233
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,529
- What do you want to eat?
- Pizza.
Pizza?

234
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,963
Let's order a food delivery.

235
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,532
Sure.

236
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,651
Hi, everyone. What are you all doing?

237
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:05,410
This is a special birthday meal that my parents prepared for me.

238
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:09,695
I received all the birthday gifts you all gave me.

239
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,480
I want to share this joy with you all.

240
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,999
I'm going to celebrate with my parents.

241
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,668
Bye-bye, everyone.

242
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,971
Happy birthday.

243
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:45,465

Okay, I am on my way.

260
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,232
Don't you look out when you're riding the bicycle?

261
00:18:54,232 --> 00:19:00,943
♫ I can't forget your face in slow motion ♫

00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,550
I am sorry, I am sorry.

265
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,884
What's wrong with you?

266
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,819
I will buy you a new one, okay?

267
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,354
- Can you be more careful?
- Okay.

268
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,964
Sorry. I am really sorry.

269
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,648
Where is my bicycle?

270
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,563
Weird. I just parked it here.

271
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:46,544
Even the bicycle bullies me!

272
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:05,608
♫ Slowly getting closer and the sky keeps raining ♫
