00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,363
But what song would we play?

162
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,864
Just go ask first.

163
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,666
Let's talk in the rehearsal room later.

164
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,268
Okay, thanks, Brother.

165
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,570
Bye-bye.

166
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,354
Youngster Xu Qi Zhang, what are you looking for?

167
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,127
Something went wrong with the orchestra that is going to perform tomorrow.

168
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,330
Then what are you going to do?

169
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,565
My band will replace them.

170
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,134
- So you're going to perform?
- Yes.

171
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,704
So is my son going to perform in front of the whole school of teachers and students?

172
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,406
Right.

173
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,241
What am I going to wear?

174
00:12:58,911 --> 00:12:59,946
Where are you going?

175
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,714
To match clothes.

176
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,617
Tomorrow will be a livestream, Mom.

177
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:08,888
What are you going to wear?

178
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,390
You should be worrying about what I'm going to perform tomorrow.

179
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,725
Why do I need to ask that?

180
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,661
Just perform whatever your band practices.

181
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,330
I'm tired of singing that song.

182
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,033
And I don't think it's suitable for me now.

183
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,102
Suitable?

184
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,905
What about singing your dad's song?

185
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,574
Dad's songs are all good.

186
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,644
Then pick a song that

187
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,112
you think is suitable for you now,

188
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,615
and when you sing it on stage,

189
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,552
the entire audience will be impressed by you.

190
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,293
I didn't expect you guys to change the whole show in just one night.

191
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,429
Our friends helped us.

192
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,797
Is it okay?

193
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:55,067
It will take about thirty minutes for the backstage preparation.

194
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,237
Shall we do some preparations before the performance?

195
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,806
Are you confident?

196
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,542
Of course.

197
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,710
Come on!

198
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,611
All right, go quickly.

199
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,515
It's almost time.

200
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,951
Darling, Guang Guang is performing soon.

201
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,652
I will send you the link.

202
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,755
No need. I am busy now.

203
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,791
I will watch it myself.

204
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,329

I'm giving up on running for president of the student union.

241
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,081
Why?

242
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,117
It was never what I wanted to do anyway.

243
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:37,054
And I feel very happy

244
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:38,791
after making this decision.

245
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:44,259
Ye Guang! You have finally made a decision for yourself!

246

Aren't you happy with that?

249
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:04,917
No. I feel weird.

250
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,686
I feel that it's pity.

251
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:11,924
After all, you're better than me.

252
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,959
You have always been great.

253
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,495
It's just that you never knew, okay?
