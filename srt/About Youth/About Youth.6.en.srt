How can I make him forgive me?

It seems like there's only winter left in this world.

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,484
Is there any way

to melt all the ice between us?

00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:20,578

How is your revision going?

Say it. What's wrong?

Do you know a guy named Ray in your school?

I would like you to do me a favor.

Okay, I will tell him.

Hi, Fan Rui Hao.

47
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,066
Are you free to talk?

48
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:23,002
What's the matter?

49
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:29,209
Ye Guang has been troubled recently

50
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,478
because of you.

51
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,500
What does it have to do with you?

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,282
I am worried to see him upset because of you.

53
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:40,120
Even I am not worried, why should you be?

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,056
Yes, I know you've been very close to him lately.

55
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,724
No, no. Don't get me wrong.

56
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,963
I really care about him.

57
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,631
I hope you can accept me.

58
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,433
We are in our second year of high school.

59
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,834
Why are you getting close to him now?

60
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,606
I didn't expect to be friends with him.

61
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:06,108
It's just that he appeared at the saddest moment of my life

62
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,314
and helped me.

63
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:13,450
I can still meet him now and be so close to him.

64
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,257
I really feel that it's so unreal.

65
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,760
Why is there the smell of love?

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,010
Don't misunderstand. We are not together yet.

67
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:28,768
So you don't want to be just friends with him?

68
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,536
I...

69
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:37,006
Let me tell you, liking someone is very difficult.

70
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:40,113
Especially Ye Guang. He's good in everything,

71
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,880
but his talent in love is less than 1%.

72
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:51,990
So should I thank you now?

73
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,194
You are really a fool.

74
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,966
But I have one more important thing to tell you.

75
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,001
What is it? Tell me.

76
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,474
It's about my brother, A'Jian.

77
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,677
He wants me to give this to you.

78
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,545
It's the first time

79
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,014
I've seen him treat someone so sincerely.

80
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,383
Please give him a chance.

81
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,919
Why didn't he bring it to me himself?

82
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,654
He came to you so many times.

83
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,656
But you didn't let him explain.

84
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,291
Please give him one more chance.

85
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,460
Think about it.

86
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,296
This necklace was fixed by himself.

87
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,864
Bye-bye.

88
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,840
Sorry.

89
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,309
I know I'm annoying like this,

90
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,270
but the stupidest way I can think of

91
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,970
is to wait for you downstairs.

92
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,118
Because I really want to see you.

93
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,953
Could you reply to me?

94
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,131
Here, Guang Guang. Sit down.

95
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,670
We have something to tell you.

96
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,439
I thought that after giving you a chance,

97
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,007
you would know how to grasp it, reflect on yourself, and correct it.

98
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,778
In the end, you still screwed up.

99
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,913
You have been letting us down lately.

100
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,715
After much discussion with your dad,

101
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,751
we decided to strengthen your discipline.

102
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,750
Give me your phone.

103
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,057
Why?

104
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,925
Do it.

105
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,570
I will turn on your phone's location system.

106
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,706
So from now on,

107
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:23,276
we can track your daily location.

108
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,077
Lest you lose contact like last time.

109
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,613
It will make us worry.

110
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,047
If you don't know self-discipline, let us help you.

111
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:35,486
Mom, I have seldom worried you until now.

112
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:37,490
Is it necessary to distrust me like this?

113
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,926
This way, I don't have any privacy at all.

114
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:40,760
Privacy?

115
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,563
What right do you have to talk to me about privacy?

116
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,399
Your only responsibility now is to study hard

117
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,767
and to get home on time.

118
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,134
Guang Guang, we do this for your own good.

119
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:53,406
Do you know that you are at a very important stage right now?

120
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,570
For my good?

121
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,144
Have you ever asked me what I want?

122
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,546
You just want me to become the second you.

123
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,281
The second me?

124
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,452
With your conduct right now?

125
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:09,054
By having such low demands on yourself, you won't make it in ten or even twenty years.

126
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:11,490
What if I make it?

127
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,227
You better watch your mouth, Young Man.

128
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,029
Enough, Guang Guang. Stop contradicting your dad.

129
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,165
It's just installing a location system.

130
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,766
All right. Here.

131
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,735
Go to your room and study.

00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,742
Where are you going?

133
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,470
I'm going to the convenience store.

134
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,282
You can check anyway.

135

It's so cold.

Why aren't you wearing a coat?

137
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,602
Why are you looking for me in such a hurry?

138
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,240
I just want to talk to someone.

139
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,676
Here I am. What's up?

140
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,077
I hate my family

141
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,360
and my dad more and more.

142
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,517
I really can't take it anymore.

143
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:14,053
They only care about my grades and what others think of me.

144
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,723
They even installed a location system on my phone.

145
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,159
They might just be worried about you.

146
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,761
I don't think so.

147
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,896
They may just do this so

148
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,200
if something happens to you, they can find you as soon as possible.

149
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,703
No, you don't understand.

150
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,438
I feel like I'm getting farther and farther away from him now.

151
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,907
You know?

152
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,210
So why don't you just tell them these words directly?

153
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,514
You are the only one to hear these.

154
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,949
It's okay if you don't comfort me.

155
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,084
Instead, are you teaching me what to do?

156
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,619
No, I just want to help you.

157

Who are you to tell me these?

158

You don't have a dad like mine.

159

How could you understand what I'm feeling now?

160

Stop crying.

161
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,117
It's okay.

00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,777
Where are we going?

166
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,679
To your home.

167
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,448
Are you okay?

168
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,887
Sorry.

169
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,256
Okay, come on.

170
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,257
Let's continue.

171
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,739
Mom, what's up?

172
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,542
Youngster Xu Qi Zhang, what are you doing?

173
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,511
Nothing.

174
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,512
Nothing? I didn't even ask you,

175
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,315
and you said nothing. Something must have happened.

176
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,785
We haven't shared what happened today.

177
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,188
How was your day?

178
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,300
How about the band?

179
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,726
Good.

180
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,594
And your new friend?

181
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,469
It's okay.

182
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,604
All good.

183
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,509
All right. It's good that everything is fine.

184
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,211
Time to sleep.

185
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,847
Go to bed.

186
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,183
Quickly go to sleep.

187
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,954
Thank you, Mom.

188
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,626
If there's nothing else, quickly go to sleep.

189
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,866
You know you can tell me anything.

190
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,934
I know.

191
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,202
Okay, I know.

192
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,804
Go to sleep.

193
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,508
Good night, love you.

194
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,143
Me, too.

195
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,099
Good morning.

196
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,768
I'm going to be late for class.

197
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,669
Did you sleep well?

198
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,776
Could you give me a chance to take care of you?

199
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,953
I will call you after school.

200
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,895
In the face of the impact of declining birthrate,
[Sharing of famous supplementary education teacher]

201
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,798
many schools are facing the suspension of enrollment,
[The Way of Elite Education]

202
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,667
and various supplementary education institutions have also been affected to some extent.

203
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,836
But your supplementary education system

204
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,105
set up branch campuses every year.

205
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,573
You are really a person of outstanding talent.

206
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,510
Could you share your tips with the audience?

207
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:43,015
Actually, the declining birthrate and the low fertility rate

208
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,820
have indeed had a certain impact on the supplementary education sector.

209
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,987
But all along, what sets our system apart from others

210
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:54,224
is that we destroyed the myth of cramming.

211
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:58,596
Only by self-directed learning can kids learn more, learn faster,

212
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,499
and learn happier.

213
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,902
Parents will be happy when their kids are.

214
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,237
So we can have such good results.

215
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,640
Thank you so much for your sharing today.

216
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,375
We have gained a lot.

217
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,075
Thank you again─

218
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,463
Mama Xu.

00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,764
Ye Guang.

220
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,199
Did you make an appointment with Xu Qi Zhang?

221
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,404
He didn't answer my phone.

222
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,507
Have you eaten?

223
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,642
Even if you are in a bad mood, you have to eat.

224
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,478
How about shredded chicken noodles?

225
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,113
Thank you, Mama Xu.

226
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,615
Look at you.
[Mama Xu's Noodle Shop]

227
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,252
You look pitiful like a puppy.

228
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,574
Here.

229
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,742
Eat it while it's hot.

230
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,110
Thank you.

231
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,650
Mama Xu.

232
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,380
What if I said something that made Xu Qi Zhang unhappy?

233
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:30,489
It depends on whether you meant it or were just angry.

234
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,458
Who are you to tell me these?

235
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,525
You don't have a dad like mine. How could you understand what I'm feeling now?

236
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,566
I don't really know how to get along with people.

237
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,637
It must be because I spend too much time studying.

238
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,008
But I heard Xu Qi Zhang say that

239
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,477
many of your classmates at school like you very much.

240
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,013
He said your grades are good,

241
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,782
and you are active in whatever you do, aren't you?

242
00:16:56,782 --> 00:17:00,183
That's what my dad wants me to do, not what I want.

243
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:02,087
Then what do you want to do?

244
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,456
What things make you happy?

245
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,994
I'm not quite sure.

246
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,197
I actually haven't thought about it seriously.

247
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,700
But I really envy Xu Qi Zhang.

248
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:23,506
Actually, all parents love their kids.

249
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:27,279
They will treat their kids in the way they think is best.

250
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,249
It's just that maybe kids don't like those methods.

251
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,451
So you need to ask yourself.

252
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,888
Ye Guang, what do you want?

253
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,257
Then communicate with your parents.

254
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,492
Or how else would they know what you want?

255
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,130
When you've figured it out, communicate with your parents.

256
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,799
And they will know.

257
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,605
Do the same with Xu Qi Zhang.

258
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,573
Communicate.

259
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,578
All right, eat the noodles.

260
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,680
You will have strength after you eat.

261
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,816
Thank you, Mama Xu.

I couldn't reach you all day yesterday.

274
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,570
I am wondering if you are still angry.

275
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,284
I have been busy practicing recently.

276
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,921
And how could I possibly be angry at you?

277
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,656
No.

278
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,580
I think I should apologize to you in person.

279
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,762
I shouldn't have taken out my anger on you

280
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,990
just because I was in a bad mood.

281
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,350
What's wrong?

282
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,675
I was wrong, too.

283
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,344
We grew up in different environments.

284
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,314
I didn't know you were so stressed.

285
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,617
So in the future, let me know if anything happens, okay?

286
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,720
I don't want it

287
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,456
to be like this time.

288
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,461
If we quarrel, we make up.

289
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,030
If we quarrel again,

290
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,130
it will be okay after we make up again.

291
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,342
What?

292
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,549
Now that we've made up, can we quarrel again?

293
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,521
Nonsense! Boring.

294
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:04,463
I like a part of your singing just now.

This one?

297
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,104
Right?

298
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,274
