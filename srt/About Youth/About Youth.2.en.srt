166
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:25,470
to provide me some ideas and many things actually because I'm really amazed.

167
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,040
About that part, I...

168
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,815
- Sir.
- Yes, please.

169
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:41,786
From my perspective, I reckon the school should establish a diversified way of development

170
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:45,490
so that students can participate in international affairs more,

171
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,260
thus, they will be able to broaden their horizon as early as possible.

172
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,861
That's great. Thank you so much.

173
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:53,430
- It's my pleasure.
- Wonderful.

174
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,799
- This way.
- Okay.

175
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,606
Ye Guang.

176
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:02,841
Yes, Senior.

177
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,910
Not bad.

178
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,313
No wonder everyone says you are my successor.

179
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:10,749
I hope you'll live up to it.

180
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,853
Work hard.

181
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,055
I will, Senior.

182
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,934
Your black tea angel was here again.

183
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:35,137
"Even if it's not perfect, it's worth moving forward."

184
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:39,095
[Even if it's not perfect, it's worth moving forward.]

185
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,114
I am really envious that you have your own angel.

186
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,488
You will have yours for sure.

187
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,625
You have a lot of things going on,

188
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,493
and you can handle them all.

189
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,262
Your dad gave you a new mission, to become the student union president.

190
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:01,567
Can you really handle all this?

191
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,470
As long as I have plans, it's not a problem.

192
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,339
Okay.

193
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:11,174
Let's not talk about this. Let's organize the materials first.

194
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,678
Sure.

195
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:23,352
Why do I feel that Ray has been pretending to look happy recently?

196
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,978
May I take your order?

197
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,079
No, thanks.

198
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,115
Okay, call me if you need anything.

199
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:52,684
Thank you.

200
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,462
- I'll go back and apply ice for you.
- Sure.

201
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,873
Welcome.

202
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,908
You're here.

203
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:19,010
Why are you late again?

204
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,379
Not that late.

205
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,148
Anyway, I am here.

206
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,617
This is our menu.

207
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,486
Do you need me to give you recommendations?

208
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,055
No, thanks.

209
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,989
- Thanks.
- Okay.

210
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,200
Did you notice any difference in me?

211
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,000
Where?

212
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,200
Lipstick.

213
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,800
You gave it to me. Do you still remember?

214
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,800
See, I already dressed up.

215
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,600
Didn't you say you would take me to an Italian restaurant? Why are we here again?

216
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,400
It's good here.

217
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,200
The food is too expensive in the Italian restaurant.

218
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,800
So you mean you can afford all the food here?

219
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,600
Sure.

220
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Order whatever you want.

221
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,800
I'm not hungry.

222
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,300
Fine.

223
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,000
I will order this one, this one,

224
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,200
this one, and this one.

225
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,800
So much? Can you eat them all?

226
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,900
Of course. And I want to order this too.

227
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,600
Okay.

228
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,400
Excuse me.

229
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,000
Hello.

230
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
Hello.

231
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,300
Hello.

232
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,500
- I'd like to order.
- Lin Xiang.

233
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,000
What are you doing? Baby.

234
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,800
- You lied to me again.
- I didn't lie to you.

235
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,400
Why are you dating this high school student again?

236
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,800
I didn't lie to you.

237
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,000
Then tell him to get lost now.

238
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,900
Leave. Please leave quickly.

239
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,400
Stop pestering me.

240
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,800
- Leave.
- What are you doing?

241
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,900
- Who are you?
- I'm the shop assistant here. What do you want?

242
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
So what?

243
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,000
Do you know what kind of person he is?

244
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,100
Scumbag. If you don't get lost, I will call the police.

245
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,700
- Go ahead.
- Come on.

246
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,300
- Go ahead.
- Stop it.

247
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,800
Baby.

248
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,100
Hold on. Let me explain.

249
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,600
Hey, hold on.

250
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,600
Hey.

251
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,900
You forgot to take the cake.

252
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,500
Eat slowly.

253
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,600
Don't eat any more.

254
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,000
It's none of your business.

255
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,800
I said to stop eating. It's not worth doing it for him.

256
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,400
I don't care if it's worth it or not.

257
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,300
♫ Even before we hugged ♫

258
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,400
♫ I already expected ♫

259
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,400
♫ How hard it would be to separate ♫

260
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm going to dismantle his motorcycle.

261
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,500
Do you want to go with me?

262
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,600
It's already fine.

263
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,500
Wear it tightly. Why would you want to wear a safety helmet loose?

264
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,400
Your pants have so many holes.

265
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,200
Don't you feel cold?

266
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,400
Not at all. I am leaving.

267
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,200
Okay, good luck with your performance.

268
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,400
Xu Qi Zhang, I love you.

269
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,400
Be careful.

270
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,200
Xu Qi Zhang.

271
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,800
Xu...

272
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,200
Follow the scooter in front.

273
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,200
- Hi, Brother Benny.
- Hi.

274
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Quickly go inside and get ready.

275
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,000
- Excuse me.
- Where is your ticket?

276
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,600
Excuse me, can I still enter?

277
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,100
- Yes, go in quickly.
- Thank you.

278
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,800
It's okay, I will call my friend.

279
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,200
Okay.

280
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,300
Aren't you Qi Zhang's friend,

281
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,200
Ye Guang?

282
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,600
Yes, I am.

283
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,400
- How did you know?
- Benny, he is our friend.

284
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,200
Just let him in when the show starts.

285
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,600
Okay.

286
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,800
A'Jian, you have to get prepared.

287
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Okay, I am going in first. See you later.

288
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,000
I will leave it to you.

289
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,100
Okay.

290
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,400
Take a seat over there first. I will bring you in later.

291
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,700
- Okay, thanks.

♪ Love me, love me, don't be afraid ♪

329
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,800
♫ Slowly getting closer, there's nothing that can beat me ♫

330
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,000
♫ Decide the sequel to me and you ♫

331
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,200
♫ Just sing for you and keep repeating it ♫

♫ Someone will always come ♫

333

♫ No need to cover up ♫

334
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,200
♫ Like the sky and the sea never separating ♫

335
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,600
♫ They also can't get any closer ♫

336
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,800
♫ Don't want to just hide in the clouds ♫

337
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,300
♫ Love is not the only choice ♫

338
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,800
♫ Can we be together ♫

339
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,100
♫ Looking for the definition of existence ♫

340
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:03,000
♫ I want to be your faith in slow motion ♫

341
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:12,400
♫ I can't forget your face in slow motion ♫

342
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:19,200
♫ I want to be your faith in slow motion ♫

343
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:28,600
♫ I can't forget your face in slow motion ♫

344
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:35,700
♫ I want to be your faith in slow motion ♫

345
