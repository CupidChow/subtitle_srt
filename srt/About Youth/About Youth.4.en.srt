Okay.

167
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,079
I am leaving.

168
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,680
Bye-bye.

169
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,882
All students, come here to take a look.

170
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:35,220
Chen Jun Wei from Year 2, Class 2, decided to run for president of the student union.

171
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,621
Now he's going to give you gifts.

172
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,156
Hurry up. You have to be fast if you want to grab it.

173
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:41,593
As soon as I get elected,

174
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:43,729
the toilets in the whole school will be replaced by bidet toilets.

175
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,397
Bidet toilets.

176
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,932
I will set up a 5G base station.

177
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,199
5G base station.

178
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,835
All of you must support me. Thank you.

179
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:52,337
Free black tea.

180
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:53,872
Remember to support Chen Jun Wei.

181
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:57,008
- Senior Jun Wei, you are very handsome when you dance.
- Everyone will get one.

182
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,444
Remember to support Chen Jun Wei.

183
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,377
Thank you. Okay.

184
00:13:00,377 --> 00:13:02,179
Here. One... Sorry.

185
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:03,715
- One, two, three.
- Thank you, thank you.

186
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:05,350
Remember to support Chen Jun Wei.

187
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,451
Join us.

188
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,854
Okay, thanks.

189
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,623
RayRay, you look very handsome today.

190
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,758
Would you like to drink black tea?

191
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:15,827
Are you sure?

192
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,365
Lin Nai Mi, what's wrong with you?

193
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,334
Take care of him, okay?

194
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,471
This tastes good.

195
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,939
Can't I give it to him?

196
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:30,208
Why are you doing this again?

197
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,917
What are you doing?

198
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,453
You are weird today.

199
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,523
No!

200
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,062
No?

201
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,890
No!

202
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,300
- Where did you go last night?
- I went to

203
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,869
a friend's home.

204
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,137
Friend?

205
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:01,272
Who?

206
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,508
You don't know him.

207
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,043
Which of your friends don't I know?

208
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,610
All right.

209
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,585
I'll introduce the two of you another day.

210
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:15,587
Why didn't you stay at my home?

211
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,555
My home is big.

212
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:21,393
All right, eat.

213
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:32,421
[Xu Qi Zhang]

214
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,909
Xu Qi Zhang's video suddenly became popular.

215
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,577
I really don't understand.

216
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,080
Did he upload it himself to attract fans?

217
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,820
He's not like that.

218
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,790
He's not like that?

219
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,491
Are you two close?

220
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,861
It's my guess.

221
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,564
It's my guess.

222
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,533
Hi, Teacher.

223
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,935
Hi, popular boy.

224
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,036
Popular boy?

225
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:07,572
It turns out that my performance video was uploaded by you.

226
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:10,041
I was wondering why it suddenly popped up in the school community.

227
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,843
I said I would help you.

228
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,580
Now you've settled the popularity part.

229
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,381
Thank you, Teacher.

230
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,119
Next, we will discuss your views about the school's development.

231
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,120
The main purpose is to let the students of Haicheng High School

232
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,656
have more diversified ways of development.

233
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,293
The director said that your competitors this time are very strong.

234
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:35,686
You have to work hard yourself and perform well. Understand?

235
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:38,040
I will go home early today and wait for you.

236
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,928
You can bring up any questions that you have, and we'll discuss them.

237
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,485
Why are you here?

238
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,455
To give you a drink.

239
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,757
Thank you.

240
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,562
Do you also like this drink?

241
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,773
Is there anything on your mind?

242
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,276
No.

243
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,816
It's my dad.

244
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,300
My band is going to practice tomorrow.

245
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,000
Would you like to come?

246
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,800
It can relieve stress.

247
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Practice?

248
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,300
Sure.

249
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,165
Nice.

250
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,600
♫ People come and go ♫

251
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,200
Did you write the song at the concert?

252
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,600
♫ I inadvertently pretended to be natural ♫

253
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,000
♫ Oh, do you feel the same way ♫

254
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,400
♫ You appear ♫
♫ As bright as the sun ♫

255
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,600
♫ Over and over again ♫
♫ Hiding your exhaustion ♫

256
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,200
Ye Guang, hold on.

257
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,000
Sorry. You're here.

258
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,100
♫ Don't want to just hide in the clouds ♫

259
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,800
♫ Love is not the only choice ♫

260
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,000
Was it hard to find your way here?

261
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,900
It's okay. I found it by following the map on the phone.

262
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,800
Let's go.

263
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,600
Will I disturb you guys?

264
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,800
No, they're all nice. Let's go.

265
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,300
Should I buy something for them?

266
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,600
No need. Let's go.

267
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,200
- Really?
- Yes.

268
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,000
This is where I practice with the band.

269
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,200
It's really not bad.

270
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,800
I just looked at you.

271
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
I will introduce them to you.

272
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
Did you hear me?

273
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,400
Hi, everyone.

274
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
This is my friend, Ye Guang.

275
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,900
Hi, everyone. I am Ye Guang.

276
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,000
So you are Ye Guang.

277
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,400
Not bad.

278
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,800
You are really tall.

279
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,400
Qi Zhang always─

280
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
What are you doing?

281
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
Hi, I am Iris.

282
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,400
Hello.

283
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,700
Not bad.

284
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,900
So cute.

285
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,400
Brother.

286
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,000
All right. Your enthusiasm will scare him.

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,200
- So annoying.
- Leave it to me.

288
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,200
Hi, we meet again.

289
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,800
Thank you so much for the other day.

290
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,000
Don't be so polite. Relax.

291
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,600
By the way, why did you leave halfway that day?

292
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,400
Qi Zhang─

293
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,200
What are you doing?

294
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
He's our band leader, A'Jian,

295
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,800
and also my good brother.

296
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,300
We are really close.

297
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,800
Okay, I will introduce the others to you.

298
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
This is our bass player.

299
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,800
- Hello.
- Shaun.

300
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,400
Your hands are so soft.

301
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,800
Enough, enough.

302
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,400
This is our drummer, Iris.

303
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,500
Hello, I am Iris.

304
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,000
The most beautiful female drummer in Taiwan.

305
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,400
Okay, you are the most beautiful.

306
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,100
Our guitarist, Xiao Jie.

307
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,200
Hi, I am Xiao Jie.

308
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,300
Do you want to drink anything?

309
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,200
We've got water, beverages and─

310
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,400
Why are you nervous?

311
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,400
I am nervous for Qi Zhang.

312
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,000
That's right. You should.

313
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Nervous.

314
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,400
Okay.

315
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,300
Let's practice.

316
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,000
Shall we practice now?

317
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,300
Which song are you going to play?

318
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,216
Just that song. Go. Hurry up.

319
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,400
All right. Let's practice.

320
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Fine.

321
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,300
Iris first.

322
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,200
Sure.

323
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Take a seat.

324
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,000
Sit here.

325
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,000
♪ Baby, you can't take it away, in my pocket ♪

326
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,600
♪ No matter what they say, cause I like it ♪

327
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600

♪ Flying against the wind to see the most beautiful scenery ♪

329
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,000
Do you guys have dinner so early?

330
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,200
We have to eat when we are hungry.

331
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
You must be hungry, too.

332
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,300
Here's the fruit I just washed.

333
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,400
Here, Ye Guang.

334
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
And egg tarts.

335
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,600
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

336
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,000
Quick, eat. Stop being busy.

337
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's start eating.

338
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,800
Do you have a knife and fork? How to eat?

339
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,400
With your hands, of course.

340
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Don't you know?

341
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,100
It tastes better when using your hands to eat.

342
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,600
Or do you want...

343
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,700
Eat it.

344
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,900
So sweet.

345
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,600
Thank you.

346
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
There's a lot more fried chicken.

347
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,800
Aren't you eating?

348
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
It's okay, you just eat.

349
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,400
Iris, I want that chocolate.

350
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
Help me take it.

351
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,700
Thank you.

352
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,800
♫ Someone will always come ♫

353
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,800
♫ No need to cover up ♫

354
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,800
♫ Like the sky and the sea never separating ♫

355
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,500
♫ They also can't get any closer ♫

356
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,600
♫ Don't want to just hide in the clouds ♫

357
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,600
♫ Love is not the only choice ♫

358
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,600
♫ Can we be together ♫

359
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,800
♫ Looking for the definition of existence ♫

360
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:21,800
♫ I want to be your faith in slow motion ♫

361
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:30,000
♫ I can't forget your face in slow motion ♫

362
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
♫ I want to be your faith in slow motion ♫

363
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,200
♫ I can't forget your face in slow motion ♫

364
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:54,400
♫ I want to be your faith in slow motion ♫

365
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,000
♫ I can't forget your face in slow motion ♫
