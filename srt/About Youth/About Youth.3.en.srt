00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,658
Actually, I want to tell you something.

165
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,794
What?

166
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,599
My dream is to study overseas at a music academy.

167
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,601
That sounds great.

168
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:08,541
But I am afraid that my study abroad will cause a great burden on my family.

169
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,776
I heard from my teacher the other day that

170
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,579
if I'm elected president of the student union,

171
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,281
the school would give me a scholarship,

172
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,583
and I could study abroad.

173
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,787
So I'm wondering if I should try it.

174
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,388
Yes, of course, you should.

175
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,456
It's such a great opportunity.

176
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,894
Don't you mind?

177
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:31,130
No, why should I mind?

178
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,865
Anyway, running for president of the student union

179
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,934
isn't something I wanted to do in the first place.

180
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,469
It's my dad who wants me to run for it.

181
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,504
I don't want to disappoint him.

182
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,248
Quickly fill it in. Don't hesitate anymore.

183
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,452
Let's work hard together.

184
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,790
Okay.

185
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,561
Start filling from here.

186
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,366
The list of candidates for president of the student union is out.

187
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,802
Ye Guang is sure to run for president of the student union.

188
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,936
And the guy I once investigated,

189
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:14,673
Xu Qi Zhang, will run for it, too.

190
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,474
Who is that?

191
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,678
It's annoying.

192
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,147
Well...

193
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,515
There's a good method.

194
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,785
You can also run for it.

195
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,520
Good idea.

196
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,457
- Clever.
- Of course.

197
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,563
Okay. Then, what do we do now?

198
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:47,288
Guang Guang, we have to go out for a few days because something suddenly cropped up.

199
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:50,874
Remember to study hard and eat well.

200
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,666
Hello, are you free?

201
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,202
I am at the shop. What's up?

202
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,638
I want to give you the pants back

203
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,740
and try your soup at the same time.

204
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,213
What's the use of raising a nephew like you?

205
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,549
You don't want to give any penny to your uncle!

206
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,884
Hello. Hello?

207
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,320
Go and cook noodles for me!

208
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,788
- Are you okay?
- Ye Guang, sorry. I am not available now.

209
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,327
Stop it.

210
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,263
Where are my noodles? Cook noodles for me!

211
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,239
When is your mom coming back?

212
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,276
Let me tell you.

213
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,214
Your mom is my sister.

214
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,419
Xu Qi Zhang.

215
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,587
Ye Guang.

216
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:10,455
Are you Xiao Zhang's friend?

217
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,756
Who are you? Who are you?

218
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,692
Give me money. Give me money!

219
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,598
If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

220
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,805
How are you?

221
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,708
Are you scared?

222
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,582
Come in.

223
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,220
Come here. Let me see if you are hurt anywhere.

224
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,721
Be careful.

225
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,590
Here?

226
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,425
Yes. Sit down.

227
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,296
It hurts here, right?

228
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,598
- A little bit.
- I'll help you.

229
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,500
Let me.

230
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,507
Will it get infected? Let me take you to the hospital.

231
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:06,178
It's okay. It's a small injury.

232
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,481
Just apply some medicine and it would be fine.

233
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,896
Put it here.

234
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,764
It's fine. Be careful.

235
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,737
Does it hurt?

236
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,039
Not really.

237
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,679
Sorry, I will be more gentle.

238
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,550
I'm really sorry for today.

239
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,086
Sorry.

240
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,955
Never mind.

241
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,757
Were you scared?

242
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:58,097
Is your uncle always like this?

243
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,366
He wasn't like this before.

244
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,537
He's been having a hard time lately.

245
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,006
He often came to the shop to make a fuss when he was drunk

246
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,070
and asked my mom for money.

247
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,946
I didn't expect you to have suffered so much.

248
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,449
Done. Be careful.

249
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,052
Thank you.

250
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,856
Let me see if you're injured anywhere else.

251
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,524
Does it hurt here?

252
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,726
Why is it reddened here?

253
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,450
Let me see.

254
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,820
I think I got scalded today.

255
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,971
Why didn't you tell me?

256
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,639
Doesn't it hurt?

257
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,400
It's okay. I'm used to getting scalded.

258
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,946
Who would get used to getting scalded?

259
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,581
I often help out at the noodle stall.

260
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,303
♫ Just kidding ♫

261
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,386
It's all red.

262
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,088
This won't do.

263
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,526
I'll do it myself.

264
00:16:04,393 --> 00:16:08,584
♫ Even before we hugged ♫

265
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:12,615
♫ I already expected ♫

266
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,609
I'll apply it myself.

267
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,110
Thank you.

268
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,181
Does it hurt?

269
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,850
Not really.

270
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:31,657
Let me help you.

271
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:34,545
Thank you.

272
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:43,184
♫ I only dare to look at you ♫

273
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:50,460
♫ Occasional thoughts ♫

♫ It's better to endure it ♫

275
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:57,890

00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,078
All right.

283
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,948
I see that your clothes got dirty.

284
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,916
I will get you clean ones. Just give it to me.

285
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,817
- I haven't finished yet.
- It's okay.
- Where are you going?

286
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:35,821
I'll go get you clothes.

287
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,724
Xu Qi Zhang?

288
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,328
So many CDs.

289
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,874
Are these all yours? Super cool.

290
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,243
Yes, these are all my treasures.

291
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,348
Is this your idol?

292
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:39,384
He's my dad.

293
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,987
A musician who released many albums.

294
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,689
Cool.

295
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,891
Did he ever hold a concert?

296
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,693
I'd like to be there.

297
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,030
He passed away when I was in my third year of middle school.

My dad was a dad who sang the best

302
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:12,710
and played the guitar the best.

303
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,489
It doesn't matter that

304
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,625
he only had two fans; me and my mom.

He is the best singer in the world.

308
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,793
Until one day,

309
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,429
he suddenly fell down in the bathroom

310
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,933
and was sent to the hospital.

311
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,011
Sorry.

312
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,247
It's okay.

313
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,384
Look, we look quite alike.

314
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,093
What's wrong?

315
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,996
I was thinking that you...

316
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:35,099
You've been through so much.

317
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,437
How could you still be like this now?

318
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,741
Maybe I inherited it from my dad.

319
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:46,145
No matter how sad he was or what happened,

320
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,812
he would always tell me

321
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,781
it would be fine after a sleep

322
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,252
and to be happy every day.

323
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,156
Go and change out of your dirty clothes.

324
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,736
How is it? Not bad, right?

325
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:16,706
I feel that it has a sense of depth. It's not bad.

326
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:18,042
It's just a demo.

327
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,778
Remember to let me listen to it when you're done.

328
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,079
Sure.

329
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,982
Where did you buy these earphones?

330
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:27,218
I think the sound quality is not bad.

331
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:29,287
I saved money for a long time to buy them.

332
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,289
Take me to buy them another day.

333
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,326
Do you want to listen to other songs?

334
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:36,527
Sure.

335
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:38,896
Let me find songs for you.

336
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,619
Ye Guang.

337
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,100
Ye-Ye Guang.

338
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,500
Ye Guang.

339
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,900
♫ I love you, I love you ♫

340
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,860
♫ I couldn't bring myself to say it ♫

341
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:48,520
♫ I love you, I love you, I love you ♫

342
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:01,931
♫ Someone will always come ♫

343
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:05,968
♫ No need to cover up ♫

344
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:11,050
♫ Like the sky and the sea never separating ♫

345
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,409
♫ They also can't get any closer ♫

346
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:18,800
♫ Don't want to just hide in the clouds ♫

347
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,821
♫ Love is not the only choice ♫

348
00:23:22,821 --> 00:23:26,659
♫ Can we be together ♫

349
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:29,925
♫ Looking for the definition of existence ♫

350
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:38,100
♫ I want to be your faith in slow motion ♫

351
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:46,190
♫ I can't forget your face in slow motion ♫

352
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:53,170
♫ I want to be your faith in slow motion ♫

353
00:23:54,315 --> 00:24:01,220
♫ I can't forget your face in slow motion ♫

354
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:09,420
♫ I want to be your faith in slow motion ♫

355
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:17,725
♫ I can't forget your face in slow motion ♫
