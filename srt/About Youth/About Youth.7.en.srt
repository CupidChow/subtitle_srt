00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,489
What legend?

165
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,590
Cross your arms over your chest and see if you can see your rear foot.

166
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,828
"Cross your arms over your chest."

167
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,396
"See your rear foot."

168
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:34,834
You are taking off!

169
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,470
You're so boring!

170
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,172
What do you mean?

171
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,207
He looks so cute like that.

172
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,311
What high school student joke is that?

173
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,046
You don't understand.

174
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,248
I am really starving.

175
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,450
- Let's go buy something to eat.
- Let's go.

176
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,118
Let's go.

177
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,124
Not bad.

178
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,625
What?

179
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,020
It seems like things are getting better with the two of you.

180
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,365
When are you going to confess?

181
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,268
Not so soon. Not like you.

182
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,804
The faster, the better.

183
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,339
Let's go. No more nonsense.

184
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,727
What are you doing?

185
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,599
What's the matter?

186
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,410
That tickles.

187
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,012
What are you doing?

188
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,414
What's the matter?

189
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,607
- I want to eat it, too.
- No.

190
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,410
Why?

191
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,877
- No.
- This is mine.

192
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,949
Say that again.

193
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:30,883
No.

194
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,084
Are you sure?

195
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,385
No. No.

196
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,946
I want to eat noodles.

197
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,249
I will cook them for you. Wait for me.

198
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,784
Okay.

199
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,162
Choose one.

200
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,765
Choose one.

201
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,200
I want this one.

202
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,903
The last time I played this was a long time ago.

203
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,141
Not like this.

204
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,409
This is very therapeutic.

205
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,179
Let me teach you. Like this.

206
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,347
Dip it first.

207
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,616
After it is fully dipped, raise it slowly.

208
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:41,687
- How slow?
- See?

209
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,822
Yes?

210
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,923
Yes.

211
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:51,809
♫ Hey, let me be your sun ♫

212
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,190
Look, so many bubbles there.

213
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:06,171
♫ Let the sun shine ♫

214
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:12,359
♫ For that window of your heart ♫

215
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,989
Yes, the bubbles are in the picture.

216
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:17,957
Really?

217
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,191
Yes.

218
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,560
Any bubbles?

219
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,462
Yes.

220
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,664
Did you capture that moment?

221
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,299
Yes.

222
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:32,405
♫ When you get hurt ♫

223
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,407
I'll take you to more fun places next time.

224
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,944
Why are you so nice to me?

225
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,048
Because I like you.

226
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:48,393
♫ In the gloom, you won't be lonely ♫

227
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:50,222
I like you.

228
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:56,559
♫ I'll hold your hands and caress your wounds ♫

229
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:08,424
[Here, our first photo together.]

230
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:24,940
[Today is our first day. Rest early. Good night.]

231
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,044
[Good night. See you tomorrow.]

232
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,671
Let's have supper later.

233
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,472
Do you still want to eat?

234
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,007
It's late.

235
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,400
All right. We have arrived.

236
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,283
Give it to me.

237
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,000
Give it to me.

238
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you.

239
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,400
Guang Guang?

240
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,000
My bag.

241
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,700
How come?

242
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,900
Hello, I am in the taxi. I will be right there.

243
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,800
Bag.

244
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,200
Bag or hug?

245
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,700
Bag.

246
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,500
I thought you meant a hug.

247
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
What are you thinking about?

248
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,948
Bye-bye.

249
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,884
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

250
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,200
Ye Guang.

251
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,800
What's up?

252
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,400
Nothing. I just forgot to say good night.

253
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,000
- Good night.
- Good night.

254
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,700
Guang Guang.

255
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,800
Come out. Hurry up.

256
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,500
Coming.

257
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,291
Kneel down.

258
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,693
- Why?
- Kneel down.

259
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,100
- I didn't do anything. Why must I—
- Just kneel.

260
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,900
Kneel properly.

261
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,300
Let me ask you.

262
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,400
Who is that person who sent you back on the scooter?

263
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,600
I walked home. Nobody sent me back.

264
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,500
You still dare to lie?

265
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,264
Your mom saw it.

266
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Tell us the truth.

267
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,800
Who is that guy?

268
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,500
A classmate I met recently.

269
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,200
A classmate?

270
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,900
Is he from your class?

271
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,700
What's his name?

272
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,500
Even if I tell you, you don't know him.

273
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,300
Tell us!

274
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,700
Xu Qi Zhang.

275
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,900
I said you don't know him.

276
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Xu Qi Zhang?

277
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,100
He should not be in your class.

278
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,200
I've never heard this name.

279
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,300
He is not in our class, but he treats me well.

280
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,500
He treats you well, so you run around with him every day?

281
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,400
I told you not to make weird friends.

282
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,300
He is not weird at all.

283
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,100
- He has a band, and his grades are good.
- He has a band?

284
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,800
No wonder he dressed so strangely.

285
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,100
Because his father passed away, and he has to help his mother with the noodle shop.

286
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,300
So he is from a single-parent family?

287
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,700
I have long said that how a kid is raised is closely related to what kind of family he is from.

288
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,800
Guang Guang. Do you know what kind of friends you should make?

289
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,900
I have told you many times that birds of a feather flock together.

290
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,600
Children from single-parent families like him can easily become problem teenagers.

291
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,500
You don't even know him. Why did you say that about him?

292
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,300
What's wrong with single-parent families?

293
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,000
How dare you talk back at your parents?

294
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Such a child whose family sells noodles and has no father to teach him,

295
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
what can he achieve in the future?

296
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
It would be better if he was like you, right?

297
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,400
Who do you think allows you to live like this?

298
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,000
Your dad has done a lot for you.

299
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,600
How can you say that to him?

300
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,800
I've never felt it.

301
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,300
You only care about yourselves and your honor.

302
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,200
When did you─

303
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,360
We've always cared a lot about you.

304
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,800
Really?

305
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,600
You have never said that you love me.

306
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Of course we love you, Baby.

307
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,000
Both your dad and I love you very much.

308
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,600
How could you say this?
