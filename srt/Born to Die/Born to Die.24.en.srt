Seize this spy from the enemy side

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,480
at once!

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,640
Prince Kesong,

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,640
you colluded with outsiders,

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,000
killed nobles from both nations,

22
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,040
and used me to frame Song Dianxin.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,710
You're talking nonsense.

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,760
Where's your proof?

25
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,400
The fact that I'm not dead

26
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,280
is the proof.

27
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,590
Execute them on the spot!

28
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,920
I'd like to see who dares!

29
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,230
The Emperor has arrived!

30
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,910
Father.

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,000
It's...

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,150
Song Dianxin is bold.

33
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,150
She allied with outsiders
to break the prison

34
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,150
and tried to frame me!

35
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,630
- Father...
- Enough.

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,870
My dear daughter,

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,430
I've heard

38
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,910
everything you said.

39
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,430
Why must you seek war
between the two nations?

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,280
Because they deserve to die.

41
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,520
Over a hundred lives of my mother's family

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,400
were slaughtered by the Nanlu royal family.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,190
I must avenge my family.

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,000
Hatred is poison,

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,560
but also medicine.

46
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,000
Princess Kesong, lacking virtue,

47
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,590
has repeatedly committed grave crimes,

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
which is unforgivable by the law.

49
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,150
She is hereby stripped of her title,

50
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,960
confined to the palace,

51
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,560
and forbidden to leave forever.

52
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,590
General Song Guolin, falsely accused,

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,030
lived a life loyal to his king and country.

54
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,630
He is posthumously honored
as Marquis of Yi Yong.

55
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,750
The Song family
is to be released immediately.

56
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,560
Song Dianxin, quelling internal strife

57
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,190
as outstanding merit,

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,950
is reinstated to her former position

59
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,070
and granted the title
of Grand General of the Nation.

60
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,120
Sister Dianxin,

61
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,190
since childhood,
I've been controlled by Mother.

62
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,830
My only goal

63
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,000
was to avenge my mother's family.

64
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,040
I miss the days spent with you.

65
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,480
Back then,

66
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,240
I truly lived as myself.

67
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,360
Sister Dianxin,

68
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,920
save me.

69
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,000
Sister Kesong,

70
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,190
this is the first

71
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,480
and last time I'll call you that.

72
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,190
You can hate me,

73
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,600
and hate me forever.

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,070
That way,

75
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,070
you can keep living with hatred.

76
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,870
Song Dianxin,

77
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,950
you'll regret this.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,430
The path of power

79
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,160
is paved with bones and blood.

80
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,750
You're too soft-hearted.

81
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,800
You're too naive, Song Dianxin.

82
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,600
You can stop the war for a moment,

83
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,360
but not forever.

84
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,660
(Peace and Prosperity)

85
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,480
Are you really leaving?

86
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
Now that I've been reinstated,

87
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,390
I can still protect you at Qianwei Teahouse.

88
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,390
Song Dianxin,

89
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,950
I want to return to Nanlu Kingdom

90
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,800
to reclaim what's rightfully mine,

91
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
and to fulfill your dream.

92
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,070
My dream?

93
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,800
With my strength,

94
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,800
I want to prevent war from rising.

95
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,680
I will use all the power I have

96
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,190
to protect the peace of both nations.

97
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,680
The road ahead is treacherous.

98
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
It's just a pity

99
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,240
it won't be you by my side.

100
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,310
The one who accompanies you
will appear in time.

101
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,800
But that person will never be me.

102
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,390
Dianxin,

103
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,870
as a friend,

104
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,480
can I have a hug?

105
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,560
No.

106
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,830
Of course.

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,190
I'm leaving now.

108
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,310
Someone is waiting for you.

109
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,920
Will we meet again?

110
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
If there's a chance, we surely will.

111
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,040
I hope it's not on the battlefield.

112
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,750
Of course.

113
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,390
Take good care of yourself.

114
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,390
Shen Musi,

115
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,030
if Dianxin is ever unhappy,

116
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,240
I'll take her away at any time.

117
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,600
You wouldn't dare.

118
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,080
Why wouldn't I?

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,960
Song Dianxin,

120
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,030
take good care of yourself.

121
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,320
May you live a life of peace and joy,

122
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,120
with someone to rely on,

123
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,200
and someone to trust.

127

of General Song and the grand master.

128
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,150
Our manager has declared

129
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,870
that on the 1st and 15th of every month,

130
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,600
- it'll be our charity day.
- Thank you.

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
There's plenty of food for everyone.

132
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,790
Don't push, line up!

133
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,670
Mother,

134
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,670
where do the people
in the storybooks go in the end?

135
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,750
They go into the next story.

136
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,910
When can we

137
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,910
- see the next story?
- Over here.

138
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,240
You'll all get one.

139
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,440
