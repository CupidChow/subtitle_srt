=Episode 20=

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,680
It's hard for one to change one's habits.

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,400
This is clearly

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,560
a frame-up against Song Dianxin.

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,790
This alone may not be enough to convince us.

19
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,400
In my opinion,

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,120
Song Dianxin should be executed.

21
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,150
Princess,

22
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,040
Song Dianxin is my wife.

23
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,680
If she is guilty,

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,740
I'd stake my reputation as the grand master

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,040
and share her punishment.

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,430
Grand Master,

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,120
your love for her

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,920
is truly moving.

29
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,870
Dianxin,

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,350
do you have anything to say?

31
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,040
The engagement

32
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,750
between us have long been annulled.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,630
From the past until now,

34
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,960
we have never been together.

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,630
No need to share the punishment.

36
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,430
(Dianxin.)

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,400
(I know you're afraid of burdening me,)

38
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,630
(but do you realize)

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,960
(you don't have to struggle alone?)

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,910
A life for a life.

41
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,430
Then execute Song Dianxin on the spot.

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,630
Wait!

43
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,520
Ninth Prince,

44
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,520
it seems that staying
at Qianwei Teahouse for long

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,630
has made you forget your status.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,560
You'd better remember your stance.

47
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,630
Dianxin and I

48
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,910
have already been married.

49
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,590
She'll be Nanlu's princess consort.

50
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,800
If you insist on harming her,

51
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,870
it will incite war
between the two nations.

52
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,630
Can you bear that responsibility?

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,150
It seems

54
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,080
you're deeply infatuated with Dianxin.

55
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,240
However,

56
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,150
this is likely just your one-sided claim.

57
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,190
This is Dianxin's personal item.

58
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,080
Back then,

59
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,960
she gave me this jade pendant

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,840
as a token of love.

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,190
Dianxin,

62
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,280
two men are vying to protect you.

63
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,840
I'm quite curious.

64
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
Do you acknowledge

65
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,660
the ninth prince's words?

66
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,240
The ninth prince's words

67
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,590
are true.

68
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,240
Your Highness, prioritize the greater good

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,240
and revisit Song Dianxin's case.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,680
What a spectacle this has been.

71
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,160
The Ninth Prince has even

72
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,680
pinned the blame for inciting war on me.

73
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,800
Minister of Justice,

74
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,390
according to the laws of Haiyin Kingdom,

75
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,480
how should such an uncertain case

76
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,310
be handled?

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,830
Confine the suspect

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,680
until the truth is revealed.

79
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,950
Let it be done this way.

80
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,480
Understood.

81
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,240
Dianxin,

82
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,510
let's go back.

83
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,600
Let's go.

84
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,680
(Dianxin,)

85
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
(we've lived two lifetimes,)

86
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,600
(and we promised to be together.)

87
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,920
(But now,)

88
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,390
(you won't even give me
the chance to protect you.)

89
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,480
Why is everyone looking so gloomy?

90
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,630
We're here with Qianwei Teahouse.

91
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,120
Manager, we all want to stay

92
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,520
and help you through this crisis.

93
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,830
There's no crisis.

94
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,630
Once the truth comes to light,

95
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,830
everything will be resolved.

96
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,630
When the storm passes,

97
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,840
you can return.

98
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,310
All of you

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,040
have fought alongside me on the battlefield.

100
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,390
Now that Qianwei Teahouse is in danger,

101
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,270
even if you stay,

102
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,720
you won't be able to help me.

103
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,430
You're our general.

104
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,190
We're willing to risk our lives for you.

105
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,240
As long as there's a glimmer of hope,

106
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,630
we'll defend Qianwei Teahouse to the death.

107
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,040
We rise

108
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,720
and fall together.

109
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,750
Soldiers, heed my command!

110
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,830
Yes!

111
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,390
As your general, I now order you

112
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,800
to withdraw from Qianwei Teahouse.

113
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,720
Do not make any unnecessary sacrifices.

114
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,040
Do you understand?

115
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,560
Yes!

116
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,510
Now go.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,120
Grand Master,

118
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,030
it's inappropriate for you to stay here.

119
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,840
Please leave.

120
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,720
Why can he stay,

121
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,790
but I cannot?

122
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,270
Why must you distance yourself from me?

123
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,080
Between you and me,

124
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,910
whether it's obsession or foolish love,

125
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,840
a clean break

126
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,550
is the only outcome.

127
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,670
Dianxin,

128
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,630
this jade pendant...

129
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,630
I'll return it to its owner.

130
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,630
I don't want this pendant anymore.

131
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,200
Throw it away for me.

132
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,840
Shen Musi,

133
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,670
from now on,

134
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,030
we are strangers.

135
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,390
In this lifetime,

136
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,030
let's not meet again.

137
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,270
You're a discarded hostage prince
of Nanlu Kingdom,

138
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,030
what power do you have
to protect Song Dianxin?

139
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,360
Though my status holds no real authority,

140
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,630
once Dianxin and I marry,

141
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,390
I'll free myself from being a hostage

142
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,510
and take her far away

143
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,390
to live the life she desires.

144
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,630
Song Dianxin is my wife.

145
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,750
Even if a tombstone is erected,

146
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,440
it can only bear my surname as her husband.

147
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,480
And you? You merely scurry about, surviving,

148
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,390
not even knowing

149
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,840
when you'll die.

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,720
This is Haiyin Kingdom.

151
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,030
I am the grand master of the court.

152
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,790
If I discover anything

153
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,600
you've done to harm Song Dianxin,

154
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,630
I will ensure you die
without a burial place.

155
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,030
You wouldn't dare.

156
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,670
Why would I?

157
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,750
(Li Qi has a home to return to,)

158
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,120
(a place to retreat to.)

159
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,720
(But Shen Musi,)

160
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,440
(Haiyin Kingdom is your home.)

161
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,240
(You have your parents and family here.)

162
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,630
(The General Mansion has already fallen.)

163
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,400
(I can't drag you and your family into this)

164
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,150
(for the sake of my own selfish desires.)

165
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,120
(Though you've never explicitly told me,)

166
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,200
(I believe in your past life,)

167
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
(you never intended to harm me.)

168
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,270
Manager,

169
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
bad news.

170
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,630
I've just heard
that an official has proposed

171
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,270
sending troops to attack Nanlu.

172
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,510
Is it Princess Kesong?

173
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,670
Princess Kesong is convinced
that you are a spy.

174
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,480
She believes you will inevitably provoke war,

175
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,120
so it's better to take the initiative.

176
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,840
From Su Xuefu,

177
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,480
Eunuch Liang,

178
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,000
Luo Su,

179
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,630
to the court officials,

180
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,850
merchants,

181
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,940
and Chen Ruiyang...

182
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,840
She wouldn't go to such lengths

183
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,270
just to put me in this position.

184
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,030
Do you mean she has another purpose?

185
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Perhaps,

186
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,750
a war between the two nations

187
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,820
is her ultimate goal.

188
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,670
However,

189
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,080
once a war breaks out,

190
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,360
Li Qi...

191
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Dianxin,

192
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,150
what's the matter?

193
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,890
Yuan Xiao has prepared a carriage.

194
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,740
Tonight, you must leave Haiyin Kingdom.

195
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,320
I know what you're thinking.

196
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,840
The tensions between Haiyin
and Nanlu are rising.

197
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,030
As a hostage prince,

198
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,870
I'm naturally at the center of this storm.

199
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,240
But...

200
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,150
I don't want to leave here.

201
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,600
Isn't returning to Nanlu Kingdom your wish?

202
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,710
Staying here is just waiting for death.

203
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,530
Before the war begins,

204
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,720
as the ninth prince of Nanlu Kingdom,

205
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,890
I won't be sacrificed as a scapegoat.

206
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,240
Let me stay.

207
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,840
I can help you.
