(Shen Musi)

16
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,560
What is this?

17
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,280
The sole purpose of my life

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,400
is to make every person on this list

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,680
pay for what they've done.

20
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,150
Shen Musi,

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,840
I will not marry you.

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
Tomorrow,

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,680
please leave Qianwei Teahouse.

24
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,840
I don't even have any value
left for you to use.

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,080
All this time,

26
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,960
I've never felt anything for you.

27
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,000
So,

28
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,750
you don't need to
waste time on me anymore.

29
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,430
Dianxin,

30
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,560
I don't believe it.

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,710
I must avenge my father.

32
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,680
I don't have time for you.

33
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,010
Every additional bond

34
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,310
only ties me down further.

35
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,310
From today onward,

36
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,590
you and I are strangers.

37
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,590
Please leave.

38
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,430
Song Dianxin.

39
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
If anyone breaks it,

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,030
what we love will only bring pain,

41
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,310
and all the joy will eventually fade away.

42
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,150
Enough.

43
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,360
If it weren't for your presence,

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,560
I wouldn't have ended up in this situation.

45
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,430
I don't want to see you again.

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,630
Please leave.

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,080
Can't you understand?

48
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,080
Fine.

49
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,190
I won't force you.

50
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,900
(Shen Musi)

51
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,600
(Shen Musi)

52
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,480
(Now, all I have left)

53
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,870
(is you.)

54
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,040
(Shen Musi)
(The path I must take)

55
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,870
(has no turning back.)

56
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,410
(You've risked your future)

57
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,870
(and your life to stand by me.)

58
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,560
(How could I ever drag you into this?)

59
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,850
The forged letters

60
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,510
between my father and the Nanlu Kingdom

61
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,270
were likely written

62
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,750
by the same person as this letter.

63
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,470
The handwriting on it

64
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,190
was accidentally smudged by me.

65
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,060
(Song Dianxin)

66
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,020
(Meet at the back mountain in the afternoon.)

67
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,720
This letter must have been freshly written,

68
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,270
and the person should still be in the city.

69
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,310
Yuan Xiao,

70
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,750
go find someone
skilled in imitating handwriting.

71
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,560
I will find a way

72
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,390
to locate the child who delivered the letter.

73
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,590
Understood.

74
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,780
(To My Beloved Daughter, Song Dianxin)

75
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,920
From today onward,

76
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,160
you and I are strangers.

77
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Please leave.

78
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,160
Song Dianxin.

79
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,870
If anyone breaks it,

80
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,680
all the joy will turn to pain,

81
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,750
all that brings joy will turn to sorrow.

82
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,870
Enough.

83
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,160
I don't want to see you again.

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,270
Please leave.

85
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,750
Manager, stop looking.

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,340
I heard the grand master
didn't return home.

87
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,390
He's probably

88
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,160
still enjoying himself with that courtesan.

89
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,310
Yet you...

90
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,240
Sorry. I'll go find someone right away.

91
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,350
Dianxin,

92
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
are you going out?

93
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,920
I'm going to find someone.

94
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,270
I'll go with you.

95
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,160
If you remember anything later,

96
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,510
feel free to come to me.

97
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,600
This girl can hear,

98
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,160
but she can't speak or read.

99
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,560
The only thing we know now

100
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
is that the person

101
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,560
who gave her the letter

102
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,870
was a man.

103
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,680
Thank you.

104
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,240
Do you still recognize me?

105
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,800
Do you have any family?

106
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,270
Why not come to Qianwei Teahouse with me?

107
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,830
Then, would you like to do me a favor?

108
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,160
If you see that man again,

109
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,950
come find me at Qianwei Teahouse.

110
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,710
Remember,

111
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,830
as long as you like,

112
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,950
Qianwei Teahouse will always be your home.

113
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,950
I'll make sure
you're well-fed and cared for.

114
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,230
Dianxin.

115
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,320
I made it clear to you that night.

116
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,240
We are strangers now.

117
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,440
Don't interfere in my matters anymore.

118
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,840
Grand Master,

119
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,600
it's time for her to leave.

120
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,000
Please don't disturb her further.

121
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,360
He spends his days with the courtesan.

122
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,830
Does he still remember me,

123
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,150
a humble manager?

124
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,360
(Dianxin.)

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,960
(I won't let you push me away again.)

126
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,500
(Qianwei Teahouse)

127
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,150
Manager, I just heard

128
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,600
a wanderer has arrived in the city.

129
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,260
While drinking with the courtesan

130
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,260
at the Flower Tower,

131
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,050
in high spirits,

132
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,120
he showed his skill of imitating handwriting.

133
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,910
Since the courtesan has met him,

134
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,960
we can seek clues from her.

135
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,560
He got drunk

136
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,360
and tried to kill the courtesan with a sword.

137
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,150
She was terrified and left the city.

138
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,000
However, I heard

139
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,750
the grand master is close to her.

140
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,390
Should we go see him?

141
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,440
No need. Let's go to Flower Tower.

142
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,750
This is the courtesan.

143
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,120
I am Luo Su.

144
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,580
(Luo Su, courtesan)
It's my honor

145
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,360
to meet you, Manager Song.

146
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,200
You know me?

147
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,000
Grand Master Shen often mentions you.

148
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,870
It seems you're quite close to him.

149
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,200
No wonder he left this Qianwei Teahouse.

150
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,150
I heard a beauty hiding
in Qianwei Teahouse.

151
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,550
It must be you, Ninth Prince.

152
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,080
I pay my respects to you.

153
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,600
What brings

154
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,150
you two here?

155
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,240
She knows the appearance of the wanderer.

156
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,960
I feared for her safety,

157
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,000
so I brought her to Qianwei Teahouse.

158
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,390
I want to seek your protection,

159
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,550
and also hope that

160
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,120
she can help you find the person you want.

161
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Rest assured.

162
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,750
Qianwei Teahouse will keep her safe.

163
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,750
Thank you, Manager Song.

164
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,300
We've completed the portrait

165
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,650
based on Miss Luo's description.

166
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Search the whole city

167
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,460
to find him as soon as possible.

168
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,390
Yes.

169
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,910
What do you want?

170
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,270
To see you.

171
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,480
You spend every night in revelry,

172
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,960
flitting among countless flowers.

173
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,670
What's there for me, a manager

174
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,080
of Qianwei Teahouse to see?

175
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,960
You're quite informed

176
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,510
about my whereabouts.

177
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,270
I once received help from Luo Su,

178
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,960
so I'm acquainted with her.

179
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,200
Like I care.

180
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,600
If you have no further business,

181
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,670
please take your leave.

182
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,550
Since Luo Su was brought here by me,

183
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,960
I'll stay as long

184
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,240
as she does.

185
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,750
Today, we gather here

186
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,200
first to welcome Luo Su,

187
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,750
and second to thank her

188
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,840
for helping in the search.

189
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,510
I'll trouble you during this time.

190
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,870
By age, I believe I'm older than you.

191
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,080
May I call you "sister Dianxin"?

192
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,750
Sure.

193
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,360
Here, I'll toast everyone.

194
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,200
This is a millet cake I made myself.

195
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,910
Sister Luo Su, try some.

196
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,390
She gets rashes from eating millet cake.

197
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,960
There's something

198
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,600
I'd like to ask Miss Luo Su.

199
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,360
How should a man win the affection

200
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,440
of the woman he loves?

201
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,910
When it comes to winning affection,

202
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,440
whether for men or women,

203
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,960
it all comes down to one thing,

204
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,360
sincerity.

205
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,360
Sincerity or pretense...

206
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,000
Isn't that hard to distinguish?

207
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,870
There are ways to tell.

208
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,150
Observing, smelling, asking, and feeling.

209
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,550
Let me demonstrate it for you.

210
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,720
Observing

211
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,150
means locking eyes,

212
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,000
and gazing deeply at each other.

213
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,630
Smelling

214
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,360
means seeking the other's scent,

215
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,720
and sensing the signals they emit.

216
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,440
Asking

217
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,550
means asking questions

218
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,150
to understand their true thoughts.

219
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,670
For example,

220
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,150
Shen Musi,

221
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,480
what kind of woman do you like?

222
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,750
Dianxin knows.

223
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,550
This is when the feeling comes in.

224
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,840
Feeling

225
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,360
means physical contact.

226
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Sister Dianxin,

227
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,480
