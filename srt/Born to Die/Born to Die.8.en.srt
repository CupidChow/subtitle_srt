Musi, you're back.

17

General Song Guolin

18
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,950
has been reinstated.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,040
What joyous news!

20
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,520
Father.

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
Mother.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,430
Did anything happen last night?

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,880
Nothing at all.

24
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,790
Your father took me to see the lanterns.

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,840
Musi, what's wrong?

26
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,150
Manager.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
Good. You're back.

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
Shen Musi has stopped

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,910
investigating Su Xuefu.

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,810
You asked me to prepare

31
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,360
the masks of Shen Musi's parents.

32
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,240
What exactly was that for?

33
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,080
From now on,

34
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm no longer bonded to you.

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
You may rise.

36
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,520
- Manager.
- Manager.

37
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,170
You may leave.

38
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,030
- Yes.
- Yes.

39
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,680
How is the investigation

40
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,150
into Lin Xiuyuan going?

41
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,680
It's now clear.

42
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,430
(Song Dianxin,)

43
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,030
(you've deceived me again.)

44
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,660
(Qianwei Teahouse)

45
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,330
Zheng Huai'an's superior, Wang Fangchi,

46
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,030
meets privately

47
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,400
with Lin Xiuyuan at the temple

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,700
every first day of the month.

49
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,590
It's secretive.

50
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,750
Zheng Huai'an

51
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,870
works under Wang Fangchi

52
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,630
but secretly serves Lin Xiuyuan.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
It seems

54
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,590
Wang Fangchi is unaware of this.

55
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,400
Zheng Huai'an holds a list
of everyone involved.

56
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,270
It's possible

57
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,030
he's playing more than two sides.

58
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,400
What list?

59
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
Come in.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,190
I need to speak with you.

61
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,800
The one targeting you

62
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,070
must hold immense power.

63
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,040
He can harm your sister

64
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,830
and have your entire family executed.

65
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,070
I've arranged your family

66
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,900
to leave the capital
under the guise of exile.

67
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,750
Once they're out of here,

68
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,360
I can ensure

69
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,510
they'll reach a safe location.

70
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,450
I hope those you want to protect

71
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,290
are safe and sound.

72
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,000
This is a last resort.

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,780
As for Qianwei Teahouse...

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,430
Imperial Censor Lin Xiuyuan and Wang Fangchi

75
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,830
jointly petitioned

76
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,920
to thoroughly investigate Su Xuefu's death.

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,490
I had no choice but to request his majesty

78
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,630
to let me investigate,

79
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,120
seeking a glimmer of hope.

80
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,630
Since you had a plan all along,

81
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,270
why didn't you tell me earlier?

82
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,240
I asked you before,

83
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,190
"Would you trust me?"

84
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,670
Song Dianxin,

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,360
would you trust me?

86
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,000
Especially when using the family as a stake.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,800
What makes you worthy of my trust?

88
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,270
You've truly confused me.

89
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,680
I can no longer see your true intentions.

90
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,640
Dianxin,

91
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,160
you were never a calculated choice for me.

92
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,140
You are my reckless obsession,

93
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,190
even when I know it's unwise.

94
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,120
This time,

95
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,150
I hope

96
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,750
we can be allies.

97
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,120
Would you trust me?

98
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,600
It seems we can use each other for now.

99
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,040
I have one more question.

100
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,000
If I really killed your parents,

101
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,750
what would you do?

102
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,830
I would kill you.

103
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,870
"Till the end of the world,

104
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,600
I will perish with you."

105
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,480
You're even crazier than I am.

106
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,380
(Qianwei Teahouse)

107
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,720
Shen Musi gifted a painting to Lin Xiuyuan

108
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,830
as a bribe

109
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,160
and also reported you.

110
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,360
Did you know?

111
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,070
Do you think

112
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,680
(Wang Fangchi, commandant)

113
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,190
I'd be foolish enough to believe your story?

114
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,020
Commandant Wang,

115
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,040
I heard you say
someone is plotting a rebellion,

116
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,300
allying with Nanlu Kingdom.

117
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,040
My Lord, what's wrong?

118
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,240
(Lin Xiuyuan, imperial censor)
(Wang Fangchi must be dead.)

119
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,360
It's nothing. Let's go.

120
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,270
Do you think

121
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,190
I'd be foolish enough

122
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,040
to believe your one-sided story?

123
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,560
You truly are foolish.

124
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,750
Commandant Wang, are you alright?

125
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,390
Zheng Huai'an.

126
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,590
Commandant.

127
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,000
The censor sent me here.

128
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,320
If I don't act,

129
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,720
he'd take my life.

130
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,260
Commandant Wang,

131
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,960
you know Censor Lin Xiuyuan loves beauty.

132
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,260
To curry favor with him,

133
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,000
you often offered him beauties.

134
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,510
But did you know your wife

135
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,240
also frequently meets
Lin Xiuyuan late at night?

136
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,200
What?

137
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,120
At this very moment,

138
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,630
she is at the censor's annex.

139
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,000
Lin Xiuyuan,

140
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,030
I want you to die a horrible death!

141
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,000
You treacherous woman,

142
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,480
how dare you betray me!

143
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,630
Lin Xiuyuan,

144
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,200
not only did you burn my bridges,

145
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,510
but you also defiled my wife.

146
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,150
I will kill your entire family!

147
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,030
What does it matter if I took your woman?

148
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,910
I've promoted you, a reckless fool,

149
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,720
allowing you to command military power,

150
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,270
yet you betrayed me.

151
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,200
Clearly, you've colluded with Shen Musi.

152
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,800
All these years,

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,440
you've harmed those
who opposed you politically,

154
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,360
and secretly amassed troops for rebellion,

155
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,460
allying with Nanlu Kingdom.

156
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,030
Now that you fear exposure,

157
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,360
you're targeting me first.

158
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,360
What nonsense are you spouting?

159
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,150
If it weren't for me,

160
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,440
how could you have connected

161
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,200
with those powerful figures in Nanlu Kingdom?

162
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,510
You've embezzled
so many treasures along the way.

163
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,080
Don't think I don't know.

164
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,870
Have their words

165
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,910
been recorded?

166
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,120
Yes.

167
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,600
Shen Musi,

168
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,630
this was your scheme.

169
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,150
Imperial Censor Lin Xiuyuan

170
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,000
and Commandant Wang Fangchi

171
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,390
are conspiring to rebel.

172
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,240
It has been confirmed.

173
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,740
(Wang Fangchi)

174
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,140
(Lin Xiuyuan)

175
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,320
Manager,

176
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,000
everything has been settled.

177
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,720
How did Shen Musi handle it?

178
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,840
He's reported to his majesty

179
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,030
that men of the censor's residence
are sent into exile,

180
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,960
and women are demoted to
military prostitutes.

181
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,230
Tell him,

182
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,080
for the family to care for each other,

183
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,080
the conscripted men and the prostitutes

184
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,440
should be stationed in the same camp.

185
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,990
Understood.

186
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,620
(Suicide Note)

187
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,470
Yuqian,

188
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,000
I promised you

189
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,870
that your death would not be in vain.

190
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,740
(Suicide Note)

191
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,360
Within twelve hours,

192
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,840
this poison

193
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,360
will seep into your bones,

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,720
causing unbearable pain

195
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,030
and a sudden, violent death.

196
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,240
Zheng Huai'an,

197
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,550
I'm giving you one final day to reconsider.

198
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,600
I truly don't know who the mastermind is!

199
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,000
If Zheng Huai'an still refuses to confess,

200
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,600
will you really let him die from the poison?

201
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,080
It's an anesthetic.

202
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,790
He's afraid of death either way.

203
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,390
By talking tough,
he might live a few more days.

204
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,080
I want to frighten him.

205
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,790
You leaked his location at Qianwei Teahouse,

206
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,320
inviting danger.

207
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,960
This will only bring

208
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,670
more unforeseen trouble.

209
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,670
Isn't there still you,

210
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,960
someone I can use?

211
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,670
We each take what we need.

212
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,630
"Each takes what we need."

213
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,670
Then will you give

214
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,150
what I want to me?

215
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,270
Shen Musi,

216
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,960
I've trusted too many people before,

217
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,510
but in the end,

218
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,320
it only led to my ruin.

219
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,910
You are Shen Musi,

220
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,200
but also a powerful official.

221
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,990
Between you and me,

222
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,650
there are too many secrets
we cannot speak of.

223
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,320
Then let's forget all of this.

224
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,280
You're just the manager of Qianwei Teahouse,

225
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,150
and I'm just someone who admires you.

226
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,780
Manager,

227
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,900
something's wrong!

228
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,600
The Imperial Guards have surrounded us.

229
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,030
I didn't do it.
