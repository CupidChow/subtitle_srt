=Episode 23=

15
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,590
Your Highness,

16
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,840
there's a body in the main hall.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,570
It's Li Qi, the hostage prince of Nanlu.

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,640
Another death of a Nanlu Kingdom native.

19
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,430
And it's related to Song Dianxin again.

20
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,940
This time, it's even the ninth prince.

21
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,220
The moment he died,

22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,580
you arrived.

23
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,660
Could it be that you can foresee the future?

24
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,540
I don't possess such divine powers.

25
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,100
I was simply concerned about you

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,620
and came to check on you.

27
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,100
I didn't expect

28
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,900
to stumble upon this.

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,460
This makeup box...

30
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,540
Isn't it yours, Sister Dianxin?

31
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,180
It's mine.

32
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,540
This is correspondence with the enemy.

33
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,900
Former General of Haiyin Kingdom,

34
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,580
Manager of Qianwei Teahouse, Song Dianxin,

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,340
has been found guilty of excessive association

36
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,740
and colluding with Nanlu Kingdom.

37
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,100
You're now arrested for treason.

38
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,740
Kneel!

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,140
Let go!

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,060
Dianxin.

41
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,140
Take the grand master away.

42
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,740
Move!

43
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,060
Let go!

44
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,740
Leave us alone

45
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,380
to catch up.

46
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,420
You approached me,

47
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,340
calling me "Sister Dianxin" with every breath,

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,580
yet set a trap to harm me.

49
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,540
Why have you always targeted me?

50
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,340
To be honest,

51
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,860
in this court,

52
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,940
the only woman I truly admire is you.

53
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,340
Song Dianxin,

54
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,580
I originally intended to
promote you to serve me,

55
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,940
but you insisted on opposing me.

56
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,500
Why must you seek war
between the two nations?

57
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,380
Because they deserve to die.

58
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,540
Over a hundred lives
from my mother's family

59
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,580
were slaughtered
by the Nanlu royal family.

60
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,100
I must avenge my family.

61
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,740
But Song Dianxin,

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,460
you obstructed the war
against Nanlu Kingdom,

63
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,500
preventing me from avenging my family.

64
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,550
I have no choice

65
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,440
but to change my plans again and again.

66
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,180
I planned to use
Su Xuefu's jealousy of you

67
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,580
to eliminate you.

68
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,540
Unfortunately,
she lacked the wit to succeed.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,380
Keeping her around only hindered my plans.

70
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,940
Li Qi is cautious and meticulous,

71
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,820
just as you like.

72
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,900
See?

73
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,580
How well he cooperated!

74
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,740
He successfully lured you in.

75
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,380
But you didn't fulfill
what you promised him.

76
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,740
That's right.

77
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,540
I did promise him freedom

78
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,340
once the task was completed.

79
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,300
But death

80
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,340
is the ultimate liberation.

81
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,620
He was abandoned by Nanlu Kingdom,

82
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,460
and Haiyin Kingdom
has no place for him either.

83
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,460
Where could he possibly find freedom?

84
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,860
This is the best ending for him.

85
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,100
To be honest,

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,900
matching wits with you
was quite entertaining.

87
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,420
In the past,

88
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,140
I would have played with you a bit longer.

89
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,230
But you somehow got your hands on

90
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,980
a list of all my people.

91
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,140
That takes the fun out of it.

92
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,060
That day, I tried to
kill you at the Imperial Court,

93
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,740
but so many people came to your defense.

94
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,980
How dull.

95
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,020
They worked for you,

96
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,540
yet you killed them all.

97
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,340
Your actions today

98
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,940
will surely come with a price.

99
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,860
This is the look I want in your eyes.

100
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,820
Hate me.

101
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,860
Hate me even more.

102
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,940
Because the more you hate,

103
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,740
the more you'll understand me.

104
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,460
Hatred is poison,

105
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,100
but also medicine.

106
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,940
It keeps me awake at all times,

107
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,540
reminding me of my purpose and meaning.

108
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,100
My mother told me this,

109
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,580
and even in her dying breath,

110
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,140
she reminded me

111
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,060
that I live for revenge.

112
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,660
You're utterly mad.

113
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,740
You've underestimated me.

114
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,820
Even greater madness lies ahead.

115
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,740
Grand Master Shen Musi

116
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,540
is negligent in his duties.

117
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,380
Commoner Song Dianxin

118
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,980
is guilty of treason.

119
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,580
Put them in the heavenly prison.

120
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,700
Tomorrow,

121
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,540
they will be publicly executed.

122
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,820
Song Dianxin,

123
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,100
once a first-rank general of Haiyin Kingdom,

124
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,380
has committed the grave crime of treason.

125
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,660
Thanks to my timely discovery,

126
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,020
a great disaster was averted.

127
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,620
For so many years,

128
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,500
you relied on your military achievements

129
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,340
to act recklessly in Haiyin Kingdom.

130
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,940
All of this

131
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,740
ends today.

132
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,860
You framed the loyal,

133
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,820
and took the lives of innocent people.

134
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,140
Your every crime
appears in my mind's eye.

135
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,900
Justice will prevail.

136
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,060
The truth

137
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,980
will always come to light.

138
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,780
Is that so?

139
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,540
After your death,

140
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,620
you will vanish with your notorious name

141
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,220
into the long river of history.

142
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,580
No one will remember you.

143
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,380
Shen Musi,

144
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,860
it falls to you

145
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,700
to read out Song Dianxin's list of crimes.

146
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,860
(Indictment)
After all,

147
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,140
she is your betrothed.

148
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,900
(Indictment)

149
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,840
In the 55th year of Haiyin Kingdom,

150
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,300
Song Dianxin captured
Tianhe Valley with the light cavalry,

151
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,700
defeating over ten thousand enemy troops

152
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,620
and seizing their provisions.

153
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,940
That year,

154
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,740
Song Dianxin was seventeen.

155
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,500
I want you to read her charges.

156
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,820
What are you reading?

157
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,300
In the 56th year of Haiyin,

158
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,340
Nanlu Kingdom seized our stronghold.

159
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,380
How dare you!

160
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,620
Guards, Shen Musi has neglected his duties.

161
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,540
I hereby strip his title as grand master.

162
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,180
Song Dianxin,

163
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,140
guilty of treason,
is to be executed on the spot.

164
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,460
Whoever dares harm the general

165
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,660
must first kill us!

166
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,460
We will defend her to the death!

167
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,220
Are you all deaf to my words?

168
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,740
In the 56th year of Haiyin,

169
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,420
Nanlu Kingdom invaded our borders,

170
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,020
endangering our people.

171
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,140
General Song Guolin
was severely wounded.

172
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,920
With few soldiers and scarce supplies,

173
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,700
Song Dianxin led an elite force to help,

174
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,060
repelling the enemy

175
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,300
and safeguarding our people.

176
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,100
That year,

177
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,340
Song Dianxin was eighteen.

178
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,340
In the 57th year,

179
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,580
she led her troops
deep into the northern deserts,

180
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,340
annihilating 30,000 enemies.

181
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,860
From then on,

182
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,340
Haiyin unified the northern deserts.
