(I know what worries you,)

18
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,350
(but I can't let the only clue)

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,350

(Only he has no name.)

24
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,800
Thank you for the invitation, Manager Song.

25
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,630
Did I invite you?

26
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,520
I've heard

27
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,590
you're not only skilled at painting,

28
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,840
but also at imitating handwriting.

29
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,030
Indeed,

30
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,430
that would be me.

31
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,800
My master asked me to relay a message.

32
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,280
The princess said

33
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,240
that you should cherish

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,150
your final hours tonight.

35
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,150
Nobody moves!

36
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,750
Sir, they're all dead.

37
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,560
How audacious,

38
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,750
daring to commit murder in broad daylight.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,840
Guards,

40
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,590
arrest Song Dianxin!

41
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,750
Sir,

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,910
although they were killed at my teahouse,

43
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,630
it wasn't done by me.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,480
How can you place the blame on me

45
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,870
without any clear evidence?

46
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,150
The evidence is clear.

47
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,380
My duty is to make the arrest.

48
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,240
Defend yourself at the Imperial Court.
Arrest her!

49
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,310
Stop!

50
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,680
These deaths

51
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,240
have nothing to do with Song Dianxin.

52
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,830
Grand Master,

53
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,750
we can't just let her go

54
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,000
based on your words alone.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,950
What should I explain to my superiors?

56
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,480
I'll go with you.

57
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,390
Dianxin.

58
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,370
Whether I'm guilty or not,

59
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,430
I believe

60
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,040
the Imperial Court will uncover the truth.

61
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,830
The chef who put the poison
committed suicide,

62
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,070
leaving behind a letter

63
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,220
claiming you instructed him
to poison the food.

64
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,310
The painter, Hua Wuxin,

65
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,000
is the last person on the list.

66
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,190
Chen Ruiyang,
a fourth-rank commandant from Nanlu.

67
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,070
He also had a handwritten letter from you,

68
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,270
saying,

69
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,920
"Come to Qianwei Teahouse tonight

70
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,040
to discuss important matters."

71
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,630
The Imperial Court will likely hand you over

72
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,190
to resolve the dispute.

73
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,430
Chen Ruiyang...

74
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,390
Before he died, he said,

75
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,630
"The princess asked me to relay a message.

76
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,480
You should cherish your final hours tonight."

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,040
You suspect Princess Kesong?

78
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,800
The mastermind behind this

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,480
might be trying to mislead us.

80
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,390
But I guarantee there's one person

81
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,190
who can't escape blame.

82
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,950
- Who?
- Li Qi.

83
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,070
I'm investigating him.

84
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,870
- It can't be him.
- Song Dianxin,

85
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,240
if you stay deluded, you'll really die.

86
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,560
Someone will take you out at midnight.

87
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,510
Until I find evidence,

88
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,870
don't show yourself up.

89
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,430
(I'm given a second chance.)

90
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,630
(If my fate is inevitably toward death,)

91
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,830
(then I must carve a path to survival.)

92
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,430
Now, everyone on the list is dead.

93
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,630
I have no other leads left.

94
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
This is a dead end.

95
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,750
Shen Musi,

96
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,000
don't involve yourself
in this matter anymore.

97
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
Until I find a way

98
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,870
to break this deadlock,

99
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,580
I can't drag unrelated people

100
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,340
into this mess.

101
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,630
What about Li Qi?

102
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,430
Why do you keep fixating on him?

103
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,600
Because in my past life, he didn't die.

104
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,950
In your past life?

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,750
The snow in the palace passageway

106
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,270
was the most tragic snow I've ever seen.

107
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,430
In my past life,

108
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,270
I watched you die before my eyes.

109
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,560
In this life,

110
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,920
I can't lose you again.

111
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,310
So,

112
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,800
when did you realize

113
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,160
I was also reborn?

114
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,600
From the moment
you stopped calling me "Brother Musi".

115
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,920
From the look in your eyes,

116
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,710
filled with hatred.

117
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
From the day you tried to
call off our engagement.

118
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,750
From the first time I saw you...

119
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,430
Dianxin,

120
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,310
long time no see.

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
Dianxin,

122
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,600
the way you looked at me

123
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,360
was the same as in your previous life,

124
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,710
when you were struck by an arrow,

125
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,630
filled with hatred and despair.

126
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,390
I knew then

127
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,240
that you had also been reborn.

128
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,320
Dianxin,

129
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,550
what I want to tell you is

130
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,270
in our past life, Li Qi didn't die.

131
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,390
He conspired with the mastermind.

132
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,390
Before your triumphant return,

133
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,630
he faked his death

134
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,320
to secure his way back to Nanlu.

135
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,240
Then he framed you for treason.

136
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,080
So you've been lying to me all along?

137
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,630
No matter my methods,

138
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,080
I have

139
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,100
never deceived you.

140
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,120
Grand Master,

141
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,320
time's up.

142
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
(This rebirth)

143
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,870
(has altered everyone's fate,)

144
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,630
(even the destinies of two nations.)

145
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,240
(Shen Musi,)

146
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,440
(I've lost too much.)

147
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,440
(Let me come alone,)

148
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,440
(and leave alone,)

149
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,000
(without failing anyone.)

150
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,870
(The greater the hope,)

151
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,360
(the deeper the hurt.)

152
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,150
(Rather than this,)

153
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,030
(it's better to have never hoped at all.)

154
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,260
(Imperial Court)

155
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,670
The criminal, Song Dianxin,

156
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,360
poisoned numerous officials, merchants,

157
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,630
and Nanlu Kingdom's Commandant Chen Ruiyang.

158
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,440
Confess the truth of last night's event.

159
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,150
(Those who want to harm me)

160
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,670
(won't miss seeing me fall to this state.)

161
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,390
(Who could it be?)

162
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,200
Song Dianxin.

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,440
Do you admit your guilt?

164
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,200
You are the mastermind behind this.

165
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,600
I never expected you

166
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,240
to hide so deeply.

167
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,240
Princess Kesong.

168
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Commandant Chen Ruiyang of Nanlu
died in our kingdom.

169
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,510
Father has sent me
to assist in the investigation.

170
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,960
Dianxin,

171
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,630
did you poison these people?

172
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,480
I have never harmed anyone.

173
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,390
I won't admit to any guilt.

174
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,730
These are the pieces of evidence

175
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,360
seized from Qianwei Teahouse.

176
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,740
(Zuo Haoxuan, Guo Wuyang,
Zhang Yonghong, Chen Ruiyang)

177
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,000
Dianxin,

178
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,840
you've deeply disappointed me.

179
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,670
It really is you.

180
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,000
The names of every person you poisoned

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,320
are listed there.

182
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,370
(Zuo Haoxuan)
I've finished investigating.

183
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,630
Each of them was collaborating with the enemy.

184
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,510
And you silenced them by killing them.

185
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,750
Dianxin,

186
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,960
your father was beheaded for treason.

187
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,360
Now, you've taken his place

188
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,960
as a spy for Nanlu Kingdom.

189
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,390
You are the mastermind
behind these people.

190
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,030
My father never betrayed his kingdom.

191
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,960
And I am not a spy for Nanlu Kingdom.

192
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,550
I can testify

193
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,720
that Song Dianxin is innocent.

194
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,100
This is a handwritten letter
from Song Dianxin

195
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,750
found on Chen Ruiyang's body.

196
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,550
Come to Qianwei Teahouse tonight

197
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,440
to discuss important matters.

198
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,360
And this letter

199
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,720
was written by Song Dianxin to me.

200
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,360
Look,

201
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,020
both letters have

202
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,300
(Qian, Qiam)
the similar character written by her,

203
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,030
but the handwriting is different.

204
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,610
In Haiyin Kingdom, it is written as "Qian",

205
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,440
while in Nanlu Kingdom,

206
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,870
it's written as "Qiam".

207
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,600
It's hard for one to change one's habits.

208
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,840
This is clearly a frame-up

209
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,480
against Song Dianxin.

210
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,550
Grand Master,

211
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,000
this alone may not be enough to convince us.

212
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,670
In my opinion,

213
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,630
Song Dianxin should be executed

214
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,870
to give both nations an explanation.

215
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,150
Dianxin,

216
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,550
didn't you always value fair judgment?

217
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,200
I'm merely handling the case
as it should be.

218
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,510
Princess,

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,510
Song Dianxin is my wife.

220
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,030
If she is guilty,

221
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,640
I'd stake my reputation as the grand master

222
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,750
and share her punishment.

223
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,080
So,

224
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,320
if Song Dianxin is beheaded,

225
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,510
you're willing to die with her?

226
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,790
Your love for her

227
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,680
is truly moving.

228
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,790
A life for a life.

229
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,660
Then execute Song Dianxin

230
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,200
on the spot.
