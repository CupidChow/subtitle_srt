15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,560
Ninth Prince,

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,120
you're still hesitating.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
My master doesn't have much patience.

18
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,200
After tomorrow,
this opportunity will be gone.

19
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,920
Shh.

20
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,740
I once told you

21
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,100
that Li Qi's been meeting with a man.

22
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,980
The person just now was that man.

23
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,140
You saw it with your own eyes,

24
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,180
and you still say there's no problem?

25
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,260
You don't need to meddle in it.

26
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,620
You still want to believe in him?

27
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,780
Why should I trust you instead?

28
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,380
From the day you arrived
at Qianwei Teahouse,

29
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,980
has everything you've done
been part of a plan?

30
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,580
In your eyes,

31
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,580
was all the sincerity I've shown

32
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,900
just part of the plan?

33
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,020
Wasn't it?

34
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,740
Since you already
had the answer in your mind,

35
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,860
I won't explain further.

36
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,180
As for Li Qi's matter,

37
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,540
I will get to the bottom of it.

38
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,060
From now on,

39
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,860
we'll each go our separate ways.

40
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,580
Between you and me,

41
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,420
no more entanglements.

42
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,540
Dianxin,

43
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,980
you're drunk.

44
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,580
Let me help you back to rest.

45
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,580
Tell me,

46
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,500
why do people have secrets?

47
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,420
Secrets...

48
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,980
Shen Musi has secrets,

49
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,820
always keeping them from me.

50
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,300
And I have secrets too,

51
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,220
keeping them from everyone.

52
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,020
Do you want to know my secret?

53
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,580
From the moment
I founded Qianwei Teahouse,

54
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,460
I've been afraid

55
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,140
that someone would try to harm me,

56
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,860
to brand me and my family

57
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,100
as traitors collaborating with the enemy.

58
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,180
I've tried my best
to root out every suspicious person,

59
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,980
but in the end,

60
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,980
I not only fell into a trap,

61
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,380
but also failed to
protect my family's lives.

62
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,620
Everything

63
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,420
will come to light one day.

64
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,780
What about you?

65
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,600
Do you have secrets?

66
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,510
Will you, like Shen Musi,

67
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,400
also deceive me?

68
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,740
Yes.

69
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,220
My secret is

70
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,740
that I not only want to survive,

71
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,170
but also return to Nanlu Kingdom,

72
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,900
avenge my clan, and fight for the throne,

73
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,540
so that the people of the world

74
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,820
no longer suffer from war.

75
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,980
But for you,

76
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,580
I'm willing to abandon this secret.

77
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
Dianxin,

78
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,620
have you ever thought of

79
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,420
giving up everything here

80
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,420
and traveling the world with me,
free and easy?

81
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,420
Li Qi,

82
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,740
you have your secrets to guard,

83
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,180
and I have my responsibilities to uphold.

84
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,300
I can't possibly abandon everything

85
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,860
to follow you.

86
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,300
No need, thank you.

87
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,580
(I thought I could keep waiting,)

88
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,300
(waiting for you to turn back.)

89
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,740
(But what I waited for was despair.)

90
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,220
(Song Dianxin,)

91
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,760
(if you don't care for me,)

92
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,300
(what meaning is there)

93
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,940
(in everything I've done?)

94
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,300
Since you've come,

95
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,420
I guess you've made up your mind.

96
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,540
Song Dianxin has already lost her power.

97
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,220
There's no need to press her further.

98
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,580
She can't cause more trouble.

99
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,180
The renowned female general
of Haiyin Kingdom...

100
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,820
I know her all too well.

101
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,980
She won't admit defeat so easily.

102
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,220
I won't give her any chance to fight back.

103
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,980
You are the princess of Haiyin.

104
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,580
Why are you doing this?

105
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,740
To tell the truth,

106
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,240
I am half a Nanlu Kingdom native.

107
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,780
What?

108
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,980
My mother was originally
from Nanlu Kingdom.

109
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,740
The Nanlu royal family fought for power,

110
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,220
slaughtering my mother's family.

111
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,460
The pain of losing loved ones...

112
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,740
You should know it
better than I do, right?

113
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,860
Isn't that reason enough?

114
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,780
I can understand,

115
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,740
but Song Dianxin...

116
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,380
She's innocent.

117
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,810
Why drag her into this?

118
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,980
Innocent?

119
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,220
If it weren't for her interference,

120
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,420
we'd have already
waged war against Nanlu.

121
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,940
You're aware of the current situation.

122
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Two nations are about to go to war.

123
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,180
Remember,

124
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,140
I'm the only one
who can grant you freedom.

125
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,820
Manager!

126
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,300
Manager, something terrible happened!

127
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,780
Nanlu people have heard

128
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,090
that you poisoned their officials.

129
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,000
Now they're threatening to kill you.

130
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,140
Everyone is talking about it.

131
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,700
We are on the brink of war again.

132
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,540
It's happening so fast.

133
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,900
Where's Li Qi?

134
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,060
Prepare a carriage.

135
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,460
He can't stay in Haiyin any longer.

136
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,100
He left early this morning.

137
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,340
Manager, compared to him,

138
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,700
you're in greater danger now.

139
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,420
Let's leave quickly.

140
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,620
Yuan Xiao,

141
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,420
be ready to leave at any moment.

142
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,420
Understood.

143
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,700
Shen Musi,

144
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,740
we've agreed to go our separate ways.

145
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,900
Why have you brought a coffin here?

146
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,140
When we reunited,

147
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,900
you said this coffin was your dowry.

148
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,860
Now, I've brought it to marry you.

149
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,910
Song Dianxin,

150
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,250
today, I've come to marry you.

151
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,900
Perhaps you didn't hear me clearly.

152
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,700
I, Song Dianxin,

153
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,500
in this lifetime,

154
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,460
will never marry you, Shen Musi.

155
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,700
Whether you marry or not,

156
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,180
it's not up to you.

157
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,020
The one bound by the engagement

158
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,740
is the great general of Haiyin, Song Dianxin.

159
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,260
If you want to marry someone,
go marry her.

160
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,400
I'm just a commoner
and have nothing to do

161
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,700
with this engagement.

162
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,980
Dianxin,

163
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,580
if I meant nothing to you,

164
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,740
why didn't you kill me back then?

165
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,860
If you didn't like me,

166
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,180
why did you keep me by your side?

167
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,780
If you didn't love me,

168
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,660
why did you cry for me?
