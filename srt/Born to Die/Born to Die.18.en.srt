=Episode 18=

15
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,030
How is the search for

16
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,710
the wandering who painted that begonia?

17
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,310
That wanderer roams the world.

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,590
We haven't traced his whereabouts yet.

19
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,510
But the painting he created...

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,590
Red leaves paired with green flowers.

21
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,590
Red leaves...

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,480
What shade of red?

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,150
Sit still.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,330
There's a lantern show tomorrow.

25
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,400
Are you going?

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,200
We haven't even found the wanderer.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,560
I'm not in the mood to have fun.

28
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,790
Are you going or not?

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
Come here.

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,680
- Come here.
- Alright.

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Why are you dodging?

32
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,400
By the way,

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,000
for this trip,

34
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,400
safety is the most important.

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,360
Do you hear me?

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,470
Don't worry.

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
I won't stop worrying.

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,240
Unless...

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,560
Dreams of Beauty and Power.

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,750
A female general
finds joy in the Dream Garden,

41
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,000
while the grand master
vows to be chaste!

42
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,800
Come and buy, come and see!

43
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,800
Hurry, buy now!

44
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,590
A female general
and the grand master. Perfect!

45
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,800
They're a perfect match.

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
We even have scripts!

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,000
- Only 20 wen!
- I'll buy one.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,590
- Good!
- It's like how you helped me

49
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,910
- Sir.
- tend to my wounds.

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
- Here. Let's go.
- The tale of love and hate...

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,080
Did you draw this?

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,030
Who cares who drew it?

53
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,360
Buy it or move along.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,000
I've got plenty of customers waiting.

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,590
You... Who are you, exactly?

56
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,190
Song Dianxin,
the manager of Qianwei Teahouse.

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,400
And this is the grand master.

58
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,800
- You...
- Sachets...

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,120
don't seem like the artistic type.

60
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,150
Take a look.

61
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,960
Who exactly gave these to you? Speak!

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,870
It was a man.

63
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,960
We agreed to meet every seven days.

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,910
I sell them, and we split the profit 20-80.

65
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,560
Everything I've said is true.

66
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,280
When will you meet next time?

67
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,750
Tomorrow night.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,430
Many details in these storybooks

69
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
are clearly based on

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,630
our real-life experiences.

71
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,520
Who could know our private affairs

72
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,150
so intimately?

73
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,910
And there are sequels too.

74
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,120
But what's his purpose

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,590
in doing this?

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,360
Yuan Xiao,

77
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,840
keep an eye on the vendor.

78
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,910
Dig deep, and find that painter.

79
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,310
Yes, I'll do it right away.

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,400
Is it possible

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,800
that it's someone close to us?

82
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,360
Are you suspecting me?

83
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,830
I don't have the skill to create this work.

84
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,190
Besides,

85
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,430
Dianxin,

86
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,160
what's drawn in this book

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,680
isn't necessarily real, right?

88
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,070
Of course, it's fake.

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,400
Ninth Prince,

90
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,430
would you like to learn

91
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,600
how to flirt with a lady?

92
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,390
Give it back to me.

93
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,950
Give it back.

94
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,430
Give it back to me.

95
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,800
Give it back.

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
You...

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,040
Give it back!

98
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,270
Then tell me,

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,630
is this real or fake?

100
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Fake.

101
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,300
Real.

102
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,800
My master sent me to ask you.

103
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,270
Have you made a decision yet?

104
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,430
Li Qi,

105
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,390
what are you doing?

106
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,000
Are you following me?

107
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,430
I'm just out for a walk.

108
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,560
Ninth Prince, you...

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,070
You're sneaking around.

110
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,190
Who were you talking to?

111
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,630
I merely instructed
someone to handle a matter.

112
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,050
As for you,

113
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,870
what right do you have to question me?

114
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
Dianxin thinks of you as a close friend.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,480
Don't let me find out

116
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,040
you've done something to hurt her.

117
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,070
What happens between Dianxin and me

118
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,160
is none of your business.

119
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,270
Ninth Prince,

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,800
don't do anything suspicious.

121
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,000
Only by behaving yourself

122
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,310
can you ensure your safety.

123
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,240
Grand Master,

124
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,390
instead of wasting time following me,

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,040
why not focus on your official duties?

126
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,870
Is there news about the painter?

127
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,390
The painter?

128
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,600
We haven't found them yet.

129
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,190
But these past two days,

130
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,120
I've uncovered something else strange.

131
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,790
What is it?

132
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,680
Lately, high-ranking officials and nobles

133
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,600
from various regions have come to the city.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
Here.

135
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,430
I've copied down their names.

136
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,260
(List)

137
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,390
These are the names from my list!

138
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,700
(List)

139
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,740
(Chen Ruiyang)

140
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,680
Only this person

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,830
is missing from Yuan Xiao's list.

142
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,890
I suspect...

143
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,190
(Chen Ruiyang)
these names

144
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,190
have already been leaked out.

145
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,920
Who could have seen these?

146
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Besides me,

147
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,080
only the two of you.

148
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,600
Manager, I...

149
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,200
I trust you both.

150
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,480
Yuan Xiao,

151
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,390
you lost your family young

152
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,750
and fought with me in battles,
loyal to the core.

153
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,000
I've seen it all.

154
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,600
The storybook and this list

155
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
appeared around the same time.

156
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,370
Maybe we should find the painter first

157
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,910
to see if it's done by the same group,

158
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,510
to avoid alerting them.

159
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,360
You're right.

160
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,670
The top priority is to find the painter.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,240
The storybooks...

162
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,190
were made by me.

163
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,710
Why did you do this?

164
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,320
You've been busy with romance,

165
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,600
and our Qianwei Teahouse is struggling.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,730
Lately, love storybooks
have been trending.

167
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,480
I thought of writing one,

168
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,790
a touching story to earn some money.

169
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,390
But I never expected it

170
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,790
to become a citywide sensation.

171
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,390
It can cover our income for half a year.

172
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,750
Then why did you draw me and Shen Musi?

173
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,600
You and the grand master

174
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,600
are always flirting with each other.

175
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,720
Isn't that a perfect material?

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,320
And everyone loves reading about

177
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,870
a brave and skilled female general

178
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,910
and a scheming, devoted grand master.

179
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,510
You must retrieve

180
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,370
all the storybooks,

181
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,240
not a single one missing. Understood?

182
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,480
Yes.

183
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,960
This storybook is so improper.

184
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,790
Look, even the color scheme is wrong.

185
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,660
What's wrong with it?

186
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,080
- Look here.
- Nonsense.

187
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,080
See?

188
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,240
What's wrong with the color scheme?

189
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,270
Are you picking a fight?

190
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,790
Look, even the flower color is wrong.

191
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,220
(Hua Wuxin, wanderer)
It's green.

192
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,990
No.

193
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,750
This is clearly a red flower.

194
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,480
The leaves are what's green.

195
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,030
You... You're lying!

196
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,630
Clearly, the flower is green.

197
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,200
No, look closely.

198
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,550
This is a red flower.

199
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,840
This is obviously a green flower.

200
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,870
He is Hua Wuxin,

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,320
skilled in imitating handwriting.

202
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,550
He's likely the wanderer

203
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,600
we've been looking for.

204
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,750
But his true identity remains unknown.

205
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,030
So, we should thank your storybooks

206
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,600
for leading us to Hua Wuxin.

207
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,200
Manager,

208
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,960
isn't this all thanks to my luck?

209
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
Look, if it weren't for my storybooks,

210
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,390
how would we have found the wanderer?

211
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,670
I've practically redeemed myself.

212
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,960
Get lost.

213
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,550
We were struggling to find him,

214
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,290
and now he's shown himself up.

215
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,230
This is clearly a trap.

216
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,790
There's one more thing

217
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,390
I think you should know.

218
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,390
Li Qi has been acting suspiciously,

219
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,220
meeting frequently with a man in secret.

220
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,270
I suspect

221
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,910
he's involved in recent events.

222
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,240
We all have our secrets,

223
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,390
but I believe he wouldn't harm me.

224
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,200
Why are you so stubborn?

225
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Manager,

226
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,790
Hua Wuxin has arrived here.

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,870
Not just him...

228
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,550
The people on the list are here too.

229
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,730
Close the teahouse.

230
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,480
We're not receiving any guests today.

231
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,770
No. Receive them as usual.

232
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,360
You haven't figured out
their intentions yet.

233
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,750
Receiving guests is too risky.

234
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,440
If war were fought with hesitation,

235
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,150
we'd have been dead long ago.

236
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,630
Yuan Xiao,

237
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,390
tell the staff to prepare for guests.

238
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,670
If this is a trap,

239
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,560
your decision

240
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,000
is just walking into their net.

241
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
Even better.

242
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,600
Since they're all here,

243
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,910
I can find out

244
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,270
who's behind this.

245
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,390
(Dianxin,)

246
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,910
(you don't know
Li Qi didn't die in the past life.)

247
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,320
(He returned safely to Nanlu Kingdom,)

248
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,320
(causing the deaths of you and your family.)
