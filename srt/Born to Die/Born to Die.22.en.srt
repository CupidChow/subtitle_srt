why didn't you kill me back then?

If you didn't like me,

why did you cry for me?

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,040
People in Nanlu see me
as their mortal enemy,

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
and everyone in the court

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,870
is keeping their eyes on me.

If you marry me, once wars break out

25
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,070
you'll be an enemy of both nations,

with no way to turn back.

if you wish to wander the world,

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,560
I will accompany you.

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,030

You all...

79
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,700
knew from the start?

80
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,780
Yes.

81
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,260
When did you

82
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,740
set this trap for me?

83
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,860
The day

84
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,980
I was imprisoned,

85
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,580
I decided to join forces with Shen Musi.

86
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,740
Grand Master, time's up.

87
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,580
Leave us alone.

88
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,940
Yes.

89
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,180
Dianxin,

90
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,900
if I had told you from the beginning,

91
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,020
you would have just pushed me away.

92
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,220
For a general,

93
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,580
the best end is to die on the battlefield,

94
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,060
not in a prison cell.

95
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,180
Song Dianxin,

96
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,340
I won't give up.

97
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,580
No matter how many times we start over,

98
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,380
I will keep a firm hold on you

99
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,980
and face life and death by your side.

100
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,460
In this life,

101
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,580
we still have a chance.

102
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,140
Song Dianxin,

103
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,180
will you trust me?

104
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,780
You're right.

105
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,900
In this life,

106
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,380
we still have a chance
to change the outcome.

107
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,860
Everyone on the list of traitors

108
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,020
is now dead.

109
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,780
We've lost all leads.

110
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,860
I had to use you
to draw out the mastermind.

111
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,140
Only if that person knew
I no longer trusted you

112
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,740
would they try to use you to kill me.

113
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,980
A coffin as the matchmaker,

114
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,740
the truth revealed as the bride-price...

115
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,540
Song Dianxin,

116
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,380
when you said you would send me away,

117
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,380
I almost believed you.

118
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,860
Li Qi,

119
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,220
I did intend to send you away.

120
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,500
You're lying.

121
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,140
You kept me by your side,

122
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,820
making me believe

123
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,020
we could be together forever.

124
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,020
Aren't you just using my feelings?

125
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,160
You're wrong.

126
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,900
She only cares for you

127
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,340
so that

128
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,980
you can regain your freedom.

129
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,900
That's all.

130
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,420
Li Qi,

131
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,860
you are a hostage prince trapped here.

132
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,460
And I...

133
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,740
I'm a suspect trapped
in a web of mysteries.

134
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,420
I never thought

135
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,460
that helping friends was exploitation.

136
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,220
Even after Hua Wuxin
and Chen Ruiyang died,

137
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,220
and even the truth remained unclear,

138
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,180
my original intention never changed.

139
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,460
Even if I found your actions suspicious,

140
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,780
I never believed you would truly harm me.

141
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,580
If I said

142
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,780
I want to leave now,

143
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,220
would you agree?

144
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,980
You know,

145
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,620
the truth means more to me
than anything else.

146
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,020
The mastermind is surely Princess Kesong.

147
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,300
You are the only one
who knows the full story.

148
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
I hope

149
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,140
you can help me expose her crimes.

150
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,180
However,

151
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,060
if you wish to leave now,

152
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,540
take this.

153
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,500
It will allow you to pass through

154
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,180
every checkpoint in Haiyin Kingdom.

155
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,660
(Travel Pass)

156
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,620
You're aware of the current situation.

157
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,980
Two nations are about to go to war.

158
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,380
Remember,

159
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,940
I'm the only one
who can grant you freedom.

160
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,140
(Travel Pass)
You once said

161
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,780
that we are both gamblers,

162
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,580
betting our lives as the stake,

163
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,420
hoping we both make the right bet.

164
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,780
But in your eyes,

165
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,730
I am nothing

166
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,740
more than a tool to accuse the princess.

167
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,300
This kind of charity...

168
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,740
I don't want it.

169
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,980
Li Qi.

(Essence of Elegance)

171
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,060
Your Highness,

172
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,480
there's a body in the main hall.

173
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,380
It is Li Qi, the hostage prince from Nanlu.

174
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,540
Princess Kesong,

175
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,980
Li Qi stayed at Qianwei Teahouse for too long,

176
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,020
and harbored ill intentions toward my wife.

177
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,020
That's why we killed him in self-defense.

178
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,820
Another death of a Nanlu Kingdom native.

179
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,620
And it's related to Song Dianxin again.

180
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,420
This time, it's even the ninth prince.

181
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,980
The moment he died,

182
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,380
you arrived.

183
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,580
