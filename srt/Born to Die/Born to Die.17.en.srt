=Episode 17=

15
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,800
You mean

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,150
when you entered the room,

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,710
you saw Shen Musi holding a dagger,

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,950
but didn't witness him using it to kill?

19
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,280
His sudden departure and solo actions...

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,600
Isn't that premeditated?

21
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,060
If Shen Musi truly committed a crime,

22
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,200
the Imperial Court will interrogate him.

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,840
I believe

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,070
he must have his reasons
for acting this way.

25
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,680
Dianxin,

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,840
he can't even defend himself,
yet you trust him,

27
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
but not the facts I saw with my own eyes?

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,070
The grand master

29
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,700
has no reason to kill.

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,360
What is his purpose?

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,960
I don't know.

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
But...

33
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,190
Weren't you the one
who let your guard down

34
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,030
because he was injured?

35
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,700
Li Qi,

36
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,900
I understand your concerns.

37
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,380
Once I investigate it,

38
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,260
I'll give you a proper explanation.

39
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,540
You don't need to explain to me.

40
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,700
If you insist on trusting him,

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,230
how can I change that?

42
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,100
Tell me, what exactly happened?

43
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,900
The dead isn't the one
who forged the handwriting.

44
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,260
When I entered the room,

45
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,900
that man was already dead.

46
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,900
He had thick calluses on his palms,

47
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,500
not on the middle finger.

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,500
So, he wasn't a frequent writer.

49
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,100
He matched the portrait.

50
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,500
It's unlikely we targeted the wrong person.

51
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,500
This information was provided by Luo Su.

52
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,500
Could it be she's lying?

53
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,300
There's one thing
that's always puzzled me.

54
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,240
When I woke up that day,

55
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,430
Luo Su was standing by my bed.

56
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,260
I've always been sensitive
to the smell of blood.

57
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,330
You're awake.

58
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,300
That day, I smelt

59
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,940
the faint scent of blood on her.

60
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,500
But I thought it was from my own wound.

61
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,280
I can understand you not telling the truth,

62
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,280
but why didn't you even defend yourself?

63
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,700
With you here,

64
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,050
I knew you'd defend me.

65
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,460
So, why waste words

66
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,960
on them?

67
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,780
If you dare act like this again,

68
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,420
I won't waste my words on you.

69
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,020
I'll follow your arrangements.

70
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,300
However,

71
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,340
Qianwei Teahouse

72
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,780
doesn't seem as peaceful as before.

73
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,850
Be sure

74
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,220
not to let them know your trump card,

75
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,930
including Li Qi.

76
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,120
(What exactly is her trump card?)

77
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,700
You're the mastermind behind this.

78
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,700
I never expected you

79
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,420
to hide so deeply.

80
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,180
Your people must still be in Qianwei Teahouse.

81
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,300
Who is it?

82
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,300
(Qianwei Teahouse)

83
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,540
(Qianwei Teahouse)

84
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,060
Did she discover us?

85
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,340
Given her intelligence,

86
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,500
she probably has.

87
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,980
What's your plan?

88
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,090
Did you see the person
who delivered the letter?

89
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,020
(Qianwei Teahouse)

90
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,580
Pan'er,

91
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,860
pack up quickly. We need to leave now.

92
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,500
Go to the inner room to enjoy the food.

93
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,140
When did you figure it out?

94
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,100
You hid the wound well,

95
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,340
but you overlooked one thing.

96
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,100
This is the millet cake I made myself.

97
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,500
Sister Luo Su, try some.

98
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,620
You break out in rashes
from eating millet cake.

99
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,140
That day, you stopped Pan'er from eating it.

100
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,780
Millet cake is made from glutinous rice,

101
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,900
hard to digest.

102
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,700
How about some chestnut cake instead?

103
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,260
I guess

104
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,570
you two know each other.

105
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,460
You once mentioned

106
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,670
you have a little sister.

107
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,460
It's her, isn't it?

108
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,420
Your target has always been me.

109
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,900
Meet me at the annex tomorrow.

110
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,820
You overheard my conversation with Shen Musi,

111
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,620
and ambushed the cottage in advance.

112
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,140
After the plan failed,

113
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,300
to prevent us from investigating further,

114
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,020
you faked the death of a fake wanderer,

115
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,700
creating a dead end.

116
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,020
But you didn't expect

117
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,460
that hand unused to holding a pen

118
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,820
would instead arouse
our suspicion of you.

119
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,460
The arrow Shen Musi took for you...

120
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,500
To be honest,

121
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,260
I truly envy you.

122
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,940
Because there's someone

123
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,500
willing to die for you.

124
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,980
But at the same time,

125
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,620
I also feel regret

126
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,980
because I might lose my only friend.

127
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,220
We've been friends for so long.

128
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,220
Did you approach me

129
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,580
with an ulterior motive?

130
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,780
Shen Musi,

131
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,620
do you think anyone in Flower Tower

132
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,170
would truly offer genuine sincerity?

133
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,380
I have no grudge against you.

134
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,840
Why do you want to harm me?

135
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,020
Because I want to survive.

136
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,740
That day you said

137
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,140
your sister was missing.

138
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,260
But it wasn't your sister.

139
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,480
It was your parents, wasn't it?

140
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,700
How did you guess that?

141
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,260
If she were your sister,

142
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,060
you could have taken her away.

143
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,140
But since you're following orders,

144
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,540
it can only mean

145
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,860
your parents are in their hands.

146
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,980
Only by obeying

147
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,540
can I ensure my family stays alive.

148
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,740
Do you really trust
the person behind this?

149
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,700
Song Dianxin,

150
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,100
you once said

151
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,720
that women can also shape their own destiny

152
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,060
without depending on anyone.

153
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,860
Why should women only rely on

154
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,340
their families or husbands?

155
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,300
I believe

156
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,300
women can also shape their own destiny

157
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,740
without depending on anyone.

158
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,140
You became a general,

159
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,020
refused an arranged marriage,

160
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,980
and even opened Qianwei Teahouse.

161
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,060
But for people like us,

162
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,200
from the moment we were born,

163
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,980
we never had the right to choose.

164
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,940
You are living a life,

165
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,740
while women like me

166
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,460
are merely surviving.

167
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,860
But have you ever considered,

168
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,100
Song Dianxin also had no choice.

169
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,380
She was forced to take her father's place

170
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,100
to fight on the front lines,

171
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,740
risking her life at any moment.

172
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,180
She fought desperately for the nation,

173
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,780
so that the people

174
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,100
could live in peace.

175
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,620
Even after all her efforts,

176
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,740
her family was still executed.

177
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,860
For her,

178
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,380
surviving

179
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,460
is nothing short of a miracle.

180
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,800
We are all using our lives

181
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,900
to protect our families.

182
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,700
You have your struggles,

183
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,380
and I have my cage.

184
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,620
But I believe

185
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,780
the words you've spoken to me

186
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,420
were all sincere.

187
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,740
Sister Luo Su,

188
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
trust me.

189
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,420
Work with me.

190
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,500
As long as you help me protect

191
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,940
my sister and my parents,

192
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,300
I'll help you lure out
the person behind me.

193
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,100
They won't let me go.

194
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,940
I'm the perfect bait.

195
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,100
Sister...

196
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:59,060
(Three days later)

197
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,980
Ms. Yuan.

198
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,620
Miss.

199
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,720
- You're here.
- You're here.

200
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,140
From now on,
I'll leave her in your care.

201
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,940
Please take good care of her.

202
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,340
We'll look after her well.

203
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,940
Now you have a home.

204
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,340
- Go ahead.
- Come, let me see.

205
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,980
You've grown so tall.

206
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,940
How wonderful.

207
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,900
Dianxin.

208
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,060
Can you actually speak?

209
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,940
Pan'er, you little liar.

210
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,980
My sister said

211
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,820
to give this to you

212
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,100
when I found a home.

213
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,220
(With a smile and blushing cheeks, she greets.)

214
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,140
It matches Father's handwriting.

215
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,060
This is the person
who wrote the forged letter.

216
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,740
