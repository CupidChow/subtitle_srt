Feeling

16
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,140
means physical contact.

17
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,820
Sister Dianxin,

18
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,180
do you like Shen Musi?

19
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,140
Usually,

20
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,140
people deny it or stay silent.

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,180
See?

22
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,860
It's that simple

23
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,700
to guess someone's thoughts.

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,700
Dianxin,

25
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,540
what kind of person do you like?

26
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,060
I like someone who takes the initiative.

27
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,660
I've always been proactive,

28
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,580
and I treat others with sincerity.

29
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,180
But I'm also afraid
that being too proactive

30
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,660
might annoy the woman I love,

31
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,620
and even make me seem insincere.

32
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,260
You've been away
from Qianwei Teahouse for days.

33
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,820
You've truly improved quite a bit.

34
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,300
You must have someone special,
teaching you well.

35
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,860
You've quickly learned
the art of sweet talk.

36
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,180
Indeed,

37
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,100
I've long had someone in my heart.

38
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,220
If you treat your beloved sincerely,

39
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,500
time will show you

40
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,020
who truly cares for you

41
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,940
and who wears a mask to deceive you.

42
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,460
If you truly love someone,

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,300
you must be honest and open to her.

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,300
What does time have to do with it?

45
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,180
It seems

46
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,140
no matter which of these two wins,

47
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,060
you are the true winner.

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,020
Thank you for your hospitality today.

49
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,660
I toast to everyone.

50
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,180
Dianxin, let's meet at the annex tomorrow.

51
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,300
I want to have a good talk with you.

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,460
I'll wait for you till you come.

53
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,660
If the final outcome

54
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,300
is a living hell,

55
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,900
I will lift you high,

56
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,700
far away from all the suffering.

57
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,380
I believe in you.

58
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,780
He couldn't still be waiting, could he?

59
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
Shen Musi.

60
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,300
Shen Musi.

61
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,340
Shen Musi.

62
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,220
Shen Musi.

63
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,420
What happened?

64
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,420
Let's get you up.

65
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,860
Someone attacked me.

66
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,100
Let's leave here first.

67
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,860
Shen Musi.

68
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,220
Shen Musi.

69
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,180
I finally

70
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,940
blocked the arrow aimed at you.

71
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,860
Yuan Xiao.

72
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,100
Yuan Xiao.

73
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,980
Fetch the royal doctor!

74
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,860
Yes.

75
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,420
How is he?

76
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,620
The grand master is deeply poisoned.

77
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,180
We've used the best medicine available.

78
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,500
If his fever subsides

79
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,420
within the next two days,

80
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,060
he might wake up.

81
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,380
Thank you, doctor.

82
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,420
It's all my fault for arriving too late.

83
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,540
I should have gone earlier.

84
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,300
Then this wouldn't have happened.

85
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,340
Dianxin,

86
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,540
it's not your fault.

87
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,140
You did your best.

88
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,980
Shen Musi,

89
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,060
you must wake up.

90
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,660
Go rest.

91
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,700
I'll stay and watch over him.

92
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,100
Tell Yuan Xiao for me

93
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,180
that we must find the attacker.

94
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,620
You haven't eaten all day.

95
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,180
I'll go make something.

96
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,540
Why?

97
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,980
You didn't hesitate at all.

98
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,940
It's human nature

99
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,820
to only save themselves when in danger.

100
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,220
Yet, you risked your safety for me.

101
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,700
Watch out!

102
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,980
A dead person can't repay debts.

103
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,420
You still owe me, remember?

104
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,460
I would, as I do now,

105
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,140
love only one woman,

106
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,100
watch fireflies with her,

107
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,820
and gaze at the starry sky with her.

108
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,540
No matter what happens,

109
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,020
I'd stay by her side,

110
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,380
ensuring her safety.

111
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,780
If anyone breaks it...

112
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,260
If anyone breaks it,

113
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,300
what we love will only bring pain,

114
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,420
and all the joy will eventually fade away.

115
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,740
Dianxin,

116
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,220
you were never a calculated choice for me.

117
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,420
You are my reckless obsession,

118
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,380
even when I know it's unwise.

119
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,460
If the final outcome

120
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,200
is a living hell,

121
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,060
I will lift you high,

122
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,860
far from all the suffering.

123
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,620
I don't want any of this.

124
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,620
I only want you to live.

125
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,740
Shen Musi,

126
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,900
I gave you the chance to leave.

127
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,300
Since you chose to stay,

128
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,700
you are bound to me,

129
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,940
and only me, for the rest of your life.
