There are fireflies.

16
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,350
I've heard that if you make a wish on them,

17
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,760
it will come true.

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,590
When we were young, you said

19
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,000
that wishes made on fireflies
would come true.

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,430
I wish

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,710
for my father to return safely.

22
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,190
What did you wish for?

23
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,590
My wish

24
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,430
is that all your wishes come true.

25
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,190
If we could start over,

26
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,360
what would you do?

27
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,590
I...

28
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,080
I would do as my father hoped.

29
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,590
I'll continue being a general,

30
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,190
protecting the country

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
and my family.

32
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,590
I would, as I do now,

33
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,190
love only one woman,

34
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,800
watch fireflies with her,

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,400
and gaze at the starry sky with her.

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,380
No matter what happens,

37
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,400
I'd stay by her side,

38
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,800
ensuring her safety.

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,840
If anyone breaks it...

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,470
If anyone breaks it,

41
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,680
what we love will only bring pain,

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,680
and all the joy will eventually fade away.

43
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,590
It's not enough.

44
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,840

Correspondence with Nanlu

Yuan Xiao brought back

73
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,870
a letter from your father.

- To deliver it...
- How is my father?

Your father...

76
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,750
has taken his own life.

78
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,240
Manager,

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
By the time I arrived,

81
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,920
General Song had already...

82
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,240
This was secretly handed to me

83
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,190
by the deputy general before his arrest.

84
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:53,260
(To my beloved daughter, Song Dianxin)

(Father...)

86
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,900
(To my beloved daughter, Song Dianxin)

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Dianxin, remember this:

88
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,040
as long as I'm by your side,

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,680
you'll never have to fear anything.

90
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,800
Are you hungry?

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,840
Let's go.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,310
Dear Dianxin.

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,950
You've always been like your mother,

94
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,360
strong-willed and decisive.

95
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
On the day you knelt before me,

96
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,630
(Song Guolin)
I wasn't truly intent

97
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,360
on casting you out of the family.

98
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,430
I simply understood

99
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,000
that you had your reasons

100
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,160
for breaking off the engagement

101
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,750
and opening Qianwei Teahouse.

102
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,110
My child,

103
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,830
go ahead and do whatever you want.

104
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,390
No matter how far you go,

105
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,830
I will always be here for you.

106
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,000
Though I've spent my life on the battlefield,

107
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,600
this time,

108
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,720
I have an ominous feeling.

109
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,830
(Love, Your Father)

110
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,390
If something happens to me,

111
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,480
I only hope

112
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,070
you'll let go of revenge,

113
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,160
and leave the capital,

114
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,070
spending the rest of your days in peace.

115
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,360
This is my only wish for you,

116
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,830
as your father.

117
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,390
(In this second life,)

118
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,390
(I already knew everything)

119
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,870
(that was going to happen.)

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,120
(I had already left the court.)

121
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,680
(I even broke ties with my family)

122
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,070
(to protect my loved ones.)

123
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,240
(Why did things still end up this way?)

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,840
Your Majesty,

125
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,390
my marriage is bestowed by you.

126
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,000
If she is convicted
for being a part of the Songs,

127
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,800
then I should also be imprisoned.

128
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,740
(Emperor of Haiyin Kingdom)
Nonsense.

129
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,000
As a grand master of our kingdom,

130
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,560
how can you threaten me
with personal feelings?

131
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,170
In life, a couple share their bed;

132
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,050
in death, they share their grave.

133
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,430
If Song Dianxin dies,

134
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,630
I beg Your Majesty to sentence me to death.

135
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,960
(General Mansion)
My master would never rebel.

136
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,270
What are you doing?

137
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,390
- Hurry, move!
- Quickly!

138
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,390
No one is allowed to take anyone away.

139
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,080
Song Dianxin, by the emperor's decree,

140
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,510
your entire family

141
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,630
is to be executed.

142
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,750
Even those already expelled from the family

143
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,630
cannot be exempt.

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,030
Seize her!

145
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,120
Who dares seize me?

146
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Dianxin,

147
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,630
the Song family has served

148
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,120
as soldiers for generations,

149
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,790
fighting for the nation.

150
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,390
In my generation,

151
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,510
even as a woman,

152
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,910
I fear no charge into battle.

153
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,200
My father spent his life fighting for Nanlu,

154
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,550
earning countless military honors.

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,670
He would never betray his country,

156
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,600
nor abandon the wishes of our ancestors.

157
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,240
If someone framed my father,

158
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,150
and no one seeks the truth for him,

159
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,630
then the fate of the Song family today

160
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,870
will be the future of all soldiers.

161
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,870
All, receive the edict.

162
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,460
(Imperial Seal)

163
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,510
From God's blessings,

the commoner Song Dianxin, due to the plea

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,390
of Grand Master Shen Musi,

166
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,050
is pardoned from the collective punishment.

167
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,480
Grand Master Shen Musi, for his moral failings,

Dianxin,

171
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,790
let's go back.

172
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,510
You can't solve anything here.

173
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,510
Come back with me.

174
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,040
Dianxin,

175
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,600
your father
wouldn't want you to be like this.

176
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
He can't see anymore.
