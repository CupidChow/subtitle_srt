00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,840
How are you feeling?

16
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,400
I'm fine.

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,590
Thank you,

18
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,400
Shen Musi,

19
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,430
for saving me once again.

20
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,150
I finally

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,760
blocked the arrow aimed at you.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,790
But what do you mean

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,760
by saying you 'finally'

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,150
blocked the arrow shot at me?

25
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,150
Perhaps

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,840
it reminds me of the last time

27
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,840
you were nearly hit by an arrow.

28
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,840
How's your investigation going?

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,080
There are many suspicious points.

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,120
I don't want to make a scene,

31
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,630
lest we alert the enemy.

32
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,400
They are in the dark,

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,870
and we are in the light.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,840
There will be many uncertainties.

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,960
We must be more careful.

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,150
Who said 'we'?

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,710
Just focus on recovering.

38
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,000
I can handle these matters alone.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
Of course, it's 'we'.

40
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,800
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,150
I'll get you something.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,150
Did you pull at the wound?

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,870
Song Dianxin,

44
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,470
since I've chosen to stay,

45
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,870
then in this lifetime,

46
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,360
I will only entangle with you alone.

47
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,630
I heard everything you said.

48
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,750
I know you like me.

49
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,960
That's enough for me.

50
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,260
(Qianwei Teahouse)

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,310
Manager,

52
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,710
based on the footprints around the annex,

53
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,190
it seems to be a man.

54
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,950
But there are no clear leads yet.

55
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,080
Where has Li Qi been these days?

56
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
He's probably jealous seeing you favor

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,080
the grand master so much.

58
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,710
Such a smooth talker.

59
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,360
Sister Dianxin.

60
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,710
You may leave now.

61
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,680
Yes.

62
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,840
Sister Luo Su.

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,470
Sister Dianxin,

64
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,290
I specially bought these pastries

65
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,840
to apologize to you.

66
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,550
You're too kind.

67
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,470
I'm afraid you might misunderstand me.

68
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,430
In truth, Shen Musi and I are just friends.

69
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,840
We've known each other since childhood,

70
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,310
but he's never mentioned you before.

71
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,960
He came to Flower Tower on business,

72
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,750
and that's how we met.

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,750
But strangely enough,

74
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,830
Lord Shen has always been fair in his duties.

75
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,070
But one day,

76
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,190
he suddenly asked me

77
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,240
how to win a lady's heart.

78
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,110
It's the first time I've heard

79
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,700
that the Grand Master would need to ask

80
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,270
someone how to make a person happy.

81
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,240
It's almost laughable to say it out loud.

82
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,630
So, Sister Dianxin,

83
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,720
who do you think he is trying to charm?

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,510
Sister Dianxin,

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,830
to be honest,

86
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,040
I truly envy you.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,220
You've had your family
to protect you since childhood.

88
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,480
And now,

89
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,120
there's someone
who loves and protects you.

90
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,770
A woman is always more secure
with the protection

91
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,830
of her family or her husband.

92
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,040
But why should a woman

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,920
only rely on her family or her husband?

94
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,510
I believe

95
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,480
a woman can also shape her own destiny

96
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,190
without depending on anyone.

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,630
Little mute, give it to me.

98
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,750
(Qianwei Teahouse)
Hurry.

99
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,270
What are you doing?

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,310
Are you okay?

101
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,950
This little girl clearly hasn't eaten all day.

102
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,820
The millet cake is made of glutinous rice,

103
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,950
which is hard to digest.

104
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,750
How about having a chestnut cake instead?

105
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,270
You're so thoughtful.

106
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,600
You seem a bit sad.

107
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,070
Seeing her...

108
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,160
reminds me of the past.

109
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,750
I once had a younger sister too.

110
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,750
But back then, our family was poor.

111
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,730
She fell seriously ill,
and we couldn't afford treatment.

112
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,950
Later,

113
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,070
she went out alone and got lost.

114
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,870
To this day, we haven't found her.

115
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,830
Do you remember any distinctive features?

116
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,430
I can help you look for her.

117
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,120
It's been so long...

118
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,120
I doubt she can be found now.

119
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,800
Sister Dianxin,

120
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,950
you truly are a kind person.

121
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Manager,

122
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,800
the princess has arrived.

123
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,070
I didn't tell her the details
of Mr. Shen's injury.

124
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,810
Princess.

125
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,000
Dianxin, are you alright?

126
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,920
I heard the grand master
was severely injured,

127
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,720
and was worried you might be hurt too,

128
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,160
so I came to check on you.

129
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,160
I'm so relieved

130
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,560
to see you safe and sound.

131
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,780
I'm fine. Thank you for your concern.

132
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,510
Could it be
that another tragedy has occurred?

133
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,190
Don't hide it from me.

134
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,390
Nothing serious.

135
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,360
It's just that the grand master

136
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,630
was accidentally injured
by a hunter while out.

137
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,950
Princess, would you like to see him?

138
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,680
Why would I go see the grand master?

139
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,070
As long as you're well,

140
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,750
what does it matter
if others are injured?

141
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,510
I'm sure you aren't worried about him either.

142
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,260
What are you laughing at?

143
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,830
Your Highness, greetings.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,120
I'm smiling because recently, the manager

145
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,160
has been by the grand master's side every day,

146
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,410
taking care of him.

147
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,360
She seems even more worried
than if she fell ill.

148
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,560
Dianxin,

149
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,510
didn't you call off
the engagement with him?

150
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,560
Changed your mind?

151
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,830
Princess, you've misunderstood.

152
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,360
He was injured at Qianwei Teahouse.

153
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,000
As the manager,
it's my duty to care for him.

154
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,920
Well, never mind then.

155
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,160
I sneaked out this time.

156
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,560
I must hurry back.

157
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,600
These tonics...

158
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,600
Never mind.

159
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,950
Just leave them here.

160
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,630
Dianxin,

161
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,870
I'm leaving now.

162
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,780
Princess, take care.

163
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,600
I am, after all, your savior.

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,360
Why did you tell others

165
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,360
that I was injured by hunters?

166
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,240
This matter is suspicious,

167
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,870
and it shouldn't be leaked to outsiders.

168
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,360
Besides,

169
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,550
you're lucky.
I could've called it a dog bite.

170
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,510
Who's the dog?

171
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,080
Yuan Xiao.

172
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,440
Manager,

173
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,120
we've got news about the wanderer.

174
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,320
Three suspicious locations
have been identified.

175
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,600
Let's set out immediately.

176
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,120
I'll go with you.

177
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,080
What if something happens to you?

178
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,510
- I...
- Your injury hasn't healed.

179
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,630
You won't be able to save her anyway.

180
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,720
Dianxin.

181
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,600
I'll accompany you instead.

182
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,670
If something happens,

183
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,510
my status as the grand master
might be useful.

184
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,750
Besides,

185
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
if something were to happen to you,

186
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,960
Dianxin and I

187
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,150
would feel terribly guilty.

188
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,030
Here's the plan:

189
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,560
I'll lead one team, Yuan Xiao another.

190
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,420
You two in one team.

191
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,750
Let's set out now.

192
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,480
Manager,

193
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,320
when you're

194
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,390
flirting with Mr. Shen

195
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,630
could you tone it down a bit?

196
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,750
Even I blush watching you,

197
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,080
let alone the ninth prince.

198
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,790
Enough chatter, find the person.

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,960
Though you're injured,

200
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,630
your energy doesn't seem diminished at all.

201
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,390
You're ambiguous with the courtesan,

202
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,360
and you're also
relentlessly pursuing Dianxin.

203
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,720
You're staying at Qianwei Teahouse.

204
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,790
Don't you surely have some ulterior motive?
