Eunuch Liang, this is...

16
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,430
Song Dianxin.

17
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,740
(Princess Kesong of Haiyin Kingdom)

18
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,420
Messages from his majesty.

19
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,100
From God's blessings,
at the behest of his majesty,

20
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,580
the commoner Song Dianxin

21
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,820
attempted to abduct
the princess's husband, Li Qi,

22
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,220
behaving unseemly

23
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,740
and causing trouble.

24
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,620
However,
considering Song Dianxin's contributions,

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,940
she is pardoned

26
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,380
and shall not be punished.

27
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,860
Respect it!

28
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,540
Dianxin,

29
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,340
I have finally met you.

30
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,780
Capturing Tianhe Valley,

31
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,140
defending the border alone...

32
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,260
In my heart,

33
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,020
you are the most formidable general.

34
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,420
I am honored by your praise.

35
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,100
Now, I'm merely

36
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,660
the manager of Qianwei Teahouse.

37
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,340
But still the most beautiful manager!

38
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,540
Dianxin,

39
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,500
which room should I stay in?

40
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,660
You will stay here?

41
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,740
My father has instructed

42
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,940
that I foster a bond
with the Ninth Prince.

43
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,180
The wedding arrangements are in my charge.

44
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,740
Today, I'll stay at Qianwei Teahouse.

45
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,860
Alright.

46
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,540
Please wait while I make arrangements.

47
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,620
Yuan Xiao,

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,400
prepare a premium room for the princess.

49
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,780
- Keep an eye on Zheng Huai'an.
- Yes.

50
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,820
Ninth Prince,

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,940
you must prove yourself.

52
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,820
His Majesty wants you to bond

53
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,740
with the princess more.

54
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,100
Grand Master,

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,340
you truly like to meddle in others' business.

56
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,500
No wonder Dianxin called off the engagement.

57
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,340
Why are you still here?

58
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,620
Don't overthink it.

59
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,140
You're merely my excuse

60
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,780
to visit Dianxin.

61
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,820
Why are you still here?

62
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,100
Everyone, leave now.

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,340
Men are such a bother.

64
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,620
Dianxin,

65
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,000
I've heard there are many novelty
outside the palace.

66
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,260
Being confined to rules
in the palace every day

67
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,020
is driving me mad.

68
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,100
Then, Princess,
what would you like to do?

69
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,540
I'll leave it all to you.

70
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,740
Alright.

71
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,500
Dianxin, are you taking me
to see the stars?

72
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,100
They're fireflies.

73
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,100
- Dianxin.
- Dianxin.

74
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,660
Look!

75
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,580
Here...

76
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,300
And more over there!

77

78
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,600
Little Dianxin,
you climbed the wall again!

79
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,260
I snuck out to show you something cool.

80
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
I haven't finished today's studies yet.

81
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,900
No time for your games.

82
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,380

how did you know I love fireflies?

108

"Candlelight shines on picture screens.

110
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,660
I heard you often recite this poem

111
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,620
and love things that glow at night.

112
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,300
When my mother was still alive,

113
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,900
her courtyard was also filled

114
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,220
with such fireflies.

115
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,500
I had forgotten

116
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,500
how long it had been

117
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,580
since I last saw such beautiful fireflies.

118
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,300
If you like them, take them to the palace.

119
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,900
A firefly's life

120
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,620
lasts but a few days,

121
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,700
or at most half a month.

122
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,380
It should fly carefreely

123
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,380
in this small courtyard.

124
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,620
Why confine its brief life

125
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,580
to a cage

126
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,380
just for my selfish desires?

127
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,220
As long as you want,

128
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,920
you may visit my teahouse anytime.

129
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,620
Song Dianxin,

130
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,020
I have decided

131
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,100
that from today onward,

132
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,020
we shall become sworn sisters.

133
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,980
You will be my elder sister.

134
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,260
No, our statuses are different.

135
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,520
Please take back your words.

136
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,420
No,

137
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,420
I have decided that you are my sister.

138
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,890
Drinking alone at night,

139
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,460
you have such a refined taste.

140
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,260
The view is perfect tonight.

141
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,620
Why not join me

142
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,340
and enjoy this beautiful moment?

143
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,120
Whether Li Qi is
the princess' husband or not,

144
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,700
he should leave now.

145
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,020
All guests are welcome here.

146
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,620
Besides, Li Qi is also my friend.

147
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,900
Do you know why

148
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,820
Princess Kesong insists

149
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,700
on staying at Qianwei Teahouse?

150
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,620
Princess Kesong is simple-minded,

151
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,380
just fond of having fun.

152
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,140
You don't have to.

153
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,060
Show the same energy you use to trouble me.

154
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,620
Don't just suspect me.

155
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,300
Question those around you too.

156
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,180
If I trouble you,

157
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,300
you should feel honored.

158
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,060
Manager!

159
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,300
Princess.

160
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,980
A single fatal strike,

161
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,380
with a very small wound.

162
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,100
A special weapon was used.

163
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,980
It isn't from Haiyin Kingdom.

164
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,780
No signs of poisoning,

165
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,460
nor any struggle or resistance.

166
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,500
I checked the door lock.

167
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,900
No signs of forced entry.

168
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,460
And this room...

169
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,420
only has one exit.

170
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,340
When did you inspect the room?

171
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,740
Two hours ago.

172
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,460
Two hours.

173
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,380
Yuan Xiao,

174
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,820
order everyone
to stay in Qianwei Teahouse.

175
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,060
Dianxin,

176
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,940
who is this person?

177
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,460
Your Highness,

178
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,860
he's Deputy Commandant Zheng Huai'an,

179
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,860
under Wang Fangchi.

180
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,290
I'm ordered to investigate it.

181
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,860
Zheng Huai'an is a key figure,

182
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,820
so I detained him here

183
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,100
for questioning.

184
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,420
Your Highness, I truly...

185
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,780
- Stay still.
- I...

186
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,660
Here's a jade pendant.

187
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,960
The killer must have dropped it

188
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,220
during the crime.

189
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,060
The owner of this pendant

190
