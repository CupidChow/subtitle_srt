1
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,333
Three.

2
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,333
Two.

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,800
One.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,100
Everyone, the 21st century has begun.

5
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:34,033
The new millennium has begun
with the year 2000.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,066
Countless spectators are welcoming
the new future.

7
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,433
As the new millennium draws near,

8
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:52,500
anxiety over possible chaos
from the inability of computer systems

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,834
to distinguish 2000 from 1900
is on the rise.

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,533
A failure to fix the millennium bug

11
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:05,233
might lead to the launch of
an atomic bomb.

12
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,300
A belief that is based on doomsday,

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,834
Time-Limit Eschatology is on the rise.

14
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:16,166
Even if we study or work...

15
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,934
More people are quitting their jobs.

16
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:22,233
Half of the drug offenders
caught by police

17
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:24,000
were revealed to be jobless.

18
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,734
I love enjoying
late-night snacks with you.

19
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,667
I missed you so much at work

20
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,600
that I finished my tasks quickly.

21
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,066
Come on.

22
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,066
It's so pretty.

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,133
I can tell it's autumn.

24
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,934
- Gosh, it must be a neighborhood bazaar.
- Hold on.

25
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,200
It's market day.

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,633
What? It's a party.

27
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:58,767
Table clocks, phones, sneakers,
various books,

28
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:01,467
computers, and all sorts of other items
are on sale.

29
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:04,800
I dropped by on my way to work
after calling the office.

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,600
I bought about 20 items
for about 1,500 won.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,033
It's a big market. It looks like a feast.

32
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,266
It's so nice.

33
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,767
It's a proper market.

34
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:17,433
- What's this?
- What's this?

35
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,400
The security guard is eating.

36
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,467
Is that Woo-il?

37
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,400
- Mr. Security Guard, hello.
- Hello.

38
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
Welcome.

39
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:34,667
We meet again.

40
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,400
- Let me show you guys around.
- Okay.

41
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,433
- What's this?
- What's this?

42
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,967
The items must be connected to something.

43
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,467
It's sold as a set.

44
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:51,667
This is-- What?

45
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,300
"Prepare for Y2K."

46
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,433
- You know what that is, right?
- Y2K.

47
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,367
Don't you know what it is?

48
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:04,367
My last words, "Let's stay friends"

49
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,467
What? All of us are wearing Y2K fashion.

50
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,400
- It seems that way.
- It's retro.

51
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,767
- Tae-hyun, aren't those your old clothes?
- Yes.

52
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,700
I wore these for a drama
called Into the Sunlight.

53
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,000
- Right.
- Right. I knew it.

54
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,000
Guess who I am.

55
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:24,867
Fin.K.L.

56
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,467
KCM from Fin.K.L.

57
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,000
KCM from Fin.K.L.

58
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,934
KCM?

59
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:32,900
A Fin.K.L member, KCM in arm warmers.

60
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,300
I'm good at arm wrestling.

61
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:38,533
Who do you think JENNIE is?

62
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:42,600
She just looks like JENNIE.

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,266
- I know.
- She looks so sophisticated.

64
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:45,533
Aren't those her clothes?

65
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,367
She'll make them fashionable again.

66
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:50,667
I'm Lee Hyo-ri today.

67
00:04:58,133 --> 00:04:59,467
Who is he?

68
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,867
- He's just a guy in Dongdaemun.
- In Dongdaemun,

69
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,600
- there were men dressed like this.
- Y2K fashion.

70
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,567
Why did you give yourself a penalty?

71
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,600
- I bet it's about the end of the century.
- The end of the century.

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,233
We need to look carefully.

73
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:14,200
They sell dishware and clothing.

74
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,400
Jae-seok, let's buy some food and eat.

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,834
- We should eat.
- My goodness.

76
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:27,400
Food is the best part of bazaars.

77
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,500
There's so much food.

78
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,533
Old-fashioned fried chicken.

79
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,367
Everything looks delicious.

80
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:39,233
The color is nice and light.

81
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,734
The fish cake looks delicious.

82
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:46,500
Sundae, tteokbokki, and fish cake, please.

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,734
How much is the chicken?

84
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:55,367
Hey, don't just buy whatever you want.
There could be a catch.

85
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,033
Why would they make things so easy?

86
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,400
- Maybe we need to save up.
- But they told us to eat whatever we want.

87
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,834
They have no reason
to give us money for food.

88
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,400
- Right.
- Give me some sundae too.

89
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,533
- Right?
- All right.

90
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:18,834
- Right?
- Strange indeed.

91
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:21,233
I don't know anything.
I always get fooled.

92
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,133
- That's always the case with you.
- Yes.

93
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,100
I lost last week because of you, Jung-ha.

94
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,934
You fell for JENNIE's lies.

95
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:29,767
You're from Seoul, right?

96
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:30,967
Bundang.

97
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,667
I got this. Let's go.

98
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,633
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

99
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:38,767
...an innocent civilian. Not. I'm
a parent who requested illegal tutoring.

100
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:41,066
- I told you so.
- This ledger is filled with lies.

101
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,500
It's nonsense.

102
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:46,667
- You know, I called my mom afterward.
- What?

103
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,800
- Okay.
- I asked her, "Where was I born?"

104
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,700
- I was born in Bundang.
- So it's true.

105
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,767
- Really?
- Really?

106
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:54,000
CHA Bundang Medical Center.

107
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:56,467
- It's true.
- I'm from Bundang.

108
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:57,400
You're from Bundang.

109
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,266
JENNIE was born in a place
with a modern vibe.

110
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:03,967
CHA Bundang Medical Center.

111
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:07,166
- You were born at home, right?
- I was born at home.

112
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,367
- You were born at home, right?
- I was born at home.

113
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,700
There was a midwife.

114
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,700
-"Push."
- I wasn't born in a hospital.

115
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,734
- Let's eat. Let's have a taste.
- Okay.

116
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:21,767
I'll eat a fish cake skewer.

117
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,333
My goodness.

118
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,800
- Is it really good?
- It's tasty.

119
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,100
Thank you.

120
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:29,967
You can put the money in here.

121
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,400
Did we eat 2,000 won's worth of food?

123
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,066
By the way, what's this?

124
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:47,867
- The symbol looks unusual.
- Thank you.

125
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,700
I bet it's important.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,967
Wait, is it a crab?

127
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,734
- Are you a spy?
- Thank you.

128
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:01,533
- JENNIE.
- How is that a crab?

129
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:03,800
- It looks like a crab.
- It's nothing like a crab.

130
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,266
It's either a bull or a crab.

131
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:09,000
JENNIE, ask people.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,633
- I'll take a fish cake skewer.
- In modern society,

133
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,734
precision is a virtue.

134
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,333
- The radio is on.
- So you must be precise

135
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,066
- in calculation, appointments, and work.
- Where?

136
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,834
But in my opinion,
people who are too precise lack charm.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,300
Isn't that you?

138
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,667
It's me. Hold on.

139
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:33,166
Today is Tuesday, April 27,
and this is Cha Tae-hyun's FM Inkigayo.

140
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,433
Breaking news.

141
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:49,233
As the new millennium approaches,
society is showing unrest.

142
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,066
This year, there has been a rise
in scams regarding doomsday predictions

143
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,834
- and the millennium bug...
- It's about Y2K.

144
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:59,800
- ...as well as violent crimes.
- The millennium.

145
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,233
Amidst the social unrest,

146
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:05,834
drug use among youth has increased.

147
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:07,400
Today's episode is about drugs.

148
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:12,834
The government promised to implement
a countermeasure as soon as possible.

149
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:16,533
You've been listening to KVN Radio News.
Thank you.

150
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,066
Scams... Violent crimes...

151
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:23,400
...drug use among youth has increased.

152
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,300
- When does it expire?
- It's a forever deal.

153
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,867
No, I'm talking about 018.

154
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:35,867
I knew you were talking about 018.
It's a forever deal.

155
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,533
Isn't that too erotic?

156
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,233
- It's a commercial I was in.
- It startled me.

157
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,100
- It was his commercial.
- I see.

158
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,834
When does it expire?

159
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,133
It's a forever deal.

160
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,900
- Are you happy to hear it again?
- Yes.

161
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,000
A commercial for 018.

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,567
- It's still the case today--
- Hey!

163
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:52,734
- Gosh.
- What was that?

164
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:54,400
You sons of bitches!

165
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,333
- What?
- What?

166
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:59,000
Hey! You sons of bitches!

167
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,333
- What?
- What?

168
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,767
- All of you should be ruined!
- What?

169
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:10,100
You guys are absolutely crazy!

170
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,667
What?

171
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:12,867
- What's going on?
- What?

172
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:13,767
We should do drugs?

173
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,166
- What?
- Gosh!

174
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,667
- What?
- What?

175
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,000
- What?
- It's money.

176
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:40,834
It's money.

177
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:42,200
- Gosh.
- It's money.

178
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,233
It's money.

179
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:45,900
It's money!

180
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,967
This is incredible.

181
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,400
- It's raining money.
- What?

182
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,867
- My goodness.
- What's this?

183
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:58,767
- What's wrong with you?
- Who is he?

184
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,967
All of you will be ruined.

185
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:02,567
- What?
- What was that?

186
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,400
- What?
- Who are you punks?

187
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,333
Gosh, he's at it again.

188
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,333
- We haven't had peace since he came.
- Really?

189
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,934
He ruined the atmosphere of the apartment.

190
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:15,767
Is it unit 613 again?

191
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:18,166
He's a druggie. For goodness' sake.

192
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,967
He does drugs?

193
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:22,300
Someone who ruins the atmosphere moved in.

194
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,500
Unit 613?

195
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:27,333
You guys are absolutely crazy!

196
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:33,834
Should we go up there?

197
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
There might be clues here.

198
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,934
There are strange items regarding Y2K.

199
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:48,333
The fish cake soup is great.

200
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,500
I'll take one warm fried chicken.

201
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,533
What could it be?
There are no clues right now.

202
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,667
Their heads are in the clouds.

203
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,834
No one is putting down their food.
Let's go.

204
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:59,100
- We only talk about putting it down.
- Let's go.

205
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,133
Hope you sell a lot. Thank you.

206
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,600
- Thank you.
- Hope you sell a lot.

207
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,433
I bought some chicken.

208
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,734
Let's go.

209
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:14,800
- I'm scared.
- I'll take the lead.

210
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,333
Something might jump out, JENNIE.

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,166
- She's confident.
- Drugs--

212
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,533
There could be drugs, JENNIE.

213
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,033
This must be the unit.

214
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:28,867
GET LOST

215
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:30,800
CRAZY BASTARD, DEVIL

216
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,867
YOU'LL BE PUNISHED!

217
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,200
I found the unit.

218
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,166
- What's this?
-"Cursed bastard. Garbage."

219
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,500
"Get lost."

220
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,200
- Shall we open the door?
- Shall we?

221
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,066
- Is it locked?
- This must be a lock.

222
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:45,000
We can't open it.
I guess we need to do something.

223
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,633
We need a key.

224
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,734
- Is anyone home?
- The security guard is here.

225
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:56,467
- Sir, the door is locked.
- It's locked.

226
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:59,033
- Yes, the door is locked.
- What's this?

227
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:03,133
The resident of unit 613
has many problems.

228
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,100
That's why things are chaotic and strange
at the apartment.

229
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,500
You should go home for now.

230
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,266
- Really?
- Can't we go inside?

231
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:13,600
- No. Please go home for now.
- Is that so?

232
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,233
- Things are eerie.
- What's this?

233
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,033
Gosh, he's at it again.

234
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:21,433
He's a druggie. For goodness' sake.

235
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,800
Tae-hyun got demoted already.

236
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,533
Did I get demoted?

237
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,133
It's the elderly versus the youngsters.

238
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,734
Wasn't I a fixed member of the Yus?

239
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:35,567
- The Yangs.
- Jae-seok.

240
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,266
- See you later.
- Tae-hyun.

241
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:40,500
Let me tell you this in advance.
Se-chan can't see the big picture.

242
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,533
Don't worry. I'll show you.

243
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,133
Put the slippers on. What?

244
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,367
My family had a sofa like that.

245
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:55,133
This is incredible. It's an actual home.

246
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:02,333
It's an exact replica of an old apartment.
Gosh.

247
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,000
- Jae-seok, there's a photo of me.
- Where?

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,066
A photo of me.

249
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,000
Gosh, Jae-seok is here too.

250
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,767
It was like that in real life.
You were a star.

251
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:32,000
- There's a photo of you too.
- I wasn't a star.

252
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,667
In the early 2000s,
things looked up for me.

253
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,800
Tae-hyun was a teen star.

254
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:53,734
I wasn't a major star,
but my career was beginning to take off.

255
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,066
- Is that you?
- Yes.

256
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,133
You look cool here.

257
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,200
- I look nice, right?
- Yes.

258
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
- I didn't look half bad.
- You looked very cool back then.

259
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,800
A mermaid?

260
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,333
Here comes 1,000 won!

261
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,767
Yu Jae-seok.

262
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,967
Let's enter the Yangs' house.

263
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:12,834
Don't worry. I'll show you.

264
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,400
This feels like my grandma's house.

265
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,200
This same closet was in my childhood home.

266
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,900
My goodness.

267
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,834
- I collected them.
- I've never seen these.

268
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,100
- We're set.
- Look at the bathtub.

269
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,934
Let's find the clues.

270
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:43,667
Come on, guys. Let's take our time.

271
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,266
- Seriously.
- Let's take our time.

272
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:46,934
- Today...
- Hey.

273
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:50,567
We're young.

274
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:53,467
- We're young.
- We're young.

275
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,900
The average age dropped.

276
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,600
It's nice. This is it.

277
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,433
- The clues are ours today.
- They're ours.

278
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:08,200
- Let's search the rooms as we always do.
- Let's do that.

279
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,333
Here it is.

280
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,400
Yes.

281
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,800
Last week, there was a diary.

282
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,066
There's nothing.

283
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:20,700
- There's something here.
- The times table.

284
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,667
Here. Two times four is eight.

285
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,367
Two times four is eight.

286
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,133
And what do we have here?

287
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,433
There's a part that's highlighted.

288
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,967
"Will our relationship reach my yearning?

289
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,266
Time passes askew."

290
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,633
What?

291
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:59,800
"Will our relationship reach my yearning?
Time passes askew."

292
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:01,333
Look at this.

293
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,066
It says, "Will our relationship reach
my yearning?"

294
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:07,567
Maybe it's about Tae-hyun's commercial.

295
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,133
- No. Hey.
- You don't think so?

296
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:12,467
- JENNIE, let's discard him.
- Se-chan.

297
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:13,567
Why?

298
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:16,433
Hey, you need to get a grip.
I can't believe you.

299
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,200
- Today, the decor is simple.
- Right?

300
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Ninety-nine, ninety-eight...

301
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,500
- Se-chan.
- What is it?

302
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,000
There's another one.

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,433
There's another one.

304
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,066
There are more baskets, right?

305
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,800
Let's discard Jung-ha, Se-chan.

306
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,400
Jung-ha has no talent for deducting.

307
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,734
- He's clumsy, right?
- Yes.

308
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,333
I have him pegged.

309
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,433
JENNIE, we were cheering together
just a moment ago.

310
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:50,700
- I know.
- Discarding him so soon...

311
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,300
Embrace me.

312
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
That's right.

313
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:59,467
Come on in.

314
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,467
- Do you like sandwiches?
- Yes.

315
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,367
Eat a sandwich and get a grip.

316
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,433
Thank you for the food.

317
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:10,300
- It's so painful to choose what to eat.
- I know.

318
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,800
- They're all tasty.
- I know.

319
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,033
You know the recommended sandwiches?

320
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:15,700
I just order one of them.

321
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,967
- It's convenient.
- Yes.

322
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:18,633
- It looks delicious.
- Yes.

323
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:19,633
This is it.

324
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,567
It gives you the best combination.

325
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,033
There's a lot to eat today.

326
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:27,133
I absolutely love sandwiches.

327
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:29,767
It's nice to begin filming
with a hearty breakfast.

328
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:32,233
I like that it's convenient to order.

329
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,767
It's tasty.

330
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,000
In my opinion, we haven't fully grasped

331
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,200
- what's happening today.
- That's right.

332
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,800
Jae-seok, we need to teach
those kiddos a lesson.

333
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,333
- You... What's wrong with you?
-"Kiddos"?

334
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,367
Why do you feel so attacked by the youth?

335
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:54,967
Jae-seok, our team's youngest member
is 47 years old.

336
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,834
Hey.

337
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,900
All of us are a year apart.

338
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,367
Seriously. That's so funny.

339
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:07,367
- Gosh.
- Hey.

340
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:10,233
- It's the end of the century.
- Right?

341
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,567
I just entered my thirties,
and you guys are in your twenties.

342
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:13,633
I'm in my twenties.

343
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,667
- You're right.
- That's right.

344
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,934
Look at the calendar.
It's December of 1999.

345
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,066
- What?
- What is it?

346
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,300
It's the symbol I saw earlier.

347
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,500
What?

348
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,300
You can put the money in here.

349
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:34,000
What's this symbol here?

350
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:39,667
- That symbol was on the dalgona.
- That's right.

351
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,533
Isn't it a cow?
I think those are cow horns. Cow.

352
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,633
What's that symbol?

353
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:48,967
Jae-seok, we have an advantage.

354
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:51,133
- They have no knowledge.
- Not at all.

355
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,033
- They have no knowledge.
- You know,

356
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:55,433
their team leader is Se-chan.

357
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:58,400
- Se-chan has no idea what Y2K is.
- He doesn't have a clue.

358
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:04,300
Still, you know the era better than we do.

359
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,433
What? I guess so.

360
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:09,233
- We were babies.
- You guys were babies.

361
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,834
- I was two years old.
- I was three or four years old.

362
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:14,900
We already received a hint.
The theme is drugs.

363
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,367
I agree that it's drugs, but...

364
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:18,934
Will we have to catch a drug dealer? Or...

365
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:24,467
But we did figure something out. The bull.

366
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:26,734
- The symbol.
- Yes, there was a symbol.

367
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:29,166
The symbol belongs to...

368
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,433
- An organization.
- That's right.

369
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:32,567
An organization.

370
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,700
- It must be a drug cartel's symbol.
- Symbol.

371
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,934
We paid money for the food earlier.

372
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:41,100
- It'll go to them.
- We've become accomplices.

373
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,967
The forks had the same symbol,

374
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,467
so we've become accomplices.

375
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,667
I figured it out.
I think I might be a genius.

376
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:52,800
Someone is trying to rope us
into the drug cartel.

377
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,567
You think it could be Tae-hyun?

378
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:04,567
- In any case--
- You know,

379
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:07,166
JENNIE isn't listening
to anything you say.

380
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,100
She discarded you, Jung-ha.

381
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm sorry, but you should go home
after enjoying the sandwich.

382
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,200
It's so tasty.

383
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,633
"Now" by Fin.K.L.

384
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:22,100
- One ant, yeah, two ants, yeah
- Yeah

385
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,867
- It has been a while since I met Ok.
- I know.

386
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,500
Why are there
so many Fin.K.L-related things?

387
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,834
- There's no S.E.S. Just Fin.K.L.
- It's just Fin.K.L.

388
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:32,367
- You're right.
- Yes.

389
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:33,800
That was a sharp observation.

390
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,867
Is Fin.K.L related to this case?

391
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,567
Good.

392
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:43,000
- What's good about it?
- What's good about it?

393
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,767
What are they doing?

394
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:47,834
What are they doing?

395
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,900
- I think they found something.
- There's something.

396
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,333
- Let's stop eating and look around.
- Hold on.

397
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,767
I should drop by.

398
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:55,100
I think they found something.

399
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,834
They must have something.

400
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:04,867
They're intentionally being loud
so that we'll hear.

401
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:12,200
The hint was always inside the unit.

402
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,900
- Yes, always.
- Without fail.

403
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,367
Listen.

404
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,967
Four times two is eight.
Solve that riddle, Se-chan.

405
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:20,367
- Four times two is eight.
- Yes.

406
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:23,233
- Four and two.
- Eight and two.

407
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:26,633
Se-chan, we have to hide it.
Maybe the other unit doesn't have it.

408
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:32,467
Jae-seok, hello.

409
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,734
- Jae-seok, hello. Welcome.
- Hello.

410
00:22:34,734 --> 00:22:37,367
- JENNIE, why were you surprised?
- What?

411
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:38,800
I was just happy to see you.

412
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,233
- Why were you surprised?
- We were eating. Don't come in.

413
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:43,400
You yelled as if you found something.

414
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,166
- Because the sandwich was so good.
- What?

415
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:53,734
"Will our relationship reach my yearning?
Time passes askew."

416
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:56,900
Jae-seok, you can't just come in like this
and search our unit.

417
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,834
Hey, the door was open.

418
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,400
"Our relationship"? What?

419
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,000
Forget it. I saw the cards already.

420
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,367
You saw the cards?

421
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,967
You were talking
about Song Seung-heon earlier.

422
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:23,333
Me?

423
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:25,667
You know,

424
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,734
she looked at me and went...

425
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,433
"Jae-seok, hello."

426
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,467
What was that?

427
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:35,567
- For now--
- For now,

428
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,900
- let's go. We need to play a game.
- Let's go.

429
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:41,000
I don't have a clue.
We shouldn't have come here.

430
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,567
- Please be my side
- ...be my side

431
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:48,867
Being with them makes me young.

432
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:51,700
- Is it nice and refreshing?
- The team isn't complete without you.

433
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,266
- Really?
- Of course.

434
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,433
Shall I join this team?
That team is too dreary.

435
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,767
- They're middle-aged men.
- Seriously.

436
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:59,767
- Guess what the average age is.
- What is it?

437
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:02,834
- It's 48.
- What?

438
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,900
Breaking news.

439
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,934
...regarding doomsday predictions
and the millennium bug...

440
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:15,166
It's about Y2K.

441
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,567
Drug use among youth has increased.

442
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,667
- What?
- What?

443
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,233
He's a druggie. For goodness' sake.

444
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:25,633
What? It's the symbol I saw earlier.

445
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,767
By the way, what's this?

446
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,066
What's this symbol here?

447
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:30,533
Four times two is eight.

448
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:33,100
"Will our relationship reach my yearning?
Time passes askew."

449
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,033
The hint was always inside the unit.

450
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,533
- Yes, always.
- Without fail.

451
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,333
You should give us something.

452
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,133
- There's nothing.
- Okay.

453
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:47,700
I don't even have a hunch.

454
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,934
What's going on today?

455
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,000
- Is there a spy?
- I really figured it out.

456
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,900
Who's a spy?

457
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,367
Things are chaotic in the apartment.

458
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:58,433
The game you'll play today is...

459
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,600
the Hide-And-Seek of Death.

460
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,000
What is it?

461
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,900
H.D.

462
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,467
-"H.D."? Do you know what it is?
- No.

463
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:08,233
- There'll be an offense and a defense.
- Okay.

464
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:12,600
The defense will have
five minutes to hide.

465
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,100
- You can hide anywhere in either unit.
- Okay.

466
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,433
- Really?
- Either unit?

467
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,700
The time limit is ten minutes.

468
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,667
And the offense

469
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,900
-must link arms when they enter.
- Okay.

470
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,233
Here's the most important rule.

471
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:27,033
Let's say you find a hider.
Then you play a game.

472
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:30,333
When you find one, play Dibidibi Dip.

473
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,900
When you find the second one,
play Cham, Cham, Cham.

474
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,734
Third, the Human Zero Game.

475
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:35,633
One.

476
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,700
If you fail, you must start over.

477
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
- That team will win.
- Good.

478
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,800
Your explanation is spot on today.

479
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,033
I practiced a lot.

480
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:48,633
- JENNIE, did he improve?
- Yes.

481
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,000
- I understood.
- Well done, Woo-il.

482
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,633
I wanted to see you guys every week,

483
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,967
- so I practiced hard.
- That's good.

484
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:58,934
Hiders, please hide.
You have five minutes.

485
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,500
Hold on. Where should I hide?

486
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:03,834
Where should I hide?

487
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,033
Even if you hide...

488
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:08,333
- It's meaningless.
- Hiding is meaningless.

489
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,967
We need to play the game well
and beat them.

490
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:13,200
Still, if we hide well...

491
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,967
Where should I hide?

492
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:18,500
- If they can't find us, we'll buy time.
- Yes. Of course.

493
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,433
It'll be game over.

494
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
Finders,

495
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,300
- please wait out in the hall.
- Okay.

496
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,800
- Can you play Dibidibi Dip?
- Yes.

497
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,433
Then you should play Dibidibi Dip,
and you play Cham, Cham, Cham.

498
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,667
- Do it in the center.
- Yes.

499
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:52,567
Okay.

500
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:54,667
- There's nowhere to hide.
- One...

501
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,133
You can hide in the closet, under the bed...

502
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:59,967
Where should I hide? Where should I hide?

503
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,333
They'll check under the blanket
no matter what.

504
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:03,400
My back hurts.

505
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,734
Can you not see me?

506
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:10,000
They'll never find me.

507
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,400
One, two, three.

508
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,700
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

509
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,734
- Let's go.
- Let's go to unit 406.

510
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:18,800
There's nowhere to hide
other than the closet.

511
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:22,533
What? It's empty.

512
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:27,600
- It's empty. It's the other room.
- I guess so.

513
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,500
- Go.
- Really? Don't you need to check?

514
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,266
Really? Don't you need to check?

515
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:33,000
Let's check over there.

516
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,333
- Come here.
- Jung-ha, come here.

517
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,900
- Come on.
- Come here.

518
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,033
No hiding behind the camera.

519
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,433
Okay. No one is here.

520
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,200
- Let's go.
- No one is in this unit.

521
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,867
- Come on.
- Let's go.

522
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,800
There's no place to hide.

523
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,000
Mr. Producer, please stack the blankets
on top of me.

524
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:10,300
Please cover me completely.

525
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,734
Please cover my face too.

526
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,200
Can you breathe?

527
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:17,433
Can you not see me?

528
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,934
- Let's go.
- Forget the shoes.

529
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:26,633
- Forget your shoes? My goodness.
- Forget your shoes.

530
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,967
- There's one. Okay.
- There's one.

531
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:38,567
- What? What's going on?
- Where is everyone?

532
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:41,500
- What? What's going on?
- Where is everyone?

533
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,834
Are they moving around to avoid us?

534
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:44,367
- No way.
- They can't do that.

535
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:46,500
Is someone in there? That'd be impossible.

536
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,467
- No way. That'd be impossible.
- Come on.

537
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:50,266
- Where are they?
- Where? The restroom?

538
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:51,900
- What? Where are they?
- Come on.

539
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,767
- Where are they?
- Where? The restroom?

540
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:55,767
- What? Where are they?
- Come on.

541
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,633
No hiding behind the cameras.

542
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:59,333
- The curtains.
- What's going on?

543
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,567
Behind the curtains? I can't believe it.

544
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,100
Behind the cameras...

545
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,633
You can't hide behind the cameras.

546
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:06,633
Are they behind the cameras in that unit?

547
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:08,100
This makes no sense.

548
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,266
They disappeared.

549
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:10,333
What's going on?

550
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
You guys are no match for us.

551
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,867
- How fascinating.
- They're holding the cameras.

552
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:17,633
- Seriously.
- That's the only way.

553
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,467
Did they have to go that far?

554
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:23,467
- I mean...
- Someone's here.

555
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:25,233
- Where?
- For goodness' sake.

556
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:26,700
- Oh, my gosh!
- Get up quickly.

557
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:32,066
- Oh, my gosh!
- Get up quickly.

558
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:33,834
- How did you find me?
- Go.

559
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:35,100
Ready, go.

560
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,233
Dibidibi dip.

561
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,967
Dibidibi dip.

562
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:42,100
Dibidibi dip.

563
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,066
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

564
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:46,367
I'm sorry. Let's hurry up.

565
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,166
- Let's hurry up.
- Yes.

566
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,667
- Where are they?
- Hurry.

567
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,800
- Tap me.
- Where are they?

568
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,166
- Link arms.
- My goodness.

569
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,900
- You can't hide behind the cameras.
- My goodness.

570
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,633
- Where are Jae-seok and Tae-hyun?
- Let's check here.

571
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:01,200
- I'm curious too. Still looking?
- Under the rice cooker.

572
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,233
- Still looking?
- Yes.

573
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,400
- Where are they?
- They aren't here.

574
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,867
- Seriously.
- This is insane.

575
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:07,700
It's so fascinating.

576
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:11,000
You know, it makes no sense.

577
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:12,800
It makes no sense.

578
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,667
- It makes no sense.
- The other unit?

579
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,066
- The other unit.
- Let's go.

580
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:17,633
- Let's go.
- Where are they?

581
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,900
- It makes no sense.
- There's nowhere left to look.

582
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,567
Seriously, where did they go?

583
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,633
Seriously, where are they?

584
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:25,533
Where are they?

585
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,533
There's no place left to hide.

586
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:30,600
- There's nowhere left.
- This is annoying.

587
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:34,734
- I don't understand.
- Are they in the boxes?

588
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:38,400
- Are they in the boxes?
- Hey!

589
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:42,400
Where did they go?

590
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,533
It makes no sense.

591
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:47,533
- Why did you open the drawer?
- It makes no sense.

592
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:49,900
These men are insane.

593
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,066
Exactly how do they play
with their children?

594
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,934
- Hold on.
- It makes no sense.

595
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:56,367
- Let's go back.
- Let's go back.

596
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,200
Where are they hiding?

597
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:01,500
Wait, how did they hide so well?

598
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,700
It makes no sense.

599
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,433
They aren't behind the TV.
It can't be this room.

600
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:08,166
- He's here.
- No way!

601
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,533
- He's here.
- No way!

602
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:12,600
Jae-seok!

603
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,500
- He's here.
- No way! Jae-seok!

604
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:20,266
- He fits in there because he's skinny.
- Unbelievable.

605
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:22,467
- Gosh, my back.
- I can't believe you.

606
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:27,533
This spot...

607
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,533
I'm sure they'll open it.

608
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:33,667
Unless you're Yogi Daniel...

609
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:34,867
For goodness' sake.

610
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:44,533
Shut the doors.

611
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,567
- What?
- Cham, Cham, Cham.

612
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,767
- Cham, Cham, Cham?
- Cham, cham, cham.

613
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,567
- Okay.
- Come on.

614
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:56,100
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Okay.

615
00:31:57,467 --> 00:32:00,567
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Okay.

616
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,367
One more left to go. Tae-hyun.

617
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:05,233
- Open everything. He could be anywhere.
- Still looking for Tae-hyun?

618
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,867
He can't be in here.

619
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:10,066
Did you open the thermos?

620
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:11,467
- The thermos?
- I think

621
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:13,233
- we should open it.
- Let's open it.

622
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:15,834
Where is he? Is he inside a thermos?

623
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,600
- Where did Tae-hyun go?
- Seriously.

624
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,166
- He disappeared for real.
- Where did he go?

625
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,633
They won't be able to find me.

626
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,266
Shall we go back to the other unit?

627
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:30,800
- What should we do? Let's go back.
- Five.

628
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,767
- Four. Three.
- He's nowhere to be found.

629
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,600
- He disappeared.
- Two. One.

630
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,834
Where is he?

631
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,200
Hold on. We're going to find him.

632
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,266
Where is he?

633
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:42,266
We won.

634
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:44,867
- Where is Tae-hyun?
- Where did he go?

635
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:47,266
- I bet he's in there. Did you open it?
- Open what?

636
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:49,433
- No way. We were here.
- No way.

637
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,033
- He can't be here.
- Open it.

638
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:53,100
No way.

639
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,100
- My goodness.
- Gosh, you were hiding in there.

640
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,533
How scary.

641
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:02,500
See? You should've opened it.
Why didn't you open it?

642
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,100
He wasn't behind the cameras.

643
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:07,667
It'll be game over.

644
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:12,400
It'll be game over.

645
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:27,900
You can't beat a dad in hide-and-seek.

646
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:31,300
Is this your first time playing
hide-and-seek?

647
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,767
- People don't go that far.
- Yes, they do.

648
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:35,533
- How did you go in there?
- The cabinet...

649
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:39,533
I'm sorry, but you can't beat dads
in hide-and-seek.

650
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:42,000
- I'm flabbergasted.
- Seriously.

651
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,600
Let's switch sides
and play the game again.

652
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,467
Try hard this time.

653
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,100
For goodness' sake.

654
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:54,033
What should I do?

655
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,633
This compartment is smaller.

656
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,800
I'll make it work.

657
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:10,300
They won't find me here.

658
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,767
JENNIE, is this obvious?

659
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:42,800
- What?
- Is this obvious?

660
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:46,934
Will you be okay?
Should I put this over you?

661
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:50,767
Hey, it's too obvious.
They'll find you right away.

662
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:51,900
Really?

663
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,100
I'm doomed.

664
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:18,233
It'll take a long time.
There's no place to hide.

665
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:19,867
They can't hide where we hid.

666
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,300
No, they can't.

667
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:23,633
- People evolve.
- That's ridiculous.

668
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:25,500
People evolve.

669
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,333
- Find them.
- Okay.

670
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:41,400
- Let's go.
- We need to find them quickly.

671
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,900
- Where are they?
- We'll find them in no time.

672
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,200
- Hold on.
- I see you.

673
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,033
- I see those punks.
- I see you.

674
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,600
It'd make sense to open it first.

675
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,133
- They might try to win by hiding.
- That's right.

676
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:58,700
- That's right.
- Right?

677
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,900
- Not here.
- Not here.

678
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,700
- They aren't here. It's too tight.
- Come here.

679
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,633
Okay.

680
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:03,700
Let's go.

681
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,734
- You need to link arms.
- Okay.

682
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,567
I know that you guys are here.

683
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:14,266
- I know that you guys are here.
- Here's one.

684
00:36:14,266 --> 00:36:16,100
I know that you're in this room.

685
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,333
- Someone's there.
- Totally.

686
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,133
- Was it obvious?
- It was very obvious.

687
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,767
- Someone's there.
- Totally.

688
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:22,533
- Was it obvious?
- It was very obvious.

689
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,567
Dibidibi Dip. Go.

690
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:26,033
All right. Dibidibi dip.

691
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:27,467
- Okay.
- Success.

692
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:28,533
Dibidibi dip.

693
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:29,734
- Okay.
- Success.

694
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,233
- Jung-ha.
- His hair.

695
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:33,667
- His hair got messed up.
- Jung-ha is the cutest.

696
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:36,467
Gosh, I lost again. Se-chan.

697
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:38,467
- Jung-ha is the cutest.
- I know.

698
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:40,133
- Here?
- Open it.

699
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:41,667
She didn't go inside.

700
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:44,100
Look under the bed.

701
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,300
- Is she there?
- She's here! Look at her.

702
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,633
JENNIE.

703
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:52,066
What's this?

704
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:54,066
- How did you get in there? Hurry.
- Unbelievable.

705
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:56,800
- JENNIE, how did you get in there?
- My face is sweaty.

706
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,367
- Give her mouth-to-mouth.
- Cham, Cham, Cham.

707
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:03,066
Unbelievable. I almost left.

708
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:04,967
I didn't think you'd open it.

709
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:07,834
- Cham, Cham, Cham. JENNIE.
- Cham, Cham, Cham.

710
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,367
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Okay.

711
00:37:09,367 --> 00:37:10,433
Cham, cham, cham.

712
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,934
- You did it. Next.
- Okay.

713
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:13,934
- Se-chan.
- Se-chan.

714
00:37:13,934 --> 00:37:16,934
- Let's check over here.
- Se-chan.

715
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,433
- Empty.
- In there.

716
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:20,500
- Box.
- Check the box.

717
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,367
- No way. This box?
- Kick it.

718
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,133
- He'd die in here.
- Empty?

719
00:37:24,133 --> 00:37:25,266
It's empty.

720
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,333
Open the fridge. It took them a while.

721
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:35,333
- They moved things.
- Behind the cameramen.

722
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:37,200
Behind the cameramen.

723
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,333
Se-chan hid well.
I can't believe he isn't here.

724
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,166
- Behind here.
- He isn't here.

725
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,667
- Where did Se-chan go?
- Why are you following us?

726
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:46,300
I want to find Se-chan.

727
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:48,433
Let go of me.

728
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,867
Where's Se-chan?

729
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,400
Where did Se-chan go?

730
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,800
I can't believe Se-chan.

731
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,500
You can't go in here, right?

732
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,200
It'd be impossible, Jae-seok.

733
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:09,700
I think he's in the duvets.
Is he not in there?

734
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,066
No.

735
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:15,367
Where did he go?

736
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,667
Where did he hide? Come on out.

737
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:18,900
- Where is he?
- Where?

738
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,834
- He's over there.
- Where?

739
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:22,333
- Where?
- There's another storage closet.

740
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,400
- Where?
- Where?

741
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,500
- Another storage closet.
- Where?

742
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,834
- It's on the other side.
- I see.

743
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:27,734
Where is he?

744
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:29,867
- He was in the storage closet.
- I know.

745
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:32,266
- He's in here.
- He's in there?

746
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,600
- No.
- He's not?

747
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
- Here.
- Where?

748
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,000
- No.
- He's not?

749
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,700
- Here.
- Where?

750
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:42,867
- Here.
- What?

751
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,033
Help me.

752
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:45,700
I searched that spot earlier.

753
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,066
Help me.

754
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:49,133
I searched that spot earlier.

755
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:50,033
No way.

756
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:51,867
- Se-chan.
- I looked over there.

757
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:53,400
- That's where he was.
- You're incredible.

758
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,633
What?

759
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,467
I was determined to win.

760
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,867
I can't get up there.

761
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:11,934
Help me with this.

762
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,633
Hold on.

763
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:15,700
Okay. I'm up.

764
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,533
Give me the boxes. Hold on.

765
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:23,066
Hold on.

766
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,667
I want to win.

767
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,567
Well done.

768
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:37,033
I survived!

769
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,633
You're incredible.

770
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:41,900
I thought about looking behind the boxes.

771
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,200
My goodness.

772
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,867
Youngsters, what do you know
about hide-and-seek?

773
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:49,333
The Yus won.

774
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,000
Yes.

775
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,467
Our efforts were in vain.

776
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,667
Let's go back to our unit.

777
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:57,333
Please go back to your unit.

778
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,200
See you later, youngsters.

779
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,700
Get some rest.

780
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:09,800
I'll kill all of you.

781
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:14,867
I will get you.

782
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,233
All of you need to die.

783
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:26,867
- It's the meal for the winning team.
- What is it?

784
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:28,100
Pork cutlet.

785
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,333
King-sized pork cutlets.

786
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:31,934
They're king-sized pork cutlets.

787
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,700
- Thank you.
- Okay.

788
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,066
What do the Yangs get?

789
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:41,867
They get pork cutlets too,
but they're small.

790
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:43,233
- I see.
- I see.

791
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,533
What's inside?

792
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,734
Dumplings?

793
00:40:47,734 --> 00:40:49,900
- What?
- What?

794
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,433
LOOK IN THE SMALL ROOM
IN UNIT 406

795
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,000
-"Look in the small room."
- Let's eat first.

796
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,367
The small room?

797
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:05,100
- Is this unit 406?
- We need to watch the videotape too.

798
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,000
- Is this unit 406?
- No, unit 407.

799
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,066
This is unit 407?

800
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:11,000
Unit 406. Why does this keep happening?

801
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,867
It's never the unit we're in.

802
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:15,834
- The other unit.
- It's always the other unit.

803
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:18,800
If we go there, they'll suspect us.

804
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:25,500
They cut the pork cutlet for us.

805
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:35,800
He'll come again.

806
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,967
- What?
- My goodness.

807
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:43,667
- What?
- My goodness.

808
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:57,000
- Gosh, shall we watch the videotape?
- Shall we do that?

809
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,500
- Come this way.
- I'll lock the door.

810
00:42:10,066 --> 00:42:11,133
Turn on the TV.

811
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,367
- Here it is.
- This is the Nine O'clock News.

812
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,333
Here's the next story.

813
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:21,266
Over 150 billion won
was revealed to be stolen through fraud.

814
00:42:21,266 --> 00:42:24,300
Due to the biggest case
of fraud in history,

815
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,934
42 people were arrested and charged.

816
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:28,934
Due to the biggest case
of fraud in history...

817
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:30,367
- It wasn't a drug case.
- No.

818
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:31,300
Over 150 billion won?

819
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:33,667
Over 38.4 billion won was stolen.

820
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:35,834
Over 1,500 people were involved.

821
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:38,967
It's the biggest fraud operation
uncovered by the police.

822
00:42:38,967 --> 00:42:41,834
The accused distributed... in the '90s...

823
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:44,767
...and turned into a big group
of fraudsters.

824
00:42:44,767 --> 00:42:48,567
By combining the amounts on the bankbooks
and other materials,

825
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:53,633
we've found that over 150 billion won
was stolen in the loan fraud.

826
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,467
- Is this a real case?
- Over 150 billion won?

827
00:42:57,467 --> 00:43:00,734
Many women in their forties and fifties
have gone missing

828
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:03,100
after suffering from the demands
to pay off the debts.

829
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:07,700
It has led to many family troubles.

830
00:43:08,734 --> 00:43:10,400
What's shocking is

831
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,800
that over 30 high-ranking officials
such as a deputy director,

832
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,333
over ten teachers,
over ten bank employees,

833
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:19,500
and other highly educated individuals
have fallen for such antics.

834
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,100
It has had
widespread social ramifications.

835
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,734
It has had
widespread social ramifications.

836
00:43:25,734 --> 00:43:28,767
- Hold on.
- What?

837
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:30,266
Hey. No way.

838
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:33,867
Perhaps the scattered money
was from fraudulent funds.

839
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,000
- It's money.
- This is incredible!

840
00:43:46,266 --> 00:43:47,700
My goodness.

841
00:43:58,734 --> 00:44:00,266
- Hey.
- What?

842
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:03,433
I noticed something
when we were playing hide-and-seek.

843
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,600
That symbol was on a T-shirt too.

844
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,433
- It's in every room. The bull.
- It's everywhere.

845
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,433
I think it means something.

846
00:44:10,433 --> 00:44:13,233
Does it have to do with a drug cartel?

847
00:44:14,967 --> 00:44:17,433
- The case is about drugs.
- Yes.

848
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:22,600
How strange.

849
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:33,433
Jae-seok.

850
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,367
What is it?

851
00:44:36,367 --> 00:44:39,500
- It isn't even hidden.
- What?

852
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:42,800
This must be the den.

853
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:45,467
Right? Here.

854
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,734
What does the symbol mean?

855
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:51,233
- Na-ra.
- Yes?

856
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:53,900
We should watch the videotape too.

857
00:44:54,467 --> 00:44:57,000
- Right.
- Yes.

858
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,400
This is a case about drugs.

859
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:00,900
You know...

860
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,600
- I'll be honest.
- Okay.

861
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,333
- I'm not the spy today.
- Okay.

862
00:45:07,467 --> 00:45:10,000
- You?
- So I don't even need to watch it.

863
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,967
- Why not?
- Why not?

864
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:13,667
I figured it out
as soon as I entered the other unit.

865
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,834
- What did you figure out?
- The hint in the room.

866
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:18,133
- How?
-"Look in the small room in unit 406."

867
00:45:18,734 --> 00:45:21,467
LOOK IN THE SMALL ROOM
IN UNIT 406

868
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:23,266
- What was there?
- I saw it.

869
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:24,667
- What did you see?
- What did you see?

870
00:45:25,867 --> 00:45:27,300
- What did you see?
- What did you see?

871
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,600
- Jae-seok, hello. Welcome.
- Hello.

872
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,133
- This room...
-"Will our relationship reach"...

873
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:36,033
Why are there so many things?

874
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:46,734
- You saw the notebook earlier too.
- What?

875
00:45:46,734 --> 00:45:49,300
Some sentences were underlined.

876
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,700
- Yes, they were.
- They were underlined.

877
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,133
What were those sentences?

878
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:56,600
What?

879
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,266
What?

880
00:46:00,934 --> 00:46:02,133
Hold on.

881
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,033
Right?

882
00:46:16,467 --> 00:46:18,133
- Hold on.
- What?

883
00:46:21,533 --> 00:46:23,100
Jae-seok, where are you going?

884
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:26,266
- Is he a spy?
- Your guess is spot on.

885
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:28,066
- I don't know. He just left.
- Is he a spy?

886
00:46:28,066 --> 00:46:30,100
- He went without a word.
- He's a spy.

887
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,600
He's a spy.

888
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,433
- Tae-hyun.
- Where is he suddenly going?

889
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:35,533
Where is he going?

890
00:46:37,467 --> 00:46:39,834
Where did Jae-seok go?

891
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,467
- Get out.
- I can't believe you.

892
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,266
- You just casually came in.
- Jae-seok.

893
00:46:46,266 --> 00:46:48,200
Get out. Let us eat in peace.

894
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,066
No, Na-ra. Come here. Go and eat.

895
00:46:50,066 --> 00:46:51,333
- Let me take a peek.
- No.

896
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,133
- Go and eat.
- Is there something?

897
00:46:53,133 --> 00:46:55,000
- Go and eat first.
- Okay.

898
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,367
Go and eat first.

899
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,133
- JENNIE, pork cutlet.
- Na-ra.

900
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:05,233
- Really?
- Yes.

901
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:09,000
- Na-ra, I had a good meal.
- Come on. Doesn't it look tasty?

902
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,800
- JENNIE. Hold on.
- Na-ra. Oh, no.

903
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,633
- Don't you want to eat it?
- No.

904
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:15,033
- Get out.
- I know you want it.

905
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:18,233
- Na-ra, you're too strong.
- Bong-seok.

906
00:47:19,533 --> 00:47:22,467
- Why are you so strong?
- You're too strong.

907
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:24,800
Na-ra, have you been working out?

908
00:47:26,934 --> 00:47:29,667
I can't drag her out. I really can't.

909
00:47:30,233 --> 00:47:32,867
- Na-ra, come on.
- Have a bite.

910
00:47:32,867 --> 00:47:34,934
- Na-ra.
- Have a bite.

911
00:47:34,934 --> 00:47:37,834
Take your time. Go and eat first.

912
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,600
- Come here. Open wide.
- Na-ra is so strong.

913
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,066
- There you go. Open wide.
- Seriously.

914
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:45,767
Come here. Open wide.

915
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:46,667
There you go.

916
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:47,834
Open wide.

917
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:50,233
- Aren't you going to give it to me?
- Eat it.

918
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:51,667
Eat it.

919
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:53,700
Bong-seok fell for the pork cutlet.

920
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:16,600
Tae-hyun was right.

921
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:22,133
Some sentences were underlined.
What were those sentences?

922
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:23,533
OUR RELATIONSHIP

923
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,934
Something about a relationship.

924
00:48:25,934 --> 00:48:27,867
That's right. "Relationship."

925
00:48:27,867 --> 00:48:33,400
- On the wall was the times table.
- The times table.

926
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,200
- Some parts were circled.
- Really?

927
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,300
Go and look.

928
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,834
- And there were hwatu cards, right?
- Yes.

929
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:45,433
I don't know the corresponding numbers.

930
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:49,333
The blue ribbon cards were in a pair.
If I excluded them,

931
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:51,567
one of the cards depicted the rain.

932
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,633
- The hwatu cards have two birds, right?
- Yes.

933
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,633
- Four, two.
- What?

934
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:03,767
- Four, two. What's next?
- Four, two.

935
00:49:03,767 --> 00:49:05,100
Hold on.

936
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,633
- What is it? Four, two.
- What did I say earlier?

937
00:49:07,633 --> 00:49:09,934
- Rain.
- My goodness.

938
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,867
- There was the rain card.
- Yes.

939
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,734
- The words make up "Cult."
- Cult.

940
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:15,800
That's right.

941
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,800
- Is that the symbol of a cult?
- The symbol.

942
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,567
We could hide the clues.

943
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:23,133
But there's no point in hiding them.

944
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:25,433
- They'll figure it out.
- They need to know.

945
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,000
They didn't look, did they?
We can't rip it up.

946
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:34,600
- Four, two, and B.
- Eight.

947
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,900
- Four, two, and B. What could B be?
- Eight.

948
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:45,066
Come here. It's incredible.

949
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,166
Look. Four and two.

950
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:50,934
What if this isn't eight, but B?

951
00:49:50,934 --> 00:49:54,467
- Together, they make up "Cult."
- Cult.

952
00:49:54,467 --> 00:49:55,967
JENNIE.

953
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:00,200
-"PSY" and "Rain" make up the word too.
- Yes.

954
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,533
- We're good.
- We figured it out.

955
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,200
A religious organization
used talk of doomsday

956
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,200
and extorted over 38 billion won
from its followers.

957
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,667
Over 150 billion won
was stolen in the loan fraud.

958
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:36,500
Then on this earth,
you'll see an immense sword.

959
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,166
What's shocking is

960
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:41,567
that over 30 high-ranking officials
such as a deputy director,

961
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:44,100
over ten teachers,
over ten bank employees,

962
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,133
and other highly educated individuals
have fallen for such antics.

963
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:50,400
"When the end of the world comes,
you don't have to repay the loan."

964
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,533
By making the believers stand surety,

965
00:50:52,533 --> 00:50:54,934
the cult leader took out
a loan of 30 billion won.

966
00:50:54,934 --> 00:50:56,900
I realized I had been fooled.

967
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,100
I was so disappointed and devastated
that I tried to commit suicide.

968
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,967
But the cult leader and the spouse

969
00:51:02,967 --> 00:51:06,266
led a luxurious lifestyle
with the believers' money.

970
00:51:15,266 --> 00:51:16,967
- Na-ra, hurry up.
- I'm here.

971
00:51:16,967 --> 00:51:20,033
...and other highly educated individuals
have fallen for such antics.

972
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:22,400
It has had
widespread social ramifications.

973
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,533
Meanwhile, the mastermind
of the biggest fraud in the 20th century,

974
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:28,967
- "A", ran away from the police.
-"A".

975
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:32,734
Meanwhile, the mastermind
of the biggest fraud in the 20th century,

976
00:51:32,734 --> 00:51:34,600
"A", ran away from the police.

977
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,400
"A's" whereabouts are unknown.

978
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,834
We await the civilians' tips.

979
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:42,166
We await the civilians' tips.

980
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:43,533
- Look.
- What?

981
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,300
"A" is the spy.

982
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,667
Is there a spy?

983
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:53,467
- That means there is a spy.
- Of course.

984
00:52:01,934 --> 00:52:05,500
-"Has excellent interpersonal skills."
-"Has excellent interpersonal skills."

985
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,834
"Has excellent interpersonal skills."

986
00:52:10,834 --> 00:52:11,867
No?

987
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:14,033
- I don't know.
- I saw the notebook too.

988
00:52:14,033 --> 00:52:15,400
In any case-- Really?

989
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,100
Yes, I saw the notebook too.

990
00:52:18,734 --> 00:52:20,000
- Na-ra.
- Yes?

991
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,266
It's him. Leave him be for three hours.

992
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:25,633
It says here that "A"
has excellent interpersonal skills.

993
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:27,834
It's Jae-seok.

994
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:30,467
It's Jae-seok.

995
00:52:31,867 --> 00:52:33,934
- Excellent interpersonal skills.
- Gosh.

996
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:36,333
- He drives me crazy.
- That's all we need to know.

997
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:37,467
Na-ra.

998
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:39,734
I can't believe him.

999
00:52:39,734 --> 00:52:40,767
Just watch.

1000
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:43,200
Why would you say that in front of me?

1001
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,066
I can't believe you.

1002
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:48,533
- Let's feign ignorance for three hours.
- We don't know anything.

1003
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:50,133
- All right.
- For goodness' sake.

1004
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,500
Who do you suspect?

1005
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,633
- Who do I suspect?
- Yes.

1006
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:02,567
Firstly, I suspect Jae-seok.

1007
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:06,000
It's suspicious that he showed up late.

1008
00:53:07,433 --> 00:53:09,734
- Perhaps he did something beforehand.
- Yes.

1009
00:53:09,734 --> 00:53:11,667
Perhaps he received a mission beforehand.

1010
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:14,600
- That's right.
- However, he's too simple-minded.

1011
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,934
How about you, JENNIE?

1012
00:53:15,934 --> 00:53:17,200
- As for me...
- Okay.

1013
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,200
Jae-seok.

1014
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:24,734
- I don't know if I can trust him.
- I know.

1015
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,166
- On that team, the spy is Jae-seok.
- Yes.

1016
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:29,834
On this team,
I'm a bit suspicious of JENNIE.

1017
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,600
Your outfit looks similar to the symbol.

1018
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,300
Isn't that right?
A white symbol against a dark background.

1019
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,767
- No.
- It's too simple, right?

1020
00:53:39,767 --> 00:53:42,567
Se-chan, the shape of your mustache
resembles the symbol.

1021
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:45,367
- It looks like the bull.
- No way.

1022
00:53:45,367 --> 00:53:48,133
If you see the symbol upside down,
it becomes a mustache.

1023
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:51,467
- I see the resemblance.
- Don't be absurd.

1024
00:53:51,467 --> 00:53:54,233
If we suspect each other,
our feelings will get hurt.

1025
00:53:54,233 --> 00:53:57,567
Let's not suspect things like
earrings and makeup.

1026
00:53:58,133 --> 00:54:01,433
Wouldn't "A" have a tattoo
on his or her body?

1027
00:54:01,433 --> 00:54:03,834
It really isn't me.

1028
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:07,433
- Wait. You aren't taking off your clothes.
- I'm sweating.

1029
00:54:07,433 --> 00:54:09,934
- You stopped there.
- You stopped there.

1030
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:12,800
You're out of your mind.

1031
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,900
- Let's go outside. Be careful, JENNIE.
- Okay?

1032
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:19,400
All of you are crazy.

1033
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,500
Let's go out.

1034
00:54:22,934 --> 00:54:24,166
Okay?

1035
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,567
None of you are in your right mind.

1036
00:54:31,734 --> 00:54:34,934
None of you are in your right mind.

1037
00:54:34,934 --> 00:54:36,066
Se-chan.

1038
00:54:36,867 --> 00:54:40,467
All of you should be ruined!

1039
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:46,867
All of you are insane.

1040
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,500
- You're doing this again. Come here.
- Let go of me.

1041
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,033
Why are you behaving this way here?
Let's go.

1042
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:55,600
- Let go of me.
- We're sorry. We'll take him with us.

1043
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,600
- Let go.
- Come on.

1044
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,633
- Isn't he the resident representative?
- Yes.

1045
00:55:01,633 --> 00:55:03,233
Wasn't he making dalgona earlier?

1046
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,600
Why did he cause a ruckus here?

1047
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,400
Why did he say people are insane?

1048
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,000
Who knows?

1049
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,033
Is he the druggie from earlier?

1050
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:15,567
Your acting was awkward.

1051
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:18,467
- Your tone was suspicious.
- Come on.

1052
00:55:18,467 --> 00:55:19,500
We're veterans.

1053
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,433
- Your tone was suspicious.
- Come on.

1054
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:23,400
We're veterans.

1055
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
We promised to feign ignorance
for three hours.

1056
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,734
- I--
- Act like you don't know.

1057
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:31,100
Why is your nose runny?

1058
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,066
- Why is your nose runny?
- Tae-hyun thinks it's me.

1059
00:55:34,066 --> 00:55:37,000
- You're stressed out.
- I'm so stressed out.

1060
00:55:44,066 --> 00:55:46,367
- Did you find anything?
- You startled me.

1061
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:48,767
- Did you find anything?
- We were eating pork cutlets.

1062
00:55:48,767 --> 00:55:49,900
We're going to eat first.

1063
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,066
There's nothing. It's meaningless.

1064
00:55:52,633 --> 00:55:55,300
- So you searched the place. You did.
- What?

1065
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,166
- No, there's nothing.
- Is there something?

1066
00:55:57,166 --> 00:56:01,200
Na-ra, the millennial and Gen Zers
want to have a private meeting.

1067
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,133
I'm sorry, but the DMZ needs to leave.

1068
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:08,300
Let us have a private meeting.
DMZ, please leave.

1069
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,433
You can throw that grenade over there.

1070
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:12,400
- Hurry up.
- Bang, bang.

1071
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,600
Please leave.

1072
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,400
The millennial and Gen Zers
will have a meeting.

1073
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,633
I can't believe he called me DMZ.

1074
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,533
- I got goosebumps.
- Why?

1075
00:56:23,533 --> 00:56:25,767
- I think Na-ra is the spy.
- Why?

1076
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:30,500
Na-ra always tells me,
"Jung-ha, let's do this together."

1077
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,433
But she hasn't said it once to me today.

1078
00:56:33,133 --> 00:56:36,567
- I forgot about that.
- There's this.

1079
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:40,400
Earlier, I was surprised by her strength.

1080
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:45,367
I can't drag her out. I really can't.

1081
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Na-ra.

1082
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,066
- My arm almost got pulled out.
- Right?

1083
00:56:51,066 --> 00:56:53,333
- She's never done that before.
- She never used her strength.

1084
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,900
Right. That was the first time.

1085
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,533
They keep coming to our unit.
We should go to them.

1086
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,133
Let's go and get some pork cutlets.

1087
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:05,633
- That's right.
- Pork cutlets.

1088
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:06,600
Pork cutlets.

1089
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,300
- They're eating quietly by themselves.
- Let's go and eat pork cutlets.

1090
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,900
Someone took my shoe.

1091
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:15,066
Where did your shoe go?

1092
00:57:15,066 --> 00:57:17,400
I don't know. Someone stole it.

1093
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,700
The spy.

1094
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,767
- Jae-seok.
- What?

1095
00:57:21,767 --> 00:57:23,800
- Where did they go?
- Where did they go?

1096
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,133
What? Are they hiding again?

1097
00:57:27,133 --> 00:57:29,934
- Stop it already.
- I don't want to look for them.

1098
00:57:29,934 --> 00:57:32,266
- Where did they go?
- Seriously.

1099
00:57:32,266 --> 00:57:33,333
Where did they go?

1100
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:34,800
The pork cutlets look delicious.

1101
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,800
I guess they received a hint
and went somewhere.

1102
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:42,266
- Is it the sixth floor?
- Yes, it's unit 613.

1103
00:57:42,266 --> 00:57:43,600
Okay.

1104
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,233
I'm sharing this for you guys.

1105
00:57:47,233 --> 00:57:50,100
- It's something you ought to do.
- We're a team.

1106
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,200
It was delivered to the three of us.

1107
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,000
You guys almost lost the key to me.

1108
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,967
I won't give things to you from now on.

1109
00:57:56,967 --> 00:57:58,433
Don't be absurd. It's up to me.

1110
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,600
- Is this the floor?
- Everyone, come to unit 613.

1111
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:11,533
Unit 613.

1112
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:13,767
There it is.

1113
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,900
- See? It's open.
- You're right.

1114
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,400
It wasn't before. Open it.

1115
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,767
- I'm scared.
- I'm scared.

1116
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,767
- Hey! You sons of bitches!
- What?

1117
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,433
All of you should be ruined!

1118
00:58:27,433 --> 00:58:28,333
Let go of me.

1119
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:29,800
Why are you behaving this way here?

1120
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,066
- Let's go.
- We're sorry.

1121
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:47,000
It's open.

1122
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,100
What?

1123
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,133
All right.

1124
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,200
This is the cult leader, "A's"--

1125
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,033
Hey. "Missing person."

1126
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,166
MISSING PERSON

1127
00:59:33,934 --> 00:59:35,934
She went missing
after she left for school.

1128
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:38,600
WENT MISSING
AFTER LEAVING FOR SCHOOL

1129
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,934
It's a woman.

1130
00:59:43,467 --> 00:59:44,900
Was there a videotape?

1131
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,533
- You're good at finding things.
- Turn on the TV.

1132
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:48,600
It was here.

1133
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,400
Play.

1134
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,633
- Play.
- The year 1999.

1135
01:00:09,266 --> 01:00:11,934
The year 1999.

1136
01:00:11,934 --> 01:00:14,967
- The apocalypse is coming.
- We guessed correctly.

1137
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:16,600
That's right.

1138
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,100
At the end of the world,
one thing will save us.

1139
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,433
I see the symbol.
The resident representative?

1140
01:00:22,433 --> 01:00:25,734
And that is sincere faith.

1141
01:00:25,734 --> 01:00:27,533
- It's a cult.
- She was the tteokbokki vendor.

1142
01:00:27,533 --> 01:00:30,100
That's right. All the residents
we saw earlier are there.

1143
01:00:30,967 --> 01:00:34,000
The sanctuary we have built with faith

1144
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,333
and the base for our afterlife,
Woosang Apartment.

1145
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:40,033
- This is the den.
- When the apocalypse comes

1146
01:00:40,033 --> 01:00:42,266
in the new millennium,

1147
01:00:42,266 --> 01:00:45,333
- the residents will be saved.
- We saw them earlier.

1148
01:00:46,033 --> 01:00:50,600
Give your worldly greed and fortunes
to the savior

1149
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,233
and show your faith.

1150
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:54,734
Believe.

1151
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,767
Only those who believe will be saved.

1152
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,500
- We believe in you.
- We believe in you.

1153
01:01:03,066 --> 01:01:05,767
There was the creator
at the beginning of time.

1154
01:01:05,767 --> 01:01:08,900
I'm the incarnation of the creator.

1155
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,133
I'll save you.

1156
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:16,033
Praise Daehan Woosang Cult
Jinrihoe Church.

1157
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:20,467
DAEHAN WOOSANG CULT
JINRIHOE CHURCH

1158
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:28,533
I got goosebumps.

1159
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,066
All the residents are cult followers.

1160
01:01:31,867 --> 01:01:33,700
- Woosang.
- Woosang Apartment.

1161
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,000
The entire apartment
is a stronghold of cult followers.

1162
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,934
The cult leader and the spouse
claimed that a sanctuary must be built

1163
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:46,867
to survive the apocalypse

1164
01:01:46,867 --> 01:01:48,700
and forced the followers to pay
large offerings.

1165
01:01:49,266 --> 01:01:50,867
On a 300,000 square meter property,

1166
01:01:50,867 --> 01:01:54,367
they even built an apartment
for the followers.

1167
01:02:06,133 --> 01:02:08,934
What does that make
the owner of this unit?

1168
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:11,467
Hold on. Let's look around the place.

1169
01:02:12,467 --> 01:02:16,667
Jae-seok, she must be that man's daughter.

1170
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,867
Right. I bet she got dragged to a cult.
Right?

1171
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:25,900
The liquor bottles tell me

1172
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,233
- that this is the man's room.
- Yes.

1173
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:36,700
He drank a lot. He must've been tormented.

1174
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:39,500
- What are you doing?
- Gosh, you startled me.

1175
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,567
- What are you doing?
- You startled me.

1176
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:44,300
- What are you doing?
- Gosh, you startled me.

1177
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,367
You startled me.

1178
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,700
- Hey! You startled me.
- You practically jumped.

1179
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,867
I'm disappointed.

1180
01:02:51,867 --> 01:02:53,633
- We thought you were eating.
- I know.

1181
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:54,867
You startled me.

1182
01:02:54,867 --> 01:02:58,500
- It's that man's house.
- Right. It's that man's house.

1183
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,433
For goodness' sake.

1184
01:03:00,433 --> 01:03:01,700
You startled me.

1185
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,734
- Here.
- She's missing.

1186
01:03:06,266 --> 01:03:07,333
What is it?

1187
01:03:08,734 --> 01:03:10,633
- Right?
- Leave them be.

1188
01:03:13,033 --> 01:03:16,100
They're still searching the place.

1189
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,066
- Jae-seok.
- There's nothing.

1190
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:22,967
We're searching too.

1191
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:35,400
Why am I on this bottle?

1192
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,533
Look at this.

1193
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:45,400
- It wasn't there.
- No?

1194
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,467
The tape.

1195
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:51,100
What is it?

1196
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:54,200
- Hold on.
- What?

1197
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,700
Gather around.

1198
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,000
- Guys.
- It's Jae-seok.

1199
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,633
- He has something.
- You're it if you keep quiet.

1200
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:04,233
- Tae-hyun, he's it if he doesn't share.
- Guys, he has a Book of Prophecies.

1201
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:05,834
- What?
- Let's circle him.

1202
01:04:05,834 --> 01:04:08,667
It isn't like that. I just found it.

1203
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,000
You startled me.

1204
01:04:19,033 --> 01:04:20,767
You startled me.

1205
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,500
BOOK OF PROPHECIES

1206
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:30,133
It seems like you went through the book.
Isn't that right?

1207
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:33,400
- Then you found a crucial clue.
- A crucial clue.

1208
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,567
- A crucial clue. Let's see it.
- We found it.

1209
01:04:36,567 --> 01:04:40,100
- What is it?
- I just realized something.

1210
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:43,300
Someone is carrying out these things.

1211
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,667
- A mission?
- A mission.

1212
01:04:44,667 --> 01:04:46,300
- Is there a mission?
- Let's see.

1213
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,200
Jae-seok, this is...

1214
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,066
- What is it?
- JENNIE.

1215
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:50,667
- I got goosebumps.
- Hold on.

1216
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:52,400
What did it say? Hold on.

1217
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,500
- Hold on.
- Wait.

1218
01:04:58,166 --> 01:05:01,166
Some items are crossed out.
It means they've been completed.

1219
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,967
-"Jae-seok will hug Jung-ha."
-"...hug Jung-ha."

1220
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:06,767
-"Tae-hyun will cry."
-"...cry."

1221
01:05:06,767 --> 01:05:08,500
-"Se-chan will lose a shoe."
- I did.

1222
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,266
- You lost a shoe.
- Where is it?

1223
01:05:10,266 --> 01:05:11,800
Where did your shoes go?

1224
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,400
I don't know. Someone stole them.

1225
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,500
-"Na-ra will snap a group photo."
-"...a group photo."

1226
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,834
"JENNIE will dance."

1227
01:05:17,834 --> 01:05:21,400
-"Jung-ha will get stains on his clothes."
-"...stains on his clothes."

1228
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,967
- Some items are crossed out.
- Hey, his clothes are stained.

1229
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,667
- Come here. What's that?
- Where?

1230
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:27,166
When did it happen?

1231
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:29,834
- Someone did it.
- Hey.

1232
01:05:29,834 --> 01:05:31,500
"Once all the predictions come true,

1233
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,867
the day the cult leader talked about
will come."

1234
01:05:33,867 --> 01:05:35,166
I got chills.

1235
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,200
- Nonsense.
- I know.

1236
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,066
- Na-ra, what's yours?
- A group photo.

1237
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:42,367
- A group photo.
- I haven't taken it yet.

1238
01:05:42,367 --> 01:05:46,400
It's someone who knows our habits well.

1239
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,367
I always take group photos.

1240
01:05:49,367 --> 01:05:52,934
Three seconds. One, two, three.

1241
01:05:56,533 --> 01:05:59,467
JENNIE is someone who dances a lot.

1242
01:05:59,467 --> 01:06:00,600
That's right.

1243
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:04,867
L-O-V-E-L-E-E

1244
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:10,567
It's someone who knows our habits well.

1245
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,066
I don't lose my shoes every day.

1246
01:06:14,066 --> 01:06:16,000
I don't stain my clothes every day.

1247
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,133
- Jae-seok hugs the members after filming.
- Right.

1248
01:06:18,133 --> 01:06:19,467
1. JAE-SEOK WILL HUG JUNG-HA

1249
01:06:19,467 --> 01:06:21,100
- He doesn't do it suddenly.
- No.

1250
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:24,166
While Tae-hyun cries a lot,
he doesn't cry while he's sober.

1251
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:25,367
- So I'm the problem, right?
- Yes.

1252
01:06:25,367 --> 01:06:26,900
2. TAE-HYUN WILL CRY

1253
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,867
- What's yours?
- How will you make me cry?

1254
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:33,233
How will you make me cry?

1255
01:06:33,233 --> 01:06:35,700
You're the spy.
You know that you won't cry.

1256
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,433
- Maybe he'll cry when he's alone.
- Right.

1257
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,066
We can't complete these missions perfectly

1258
01:06:41,066 --> 01:06:43,533
- without Tae-hyun.
- That's right.

1259
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,433
Let's say
all the other missions get completed.

1260
01:06:48,433 --> 01:06:51,166
- Suddenly, Tae-hyun cries.
- That's right.

1261
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:52,700
- Gosh, I need that role.
- Tae-hyun.

1262
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:56,033
- You'll be the main character.
- It would be so cool.

1263
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,200
- Gosh, I need that role.
- Tae-hyun.

1264
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,600
You'll be the main character.

1265
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:06,633
- Seriously.
- Tae-hyun, I told you.

1266
01:07:06,633 --> 01:07:08,400
Objectively speaking,

1267
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:14,200
the only member who can complete
all of these missions perfectly

1268
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,500
is you.

1269
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,333
Do you want me to cry?

1270
01:07:19,767 --> 01:07:23,834
- For goodness' sake.
- I think it depends on me.

1271
01:07:23,834 --> 01:07:26,133
Do you want me to cry?

1272
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:33,133
Jae-seok, you're in the palm of his hand.

1273
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,300
Tae-hyun is toying with Jae-seok.

1274
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,934
- He loosens and tightens his grip.
- I can't believe him.

1275
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,633
- I have an announcement.
- It's an announcement.

1276
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,266
An emergency resident meeting
will take place.

1277
01:07:53,266 --> 01:07:56,800
I ask that every resident come

1278
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,266
to the Senior Center.

1279
01:08:00,266 --> 01:08:01,900
- Okay.
- All right.

1280
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,033
Okay.

1281
01:08:05,834 --> 01:08:07,767
My goodness.

1282
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:15,967
What?

1283
01:08:17,066 --> 01:08:19,567
What? What's this?

1284
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:22,900
Why are these symbols everywhere?

1285
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,667
I'm scared.

1286
01:08:44,266 --> 01:08:45,233
The floor too.

1287
01:08:45,233 --> 01:08:46,633
- Is this our unit?
- So suddenly.

1288
01:08:46,633 --> 01:08:48,900
Where did these symbols come from?

1289
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,033
What's going on?

1290
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:01,934
Jae-seok, I'm still watching you.

1291
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:04,433
I'm still watching you too.

1292
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:08,600
Why are you and Jung-ha whispering
so much today?

1293
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,233
Here's what I think.

1294
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:13,667
Had I been on your team,
I would've seen right through your lies.

1295
01:09:13,667 --> 01:09:16,233
That must be why
the production crew separated us.

1296
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:18,567
- Sharp, right?
- Last week,

1297
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:20,166
I became very flustered

1298
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:23,767
when you said that you were from Bundang.

1299
01:09:23,767 --> 01:09:26,033
So I'm keeping an eye on you today.

1300
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:27,600
- Really?
- Yes.

1301
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,467
- I like it.
- And today...

1302
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:33,433
- Why did you bring that?
- You look cool.

1303
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,867
You look cool.

1304
01:09:37,266 --> 01:09:40,400
- I don't look half bad.
- It's a nice photo. I like it.

1305
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,100
- I don't look half bad.
- Doesn't he look cool?

1306
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:45,100
Na-ra, why are you carrying
that photo so suddenly?

1307
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,266
- Are you carrying the cult leader's photo?
- Right now,

1308
01:09:48,266 --> 01:09:49,834
Na-ra is under suspicion.

1309
01:09:49,834 --> 01:09:52,633
- That came out of nowhere.
- Yes, the public sentiment is bad.

1310
01:09:52,633 --> 01:09:56,100
The public sentiment about you is bad.

1311
01:09:57,233 --> 01:10:01,166
Am I being ostracized?
I don't know anything.

1312
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,133
- It isn't you, is it?
- It really isn't me.

1313
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,734
It really isn't me.

1314
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,500
I'm a terrible liar.

1315
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:09,767
No way.

1316
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,433
I thought you were a terrible liar.

1317
01:10:12,433 --> 01:10:14,400
- Did I do well last week?
- Yes.

1318
01:10:15,033 --> 01:10:17,233
Jae-seok was hiding, so it wasn't him.

1319
01:10:17,233 --> 01:10:18,800
- Tae-hyun...
- Hey.

1320
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,000
- A cult leader...
- Okay.

1321
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,333
...would naturally have an underling.

1322
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:25,800
Gosh, I don't know
what to do with that punk.

1323
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:29,400
He tires me out so much.

1324
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,266
You shouldn't narrow things down already.

1325
01:10:33,266 --> 01:10:34,967
- I should keep things open.
- Yes.

1326
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:37,200
- Like pruning.
- We're a duo.

1327
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,100
A duo.

1328
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,300
- In another mission--
- What?

1329
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,767
- What?
- Which game will it be?

1330
01:10:42,767 --> 01:10:43,900
Hold on.

1331
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,467
What?

1332
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,233
Hold on.

1333
01:10:54,433 --> 01:10:55,633
Hold on.

1334
01:10:58,166 --> 01:10:59,633
Don't trust anyone.

1335
01:10:59,633 --> 01:11:03,000
You mustn't get fooled.

1336
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,100
Jae-seok.

1337
01:11:05,033 --> 01:11:07,266
- Mister, be careful.
- Be careful.

1338
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,967
- Mister, be careful.
- Be careful.

1339
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,834
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

1340
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:17,567
- Be careful.
- You mustn't get fooled.

1341
01:11:18,633 --> 01:11:20,867
- This is scary.
- But his acting is incredible.

1342
01:11:20,867 --> 01:11:22,934
- It's so scary.
- Did he fall down for real just now?

1343
01:11:22,934 --> 01:11:26,834
- To be honest...
- He lost his balance, right?

1344
01:11:26,834 --> 01:11:28,200
I think he lost his balance.

1345
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,400
I thought he was turning into a zombie.

1346
01:11:30,967 --> 01:11:33,266
He's such a great actor.

1347
01:11:33,266 --> 01:11:35,667
He startled me.

1348
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:37,533
He told us not to trust anyone.

1349
01:11:37,533 --> 01:11:38,934
He kept saying that.

1350
01:11:38,934 --> 01:11:42,100
- It means we shouldn't trust each other.
- Not even the team.

1351
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,934
- I don't trust anyone.
- It has always been that way.

1352
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,734
We don't trust anyone.

1353
01:11:50,433 --> 01:11:51,600
It's time to play a game.

1354
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,934
- I trust no one.
- I trust no one.

1355
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:55,734
Let's not trust anyone.

1356
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,700
I'm so exhausted today
because of Tae-hyun.

1357
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:04,500
- In the restroom, he kept...
- It's you, right?

1358
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,500
No. He kept going,
"I'll help you. Don't worry."

1359
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,200
Gosh, that punk.

1360
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,266
He drains my energy.

1361
01:12:12,967 --> 01:12:16,066
We gathered around
at a different place today.

1362
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:19,166
- I'll help you today.
- For goodness' sake.

1363
01:12:19,867 --> 01:12:21,200
Don't you think you're too into character?

1364
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,066
He pesters me so much.

1365
01:12:23,734 --> 01:12:25,500
- You're his target.
- For goodness' sake.

1366
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,600
Give me the Book of Prophecies.

1367
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,066
- This? Why?
- Yes.

1368
01:12:30,066 --> 01:12:32,900
- It's okay. We know the items.
- We missed something.

1369
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,567
- What?
- What?

1370
01:12:34,567 --> 01:12:36,400
No way.

1371
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,333
Did someone carry out a mission?

1372
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:40,767
What?

1373
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:43,300
See what he crossed out.

1374
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,767
- What?
- Whose is it?

1375
01:12:44,767 --> 01:12:47,000
"Jae-seok will hug Jung-ha."

1376
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:50,700
1. JAE-SEOK WILL HUG JUNG-HA

1377
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:54,500
- I haven't been hugged.
- I didn't do it.

1378
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,233
- Jae-seok wouldn't do it openly. No way.
- I haven't been hugged.

1379
01:12:58,233 --> 01:13:02,400
We forgot to cross it out
when Jae-seok hugged him,

1380
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,667
so we did it just now.

1381
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:05,600
- You hugged him.
- When did I do that?

1382
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,567
Just now?

1383
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:09,233
Did you hug him when he fell down?

1384
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:11,934
I never did that. When did I hug Jung-ha?

1385
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:17,100
In any case, it won't be complete...

1386
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,900
- unless I take a photo.
- That's right.

1387
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,967
- Tae-hyun has to cry.
- He has to cry.

1388
01:13:20,967 --> 01:13:22,700
- I...
- It's as I said earlier.

1389
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,233
When it comes to completing
all of the missions,

1390
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:27,000
crying is crucial.

1391
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,066
No one can force Tae-hyun to cry.

1392
01:13:29,066 --> 01:13:30,066
Instead of that mission...

1393
01:13:30,066 --> 01:13:32,233
He just needs to cry.

1394
01:13:35,567 --> 01:13:38,100
The game we'll play is...

1395
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,834
the Tingting Tangtang Up to 12 Frying Pan.

1396
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:43,467
- What's that?
- Up to 12?

1397
01:13:43,467 --> 01:13:46,033
Each team will decide on a category.

1398
01:13:46,033 --> 01:13:49,300
For example, it could be
food or country names.

1399
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,300
Let's say Jung-ha says, "Kimchi stew,"

1400
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,000
JENNIE says, "Doenjang stew,"
and Se-chan says, "Spicy pork."

1401
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,967
- If it's 11 kimchi stew...
- Then what?

1402
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:02,100
Kimchi stew, kimchi stew.

1403
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,133
- Kimchi stew, kimchi stew, kimchi stew.
- That's how it goes.

1404
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,567
My goodness.

1405
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:09,367
We'll win.

1406
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:10,700
Okay. We'll win.

1407
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:13,033
- We'll win.
- We'll win.

1408
01:14:15,066 --> 01:14:17,533
Now, I'll decide on the category.

1409
01:14:17,533 --> 01:14:19,500
- For the Yangs, it's food.
- Thank you.

1410
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,667
- For the Yus, it's animals.
- Animals.

1411
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:25,800
- Food is easier.
- You can look things up on the Internet

1412
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,800
to come up with a difficult name.

1413
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,800
We pick food items for them.

1414
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,333
With four syllables?

1415
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,500
Food.

1416
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,934
There are many endangered animals.

1417
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:37,834
Jae-seok, there are
many endangered animals.

1418
01:14:37,834 --> 01:14:39,000
That little...

1419
01:14:39,567 --> 01:14:43,200
- Let's hear it.
- Let's choose the animals that suit them.

1420
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,667
- I have a suggestion for Jae-seok.
- What? Nutria?

1421
01:14:45,667 --> 01:14:47,266
Naked mole-rat.

1422
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,734
- Naked mole-rat?
- That punk.

1423
01:14:49,734 --> 01:14:51,467
Naked mole-rat.

1424
01:14:52,233 --> 01:14:53,800
- Naked mole-rat?
- That punk.

1425
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,667
Naked mole, two.

1426
01:14:55,667 --> 01:14:57,066
Naked mole, four.

1427
01:14:57,066 --> 01:14:58,934
- Naked mole-rat.
- It's an actual animal.

1428
01:14:58,934 --> 01:15:00,233
- Mole-rat.
- Add "rat" too.

1429
01:15:00,233 --> 01:15:01,834
Such an animal actually exists.

1430
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:03,433
I can't believe Jung-ha.

1431
01:15:03,433 --> 01:15:05,900
Naked mole-rats have teeth like yours.

1432
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:07,667
- Naked mole-rat then?
- Yes.

1433
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:09,333
- Okay.
- Naked mole-rat.

1434
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:10,800
- Naked mole-rat.
- Yes.

1435
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,834
- How about me?
- Let's pick a cute one.

1436
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:14,600
- Seal.
- Seal.

1437
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,000
- Seal.
- Seal, seal,

1438
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,467
- seal, seal.
- It's hard.

1439
01:15:17,467 --> 01:15:18,934
Fennec fox, fennec fox.

1440
01:15:18,934 --> 01:15:21,000
- It's an easy one.
- Yes.

1441
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,133
Let's pick big chestnut bread.

1442
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,533
- It's hard to pronounce.
- Big chestnut bread.

1443
01:15:26,533 --> 01:15:27,934
Big chestnut bread, 12.

1444
01:15:27,934 --> 01:15:31,233
Big chestnut bread, big chestnut bread.

1445
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:34,000
- That won't do.
- Mussel soup.

1446
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,867
- Mussel soup, mussel soup.
- Mussel, mussel.

1447
01:15:35,867 --> 01:15:37,367
- Se-chan is mussel.
- Mussel.

1448
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:39,133
- Se-chan.
- Mussel, mussel. It's easy.

1449
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:42,133
- JENNIE is boo paht pong karee.
- Boo paht pong karee.

1450
01:15:42,133 --> 01:15:43,567
- Big chestnut bread.
- Big chestnut bread.

1451
01:15:43,567 --> 01:15:44,467
Big chestnut bread.

1452
01:15:44,467 --> 01:15:47,300
- Okay. All set.
- This is bad. Big chestnut bread.

1453
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,834
I can't do it.

1454
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,900
It's game over.

1455
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,200
Let's begin.

1456
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,000
I'm suddenly nervous.

1457
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,867
Let's begin. Ready, go.

1458
01:15:56,867 --> 01:15:59,633
Ting, ting, ting, ting,
tang, tang, tang, tang.

1459
01:15:59,633 --> 01:16:03,033
- Tingting Tangtang Up to 12 Frying Pan.
- Tingting Tangtang Up to 12 Frying Pan.

1460
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,433
Big chestnut bread, 12.

1461
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:09,767
Big chestnut bread.

1462
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:12,200
Big chestnut bread.

1463
01:16:13,233 --> 01:16:14,467
Big chestnut bread.

1464
01:16:14,467 --> 01:16:15,767
Mussel, 12.

1465
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,633
Mussel, 12.

1466
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,600
Gosh, Se-chan.

1467
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,667
I'm sorry.

1468
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,000
Gosh, Se-chan.

1469
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:27,967
I'm sorry.

1470
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,133
- Se-chan.
- I'm sorry.

1471
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,000
- We can't lose this game.
- I'm sorry.

1472
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,400
I messed up.

1473
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,667
- Thank you.
- Hey.

1474
01:16:40,667 --> 01:16:43,300
- Okay.
- You looked so stupid just now.

1475
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,166
- Are you a spy?
- I'm sorry.

1476
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:47,567
- No.
- It's you, right?

1477
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:50,000
I thought it was perfect.
Why did I say, "Mussel"?

1478
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,533
Maybe because he looks like a mussel.

1479
01:16:51,533 --> 01:16:54,100
- He looked at me and said, "Mussel."
- I can't believe it.

1480
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,834
- It was my attack.
- It's hard.

1481
01:16:55,834 --> 01:16:57,433
Let's resume.

1482
01:16:57,433 --> 01:16:59,166
- Okay.
- We're starting.

1483
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:02,333
- Okay. Naked mole-rat.
- Go.

1484
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:03,767
- Ready, go.
- Ready, go.

1485
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:06,233
Ting, ting, ting, ting,
tang, tang, tang, tang.

01:17:09,867 --> 01:17:11,133
Naked mole-rat, 12.

01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,266
Naked mole-rat, 12.

1489
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:17,033
Naked mole.

1490
01:17:17,033 --> 01:17:18,934
- Naked?
- No.

1491
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:20,667
Naked mole-rat.

1492
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:21,834
No.

1493
01:17:22,667 --> 01:17:24,600
- Naked mole-rat.
- Naked mole-rat.

1494
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,734
- Don't just say, "Naked mole."
- What did I say?

1495
01:17:26,734 --> 01:17:29,000
You said, "Naked mole."

1496
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,533
- It's naked mole-rat.
- Just let me say, "Naked."

1497
01:17:32,133 --> 01:17:34,333
- You know what it is.
- Must I add "Mole-rat"?

1498
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:36,900
- Then it isn't an animal.
- That's right.

1499
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,834
This is hard.

1500
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:40,200
Okay.

1501
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:46,300
Ting, ting, ting, ting,
tang, tang, tang, tang.

1502
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,066
Boo paht pong karee, 12.

1503
01:17:48,066 --> 01:17:56,734
Boo paht pong karee.

1504
01:17:57,433 --> 01:17:59,066
Fennec leopard, two.

1505
01:18:01,033 --> 01:18:02,033
Fennec leopard, two.

1506
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,867
- Fennec fox.
- Come on.

1507
01:18:06,467 --> 01:18:08,300
- Fennec fox.
- Come on.

1508
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,967
- We're the young team.
- Fennec leopard.

1509
01:18:12,166 --> 01:18:14,433
- I'm fennec fox, and he's seal.
- Fennec leopard.

1510
01:18:14,433 --> 01:18:16,200
Just say, "Naked mole-rat."

1511
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,400
- Fennec...
- Fox.

1512
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,767
Fox. He's the seal.

1513
01:18:19,767 --> 01:18:22,967
- There are so many weak links...
- It's confusing.

1514
01:18:22,967 --> 01:18:24,233
- ...on this team.
- It's confusing.

1515
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,900
- Fennec fox.
- Fennec fox.

1516
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,000
- Seal.
- Fennec leopard.

1517

Ting, ting, ting, ting,
tang, tang, tang, tang.

1518
01:18:31,033 --> 01:18:33,867
Tingting Tangtang Up to 12 Frying Pan.

1519
01:18:34,433 --> 01:18:35,533
Boo paht po...

1520
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,300
Boo paht pong karee.

1521
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,700
Just say, "Mussel." For goodness' sake.

1522
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:43,834
Na-ra, relax.

1523
01:18:44,867 --> 01:18:47,367
"Boo paht po..."

1524
01:18:47,367 --> 01:18:49,300
-"Boo paht po..."
- Don't be mean to her.

1525
01:18:50,567 --> 01:18:54,800
She moved her fingers like this too.
"Boo paht po..."

1526
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,100
- Hey, her hands were too warm, okay?
- All right.

1527
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,467
- Her hands were too warm.
- Take them off. Seriously.

1528
01:19:01,467 --> 01:19:03,967
- How are we losing to such a team?
- Seriously.

1529
01:19:03,967 --> 01:19:06,633
- I don't understand.
- We're losing. It's nonsense, JENNIE.

1530
01:19:06,633 --> 01:19:07,934
- I don't understand.
- Hey.

1531
01:19:07,934 --> 01:19:11,367
- Keep your head in the game.
- Okay, I'll do that.

1532
01:19:11,367 --> 01:19:12,934
- Pick an easy one.
- Mussel.

1533
01:19:12,934 --> 01:19:14,867
- Mussel, get ready.
- Not a chance.

1534
01:19:14,867 --> 01:19:16,367
Ready, go.

1535
01:19:16,367 --> 01:19:19,133
Ting, ting, ting, ting,

Seal, eight.

1540
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:31,133
Seal, seal.

1541
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,567
- Seal, seal.

1542
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,266
- You need to do it, right?
- No.

1543
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:38,300
There you go.

1544
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:40,900
- You need to do it, right?
- No.

1545
01:19:41,934 --> 01:19:43,367
This is driving me crazy.

1546
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,033
We'll win.

1547
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:50,266
"You need to do it, right?"

1548
01:19:50,266 --> 01:19:52,333
- Eight.
- For goodness' sake.

1549
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,266
- Eight.
- For goodness' sake.

1550
01:19:57,567 --> 01:19:59,734
I have the best teammates.

1551
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,266
I shine when I'm with them.

1552
01:20:02,266 --> 01:20:05,333

- Seriously. I'm sorry.

1553

1554
01:20:07,433 --> 01:20:10,100
- She's good.
- Sung Yu-ri, what's wrong with you?

1555
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,900
I'm not a spy. I'm serious.

1556
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,266
Right.

1557
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:15,467
Naked mole-rat,
do you want a different name?

1558
01:20:15,467 --> 01:20:17,266
- The look in your eyes...
- What?

1559
01:20:17,266 --> 01:20:19,166
- You're looking down on me.
- Yes.

1560
01:20:19,166 --> 01:20:20,433
Do you want something easier?

1561
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:22,700
- Let's change the words.
- Okay.

1562
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,834
- Country names for the Yus.
- Country names.

1563
01:20:24,834 --> 01:20:25,767
Difficult country names.

1564
01:20:25,767 --> 01:20:27,500
Can we give them the country names?

1565
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,300
- Do you have a good idea?
- Yes, I do.

1566
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,200
What is it?

1567

1574
01:20:44,133 --> 01:20:45,967
Announce it first to have priority.

01:21:04,533 --> 01:21:05,433
S, S, and S?

1585

S, S, and S.

1587
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:19,166
- Don't mess up. I won't repeat myself.
- It hurts my pride.

1588
01:21:19,967 --> 01:21:21,500
We won't have a practice round.

1597
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:49,467
-"Côte d'Ivo, four" is incorrect.
- Côte d'Ivoire.

1598
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:53,333
Are you picking boogers?
Did you say, "Booger, four"?

1599
01:21:53,834 --> 01:21:55,000
Do you have a good idea?

1600
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,667
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

1601
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:58,834
Hey.

1602
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,300
Jae-seok can't attack.

1603
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,533
It's Côte d'Ivoire.

1604
01:22:03,533 --> 01:22:06,033
- Don't get worked up.
- Don't get worked up.

1605
01:22:06,033 --> 01:22:08,433

01:22:08,433 --> 01:22:09,667
- Hey.
- He was so confident.

1607
01:22:10,233 --> 01:22:12,700
Gosh, this is tasty.

1608
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,533
JENNIE added a move.

1609
01:22:15,533 --> 01:22:18,767
- She added a move.
- Seriously.

1610
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:21,000
She added a move.

1611
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,967
Gosh, this is hard.

01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,066

1622
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,033
- You picked the country names.
- Hey.

1623
01:22:49,033 --> 01:22:51,967
Tae-hyun will start it off instead of me.

1624
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,667
- Go first.
- I'll attack.

1625

- Puer Rico.
- Hey.

1643
01:23:34,867 --> 01:23:38,367
Jae-seok, that's how it's pronounced
in New Zealand.

1644
01:23:38,367 --> 01:23:41,233
- Puerto Rico.
- Hey, it doesn't count.

- No? For goodness' sake.
- No.

1646
01:23:43,066 --> 01:23:44,934
- Say, "Puerto Rico."
- That's harder.

1647
01:23:44,934 --> 01:23:46,667
- No.
- It's the New Zealand accent.

1648
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:49,266
- That doesn't count.
- Puerto Rico.

1649
01:23:49,266 --> 01:23:50,934
No. It's "Puerto Rico."

1650
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,133

- Okay.

1651
01:23:54,133 --> 01:23:55,967

- I'm Sri Lanka.

1658
01:24:10,233 --> 01:24:12,300
Is Sweden too hard for you?

1659
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,500
Na-ra, is Sweden too hard for you?

1660
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,667
Na-ra, we know that you're Sri Lanka.

1661
01:24:16,667 --> 01:24:18,200
Hey.

1662
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,934
She suddenly pressed reset.

1663
01:24:20,934 --> 01:24:22,600
Tae-hyun went, "Why aren't you going?"

1664
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,800
"I'm Sri Lanka."

1665
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,166
What? You were supposed to say it
the remaining number of times.

1666
01:24:27,166 --> 01:24:30,600
We can't even scold each other.

1667
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,934

Okay.

1671
01:24:38,533 --> 01:24:40,800
- We should've won.
- We needed the clue.

1672
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,934
JENNIE got the hint three weeks in a row.

1673
01:24:42,934 --> 01:24:46,333
- I won all the games.
- JENNIE is the fairy of clues.

1674
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:48,967
- JENNIE is the fairy of clues.
- That's incredible.

1675
01:24:55,533 --> 01:24:58,934
LOOK AT THE CULT FOLLOWERS'
SOLES CAREFULLY!

1676
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,900
Keep it in the envelope.
Here. We need to look at the soles.

1677
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,033
The cult leader is among us.

1678
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:12,734
- Why did you turn off the light?
- What's this?

1679
01:25:13,367 --> 01:25:14,767
- Why?
- Is it someone's birthday?

1680
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:17,500
What? Why did you turn off the light?
Will a ghost come out?

1681
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:18,533
What's this?

1682
01:25:19,066 --> 01:25:20,433
- What?
- What?

1683
01:25:21,667 --> 01:25:24,633
- What is it?
- What is it?

1684
01:25:26,266 --> 01:25:27,600
Gosh, that startled me.

1685
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,367
Gosh, that startled me.

1686
01:25:33,233 --> 01:25:34,633
Gosh, that startled me.

1687
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:41,000
What?

1688
01:25:56,834 --> 01:25:58,433
Remember what you said?

1689
01:25:58,433 --> 01:26:00,633
My joke turned out to be true.

1690
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:03,300
My shoulder hurts.

1691
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,567
- Gosh.
- That startled me.

1692
01:26:05,567 --> 01:26:07,767
- So scary.
- I thought it was a wall.

1693
01:26:07,767 --> 01:26:09,800
I'm sorry that I left you behind.

1694
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,800
I can't believe it.

1695
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:14,533
What's this?

1696
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:16,800
- I think...
- Behind you.

1697
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,967
What? That startled me.

1698
01:26:17,967 --> 01:26:18,867
How scary.

1699
01:26:18,867 --> 01:26:21,033
- What? That startled me.
- How scary.

1700
01:26:21,033 --> 01:26:23,500
They're the residents who made us food.

1701
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:26,500
They're the residents who made us food.

1702
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:29,000
- The owner of the tteokbokki stall.
- Yes.

1703
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,934
He's the resident representative.

1704
01:26:33,934 --> 01:26:36,166
- Hello.
- Hello.

1705
01:26:36,166 --> 01:26:38,633
- You can put the money in here.
- Okay.

1706
01:26:38,633 --> 01:26:41,000
- She's good.
- My goodness.

1707
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,266
The cult leader and the spouse...
On a 300,000 square meter property,

1708
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:47,133
they even built an apartment
for the followers.

1709
01:26:47,133 --> 01:26:49,800
They're the residents who made us food.

1710
01:26:50,834 --> 01:26:53,300
They're the ones
whose soles we need to check.

1711
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:55,734
- We need to find one.
- Yes.

1712
01:26:55,734 --> 01:26:58,166
- I can see their feet.
- That's right.

1713
01:26:58,166 --> 01:27:00,500
- I can see their feet.
- That's right.

1714
01:27:08,066 --> 01:27:11,333
The winning team has one minute.
Ready, go.

1715
01:27:11,333 --> 01:27:15,734
- What's going on? What is it?
- Hurry.

1716
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,667
What's written on the sole?

1717
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,467
- They're looking for something.
- What?

1718
01:27:21,467 --> 01:27:24,333
- They're looking for something.
- What are they looking for?

1719
01:27:34,367 --> 01:27:36,200
- Now is our chance.
- Now is our chance.

1720
01:27:36,767 --> 01:27:38,667
- Now is our chance.
- Now is our chance.

1721
01:27:41,433 --> 01:27:43,066
- Now is our chance.
- Now is our chance.

1722
01:27:48,066 --> 01:27:49,734
There's something on their soles.

1723
01:27:49,734 --> 01:27:51,900
- There's something.
- There's something on their soles.

1724
01:28:01,533 --> 01:28:03,467
What? There are red letters.

1725
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:10,467
There it is. There's a red letter.

1726
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,300
A red letter.

1727
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,700
- What is it?
- Rang.

1728
01:28:15,567 --> 01:28:17,433
- What is it?
- Rang.

1729
01:28:17,433 --> 01:28:19,834
YI, RANG

1730
01:28:19,834 --> 01:28:21,166
- What is it?
- Rang.

1731
01:28:21,166 --> 01:28:23,900
Ho. Ho, Rang, Yi. Tiger.

1732
01:28:24,467 --> 01:28:26,834
HO

1733
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,200
- Okay. Tiger.
- Tiger.

1734
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,100
That's right. We got it.

1735
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,133
- We figured it out.
- We got it.

1736
01:28:34,133 --> 01:28:35,967
"Woo-yong"?

1737
01:28:35,967 --> 01:28:39,133
It must be a name. A name.

1738
01:28:39,133 --> 01:28:41,233
- Hide the letters.
- Okay.

1739
01:28:43,633 --> 01:28:45,533
- My goodness.
- It's...

1740
01:28:47,934 --> 01:28:49,033
It's...

1741
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,834
- Se-chan.
- What are you doing?

1742
01:28:56,567 --> 01:28:58,600
- Se-chan.
- What are you doing?

1743
01:29:02,033 --> 01:29:04,000
That monkfish.

1744
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,900
- He's good.
- We figured it out.

1745
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,266
- He's good.
- We're done.

1746
01:29:08,033 --> 01:29:09,867
- You can't look.
- We can't look?

1747
01:29:09,867 --> 01:29:11,300
- We won the clue.
- I can't see.

1748
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,700
- Ryu.
- Time's up.

1749
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,567
- Ryu.
- Time's up.

1750
01:29:15,567 --> 01:29:19,200
- I saw one letter.
- What's this?

1751
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,200
- What's the clue?
- We found it.

1752
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,433
- We did it.
- Ryu and ryong.

1753
01:29:23,433 --> 01:29:25,033
- Red letters.
- What did you see?

1754
01:29:25,033 --> 01:29:27,500
- Ryu.
- There was only ryu.

1755
01:29:28,633 --> 01:29:34,734
- Woo-il is there too.
- What? Really?

1756
01:29:34,734 --> 01:29:37,200
Mister, what are you doing there?

1757
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,700
- Where is he? I see him.
- The front row.

1758
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,467
He's in the middle. He must have power.

1759
01:29:41,467 --> 01:29:43,934
Woo-il has been dragged in too.

1760
01:29:43,934 --> 01:29:45,467
But...

1761
01:29:45,467 --> 01:29:47,600
- Mr. Im.
- Mr. Im.

1762
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,367
- Mister.
- Mister.

1763
01:29:49,367 --> 01:29:53,200
- Mister.
- Mister.

1764
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,800
- Mr. Im.
- How did you end up joining a cult?

1765
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,734
- Mr. Im.
- How did it happen?

1766
01:29:57,734 --> 01:29:59,100
Mister.

1767
01:30:03,367 --> 01:30:05,700
- He just left.
- I'm jealous. Mister, I'm jealous.

1768
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,567
He left last
as if he was the main character.

1769
01:30:08,233 --> 01:30:10,266
How did he end up joining a cult?

1770
01:30:10,266 --> 01:30:12,800
The red letters are a hint
on the cult leader.

1771
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,533
Please begin deducing now.

1772
01:30:20,066 --> 01:30:22,066
"Once all the predictions come true,

1773
01:30:22,066 --> 01:30:24,367
the day the cult leader talked about
will come."

1774
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:31,500
Choose a member
and get him or her on the altar.

1775
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,967
- Is there a cult leader among us?
- Among us?

1776
01:30:35,266 --> 01:30:37,433
Do we need to get the cult leader
on the altar?

1777
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,367
A religious organization
used talk of doomsday

1778
01:30:40,367 --> 01:30:42,934
and extorted over 38 billion won
from its followers.

1779
01:30:42,934 --> 01:30:46,700
Over 150 billion won
was stolen in the loan fraud.

1780
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:48,567
While the cult leader lived extravagantly,

1781
01:30:48,567 --> 01:30:52,033
the followers were driven out
of their homes and workplaces.

1782
01:30:52,033 --> 01:30:53,367
Some even committed suicide.

1783
01:30:53,367 --> 01:30:57,433
Meanwhile, the mastermind
of the biggest fraud in the 20th century,

1784
01:30:57,433 --> 01:30:59,166
A, ran away from the police.

1785
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:01,600
A's whereabouts are unknown.

1786
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:12,300
I just have one letter, ryu.

1787
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,900
I just have one letter, ryu.

1788
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,233
- A Chinese zodiac sign?
- Tiger.

1789
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:29,433
- A Chinese zodiac sign?
- Tiger.

1790
01:31:31,734 --> 01:31:32,567
JENNIE.

1791
01:31:33,734 --> 01:31:34,800
- What is it?
- JENNIE.

1792
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,133
- JENNIE is something else.
- Tell me.

1793
01:31:38,133 --> 01:31:39,767
- I got goosebumps.
- It's right.

1794
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:40,834
What is it?

1795
01:31:43,433 --> 01:31:45,333
JENNIE, share your theory.

1796
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,700
- Okay.
- The red letters.

1797
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:49,033
The red letters spelled out "Tiger."

1798
01:31:49,033 --> 01:31:52,233
- The hint was "Tiger."
- Tiger.

1799
01:31:52,233 --> 01:31:55,166
We talked about
our Chinese zodiac signs recently.

1800
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:57,166
Two people were born
in the Year of the Tiger.

1801
01:31:57,166 --> 01:31:58,734
- I was too.
- It's you or me.

1802
01:31:58,734 --> 01:32:00,233
- What?
- There are three.

1803
01:32:00,233 --> 01:32:03,133
- Were you born in the Year of the Tiger?
- I got goosebumps.

1804
01:32:03,133 --> 01:32:05,166
- Were you born in the Year of the Tiger?
- Yes.

1805
01:32:05,166 --> 01:32:06,233
Same here.

1806
01:32:06,233 --> 01:32:08,066
- Tiger? Same here.
- Twelve years apart.

1807
01:32:08,066 --> 01:32:09,967
- Hey, we're 24 years apart.
- Jae-seok.

1808
01:32:09,967 --> 01:32:11,667
- Tiger?
- Mine is the tiger.

1809
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:14,867
- Is yours the tiger?
- Yes, it is.

1810
01:32:14,867 --> 01:32:18,400
It's one of these three. Na-ra too.

1811
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,467
A red tiger?

1812
01:32:20,567 --> 01:32:23,233
- A tiger.
- There was one more red letter.

1813
01:32:23,233 --> 01:32:25,100
Ryu and ryong.

1814
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,834
- What's ryu?
- Jae-seok, born in the Year of the Dragon.

1815
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:30,400
He was born in the Year of the Dragon.

1816
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,500
- Dragon.
- How about you?

1817
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,600
- The Year of the Rat.
- The naked mole-rat?

1818
01:32:35,266 --> 01:32:36,400
The naked mole-rat?

1819
01:32:42,066 --> 01:32:43,400
You monkfish.

1820
01:32:44,367 --> 01:32:45,934
You're a naked mole-rat.

1821
01:32:45,934 --> 01:32:48,100
- The Year of the Rat.
- Naked mole-rat.

1822
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,300
- The Year of the Rat?
- Yes.

1823
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:51,967
- Were there other red letters?
- Yes, I told you.

1824
01:32:51,967 --> 01:32:53,967
- Ryu.
- I saw ryu too.

1825
01:32:53,967 --> 01:32:55,233
- Was ryu red?
- Yes.

1826
01:32:55,233 --> 01:32:56,767
- Ryu was red.
- Yes.

1827
01:33:01,533 --> 01:33:05,033
Ryu, ryong.
So there were ryu, ryong, and tiger.

1828
01:33:05,033 --> 01:33:08,767
Ryu Seung-ryong?

1829
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:10,567
Ryu Seung-ryong?

1830
01:33:23,033 --> 01:33:24,867
Ryu Seung-ryong.

1831
01:33:24,867 --> 01:33:29,033
- September. Your birthday was last week.
- Ryu Seung-ryong.

1832
01:33:29,033 --> 01:33:32,200
- Ryu Seung-ryong and tiger.
- Ryu Seung-ryong and tiger.

1833
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,200
- Ryu Seung-ryong...
- Then...

1834
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,834
- Jung-ha.
- I'm innocent.

1835
01:33:35,834 --> 01:33:37,700
- Jung-ha.
- Moving.

1836
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:38,767
- It's you.
- You.

1837
01:33:38,767 --> 01:33:40,800
- Jung-ha.
- Moving.

1838
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,133
- You.
- It's you.

1839
01:33:43,133 --> 01:33:45,767
Where did Ryu Seung-ryong come from?
It might not be seung.

1840
01:33:45,767 --> 01:33:48,467
You were in Moving too. Come here.

1841
01:33:48,467 --> 01:33:50,600
- Go over there.
- Go over there.

1842
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:51,900
- Those three.
- You too.

1843
01:33:54,266 --> 01:33:56,400
Hold on. Didn't you film
something with him?

1844
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,800
I did.

1845
01:33:58,900 --> 01:33:59,900
MOVING

1846
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,500
- Those three.
- You too. Come here.

1847
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:13,000
I don't know Ryu Seung-ryong personally.

1848
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,300
I don't know
the Miracle in Cell No. 7 actor.

1849
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,533
- I wasn't born in the Year of the Tiger.
- Come back.

1850
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:19,834
It's one of the two.

1851
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:21,900
It's one of the two.

1852
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:24,800
- Wait.
- We narrowed things down.

1853
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,734
- It's one of the two.
- We narrowed things down.

1854
01:34:28,734 --> 01:34:31,166
I feel so victimized.

1855
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:34,900
This is exactly like the last time.

1856
01:34:38,633 --> 01:34:41,100
WHO IS THE CULT LEADER?

1857
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:43,033
OH NA-RA?

1858
01:34:43,033 --> 01:34:44,867
LEE JUNG-HA?

1859
01:34:44,867 --> 01:34:46,367
Give me the Book of Prophecies.

1860
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:51,533
- We... Hey.
- There's no way he hid the shoe.

1861
01:34:51,533 --> 01:34:56,133
Why are you guys talking separately?

1862
01:34:56,133 --> 01:34:57,867
Are you jealous?

1863
01:34:57,867 --> 01:35:01,033
Jae-seok, JENNIE and I spent
the entire day with Jung-ha.

1864
01:35:01,033 --> 01:35:02,433
- Look.
- Tell everyone

1865
01:35:02,433 --> 01:35:05,433
- about the shoe.
- We need to take caution.

1866
01:35:05,433 --> 01:35:08,200
- We need to go over the prophecies.
- Yes.

1867
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,300
I feel victimized.

1868
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:11,500
- I looked for clues diligently.
- I agree.

1869
01:35:16,567 --> 01:35:18,600
And I know one thing for certain.

1870
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,200
- What?
- Na-ra stained Jung-ha's clothes.

1871
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,400
Did I do that?

1872
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:25,700
- Na-ra stained Jung-ha's clothes.
- Did I do that?

1873
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:28,900
When the pork cutlets came,
she suddenly cut one up...

1874
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:29,934
- She came.
- She came.

1875
01:35:29,934 --> 01:35:31,800
She left with a piece on a fork.

1876
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,300
JENNIE said she wanted to eat pork cutlet.

1877
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:37,967
- Did you say that?
- But I never got to eat it.

1878
01:35:37,967 --> 01:35:41,033
JENNIE said she wouldn't eat it.

1879
01:35:41,033 --> 01:35:43,934
But she suddenly enticed me
with the pork cutlet.

1880
01:35:43,934 --> 01:35:46,100
I bit into the piece.

1881
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,867
Hey. For goodness' sake.

1882
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:50,400
Come here. Open wide. There you go.

1883
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,133
- Aren't you going to give it to me?
- Eat it.

1884
01:35:53,133 --> 01:35:55,967
Eat it. There you go.

1885
01:35:55,967 --> 01:35:59,166
Close the door. I figured out something
that gave me goosebumps.

1886
01:35:59,166 --> 01:36:01,800
- I smelled it. It isn't this food.
- The stain.

1887
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,700
- It's the other team's pork cutlet.
- What?

1888
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:06,467
Na-ra tempted me
with a piece of pork cutlet earlier.

1889
01:36:06,467 --> 01:36:08,667
- Is the smell the same?
- It's the same.

1890
01:36:08,667 --> 01:36:10,133
- See?
- You're a genius.

1891
01:36:12,367 --> 01:36:14,900
Hey. For goodness' sake. Let's take it.

1892
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:15,967
Let's take it.

1893
01:36:15,967 --> 01:36:17,133
4. NA-RA WILL SNAP A GROUP PHOTO

1894
01:36:17,133 --> 01:36:19,433
- Let's see what happens when I take it.
- We can't take it.

1895
01:36:19,433 --> 01:36:20,667
Let's take it.

1896
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:22,800
- Na-ra.
- But...

1897
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,433
I get that you're desperate.

1898
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,200
Are you trying to mess things up?

1899
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,467
- Na-ra.
- I'm not the cult leader.

1900
01:36:31,467 --> 01:36:32,667
Na-ra.

1901
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:34,567
- I don't think it's her.
- Na-ra?

1902
01:36:34,567 --> 01:36:35,834
I figured it out.

1903
01:36:35,834 --> 01:36:38,533
- It doesn't seem like it's Na-ra.
- It really isn't me.

1904
01:36:38,533 --> 01:36:45,767
- Hold on.
- It really isn't me.

1905
01:36:45,767 --> 01:36:47,834
It really isn't me either.

1906
01:36:47,834 --> 01:36:54,934
- It really isn't me either.
- We're having a meeting. Stay here.

1907
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:56,400
Let us talk.

1908
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,600
- It's confusing.
- Is it Na-ra?

1909
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,400
JENNIE, let's be honest.

1910
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,467
When we were together,
someone made a mistake.

1911
01:37:03,467 --> 01:37:05,233
- JENNIE, explain.
- What mistake?

1912
01:37:05,233 --> 01:37:08,333
- Shall I really explain what happened?
- Go ahead.

1913
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:10,767
The production crew might not know.

1914
01:37:10,767 --> 01:37:12,767
- Shall I?
- Go ahead. We have no choice.

1915
01:37:12,767 --> 01:37:17,667
The resident representative
came and said hello.

1916
01:37:17,667 --> 01:37:18,800
- To your unit?
- Yes.

1917
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,800
- Yes.
- We took photos with her last week.

1918
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,533
She said,

1919
01:37:22,533 --> 01:37:28,934
"I took a photo with Na-ra yesterday."

1920
01:37:29,734 --> 01:37:31,533
- I took a photo with her.
- Yesterday?

1921
01:37:31,533 --> 01:37:32,500
Yesterday?

1922
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:35,300
- She said yesterday. We deducted...
- Yesterday?

1923
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:38,100
- ...Na-ra had an additional shoot yesterday.
- Yes.

1924
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:41,433
She came one day early
and had an additional shoot.

1925
01:37:41,433 --> 01:37:43,867
The resident representative let it slip.

1926
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:48,533
- I brought some tangerines.
- Thank you.

1927
01:37:48,533 --> 01:37:50,900
- Take photos.
- Hello.

1928
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:55,900
I took a photo with Oh Na-ra yesterday.

1929
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:59,133
- Really?
- Yes.

1930
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:03,967
She said it was yesterday.

1931
01:38:03,967 --> 01:38:07,166
- I know. I guess Na-ra came yesterday.
- She came yesterday.

1932
01:38:08,433 --> 01:38:10,467
- It's an accident.
- An accident.

1933
01:38:10,467 --> 01:38:11,934
My goodness.

1934
01:38:11,934 --> 01:38:14,500
- We can't say anything.
- We should keep quiet.

1935
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:16,633
It was during break time.
The cameras were off.

1936
01:38:16,633 --> 01:38:18,667
The cameras were off.

1937
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:22,700
She came one day early
and had an additional shoot.

1938
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:25,233
The resident representative let it slip.

1939
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:28,367
I took a photo with Na-ra.
I have to take one with you too.

1940
01:38:28,867 --> 01:38:31,500
- Let's put Na-ra on the altar.
- We must.

1941
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,567
- Let's put Na-ra on the altar.
- We must.

1942
01:38:33,567 --> 01:38:35,133
- Hold on.
- Oh Na-ra.

1943
01:38:35,133 --> 01:38:36,900
It really isn't me.

1944
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:39,000
You guys will regret it. It isn't me.

1945
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,967
It really isn't me.

1946
01:38:40,967 --> 01:38:42,734
- Look at me.
- Gosh, it isn't me.

1947
01:38:42,734 --> 01:38:45,000
- It isn't you, right?
- It really isn't me.

1948
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,300
- I don't think it's him.
- Really?

1949
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:48,600
It isn't me. You'll regret it.
For goodness' sake.

1950
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:51,033
For goodness' sake.

1951
01:38:51,033 --> 01:38:52,834
Let's get it right today.

1952
01:38:56,734 --> 01:38:58,233
I don't know who it is.

1953
01:39:01,367 --> 01:39:04,133
- Let's see.
- In 1972,

1954
01:39:04,133 --> 01:39:07,166
the Daehan Woosang Cult
Jinrihoe Church was founded.

1955
01:39:07,166 --> 01:39:11,667
Amidst many lies,
our final sanctuary came to be.

1956
01:39:11,667 --> 01:39:13,800
She was born in 1972.

1957
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,233
In 1997,

1958
01:39:16,233 --> 01:39:19,166
the leader of the church
ascended to heaven,

1959
01:39:19,166 --> 01:39:21,700
and the followers nearly lost their way.

1960
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:23,867
- The leader ascended to heaven.
- I see.

1961
01:39:24,266 --> 01:39:26,500
In 1998,

1962
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,834
the second leader emerged,

1963
01:39:28,834 --> 01:39:34,367
and Daehan Woosang Cult Jinrihoe Church
welcomed heaven once again.

1964
01:39:34,367 --> 01:39:36,800
Those aren't men's hands.

1965
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,333
I guess Na-ra came yesterday
to shoot that scene.

1966
01:39:39,333 --> 01:39:42,300
Did she really come yesterday?

1967
01:39:44,667 --> 01:39:48,900
Our leader is loved
for their flower-like beauty.

1968
01:39:51,533 --> 01:39:54,900
"Flower-like beauty" might be
about Jung-ha.

1969
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:59,300
Our leader lights up the world
with their doe-like eyes.

1970
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:02,100
- I do have doe-like eyes.
- Yes.

1971
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:03,667
But Na-ra does too.

1972
01:40:03,667 --> 01:40:06,300
- He's attacking me.
- No.

1973
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:11,300
Our true king has descended to Earth.

1974
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:15,333
We will praise our leader forever.

1975
01:40:15,333 --> 01:40:18,033
We will follow our leader forever.

1976
01:40:18,033 --> 01:40:19,734
My deity.

1977
01:40:20,233 --> 01:40:21,700
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

1978
01:40:24,867 --> 01:40:27,600
It really isn't me.

1979
01:40:28,433 --> 01:40:30,867
- It really isn't me.
- Really?

1980
01:40:32,367 --> 01:40:35,500
Our true idol.

1981
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,467
Lee Jung-ha.

1982
01:40:50,266 --> 01:40:51,800
Hey!

1983
01:40:53,033 --> 01:40:54,800
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1984
01:40:57,233 --> 01:40:58,533
Hey!

1985
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,333
Hey!

1986
01:41:05,467 --> 01:41:09,000
- My goodness.
- You practically filmed a movie.

1987
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,266
Jae-seok, I got goosebumps.

1988
01:41:10,266 --> 01:41:12,467
Why did we fall for an obvious trick?

1989
01:41:12,467 --> 01:41:14,400
I know. Why did we do that?

1990
01:41:16,433 --> 01:41:17,767
I finally won.

1991
01:41:22,967 --> 01:41:24,266
Let's begin.

1992
01:41:24,266 --> 01:41:26,367
- Leader.
- Leader.

1993
01:41:26,367 --> 01:41:28,300
Leader, I believe in you.

1994
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,433
I'm the cult leader, everyone.

1995
01:41:35,533 --> 01:41:38,200
I'll serve you.

1996
01:41:40,567 --> 01:41:43,000
I always showed my foolish side.

1997
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,900
This time, I'll truly go crazy.

1998
01:41:47,233 --> 01:41:48,700
Let's begin.

1999
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,333
- We believe in you.
- We believe in you.

2000
01:41:54,333 --> 01:41:56,834
- Let's go.
- Cut.

2001
01:42:04,166 --> 01:42:05,767
I really want to win.

2002
01:42:05,767 --> 01:42:09,567
In my opinion, Jae-seok

2003
01:42:09,567 --> 01:42:11,300
is very friendly.

2004
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:15,433
I think he'll hug me as he says hello.

2005
01:42:15,433 --> 01:42:17,500
"Jae-seok will hug Jung-ha."

2006
01:42:18,233 --> 01:42:19,934
It isn't you, is it?

2007
01:42:19,934 --> 01:42:21,533
Hey.

2008
01:42:21,533 --> 01:42:24,767
Did you forget what happened last week?

2009
01:42:24,767 --> 01:42:25,900
It isn't you, is it?

2010
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:28,633
You fell for JENNIE's lies.

2011
01:42:28,633 --> 01:42:32,633
I think it'll be better to steal
an item from Se-chan.

2012
01:42:32,633 --> 01:42:34,600
- Let's go.
- Let's go to unit 406.

2013
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,133
- Let's take a look around.
- Trust me.

2014
01:42:37,133 --> 01:42:38,333
There's nowhere to hide...

2015
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:39,600
Trust me.

2016
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:44,367
There's nowhere to hide
other than the closet.

2017
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:45,767
What? It's empty.

2018
01:42:45,767 --> 01:42:47,066
...other than the closet.

2019
01:42:47,066 --> 01:42:48,133
What? It's empty.

2020
01:42:48,133 --> 01:42:49,367
- Someone's there.
- Totally.

2021
01:42:49,367 --> 01:42:51,200
- Was it obvious?
- It was very obvious.

2022
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,667
3. SE-CHAN WILL LOSE A SHOE

2023
01:42:58,667 --> 01:43:00,300
Se-chan.

2024
01:43:01,433 --> 01:43:03,133
- Slickback.
- Slickback.

2025
01:43:03,133 --> 01:43:04,500
How does the dance go?

2026
01:43:05,867 --> 01:43:06,900
- Try hard.
- Can you do it?

2027
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,433
No, I can't.

2028
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:10,066
You must know the steps.

2029
01:43:10,934 --> 01:43:12,834
You keep your heels up.

2030
01:43:12,834 --> 01:43:16,000
- They don't touch the ground.
- The heels.

2031
01:43:16,633 --> 01:43:20,200
Na-ra loves to take group photos. Okay.

2032
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,000
Tae-hyun's tears?

2033
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:26,633
- I could hit him.
- Hit him and make him cry.

2034
01:43:26,633 --> 01:43:30,400
Perhaps he could cry from laughter.
He could go, "I'm in tears."

2035
01:43:32,333 --> 01:43:34,100
I have a chilling idea.

2036
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:37,767
My prophecy can be,
"Jung-ha will get stains on his clothes."

2037
01:43:37,767 --> 01:43:40,900
Then I can go, "I don't know
how I got these stains."

2038
01:43:42,033 --> 01:43:46,667
- Aren't you going to give it to me?
- Eat it. There you go.

2039
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:54,166
6. JUNG-HA WILL GET STAINS
ON HIS CLOTHES

2040
01:43:54,166 --> 01:43:56,967
- Some items are crossed out.
- Hey, his clothes are stained.

2041
01:43:56,967 --> 01:43:58,266
- Come here. What's that?
- Where?

2042
01:43:58,266 --> 01:44:00,400
When did it happen?

2043
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:01,467
What's this?

2044
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:05,367
I won't lose in vain.

2045
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:09,467
- I can't face Jung-ha again.
- Seriously, I...

2046
01:44:09,467 --> 01:44:11,000
- He...
- Seriously, I...

2047
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,767
Look at his face.

2048
01:44:12,767 --> 01:44:15,266
- Pork cutlet got on his clothes.
- His face.

2049
01:44:15,266 --> 01:44:16,667
Look at his face.

2050
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:18,166
Pork cutlet got on his clothes.

2051
01:44:19,367 --> 01:44:21,667
You said Na-ra got tteokbokki
on his clothes.

2052
01:44:21,667 --> 01:44:24,233
You talked about
the resident representative.

2053
01:44:24,233 --> 01:44:25,400
They got fooled.

2054
01:44:27,967 --> 01:44:30,500
- There's another video.
- For goodness' sake.

2055
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,166
What's this?

2056
01:44:36,033 --> 01:44:37,633
One, two, three.

2057
01:44:40,633 --> 01:44:44,166
The resident representatives.

2058
01:44:44,166 --> 01:44:46,233
- On the first day?
- Yes.

2059
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:50,967
She's the real resident representative.

2060
01:44:51,767 --> 01:44:52,767
All right.

2061
01:44:54,033 --> 01:44:57,266
Thank you for helping us with the shoot.

2062
01:44:57,266 --> 01:44:58,300
You're so young.

2063
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:01,000
- That's right.
- They came today as well.

2064
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,066
- Hello.
- Hello.

2065
01:45:03,934 --> 01:45:06,233
- Hello.
- We saw them again.

2066
01:45:06,233 --> 01:45:07,500
That's right.

2067
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:10,500
The two of them took photos with them.

2068
01:45:12,734 --> 01:45:14,500
Hello.

2069
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,567
- Yes, we saw them.
- They were sitting there.

2070
01:45:16,567 --> 01:45:18,166
They were there.

2071
01:45:21,734 --> 01:45:24,233
- What?
- Why?

2072
01:45:31,433 --> 01:45:33,100
Can we enter now?

2073
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,734
Three weeks?

2074
01:45:35,734 --> 01:45:37,367
That's insane.

2075
01:45:38,667 --> 01:45:40,266
Three weeks?

2076
01:45:40,266 --> 01:45:42,900
- That's insane.
- I can't believe it.

2077
01:45:44,233 --> 01:45:46,166
- My goodness.
- We fell for it.

2078
01:45:46,166 --> 01:45:48,967
I took a photo with Na-ra yesterday,

2079
01:45:48,967 --> 01:45:52,200
- but not with you.
- This is exciting.

2080
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:55,834
-"Don't trust anyone."
- Actors.

2081
01:45:55,834 --> 01:45:57,233
Don't trust anyone.

2082
01:45:57,867 --> 01:45:59,266
Are they actors?

2083
01:45:59,834 --> 01:46:03,033
Don't lie. Are you saying
they aren't resident representatives?

2084
01:46:06,266 --> 01:46:07,400
What?

2085
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:10,900
What's that?

2086
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:17,467
- Woosang Cult! Let's go.
- Let's go.

2087
01:46:19,967 --> 01:46:22,467
- My goodness.
- I can't believe it.

2088
01:46:23,567 --> 01:46:24,600
Are you serious?

2089
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,400
I can't believe it.

2090
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:33,166
- I want to break his fingers.
- I know.

2091
01:46:35,233 --> 01:46:37,100
He was close to tears earlier.

2092
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,433
We totally got fooled.

2093
01:46:38,433 --> 01:46:40,433
Why did you say
that you wanted pork cutlet?

2094
01:46:40,433 --> 01:46:42,400
I was trying to keep you from entering.

2095
01:46:43,367 --> 01:46:45,400
I was trying to keep you from entering.

2096
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:47,100
I'm sorry.

2097
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,266
- Did Jung-ha win?
- Yes.

2098
01:46:49,266 --> 01:46:51,333
I won't get fooled by Jung-ha again.

2099
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,166
A cult leader and their spouse
who used talk of doomsday

2100
01:46:56,166 --> 01:47:00,166
to make followers take out loans
that amounted to tens of billions of won

2101
01:47:00,166 --> 01:47:03,066
were sentenced
to ten years of imprisonment.

2102
01:47:03,066 --> 01:47:05,700
The justice department stated that crimes

2103
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:07,734
using religion
should be punished severely.

2104
01:47:32,266 --> 01:47:33,400
Congratulations.

2105
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:36,800
You've been invited
to the New Village Plan.

2106
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,500
The hidden secret of the apartment

2107
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:41,867
will be unveiled only after you complete
the 25 bingo boards.

2108
01:47:42,867 --> 01:47:44,867
- ...looking for bingos.
- I must catch them.

2109
01:47:44,867 --> 01:47:46,867
- There he is.
- Don't betray me.

2110
01:47:46,867 --> 01:47:49,433
All deals are allowed.

2111
01:47:49,433 --> 01:47:50,800
I'll give you a lot.

2112
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,033
Isn't it smuggling?

2113
01:47:52,033 --> 01:47:54,233
All of them are thieves.

2114
01:47:54,934 --> 01:47:57,800
Please catch other people instead.

2115
01:47:58,934 --> 01:47:59,834
He's running away.

2116
01:47:59,834 --> 01:48:00,900
Gosh.

2117
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:03,800
- I gave you money.
- The national affairs.

2118
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:06,600
- What?
- I don't have a clue.
