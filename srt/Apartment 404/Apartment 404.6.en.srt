1
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:32,500
This year, we accomplished a great deal.

2
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:35,834
The nation overcame tough challenges
such as foreign trade barriers,

3
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,333
the Middle East's economic recession,
and financial accidents

4
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,667
and achieved growth and stability.

5
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,400
That isn't all.

6
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:49,266
The 88 Expressway was built
through the rugged mountains

7
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,100
and advanced technology was developed.

8
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,967
Let's get married.

9
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,734
We'll live happily. I'm sure of it.

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,900
With a boy and a girl?

11
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,100
Shall we just die?

12
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:58,667
If I hadn't met you…

13
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,266
Hey, you punk.

14
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,600
What is it?

15
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:11,867
Are you going to jump?

16
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,467
Don't act miserable.

17
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:32,966
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

18
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,100
This is incredible.

19
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:35,867
-Gosh.
-Unbelievable.

20
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:37,667
-What?
-The decor is spot on.

21
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:42,066
They perfectly recreated
the music cafes that existed in the past.

22
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,233
-It's fascinating.
-Impressive.

23
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,900
It's the song the young lady
with the big eyes likes.

24
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:52,166
It's "Green, Green Grass of Home"

25
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,800
by Tom Jones.

26
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:20,533
That man is here for a blind date,
but he gets stood up.

27
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,133
-I see.
-He's stacking matches while he waits.

28
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,033
Was denim on denim
the dress code for your team?

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,533
My concept of the day is Jeon Young-rok.

30
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:42,700
-You have a retro vibe.
-I'm Deok-sun.

31
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,200
-Who?
-Deok-sun.

32
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,133
-Deok-sun.
-I see.

33
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,767
JENNIE knows about the era

34
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,233
-through Deok-sun.
-Yes.

35
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,900
-Through Reply 1988.
-Yes.

36
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,466
We lived through the era.

37
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,367
We lived through the era.

38
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,967
You lived through the era.

39
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,200
Seriously, the memories are so clear.

40
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:05,700
Na-ra, you've been to music cafes.

41
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:09,133
-Sit down, everyone.
-Let's sit down.

42
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,900
-What's this?
-That's right.

43
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:11,800
-What's this?
-What's this?

44
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:14,200
-It tells your fortune for 100 won.
-Fortune.

45
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:15,700
-Really?
-It pops out.

46
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:16,733
Insert it in your sign.

47
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,433
TODAY'S FORTUNE FOR FUN

48
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,967
Really?

49
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:30,367
Insert 100 won in the slot for your sign.

50
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:32,633
But it's actually an ashtray.

51
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,467
Everyone smoked indoors back then.

52
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:38,533
-What?
-My goodness.

53
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,367
-It's Starry Night.
-Starry Night.

54
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:43,166
-Lee Moon-sae.
-Lee Moon-sae.

55
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:45,300
Will Moon-sae come out?

56
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,400
Maybe Moon-sae will come out.

57
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,300
-He won't, right?
-This is fun.

58
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,433
-It's Woo-il.
-It's Woo-il.

59
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,600
It's Woo-il.

60
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:07,967
-You know, Woo-il plays…
-Are you serious?

61
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,967
…many roles.

62
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:11,166
Mister.

63
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:14,834
It suits him so well.

64
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,533
-Mr. Security Guard.
-It suits him.

65
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,633
Mr. Security Guard?

66
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,100
My gosh.

67
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,600
That's right.

68
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm the security guard
who protects your cold heart.

69
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:29,300
-He's good.
-He's good.

70
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:30,700
-He's good.
-It suits him.

71
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,367
-He's really good.
-Yes.

72
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:36,467
Hello. Your cute disc jockey,

73
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:40,000
Brother Woo-il, says hello.

74
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:41,332
-Brother Woo-il.
-Oh, no.

75
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,633
-Disc jockey.
-Disc jockey.

76
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
JENNIE, you're back.

77
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,166
-JENNIE was a regular.
-JENNIE,

78
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,533
-if you keep coming, it'll be dangerous.
-Why?

79
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,700
Brother Woo-il might become your darling.

80
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,000
-How mischievous.
-Mister, you're annoying.

81
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:58,533
-Gosh, Woo-il.
-Woo-il, you're annoying.

82
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,700
-I can't believe Woo-il.
-Darling.

83
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:05,100
-You're a nuisance.
-Seriously.

84
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:09,100
If you have a song request,

85
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,633
-please write it down on a note.
-There it is.

86
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,633
-Please write it down on a note.
-What songs are there?

87
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,433
Hold on. A song request.

88
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,367
What songs are there?

89
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,967
I want to listen to that song.

90
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,400
-What?
-"Reminiscence" by Kim Sung-ho.

91
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:28,100
-"Reminiscence."
-Is it from this era?

92
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,867
-It was a windy day
-"Reminiscence."

93
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:31,133
Is it from this era?

94
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,500
I'll pick "HEEYA" by Boohwal.

95
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,166
Look at me

96
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:36,500
That song is from the '80s.

97
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:37,900
It's from the '80s.

98
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,166
Should I message my mom?

99
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,133
JENNIE will message her mom.

100
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,300
Right now…

101
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:47,600
Can I request "Violet Fragrance"?

102
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:50,433
"Violet Fragrance" is a good one.
"Wind, Please Be Still."

103
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,332
Big sister Ji-yeon.

104
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,467
What? Is Ji-yeon older than you?

105
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,300
-Maybe not.
-Yes, she is.

106
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,300
-She's older than us.
-Really?

107
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:04,800
-Thank goodness.
-She's older than me.

108
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,033
-We're getting confused now.
-Yes.

109
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,667
-In most cases, we're the same age.
-In most cases…

110
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:12,500
-The same age.
-Here you go.

111
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:13,533
The same age.

112
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,567
All right.

113
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:17,600
You drew a heart haphazardly for Woo-il.

114
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,066
It isn't a heart for a loved one.

115
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:23,000
-It's haphazard.
-Yes.

116
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:25,033
"Here. Take this heart."

117
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:27,266
Brother Woo-il.

118
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:28,900
Thank you.

119
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,900
I'll play the first song.

120
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,567
Whose song request will it be?

121
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,367
It's "HEEYA" by Boohwal.

122
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:40,567
-Heeya
-Kim Tae-won is still in Boohwal.

123
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,300
My goodness.

124
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,300
Back then, women with names like
"Moon-hee" and "Sook-hee" went wild.

125
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:51,500
Their nicknames were Heeya.

126
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:54,033
-Kim Won-hee's nickname was Heeya.
-That's right.

127
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,734
Boohwal actually had a concert
with women whose names ended with "Hee."

128
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,033
-Really?
-The Hee Concert.

129
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,400
-The Hee Concert.
-Yes.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
Tae-won's guitar solo.

131
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:06,500
Na-ra is getting into it.

132
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:10,734
Are you itchy, Na-ra?

133
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,867
-I'm itchy.
-You keep scratching your side.

134
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:15,367
Your side.

135
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:17,934
You can watch TV if you're bored.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,867
-What?
-We can watch TV if we're bored.

137
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,133
-Here we go.
-It's on.

138
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
It's on. Play.

139
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:27,367
Will we get information
for today's episode?

140
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,734
It's Kim Hye-soo.

141
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,734
-It's Kim Hye-soo.
-Yes, Kim Hye-soo.

142
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,734
-It's like that
-That's incredible.

143
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,433
*** Bravo cone

144
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,033
With the economic growth
of the Middle Eastern countries,

145
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,500
Korean companies have been actively
expanding into the Middle East.

146
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:03,767
-It must be about oil.
-The construction industry…

147
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,367
Last December, the Korean technicians
arrived in Saudi Arabia.

148
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:10,033
They beat numerous foreign competitors

149
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,467
and are dominating
the construction industry.

150
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,200
-Impressive.
-I see.

151
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:17,300
Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo,
and other companies that expanded abroad

152
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:20,567
decided to organize a team
for the expansion of construction works.

153
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,867
CONSTRUCTION BOOM
IN THE MIDDLE EAST

154
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,467
-Thirty thousand.
-Abroad.

155
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,367
This year, the nation saw
an economic growth of 12.2 percent.

156
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:32,400
Just like last year,
the economic boom will continue.

157
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:34,133
-It was a rapid growth.
-Yes.

158
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,000
In the '80s, we had the Three Lows.
It was the time of economic boom.

159
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:49,000
Our economy has shown
a remarkable growth this year,

160
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:52,133
but it has also left behind
a new set of problems.

161
00:09:57,165 --> 00:10:00,633
In Korea, there are over 400,000
adult entertainment establishments.

162
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,166
-How flashy.
-My goodness.

163
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,567
The money that's poured
into these establishments

164
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:09,000
is estimated to be over four trillion won.

165
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,867
It can easily be guessed

166
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:14,867
that such establishments are
only for a certain class of people.

167
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,300
Why do you think that happened?

168
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,200
-People had too much money.
-Yes.

169
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,066
-Suddenly…
-The economy was doing well.

170
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,467
Really? Was too much money the problem?

171
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:25,600
The spread of such establishments has led
to an increase in various crimes

172
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,467
and deviations.

173
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,767
As it leads to horrible crimes,

174
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:33,000
we should look back
on our consumptive behavior.

175
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,233
When there's an overflow of money,
industries like that grow.

176
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:42,533
Is there a deeply-rooted gang
in Korea like Al Capone's in Chicago?

177
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,233
Here it comes.

178
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,800
-Al Capone?
-War on crime.

179
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:47,200
War on crime.

180
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:50,333
According to the police,
there are around 160 gangs

181
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,800
and 1,600 gang members in Korea.

182
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:56,100
This must be the theme.

183
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:58,000
Here's Im Chang-geun with the story.

184
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,700
Around the entertainment district,

185
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:03,333
gang members extort valuables
from business owners and customers.

186
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,867
They come every day

187
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:08,033
and torment me.

188
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,800
If I don't give them liquor and money,

189
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,000
they beat me up.

190
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,066
My goodness.

191
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,300
They force me to buy their…

192
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,000
What? What did they force him to buy?

193
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,834
There are 600 potential offenders,

194
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,033
so the police officers keep them in check
every night.

195
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,333
…keep them in check every night.

196
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,133
They forced him to buy their "blank."

197
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,033
Their…

198
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,633
Is it liquor?

199
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,367
With the economic boom of the '80s,
adult establishments thrived.

200
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:42,934
-People spent a lot of money.
-That's right.

201
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,033
What's this about?

202
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:50,800
Why are they showing us the news today?

203
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,900
Usually, it's a hint.

204
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,165
-What could it be? A music cafe--
-Right.

205
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:57,165
A music cafe--

206
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,200
-Where is that punk?
-Come on out, you punk!

207
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:01,467
-Where is he?
-Come on out!

208
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,066
-Where is that punk?
-Come on out, you punk!

209
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:07,567
That startled me.

210
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:10,333
-Oh, my.
-That startled me.

211
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,900
Oh, no.

212
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,667
Come on out!

213
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:18,533
Where did you hide him? Isn't he here?

214
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,100
Have you seen him?
The punk with slicked-back hair.

215
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,433
Have you seen him?
The punk with slicked-back hair.

216
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:26,333
I was so startled.

217
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:29,166
Have you seen him or not?

218
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,934
Why haven't you seen him?

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,367
Come on out!

220
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:33,467
Come on out!

221
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,900
-Come on out!
-Oh, no.

222
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,767
-Come on out!
-Oh, no.

223
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:38,967
Mister.

224
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,066
-Mister.
-Mister.

225
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:53,567
-A man with mousse in his hair.
-Mousse?

226
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:56,533
-We haven't seen him.
-Are they talking about Woo-il?

227
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,166
Perhaps you guys hid him.

228
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:05,033
-We didn't do that.
-Who do you mean?

229
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,467
-Unbelievable.
-Mousse?

230
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:10,200
Hey, we know that you're here.

231
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,266
-Who are you looking for?
-I'll count to three.

232
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,433
One.

233
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:15,834
Two.

234
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:18,100
Three.

235
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,200
What?

236
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:22,934
What?

237
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:32,467
Oh, my!

238
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,066
Oh, my!

239
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,233
Catch him, you idiot!

240
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,567
-That startled me.
-He ran away.

241
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:42,867
My goodness.

242
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:44,433
-That startled me.
-He ran away.

243
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,633
-My goodness.
-I'm so scared.

244
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,667
-That man…
-It was like a movie.

245
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:50,967
Where was that man hiding?

246
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,467
What on earth is going on?

247
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,867
-This makes no sense.
-I mean…

248
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,165
That scared me.

249
00:13:58,233 --> 00:13:59,967
The scale got bigger.

250
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,767
-This is very embarrassing.
-What?

251
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,900
I hid behind JENNIE.

252
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:09,100
-What should I do? I hid behind her.
-Tae-hyun.

253
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,467
-Tae-hyun, you deserted JENNIE.
-It's too late.

254
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:12,533
It's too late.

255
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,300
JENNIE was suddenly in front of me.

256
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:20,133
-Where is that punk?
-Come on out, you punk!

257
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:25,734
He put me in between. Well done.

258
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
They were swinging wooden planks.

259
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,367
Are they thugs?

260
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,200
-I think so.
-What was that about?

261
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:33,433
According to the police,
there are around 160 gangs

262
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,867
and 1,600 gang members in Korea.

263
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,100
-That startled me.
-That startled me.

264
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:40,165
-Unbelievable.
-So scary.

265
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,867
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

266
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:45,433
-I should've known…
-Excuse me.

267
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,734
Have you seen this man?

268
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,900
-What should I do?
-What's wrong?

269
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:54,500
Excuse me. Have you seen this man?

270
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,567
He's someone precious to me.

271
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,767
-It's that man.
-The man with mousse in his hair.

272
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,600
Catch him, you idiot!

273
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,333
Have you seen him? Where was he?

274
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,133
We've seen him.
He was hiding here, but he ran away.

275
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,633
-She's crying for real.
-Please look at this photo.

276
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,400
Have you seen this man?

277
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:17,867
Please look at this photo.

278
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:19,834
He's the one who was under the table.

279
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,900
My goodness.

280
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:24,100
-He's someone precious to me.
-Really?

281
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,333
I really need to find him.

282
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:31,000
Catch him, you idiot!

283
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,533
He's someone precious to me.

284
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:40,400
Is he your husband?

285
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:42,266
You're a good actor.

286
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,066
-Na-ra.
-Do you want to join my agency?

287
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:47,233
-Stop it. She's in character.
-You're a good actor.

288
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,600
-She's really good.
-They took him away.

289
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,200
Do you know where they took him?

290
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:54,100
-They went that way.
-They went outside.

291
00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:56,100
-The men with weapons…
-What should I do?

292
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:58,100
If you find him later on…

293
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,867
I live in unit 407.

294
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:01,033
-Unit 407?
-Unit 407?

295
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,633
-Please come to apartment 101, unit 407.
-Okay.

296
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,800
-I must find him.
-Unit 407.

297
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:07,300
-I'll remember his face.
-This man…

298
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,667
-Okay.
-Thank you.

299
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,867
-Okay. Good luck.
-Thank you.

300
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:12,734
We'll root for you.

301
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,700
-She's a great actor.
-She's really good.

302
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,734
-She cried for real.
-She cried for real.

303
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,567
Maybe he's her husband in real life.

304
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,700
-Her actual husband.
-Her actual husband.

305
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:24,767
-Her husband?
-Yes.

306
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,033
This man must be connected
to the mystery item.

307
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:31,100
They force me to buy their…

308
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,133
-"Blank."
-He bought "blank."

309
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,133
-I suddenly lost my appetite.
-Seriously.

310
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,767
We can't eat comfortably.

311
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,667
-I know.
-If it's going to be like this,

312
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,500
we should always check the surroundings
when we enter a place.

313
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,500
-I was so startled.
-I was so startled.

314
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,300
How long was he in there?

315
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,066
I nearly fainted.

316
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:55,333
Is that woman looking for
the man we just met?

317
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,500
Is he her husband?

318
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,934
She didn't say.

319
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,800
She called him someone precious.

320
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:03,166
-I think we need to find him.
-Is that it?

321
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:04,633
It was unit 407, right?

322
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,633
-Unit 407.
-Apartment 101, unit 407.

323
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,633
When the thugs entered, I got so startled.

324
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,934
JENNIE, I'm sorry about hiding behind you.

325
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,165
So what exactly is happening today?

326
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,200
What's going on?

327
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:20,633
Are we supposed to find
the man who's precious to her?

328
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,532
Once we go to the apartment,
we should check out her unit.

329
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,834
-Please come to apartment 101, unit 407.
-Okay.

330
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,000
I must find him. Please.

331
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,300
-What was it? Unit 407?
-Apartment 104, unit 407?

332
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:35,533
-Unit 407.
-Right?

333
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,500
-Apartment 101, unit 407.
-I see.

334
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,066
-Where's apartment 104?
-Gosh.

335
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:40,900
-Is that your apartment?
-No.

336
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,934
Apartment 101, unit 407.
Are we going there?

337
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,266
Jung-ha is talking about the spy again.

338
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,367
Again?

339
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,867
-JENNIE, Jung-ha thinks it's you today.
-Me?

340
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:51,233
-No.
-I see.

341
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,400
She has never done it.
She has never been a spy.

342
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:55,467
-JENNIE?
-Yes.

343
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,333
-Please suspect me.
-No.

344
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,066
Hey, look at him.

345
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,266
-He's going alone.
-He's nervous.

346
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,000
-He's going alone.
-Is it you?

347
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,734
-Is it you?
-Jae-seok.

348
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,734
Seriously. Doesn't he stand out too much?

349
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,734
-I just had that thought.
-What's this?

350
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,133
-I'll go here.
-"Why am I dressed like this?"

351
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,667
Na-ra asked me,

352
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:19,400
"Jae-seok, are you the Grim Reaper?"

353
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:22,400
He thinks he's Lee Dong-wook
in Guardian: The Lonely and Great God.

354
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,166
Lee Dong-wook.

355
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:27,367
You look like the Grim Reaper
from the back.

356
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:30,633
-The Grim Reaper is wandering the earth.
-You know,

357
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,266
I did wonder why
I was the only one dressed this way.

358
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,333
You don't know the reason.

359
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,967
Why am I the only one dressed this way?

360
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,633
Apartment 101, unit 407, reply.

361
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,800
Apartment 101.

362
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,567
-All right.
-Isn't that it?

363
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:47,100
Those icicles look cool.

364
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,066
Isn't the atmosphere eerie?

365
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,233
It's like the calm before the storm.

366
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,934
That's apartment 101.

367
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,700
The apartment…

368
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,066
-Gosh, it's that man!
-It's that man.

369
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:59,066
The apartment…

370
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:02,233
-Gosh, it's that man!
-It's that man.

371
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,900
-Stop right there!
-It's that man!

372
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,967
-Stop right there!
-Should we catch him?

373
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,333
Should we catch him?

374
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,700
-It's money.
-Money.

375
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,166
Should we catch him?

376
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,533
-It's money.
-Money.

377
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,800
It's money.

378
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:15,967
Come here.

379
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:19,033
Come here.

380
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
My goodness.

381
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,567
My goodness.

382
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,767
Oh, no.

383
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:34,166
Get up. Come here.

384
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,033
-He hit him for real.
-I know.

385
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,400
-He can fight well.
-He can fight well.

386
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:41,767
Who is he?

387
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:46,967
What happened?

388
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,767
-He hit him so hard.
-My goodness.

389
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,900
-How dare you run away?
-My goodness.

390
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:57,867
-That must hurt.
-Gosh.

391
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:59,367
Shouldn't we help him?

392
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:04,400
Love isn't a sin!

393
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,266
It's a sin, you punk!

394
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,567
-What?
-What did he say?

395
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,633
-"Love isn't a sin."
-Love?

396
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,066
-There you go.
-A flying kick.

397
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:17,200
Love isn't a sin.

398
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,266
-If it's about love, what's that money?
-Why is he running away with money?

399
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:22,934
My goodness.

400
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,500
Run after him!

401
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:26,867
Catch him!

402
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,066
-Let's take the rest of the money.
-Money.

403
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:37,333
-Let's do it.
-Now.

404
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,433
Why are you picking up money?

405
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,333
-We don't even know what it is.
-What's this?

406
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,767
-Let's take it for now.
-There is so much.

407
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,100
These are old 10,000-won bills.

408
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,233
Who is that man?

409
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,934
He said, "Love isn't a sin."
It must be about that woman.

410
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:57,600
Love isn't a sin!

411
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,433
It's a sin, you punk!

412
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,367
He said, "Love isn't a sin."
It must be about that woman.

413
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,867
Love isn't a sin.

414
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:06,333
Falling in love quickly is a sin.

415
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,700
-You know…
-What could the story be?

416
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,900
Old bills were larger in size.

417
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:15,567
-Why are you talking about something else?
-Listen to us.

418
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:19,500
Why do you keep doing that?
You keep talking about something else.

419
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:22,333
-You're suspicious of me.
-What's up with you?

420
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,867
-What's going on?
-It's him today.

421
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:27,633
-What's up with you?
-Why do you keep changing the subject?

422
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,367
We were deducing.

423
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:32,233
Now, do you receive orders
without your knowledge?

424
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,734
-No.
-Is that it?

425
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,133
-No.
-All right.

426
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,600
-Now…
-Let's believe him.

427
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,400
We're just getting started today.

428
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,800
-We don't have enough clues yet.
-Right.

429
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:42,567
You need to give it time.

430
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:44,734
He's the Grim Reaper.

431
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,834
Shall we put the matter aside for now?

432
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,433
For goodness' sake.

433
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,867
Okay. We'll feign ignorance until lunch.

434
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:54,100
All right.

435
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,633
What will happen today?

436
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,900
-Are you excited?
-Yes, I like this. It's fun.

437
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:02,166
-Let's get things done today.
-Okay.

438
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,367
If you find him later on…

439
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:07,633
Please come to unit 407.

440
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,300
Is anyone home?

441
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,266
It's open.

442
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:22,233
This is the unit
the woman asked us to visit.

443
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,300
There will be clues inside, right?

444
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,633
-It's so cold outside.
-It's warm.

445
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,166
-It's nice.
-Shall we find the hints first?

446
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,500
Let's see.

447
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,133
This apartment is feminine.

448
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,233
My goodness.

449
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:42,700
This place is so cute.

450
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:59,467
Gosh, this place is clean.

451
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:01,467
Let's see.
Why is the weather so cold today?

452
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:04,100
-Why is the unit so small today?
-It's cozy.

453
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:07,667
It's Fame.

454
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
"Dancing Queen." Dirty Dancing.

455
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,233
You can…

456
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,166
That isn't it.

457
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:14,500
This is Dirty Dancing.

458
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:19,934
'Cause I've had the time of my life

459
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,233
Spin.

460
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:26,166
This is Dirty Dancing.

461
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:27,834
-You're good.
-Is this it?

462
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,633
You should be a musical actor.

463
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,266
Thank you, Na-ra.

464
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:40,567
What? Is this a dressing room?

465
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:44,400
The owner of this place
must really like flowers.

466
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:47,433
Why are there so many flowers?

467
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,700
There's a very old iron too.

468
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,967
After spraying water,

469
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:04,800
run the iron over the clothing.

470
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:10,567
I don't know yet.

471
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,500
Does she share this room with a man?

472
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,667
The bed is huge.

473
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:26,533
Is that man her husband?

474
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,533
Do you know where they took him?

475
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:35,000
We won't know unless we get a hint.

476
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:36,300
-Let's go.
-Okay.

477
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,367
Is this where that woman lives?

478
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:45,333
-We need to look thoroughly.
-Let's do that.

479
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,834
The First Day of the Twentieth Year.
Short Embrace, Long Goodbye.

480
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,500
I think the owner of the room
enjoyed watching romance movies.

481
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:55,500
MUSIC HISTORY
AND A SELECTION OF SONGS

482
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:57,400
What's this?

483
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,533
"Romantic." "Dancing Queen."

484
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,133
The owner of the room is in love.
Everything is about love.

485
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:05,834
Look.

486
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,867
Love.

487
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,300
And look at this. "Romantic."

488
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:15,734
Liszt composed music about love.

489
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,266
NOTHING IS MORE TOUCHING
THAN THE TRUTH

490
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,633
A SONG OF LOVE

491
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,367
-He's someone precious to me.
-Really?

492
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:38,867
-I really need to find him.
-Is he your husband?

493
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:43,500
Love isn't a sin!

494
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:45,133
It's a sin, you punk!

495
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,133
-I can't believe it.
-What?

496
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,567
JENNIE, don't look at this.
Jung-ha, don't look at this.

497
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,867
-Come on. I'm an adult.
-This.

498
00:25:53,934 --> 00:25:55,200
Don't look at this.

499
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:57,567
You know, it's strange.

500
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,667
A woman lives here.

501
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:03,200
But there are so many erotic movies.

502
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,300
-There's a photo. Give it to me.
-No, there isn't.

503
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:11,400
Yes, there is. I saw it.

504
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:13,567
-No, there isn't.
-Yes, there is. I saw it.

505
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,867
Se-chan.

506
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:17,133
Isn't this a photo of them?

507
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:21,567
-I think that's the same woman.
-I can't be sure.

508
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,967
What? Hold on, this is…

509
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:31,066
Let's take a look.

510
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:34,066
I can't read it, so you should read it.

511
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,066
Okay.

512
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,567
An article is highlighted.

513
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:38,934
-It's in a box.
-It's highlighted.

514
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:46,667
-Husband.
-Adultery.

515
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:48,567
-Adultery.
-Adultery.

516
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:51,400
"A woman goes to jail
for an affair with her husband's friend."

517
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:54,400
ADULTERY, HUSBAND
ADULTERY, JAIL

518
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:56,700
What's this? Husband's "blank" surgery.

519
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:57,800
Circumcision.

520
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,266
-It isn't circumcision.
-No?

521
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:03,066
"Husband's circumcision"?
It's sterilization surgery.

522
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:05,633
-Why would it be circumcision?
-Vasectomy.

523
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,300
"The Wife Who Didn't Know About
Her Husband's Sterilization Surgery

524
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:11,767
-Got Caught Due to Pregnancy.'"
-The theme is the same.

525
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:14,734
All the highlighted articles are
about adultery.

526
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
That's right.

527
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,100
That's the case.

528
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,633
We keep making deductions.

529
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:22,867
-I think Na-ra is right.
-What?

530
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,033
She had an affair.

531
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:27,600
Yes. Had it been her husband,
she would've gone, "He's my husband."

532
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:29,433
But she went, "He's someone I love."

533
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,900
He's someone precious to me.

534
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:34,300
Please look at this photo.

535
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:37,533
-In one word, it's adultery.
-Adultery.

536
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,867
THE WIFE WHO DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT
HER HUSBAND'S STERILIZATION SURGERY

537
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,433
If I hadn't met you…

538
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,000
You!

539
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,500
Jae-seok, I have a question.

540
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,834
Why did the thugs beat him up?

541
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,166
Take this, you punk!

542
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:56,633
Get a grip.

543
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,700
The thugs can't be her older brothers.

544
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:09,333
Maybe she asked the thugs to find him
because he ran with her money.

545
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,333
It was just an idea of mine.

546
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,867
-"It was just an idea of mine."
-It's okay, Jung-ha.

547
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:17,633
-We're sharing our ideas.
-Okay.

548
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,967
-So share your ideas.
-Understood.

549
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:23,834
There was something about liquor too.

550
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:26,567
Around the entertainment district,

551
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:30,333
gang members extort valuables
from business owners and customers.

552
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,200
They force me to buy their…

553
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,867
Perhaps they extorted money
from a distributor.

554
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:41,100
There was money.

555
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,567
They were obviously thugs

556
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:46,500
who seemed to be in charge
of an adult establishment.

557
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:47,533
Yes.

558
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,500
What is their connection to the woman?

559
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:51,300
They can't be her brothers.

560
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:53,500
This is hard. Today's story is hard.

561
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:56,500
Were there any incidents
about extorting money back then?

562
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:58,266
-Extorting money?
-From a woman or…

563
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,266
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

564
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,166
I was an elementary schooler back then.

565
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:04,233
-I'm sorry.
-I…

566
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,700
I thought you were from the netherworld.

567
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:10,567
I was an elementary schooler
back in this era.

568
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:13,367
-Aren't you 900 years old?
-No.

569
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:15,633
Does my outfit give you that impression?

570
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,367
Maybe.

571
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:22,166
It'll be hard for us to get
to the bottom of the story.

572
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:23,233
That's right.

573
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,500
All right. Let's play a game.

574
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:27,000
Let's go to unit 409.

575
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,033
Mr. Security Guard, you have a side job.

576
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,333
At the Happiness Cafe? That's my nephew.

577
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,066
Your nephew.

578
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,133
Let's play a game.

579
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,467
Today's game is We're Here for the Flower.

580
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:39,000
-Flower?
-Flower.

581
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:41,767
-Why did you come over?
-Why did you come over?

582
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:44,500
-We're here for the flower
-We're here for the flower

583
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:46,600
That's the game.
Stand with your teammates.

584
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,600
-Na-ra, Jung-ha, and me.
-Yes.

585
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:50,467
-We did that.
-Stand with your teammates.

586
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:56,200
Shall we play the game?

587
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:57,767
-Okay.
-Go first. Ready, go.

588
00:29:57,834 --> 00:30:00,967
-Why did you come over?
-Why did you come over?

589
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:04,300
-We're here for the flower
-We're here for the flower

590
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:07,233
-Which flower?
-Na-ra flower.

591
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,200
-We're here for the Na-ra flower
-We're here for the Na-ra flower

592
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,734
Here's what's different.
Instead of rock-paper-scissors,

593
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,367
-you'll have a mission.
-We pick one.

594
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:15,667
That's right.

595
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:20,633
"Bring a book
and read what's on page 13 the fastest."

596
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,834
-Page 13?
-Here it is.

597
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,033
These are difficult books.

598
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,266
-I'll go.
-Page 13.

599
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,467
"The big brother was Nol-bu

600
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:30,333
-and the little brother was Heung-bu."
-Okay.

601
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,033
"There was nowhere to lay his body."

602
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,967
Correct! Okay.

603
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,000
Yes.

604
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:37,633
If the attacking team wins,

605
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,400
they can bring the flower.

606
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:41,667
You'll keep playing
until one member remains.

607
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,867
-"Why did you come over?"
-Ready, go.

608
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:52,166
-Why did you come over?
-Why did you come over?

609
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:54,934
-We're here for the flower
-We're here for the flower

610
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,567
-Which flower?
-Which flower?

611
00:30:57,633 --> 00:31:02,900
-We're here for the JENNIE flower
-We're here for the JENNIE flower

612
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:03,967
Okay.

613
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:05,333
-JENNIE flower.
-Protect me.

614
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,467
We'll protect you.

615
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:07,533
All right.

616
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
All right.

617
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,000
All right.

618
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:17,734
"Bring three matching pairs of socks
from unit 407."

619
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Three pairs.

620
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:22,667
-Socks?
-Unit 407.

621
00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:25,166
-Where's unit 407?
-Unit 407.

622
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,200
Unit 407. We need to go.

623
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:28,700
JENNIE, we need to do it too.

624
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:31,266
Go out.

625
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,333
It's this unit.

626
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,767
Socks? Are there socks in here?

627
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:44,333
Hey.

628
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:48,734
Bring three matching pairs of socks
from unit 407.

629
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:54,600
-They're here.
-Are there socks?

630
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,667
Find the three pairs. Come here.

631
00:31:56,734 --> 00:31:58,900
-One.
-My goodness.

632
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,333
Are there socks?

633
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,700
-JENNIE, come here.
-All of them are different.

634
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,567
-JENNIE, come here.
-All of them are different.

635
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:14,200
-JENNIE, come here.
-All of them are different.

636
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,667
Give them to me.

637
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:26,233
Come on. I want to win just once.

638
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,400
Hurry up.

639
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:31,066
Can I have these socks?

640
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,467
-Jung-ha, hurry up.
-Hold on.

641
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:37,867
Hurry up. Let's go.

642
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,867
He fell for JENNIE.

643
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:47,100
-Here.
-Go away. What are you doing?

644
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,567
-Three pairs.
-Are those matching pairs?

645
00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:53,000
-My shoes.
-My shoes.

646
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:54,433
-Who took my shoes?
-Hey.

647
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,233
Where did my shoes go?

648
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,300
My shoes!

649
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,333
My shoes!

650
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:07,333
All right. One, two, three.

651
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,633
Okay. Ding, ding, ding. Okay.

652
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,500
-One, two, three.
-Ding, ding, ding.

653
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:13,333
Okay. Ding, ding, ding.

654
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,100
-Okay.
-One, two, three. Okay. Ding, ding, ding.

655
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:18,100
One, two, three. Okay.

656
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:20,967
-Hurry up, Se-chan!
-Two people remain.

657
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,233
Se-chan!

658
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,467
Jung-ha, hurry up!

659
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:26,266
-Our team…
-Why isn't he here?

660
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,200
-Hurry up.
-Our team needs to win.

661
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:30,567
-Se-chan!
-Jung-ha, hurry up!

662
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,433
-Can I wear a pair?
-Two people.

663
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,333
Go ahead.

664
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,000
-It's too cold.
-Go ahead and wear them.

665
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:40,300
Jung-ha.

666
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:42,734
Why isn't he here? Hurry up!

667
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:46,600
You always do this to me.

668
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:48,700
-I'm going.
-You always do this to me.

669
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,200
Seriously.

670
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:52,967
-This always happens. Please.
-You can't take the JENNIE flower.

671
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,033
-Okay.
-Jung-ha!

672
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,834
Jung-ha!

673
00:33:58,967 --> 00:33:59,800
I'm here!

674
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,133
Enter with him.

675
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,633
Enter with him.

676
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,266
All right. Okay.

677
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,000
-Okay!
-Good.

678
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:11,632
I always fall behind.

679
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,300
-Why did you fall behind?
-Well done.

680
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:14,967
What were you doing?

681
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,233
What are these footprints?

682
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:36,033
Since the defending team won,
they protected the flower.

683
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,100
Now, the positions will switch.

684
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,734
-Do we go first?
-Go first.

685
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,433
Ready, go.

686
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,033
-Why did you come over?
-Why did you come over?

687
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,533
-We're here for the flower
-We're here for the flower

688
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,800
-Which flower?
-Which flower?

689
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:53,065
-We're here for the Jung-ha flower
-We're here for the Jung-ha flower

690
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,533
Hey.

691
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,033
-He's happy.
-Why are you happy?

692
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,900
-No, I'm sad.
-You…

693
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:00,967

-Why are you happy?

694
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:02,233
No.

695
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,900
-Let's go.
-What's the mission?

696
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:09,633
"Jump rope ten times in the playground
and come back."

697
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,967
-For goodness' sake!
-Seriously.

698
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,200
JENNIE, hurry up!

699
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:18,967
Really?

700
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:23,800
Hey.

701
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,333
Hey, we need to go.

702
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,600
-We're on the same team anyway.
-Hold on.

703
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:31,967
Jae-seok, let's go.

704
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,333
For goodness' sake!

705
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,633
Hurry up, teammates!

706
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,200
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

707

-We'll go first.
-Go.

709
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,633
-Us?
-We'll go first.

710
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,867
No. One. Go in there.

711
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:50,834
-Go in there.
-Go in there.

712
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,700
One, two.

713
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:54,367
-Not yet.
-Three, four.

714
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:55,867
Come on in, Jung-ha!

715
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:57,266
-One.
-Good.

716
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,333
You got caught on the rope.

717
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,467
-Come on in, Jung-ha!
-I did.

718
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,934
Good. Okay.

719
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,867
-He did ten.
-Jae-seok!

720
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,433
-He did ten.
-Jae-seok!

721
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,066
He's running away by himself!

722
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,033
-What's up with him?
-He's unbelievable.

723
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,734
He's running away by himself!

724
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,667
-What's up with him?
-He's unbelievable.

725
00:36:14,734 --> 00:36:15,934
Aren't we a team?

726
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:18,900
Why… Then…

727
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,166
-We need to go again.
-Yes.

728
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:21,166
Let's team up.

729
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:23,133
Hey, we can do this.

730
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:26,166
The next time we attack,
we'll bring the two of you.

731
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:28,400
-Okay.
-Let's leave him alone. After this round,

732
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,567
we'll bring two members.

733
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:32,266
-Yes.
-Let's leave Jae-seok alone.

734
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,633
-Just him?
-Yes.

735
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,300
-Just lose this round. Five times.
-Let's hurry up.

736
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:39,100
-All right.
-I'll film it.

737
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:42,834
One, two, three, four, five.

738
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,000
-Success.
-This is incredible.

739
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:48,000
Jung-ha and Na-ra,
make sure you lose the next round.

740
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,967
All right? Let's go.

741
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,667
-Let's act like it was a dramatic win.
-Okay.

742
00:36:57,734 --> 00:36:58,567
Okay.

743
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,900
Please.

744
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,900
-Where is it?
-Here.

745
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:06,767
-I'm back!
-Okay!

746
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,066
-I'm exhausted.
-The third one.

747
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:11,667
-We did it!
-Yes!

748
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:17,967
-Okay!
-Okay!

-What's up with him?
-He's unbelievable.

764

…Korean companies have been actively
expanding into the Middle East.

765

to an increase in various crimes…

-Really?

768
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,767
I really need to find him.

769
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:17,667
Should I move to a different unit?

770
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:20,100
Yes. Jae-seok will move
to the other unit alone.

771

Jae-seok will move
to the other unit alone.

00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:30,567
-You guys…
-You have the unit to yourself.

775
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:32,633
I'm done with them today.

776
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,934
-Try fighting five-on-one.
-For goodness' sake.

777
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,333
That unit is warm.

778
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,834
Okay. We'll go.

This unit is cold.

783
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:51,934
Our plan worked well.

784
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:02,033
-Can I flatten your hair?
-You can.

785
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:03,867
Look at me.

786
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400

791
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:21,133
Is it Korean beef?

792
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:24,834
It's a special cut of beef.

793
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,100
It's a special cut of beef.

-A special cut of beef. Enjoy.

797
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:35,967
What's in here? Vegetables?

798
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:37,867
What?

00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,533
WHAT: SEARCH UNIT 407

"Search unit 407."

801
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:46,433
-I think there's a hint in the unit.
-I know.

802
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,934
I'll need to look around.

803
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:52,000
What could it be?

804
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,967

why don't you eat with me?

I don't like food made from flour.

820
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,667
It's sujebi. You need to make it yourself.

821
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:19,567
All the ingredients are here.

822
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,734
You need to make it.

00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,834
-Eat with me.
-I can't digest flour.

00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:02,367
Well…

836
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:04,934
You came to find a clue.

-Of course.
-You got a clue too.

838

00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:43,033
-What?
-What is it?

844
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,400
I figured it out.

845
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:47,400
Tell me. We're on the same team.

846
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,867

856
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,567
-Are these dance steps?
-Dance steps.

857
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:51,233
How do you know?

858
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,633
These are dance steps.

859
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,166
So everything is related to dance.

860
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:59,033
I don't know what's going on.

861
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,100
How is it related to that woman?

862
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,333
He's someone precious to me.

863
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,934
-Have you seen this man?
-Yes, we have.

864
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,200

Stop right there!

866
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:16,033
What was that money for?

867
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,000
Shall we watch this first?
Let's watch this first.

868
00:44:22,033 --> 00:44:24,200
We should watch it after Jae-seok leaves.

869
00:44:24,767 --> 00:44:26,266
-All right.
-Come on.

-All right.

871
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,066
You've spent enough time here.

872
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:31,967
I wouldn't say that.

873
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:35,834
-You should go back to your unit now.
-All right. For goodness' sake.

874
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:39,533
What's in unit 407?

875
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,100
For goodness' sake.

876
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:57,700
Married women
in their thirties and forties

877
00:44:57,767 --> 00:45:00,233
tend to visit…

878
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,500
They visit somewhere.

879
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,033
Many of them ruin their lives here

880
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,500
and shed tears.

881
00:45:07,066 --> 00:45:08,767
The so-called…

882
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:11,166
Who are they?

883
00:45:11,734 --> 00:45:14,567
I had friends with whom I saved money.

884
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:17,166
They said they were bored
and suggested going…

885
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:20,166
After three or four visits,
I was ensnared by a…

886
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:22,033
What?

887
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:24,266
It's a cabaret.

888
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:26,200
What's a cabaret?

889
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:28,133
-It's like a club.
-I see.

890
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:33,734
We're looking for a cabaret.

891
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:37,433
What did your husband do back then?

892
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,600
My husband was abroad.

893
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:41,266
He had been away for a year.

894
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:45,734
He asked me to borrow 500,000 won
so that he could run a business.

895
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,900
It didn't stop at once or twice.
He asked me three or four times.

896
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,266
Over the course of four months,
I gave him about…

897
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,967
Back then?

898
00:45:56,066 --> 00:45:57,600
He blackmailed me.

899
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:59,700
They extort valuables

900
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:01,834
and break up families in the end.

901
00:46:03,033 --> 00:46:04,734
While drinking, we…

902
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,367
For many hours, we…
Then we had a conversation.

903
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,834
"I'll tell your husband."

904
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,834
I extorted money that way.

905
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,100
What did they do for many hours?

906
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,433
Numerous…

907
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,300
…exist in Seoul.

908
00:46:19,133 --> 00:46:22,934
Their antics are becoming
more diverse and thorough by the day.

909
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,467
Such evils will have no place in society.

910
00:46:30,934 --> 00:46:32,000
What was that?

911
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:34,834
-A cabaret?
-Adultery.

912
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,467
-A cabaret…
-It isn't a crime of adultery, is it?

913
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:40,600
It can't be a crackdown on cabarets.

914
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:47,400
Is the word that goes in the "blank…"

915
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:49,000
The…

916
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,266
In that case…

917
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,066
I'm certain it's…

918
00:46:58,133 --> 00:47:00,834
I'm certain it's…

919
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,133
Why?

920
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,400
-Let's go, Detective JENNIE.
-Follow me.

921
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:06,133
-Let's go, Detective JENNIE.
-Follow me.

922
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,133
-Let's go.
-What is it, Detective JENNIE?

923
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,333
-What?
-Violets.

924
00:47:14,967 --> 00:47:16,000
-These are violets?
-Violets.

925
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,133
These are violets.

926
00:47:18,533 --> 00:47:21,066
In here, everything is about dance.

927
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:22,834
So, gigolo.

928
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,633
The so-called "gigolos."

929
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,967
Who are they?

930
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,433
This year, the nation saw economic growth.

931
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,233
The economic boom will continue.

932
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:51,767
Gigolos approach women
in cabarets and nightclubs

933
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:53,900
using dance as an excuse.

934
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:56,233
Then they seduce married women

935
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,266
and use their weaknesses
to extort valuables.

936
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,100
Gigolos must be good dancers.

937
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:05,800
For many hours, we dance.

938
00:48:05,867 --> 00:48:10,500
We date women
in order to borrow money from them.

939
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:14,867
…Korean companies have been actively
expanding into the Middle East.

940
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:18,500
The construction industry foresees
a second Middle Eastern boom.

941
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,333
They said they were bored
and suggested going dancing.

942
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,467
After three or four visits,
I was ensnared by a jebi-jok.

943
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:30,333
He threatened to tell my children.

944
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,133
The National Security Headquarters
decided to root out jebi-jok,

945
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,800
the delinquents who extort valuables
and break up families.

946
00:48:38,867 --> 00:48:41,967
With the police,
they raided a secret dance hall

947
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:43,734
in Oryu-dong, Seoul.

948
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,066
As people scrambled to avoid arrest,

949
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:48,333
they created chaos by turning over tables

950
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,633
and breaking beer bottles.

951
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:57,467
We're right.
Even the wallpaper shows dancers.

952
00:48:57,533 --> 00:48:59,600
All these clues are related to dance.

953
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:02,633
-Violets. Jebi-jok.
-I think those are dance steps.

954
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:06,467
-Gourd.
-A swallow, jebi, brings a gourd seed.

955
00:49:06,533 --> 00:49:08,033
TALE OF HEUNG-BU

956
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:18,467
The woman and the man met at a dance hall

957
00:49:18,533 --> 00:49:19,633
and fell in love.

958
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,967
So they met while dancing.

959
00:49:21,033 --> 00:49:24,033
The clues point to adultery too.

960
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,600
If they met while dancing,

961
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:33,433
the place must've been a club.

962
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,433
-So he really is a gigolo.
-Right?

963
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,200
Stop right there!

964
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:49,033
I have to eat something.

965
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:54,100
If I don't eat anything,

966
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:59,400
people will think that I'm not eating
because I'm alone.

967
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:02,333
But it isn't like that.

968
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:05,467
I feel like I'm filming I Live Alone.

969
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:10,000
Let's have a tasty meal.

970
00:50:10,834 --> 00:50:13,033
All right. Those punks.

971
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,266
I'll cook ramyeon in this broth.

972
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,166
Hold on. What's 127?

973
00:50:26,934 --> 00:50:29,567
I saw 127 someplace else too.

974
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,166
Why do I keep seeing 127?

975
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,200
What's 127?

976
00:50:43,266 --> 00:50:45,066
Look at this. It's 127.

977
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:46,967
It caught my eye earlier.

978
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:01,500
-What's 127?
-Seriously.

979
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,834
What's 127?

980
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:07,433
Why is 127 everywhere?

981
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:10,567
What's 127?

982
00:51:11,734 --> 00:51:14,166
-Isn't your birthday on January 27?
-No way.

983
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:15,300
-No?
-No.

984
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,100
You aren't 127 cm tall, are you?

985
00:51:18,934 --> 00:51:20,567
I had to check.

986
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:23,834
What's 127?

987
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,133
Hold on. What's this?

988
00:51:27,934 --> 00:51:30,667
-This is--
-It's a lake.

989
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:33,400
A lake. What's 127?

990
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:37,567
Did 127 mean anything back then?

991
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:39,533
I don't know what 127 is.

992
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,600
-I only know about NCT 127.
-What?

993
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:43,433
-NCT 127.
-What's that?

994
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,900
An idol group.

995
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:49,233
I said I didn't know what it was.
This is bad.

996
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,400
-Are they famous?
-Very.

997
00:51:51,467 --> 00:51:52,800
Oh, no.

998
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,166
JAE-SEOK LIVES ALONE

999
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:06,667
Is it boiling?

1000
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,734
All right. Let's eat first.

1001
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,967
Even hiking Mount Kumgang should be done
after a meal.

1002
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:14,000
I'll think about it after I eat.

1003
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:16,266
I'll put ramyeon in here.

1004
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,233
This is nice. My goodness.

1005
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,467
It looks delicious.

1006
00:52:22,033 --> 00:52:23,166
My goodness.

1007
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:27,834
Since this is broth…

1008
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,100
Sujebi ramyeon.

1009
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:50,033
Gosh, this is…

1010
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:10,033
This is a taste that makes you go wild.

1011
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,700
Even though it's just ramyeon…

1012
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,834
That's all there is?

1013
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:42,133
I had three mouthfuls.

1014
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,934
It's so tasty. I'm not jealous
of any delicacy right now.

1015
00:53:49,967 --> 00:53:52,166
Let's cook it here.

1016
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,300
Is this side burnt?

1017
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:57,367
Eat it.

1018
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,266
Is it good?

1019
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,033
It's tasty.

1020
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,066
-Yes.
-I keep eating it.

1021
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,367
Thank you.

1022
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,400
It's tasty.

1023
00:54:16,266 --> 00:54:19,900
I don't know what we're supposed to find.

1024
00:54:19,967 --> 00:54:20,800
Today?

1025
00:54:20,867 --> 00:54:23,133
-The gigolo?
-That's what I want to know.

1026
00:54:24,467 --> 00:54:26,467
I don't know what the money was about.

1027
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:29,033
Let go of me.

1028
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:33,467
I know. Why was he running away
with money?

1029
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:37,000
Money isn't the only problem. What's 127?

1030
00:54:42,233 --> 00:54:44,233
I'm so curious. What's the secret today?

1031
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:47,500
What?

1032
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:48,934
-I got goose bumps.
-Why?

1033
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,700
I know this because I've eaten it before.

1034
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:53,433
-It's game over.
-Is it good?

1035
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,667
-Because it tastes good?
-No.

1036
00:54:55,233 --> 00:54:57,500
Na-ra, this cut is
the beef neck chain, jebichuri.

1037
00:54:58,433 --> 00:55:00,300
Na-ra, this cut is
the beef neck chain, jebichuri.

1038
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,734
It's a special cut of beef.

1039
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,800
-Jebichuri.
-I should've known.

1040
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:13,500
Thus, we need to find the gigolo today.

1041
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,734
Thus, we need to find the gigolo today.

1042
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,533
-So that's why we got jebichuri.
-Yes.

1043
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,934
You like how I figured that out?

1044
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,467
-That was impressive.
-Yes.

1045
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:30,367
Then Jae-seok must be the gigolo.

1046
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:33,033
Why would Jae-seok be the gigolo?

1047
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:35,834
-He keeps going off on his own.
-We're suspicious.

1048
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,133
Are you suspecting me now?

1049
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,400
You suspected two people.

1050
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:42,100
You're a bit strange today.

1051
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:48,867
You're using your acting voice today.
You're a bit off.

1052
00:55:50,033 --> 00:55:51,433
She thinks you're a bit off.

1053
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:55,233
You know this, right?
Once you begin suspecting someone,

1054
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,734
-you can't stop.
-Right.

1055
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:59,667
Do you think Jae-seok is the gigolo?

1056
00:55:59,734 --> 00:56:00,834
Yes.

1057
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,633
Tae-hyun, I have a question.

1058
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,567
Jae-seok is in that predicament
because of his outfit, right?

1059
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:08,500
Here's the thing about Jae-seok.

1060
00:56:08,567 --> 00:56:11,433
-It was because of his outfit.
-Here's the thing about him.

1061
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,033
-It's time for him to play a role.
-It's about time.

1062
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,433
There are reasons.

1063
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,333
-And only his outfit looks strange.
-Right.

1064
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,033
We don't know what we're supposed to do
with the gigolo.

1065
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,300
That's why I'm confused.

1066
00:56:24,266 --> 00:56:30,667
-We don't know yet.
-It might be a ploy to distract us.

1067
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:32,567
-There must be a meaning.
-Right?

1068
00:56:32,633 --> 00:56:34,734
-I agree.
-We just don't have enough hints yet.

1069
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:42,033
Why… Where is he going?

1070
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,834
When you begin to suspect someone,

1071
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,633
everything they do looks suspicious.

1072
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,300
He keeps disappearing.

1073
00:56:54,767 --> 00:56:57,467
I'm the only one who looks after you.

1074
00:56:57,967 --> 00:57:01,367
Jae-seok, I've figured out everything.

1075
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,934
-I see why you got cornered.
-Why?

1076
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,300
Why isn't Jung-ha back yet?

1077
00:57:08,367 --> 00:57:10,934
-He had no reason to leave like that.
-Seriously.

1078
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,934
-He was very suspicious just now.
-Yes.

1079
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,500
They're talking about everything.

1080
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,667
Jae-seok, you need to help me.

1081
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,467
Tae-hyun, there must be more than one.

1082
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:26,867
I don't know what they're scheming
in the other unit.

1083
00:57:26,934 --> 00:57:30,633
In that unit,
there are three drawings of lakes.

1084
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:36,133
In that unit,
there are three drawings of lakes.

1085
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,433
-They must mean--
-Lakes?

1086
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,333
-Lakes.
-Seriously.

1087
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,000
Is 127 a unit number?

1088
00:57:44,066 --> 00:57:46,233
-A unit number?
-A unit number.

1089
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,300
Unit 127? It's the first floor.

1090
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,266
Or the seventh unit on the twelfth floor?

1091
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,734
I think it could be as you said
since there were drawings of lakes.

1092
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,834
Is it related to a unit number?

1093
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,900
Perhaps we'll find something
when we go there.

1094
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,700
I'll go to unit 407.

1095
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:12,734
There must be something.

1096
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,133
Let's go.

1097
00:58:17,633 --> 00:58:18,667
-Is he back?
-Tae-hyun,

1098
00:58:18,734 --> 00:58:20,834
-I'll use it.
-Why are you still eating?

1099
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,000
Hey, what's up with you?

1100
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,600
-I want ramyeon too.
-The ramyeon is really tasty.

1101
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:27,133
Jung-ha, the four of us talked.

1102
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,467
You're out of the group.

1103
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:30,300
-What's up with you?
-Sorry.

1104
00:58:30,367 --> 00:58:32,467
Think about it.
The clue was for the five of us.

1105
00:58:32,533 --> 00:58:34,400
But the two of you disappeared.

1106
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:37,333
I was only making deductions
in the other unit.

1107
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:52,000
-She came.
-What?

1108
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,734
-She came.
-She came.

1109
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,900
Did you find the man by any chance?

1110
00:58:58,934 --> 00:59:01,734
Please look at this photo.

1111
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,867
-We haven't found him.
-We haven't found him,

1112
00:59:04,934 --> 00:59:07,500
but we saw him fighting with some thugs.

1113
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:10,133
Do you know where he went?

1114
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,500
We don't know that.

1115
00:59:12,233 --> 00:59:14,100
He made a right turn.

1116
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:16,633
-He ran off with money.
-Really?

1117
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,533
The money…

1118
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,500
Is he your husband?

1119
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:22,200
-Is he your boyfriend?
-What's the nature of your relationship?

1120
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:26,867
To be honest, he isn't my husband.

1121
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:29,533
-He's my boyfriend. We met at a cabaret.
-I knew it.

1122
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,967
It seemed that way.

1123
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,533
-He's a gigolo.
-That's right. That explains the money.

1124
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,433
I knew it. It seemed that way.

1125
00:59:47,266 --> 00:59:48,633
For goodness' sake.

1126
00:59:50,734 --> 00:59:54,667
Would you please help me find him?

1127
00:59:54,734 --> 00:59:58,133
My husband will kill me
if I don't find him.

1128
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,567
-Why?
-Why?

1129
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:00,967
Did you give him money?

1130
01:00:01,033 --> 01:00:04,800
He took my money and a very precious item.

1131
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:07,266
…and a very precious item.

1132
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,033
I really need to find it.
My husband will kill me if I don't.

1133
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,967
-What kind of item is it?
-What is it?

1134
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:19,967
I can't tell you.

1135
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,834
If I don't get it back,

1136
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,100
my husband will beat me to death.

1137
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,400
Don't worry. We'll find the item.

1138
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:27,800
Please find it.

1139
01:00:27,867 --> 01:00:30,300
What was that?
Who are you to say you can find it?

1140
01:00:30,367 --> 01:00:33,300
-What was that?
-His voice sounded weak too.

1141
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:34,600
What was that?

1142
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:37,934
I really need to find it.

1143
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,834
I'll be kicked out of this house.

1144
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,967
-All right. We'll find it.
-We heard you.

1145
01:00:42,033 --> 01:00:44,800
-You need to tell us if you want help.
-Where should we go?

1146
01:00:44,867 --> 01:00:46,767
-Is there a clue?
-I don't know.

1147
01:00:46,834 --> 01:00:49,767
-You don't know.
-I don't know where the man went.

1148
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:52,633
-I'll look for him, so please do the same.
-Okay.

1149
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,500
-Thank you.
-Okay.

1150
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,133
Eat some ramyeon before you go.

1151
01:00:56,633 --> 01:00:59,100
She isn't in the right state of mind
for that right now.

1152
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:00,834
I need to find him.

1153
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:05,834
What could the item be?

1154
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,033
-Why is she so scared?
-Good question.

1155
01:01:08,633 --> 01:01:11,834
What's her precious item?
What's there other than money?

1156
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,400
She said her husband would kill her
if she didn't find it.

1157
01:01:14,467 --> 01:01:16,100
-House deed?
-Bankbook?

1158
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,333
-What is it?
-It's so hard.

1159
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:23,233
You're using your acting voice today.
You're a bit off.

1160
01:01:24,133 --> 01:01:26,767
Is 127 a unit number?

1161
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:40,567
Dear residents,
please come to the Senior Center.

1162
01:01:40,633 --> 01:01:43,033
Today… It isn't you, is it?

1163
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,200
It really isn't me.

1164
01:01:44,266 --> 01:01:46,967
-JENNIE, it isn't you, is it?
-Do I look bloated today?

1165
01:01:47,033 --> 01:01:48,867
-What?
-Why did you change the subject?

1166
01:01:48,934 --> 01:01:51,033
I had mala hot pot last night.

1167
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,233
-You look fine.
-You look especially pretty.

1168
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,133
-Thank you.
-I'm serious.

1169
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,900
What do you mean by especially pretty?

1170
01:01:57,967 --> 01:01:59,834
I should use that. "How do I look today?"

1171
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,333
"You look especially pretty."

1172
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,000
-Se-chan, look at the leaves.
-What?

1173
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,600
Catch them for a clue.

1174
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:09,066
A hint on the gigolo.

1175
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,900
We've gotten so obsessive.

1176
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:15,200
-I even suspect people at home.
-I know.

1177
01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:16,867
Time for another legendary game.

1178
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:18,834
We're here.

1179
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,600
Earlier, I had ramyeon.

1180
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:24,367
The empty packet looked dirty,
so I wanted to throw it away.

1181
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:26,467
But I couldn't find a trash can.

1182
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:29,433
I was wondering what to do
when a cameraman motioned me

1183
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,367
to give it to him.

1184
01:02:31,433 --> 01:02:35,033
I thought, "There must be
a trash can behind him."

1185
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,767
When I gave it to him,

1186
01:02:36,834 --> 01:02:39,934
-he put it in his pocket. Seriously.
-He put it in his pocket.

1187
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:42,700
There isn't a trash can.

1188
01:02:45,033 --> 01:02:46,033
Here you go.

1189
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,166
Here you go.

1190
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,934
My goodness, thank you.

1191
01:02:55,934 --> 01:02:57,667
He put it in his pocket.

1192
01:02:57,734 --> 01:02:59,133
-How cool.
-Why did he take it?

1193
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,567
-Why did he ask for it?
-How cool.

1194
01:03:01,633 --> 01:03:03,000
Seriously.

1195
01:03:03,066 --> 01:03:05,333
I would've been smitten.

1196
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,567
That's right.

1197
01:03:09,033 --> 01:03:12,800
The game you'll play this time is
the Nonsense Proverb Game.

1198
01:03:12,867 --> 01:03:15,467
-What's that?
-Nonsense Proverb Game.

1199
01:03:15,533 --> 01:03:19,166
A bear wearing a rabbit-ear headband
fell on its butt while sledding.

1200
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:20,900
-We'll make…
-Is that an actual proverb?

1201
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:23,066
-…nonsense proverbs like this.
-I see.

1202
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:27,000
Jung-ha will act out the subject,
"A bear wearing a rabbit-ear headband."

1203
01:03:27,066 --> 01:03:30,166
Another person will get the predicate,
"Fell on its butt while sledding."

1204
01:03:30,233 --> 01:03:32,667
-Guess the nonsense proverb.
-We need to guess it.

1205
01:03:32,734 --> 01:03:34,867
It's doable.
I thought it involved real proverbs.

1206
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:37,166
What do you want?
Shall I take the predicate?

1207
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:38,166
Want the subject?

1208
01:03:38,233 --> 01:03:40,333
-Which one do you want?
-I think he'll do well.

1209
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,834
What do you think?

1210
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,934
Ready, go.

1211
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,500
I have the subject, right?

1212
01:03:45,567 --> 01:03:46,567
Hold on.

1213
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:50,367
Woman.

1214
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,633
-Woman.
-No.

1215
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,633
Wig. Hair.

1216
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,100
-Long. Rapunzel.
-Yes.

1217
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,266
Princess.

1218
01:03:58,333 --> 01:03:59,633
Yu Jae-seok.

1219
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,567
No.

1220
01:04:03,133 --> 01:04:04,467
What are you doing?

1221
01:04:05,834 --> 01:04:07,467
Long-haired.

1222
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,934
Grasshopper.

1223
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,700
Grasshopper.

1224
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,200
A grasshopper with long hair.

1225
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:19,400
A grasshopper with long hair.

1226
01:04:19,467 --> 01:04:21,667
A stomachache.

1227
01:04:21,734 --> 01:04:23,667
A stomachache. B-boy.

1228
01:04:24,266 --> 01:04:26,033
A stomachache.

1229
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,934
A stomachache. B-boy.

1230
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Dancing like a b-boy with a stomachache.

1231
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:38,567
My goodness.

1232
01:04:38,633 --> 01:04:40,367
My goodness, she's good.

1233
01:04:40,433 --> 01:04:42,066
Well done.

1234
01:04:42,133 --> 01:04:43,233
Well done.

1235
01:04:48,066 --> 01:04:49,900
-It was hard.
-A muscular man.

1236
01:04:49,967 --> 01:04:51,633
A muscular man.

1237
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,066
A dog. A muscular dog.

1238
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:55,734
A muscular dog.

1239
01:04:58,834 --> 01:05:00,166
Yoga.

1240
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:07,767
That's unsightly.

1241
01:05:07,834 --> 01:05:09,100
Yoga.

1242
01:05:11,467 --> 01:05:13,133
Stretching.

1243
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,333
Yoga.

1244
01:05:15,734 --> 01:05:17,567
Like this.

1245
01:05:17,633 --> 01:05:19,133
-He's good.
-What is it?

1246
01:05:19,867 --> 01:05:21,166
Stretching.

1247
01:05:21,233 --> 01:05:22,567
Yoga.

1248
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:26,000
-What is it?
-It's something you do.

1249
01:05:26,066 --> 01:05:27,266
What is it? Hold on.

1250
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:28,767
"Let's do this."

1251
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,633
-A mermaid?
-No.

1252
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:34,700
Pilates. I see.

1253
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:39,700
He's good at explaining.

1254
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:44,967
-Doing Pilates while farting.
-Okay.

1255
01:05:45,033 --> 01:05:45,867
Okay.

1256
01:05:45,934 --> 01:05:48,166
-Oh, my god.
-Okay.

1257
01:05:48,233 --> 01:05:49,600
Good.

1258
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,734
Your ears are covered.

1259
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,433
Listening to music.

1260
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,266
Wearing earphones and listening to music.

1261
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,367
Sloth.

1262
01:06:03,433 --> 01:06:05,934
A sloth listening to music.

1263
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,700
A sloth wearing earphones.

1264
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,100
Putting on a backpack.

1265
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,000
Putting on a backpack.

1266
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:31,333
-Skydiving!
-Yes!

1267
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:33,834
-All right.
-They're good.

1268
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:35,867
-Skydiving!
-Yes!

1269
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,400
All right.

1270
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,633
-Hey.
-That was incredible.

1271
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,900
-Hey.
-That was incredible.

1272
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:45,633
How did she guess?

1273
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,166
Three, two, one.

1274
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,266
Give them a hard one.

1275
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:05,000
There you go. It's hard.

1276
01:07:05,066 --> 01:07:07,767
An itchy back.

1277
01:07:07,834 --> 01:07:10,500
Come here. Lie down.

1278
01:07:10,567 --> 01:07:13,000
-An itchy back.
-Okay.

1279
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,900
-What are you guys doing?
-A wrestler.

1280
01:07:15,967 --> 01:07:17,800
-What are you guys doing?
-A wrestler.

1281
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,467
-Okay.
-What are you guys doing?

1282
01:07:21,433 --> 01:07:24,200
-All right.
-A wrestler with an itchy back.

1283
01:07:24,266 --> 01:07:26,900
Jump roping.

1284
01:07:26,967 --> 01:07:29,367
What was it called? Double under?

1285
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,266
-Jump roping.
-One. Two.

1286
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:33,667
Double Dutch?

1287
01:07:33,734 --> 01:07:35,467
She's really good.

1288
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,100
I'll eat this.

1289
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:48,233
My goodness.

1290
01:07:49,133 --> 01:07:51,233
Eating something around bedtime?

1291
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,800
Late at night…

1292
01:07:54,834 --> 01:07:56,100
"Late at night."

1293
01:07:57,867 --> 01:08:00,433
-Eating a late-night snack!
-Correct.

1294
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,967
My goodness.

1295
01:08:02,033 --> 01:08:04,333
-Eating a late-night snack!
-Correct.

1296
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,867
My goodness.

1297
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:11,266
She's good.

1298
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:13,967
-So witty.
-They're good.

1299
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:17,500
Correct.

1300
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:22,399
-The game ends with the Chas' victory.
-Okay.

1301
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:23,567
We have a clue.

1302
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:25,500
Today, the losing team will get hints too.

1303
01:08:25,567 --> 01:08:28,166
-Really? Give them to us.
-The winners, the losers.

1304
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:29,700
We get two each.

1305
01:08:29,767 --> 01:08:31,200
What's inside?

1306
01:08:31,265 --> 01:08:32,332
Let's go and take a look.

1307
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,567
He took my money

1308
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:45,633
and a very precious item.

1309
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,332
I really need to find it.

1310
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:57,000
I think I'll accomplish something today.

1311
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,000
Shall we check out the hint?

1312
01:08:59,066 --> 01:09:01,100
Did we get two hints?

1313
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:03,033
-We got two today.
-We got two today.

1314
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,767
-Is this the first one?
-"Watch after the first one."

1315
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:10,734
WATCH AFTER THE FIRST ONE

1316
01:09:15,433 --> 01:09:17,667
Why are there two?

1317
01:09:18,834 --> 01:09:21,367
What's "Grade Three,
Class Two, Number Five"?

1318
01:09:22,633 --> 01:09:23,633
Are there two?

1319
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,934
-I think so.
-I think so.

1320
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,300
Let's watch this first.

1321
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,533
-Okay.
-The first video.

1322
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,300
We got two videos.
The winning team got more, right?

1323
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,233
Play.

1324
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,934
Hello, viewers.

1325
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,767
The biggest meth cartel in Korea

1326
01:09:55,834 --> 01:09:59,200
that made and sold meth nationwide
valued at 150 billion won

1327
01:09:59,266 --> 01:10:02,867
has been caught by the prosecution.

1328
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:04,367
Meth?

1329
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:06,033
-It was about drugs?
-Oh, my god.

1330
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,867
-Drugs.
-…has been caught by the prosecution.

1331
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,967
Why do I keep seeing 127?

1332
01:10:12,033 --> 01:10:13,433
What's 127?

1333
01:10:14,233 --> 01:10:16,900
What's 127? Hold on. What's this?

1334
01:10:25,467 --> 01:10:30,767
The arrested drug dealers
had boldly made 220 kg of meth.

1335
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:32,700
-Really?
-No way.

1336
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:35,567
The amount of meth they made
is equivalent to 7,300,000 doses

1337
01:10:35,633 --> 01:10:37,900
and worth over 150 billion won.

1338
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:41,133
-Imagine 150 billion won back then.
-Seriously.

1339
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,600
Were drugs prevalent even back then?

1340
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:45,500
Seriously.

1341
01:10:45,567 --> 01:10:47,433
Is it a drug cartel?

1342
01:10:49,367 --> 01:10:52,600
The ones who got caught making and selling
large quantities of drugs,

1343
01:10:52,667 --> 01:10:54,333
married couple…

1344
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,734
…had a secret factory set up
inside the apartment.

1345
01:10:58,533 --> 01:11:00,400
-What?
-…a secret factory set up…

1346
01:11:00,467 --> 01:11:02,600
A secret factory set up
inside the apartment?

1347
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:06,800
They sold large quantities of meth
to a Japanese smuggling ring

1348
01:11:06,867 --> 01:11:09,066
as well as American buyers.

1349
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:17,300
-A married couple?
-It was inside the apartment.

1350
01:11:17,367 --> 01:11:19,734
-So there are two. I knew it.
-That's right.

1351
01:11:20,867 --> 01:11:23,266
The married couple is among us.
The husband.

1352
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:24,533
The husband is among us.

1353
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:31,400
The couple was at the helm
of Korea's biggest drug trafficking ring.

1354
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:34,367
They set up a drug factory
inside the apartment

1355
01:11:34,433 --> 01:11:37,700
and pretended to be ordinary residents.

1356
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,867
Currently, the couple is on the run.

1357
01:11:42,867 --> 01:11:44,066
-What?
-What is it?

1358
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,834
It's that woman from earlier.

1359
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:47,934
-It's her.
-It's her.

1360
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,600
How chilling.
She's the woman we saw earlier.

1361
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,834
Currently, the couple is on the run.

1362
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,433
Have you seen this man?

1363
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,066
He's someone precious to me.

1364
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,367
I guess the gigolo ran with the drugs.

1365
01:12:08,433 --> 01:12:10,867
She said it'd be bad
if her husband found out.

1366
01:12:10,934 --> 01:12:12,300
-Drugs.
-The couple.

1367
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:15,133
The wife has been identified,

1368
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,200
but information on the husband
is quite limited.

1369
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:21,000
-We ask for any information you may have.
-Look at his physique.

1370
01:12:21,066 --> 01:12:22,266
Is that Tae-hyun?

1371
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:24,033
-Se-chan.
-It's Se-chan.

1372
01:12:24,734 --> 01:12:26,133
Is that Se-chan?

1373
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:30,200
The man and woman are similar in height.
Is that Se-chan?

1374
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:32,900
-Then the spy is a man.
-Yes.

1375
01:12:32,967 --> 01:12:35,367
-The married couple…
-Tae-hyun is in trouble.

1376
01:12:35,433 --> 01:12:37,633
-The married couple…
-Tae-hyun is in trouble.

1377
01:12:40,266 --> 01:12:42,300
The drug trafficking couple. Okay.

1378
01:12:42,367 --> 01:12:43,934
-Okay.
-The first video.

1379
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,467
Okay. So we need to catch the husband.

1380
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:47,700
Put the second tape in.

1381
01:12:56,233 --> 01:12:57,166
-What?
-What?

1382
01:12:57,233 --> 01:12:58,233
What?

1383
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,767
-It's him.
-That gigolo.

1384
01:13:05,033 --> 01:13:07,700
Love isn't a sin!

1385
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:11,233
-Have you seen this man?
-Yes, we have.

1386
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,266
-He's someone precious to me.
-Really?

1387
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:15,867
-What?
-It's him.

1388
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:17,467
-The gigolo.
-The gigolo.

1389
01:13:17,533 --> 01:13:22,300
I'm the gigolo who manipulated people
for my own gain.

1390
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:27,333
However, I'm also this couple's victim.

1391
01:13:28,066 --> 01:13:30,033
This is driving me crazy.

1392
01:13:31,233 --> 01:13:33,867
They drugged me secretly

1393
01:13:33,934 --> 01:13:37,300
and threatened to call the police
if I didn't deliver drugs.

1394
01:13:37,834 --> 01:13:40,533
Before more people fall victim like me,

1395
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,800
I want to confess everything
to the police.

1396
01:13:44,367 --> 01:13:47,633
So I hid the drug suitcase
I was supposed to deliver

1397
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,667
in a secret place.

1398
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:51,700
He took my money

1399
01:13:51,767 --> 01:13:53,800
and a very precious item.

1400
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:56,934
…my husband will beat me to death.

1401
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:01,834
-The precious object was drugs.
-I see.

1402
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:02,900
A secret place.

1403
01:14:05,667 --> 01:14:08,600
I want to share the location with you,

1404
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:12,433
but I heard the husband's voice
at the tteokbokki place.

1405
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:15,333
He heard the husband's voice.

1406
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,500
-It's one of us.
-The husband is one of us.

1407
01:14:19,066 --> 01:14:22,133
-How mischievous.
-Mister, you're annoying.

1408
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,433
My goodness.

1409
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:33,467
Who is it among us?

1410
01:14:36,367 --> 01:14:39,567
Find the missing suitcase
before the husband

1411
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:41,533
and burn it in the incinerator.

1412
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:45,000
-The incinerator was at the playground.
-Yes.

1413
01:14:45,066 --> 01:14:47,000
We need to put it there.

1414
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,166
-I found it.
-Don't lie.

1415
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:49,734
Tell us.

1416
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,400
If you look at the incinerator…

1417
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,633
-Today, we need to find something.
-And burn it there?

1418
01:15:00,767 --> 01:15:02,233
-The incinerator.
-You're right.

1419
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,000
-How did you know?
-It was a hunch.

1420
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,233
There was a reason why I avoided them.

1421
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:11,233
I told you earlier
that the woman was a bad person.

1422
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:15,367
The one who tried to disregard
my opinion was Se-chan.

1423
01:15:15,433 --> 01:15:18,000
-The woman is a bad person.
-Why?

1424
01:15:19,066 --> 01:15:22,400
-We feel for her more than the man, right?
-Yes.

1425
01:15:22,467 --> 01:15:24,400
-That's what's dangerous.
-Nonsense.

1426
01:15:24,467 --> 01:15:26,834
He makes deductions haphazardly.

1427
01:15:29,467 --> 01:15:32,633
Whenever I brought it up,
Se-chan changed the subject.

1428
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,266
-So the husband is among us.
-Yes.

1429
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:36,800
And it's you, Tae-hyun.

1430
01:15:36,867 --> 01:15:38,967
It isn't me. Why do you keep saying that?

1431
01:15:39,033 --> 01:15:41,200
-Then…
-Why do you keep saying that?

1432
01:15:41,266 --> 01:15:43,033
-Everyone suspects you.
-For goodness' sake.

1433
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:46,867
-Jae-seok or you.
-The one who's it stays the quietest.

1434
01:15:46,934 --> 01:15:48,500
-Was I quiet today?
-Yes.

1435
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,433
You were much quieter than usual.

1436
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:57,533
This is an announcement.

1437
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:03,467
The husband who is hiding among you
is carrying out a special mission.

1438
01:16:03,533 --> 01:16:07,033
Firstly, he made physical contact
with the wife.

1439
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:07,967
-What?
-What?

1440
01:16:08,033 --> 01:16:12,834
Secondly, he succeeded in the mission
of hearing "like" from the members.

1441
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,000
"Like"?

1442
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:17,467
-"Like"?
-"Like"?

1443
01:16:18,633 --> 01:16:21,300
We talked about the songs we liked
when we made song requests.

1444
01:16:21,367 --> 01:16:23,400
We went, "I really like this song."

1445
01:16:23,467 --> 01:16:24,967
-It's Starry Night.
-Starry Night.

1446
01:16:25,033 --> 01:16:26,266
Lee Moon-sae.

1447
01:16:27,133 --> 01:16:28,500
My goodness.

1448
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:31,300
You liked me

1449
01:16:32,367 --> 01:16:33,367
You're right.

1450
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,033
"I really like it."

1451
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:39,900
Now, I'll explain the final mission.

1452
01:16:39,967 --> 01:16:43,333
You must find the suitcase full of drugs
before the husband,

1453
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,500
the drug dealer,

1454
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:49,567
and burn it in the incinerator by 3 p.m.

1455
01:16:49,633 --> 01:16:52,266
Then the ordinary residents will win.

1456
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:55,200
On the other hand, the husband's objective

1457
01:16:55,266 --> 01:16:59,433
is to put the suitcase
in a drum that says "Smuggling out"

1458
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,900
and succeed in smuggling out the drug.

1459
01:17:02,967 --> 01:17:04,500
Then he will win.

1460
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:08,533
However, only one person can enter
the incineration area at a time.

1461
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,734
So please choose wisely.

1462
01:17:20,033 --> 01:17:21,800
I figured it out. Come here.

1463
01:17:21,867 --> 01:17:23,967
-It's you.
-Come here.

1464
01:17:24,033 --> 01:17:26,000
-Stop it. Come here.
-You…

1465
01:17:26,066 --> 01:17:27,166
Who do you think it is?

1466
01:17:27,233 --> 01:17:30,000
-Come here.
-It's you, isn't it?

1467
01:17:30,066 --> 01:17:31,367
-Come here.
-Hey.

1468
01:17:31,433 --> 01:17:32,500
It's one of the four.

1469
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:34,100
-It's Tae-hyun.
-Why?

1470
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:35,734
-It's Tae-hyun.
-Why?

1471
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,900
-What did I do?
-Tae-hyun.

1472
01:17:36,967 --> 01:17:38,200
I saw everything.

1473
01:17:38,266 --> 01:17:39,900
What did I do? What did you see?

1474
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,266
The husband accomplished the mission.

1475
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:43,734
-What mission?
-"Like"?

1476
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,233
Hearing "like"
and making physical contact with the wife.

1477
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,100
Tae-hyun was the only one.
I saw him hold her hand.

1478
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,100
When did he do that?

1479
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,567
-I saw him hold her hand.
-When did he do that?

1480
01:17:53,633 --> 01:17:55,033
I saw him do this.

1481
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:58,200
-He went, "Why are you shaking so much?"
-That's right.

1482
01:17:58,266 --> 01:18:01,000
-That's right.
-He did that.

1483
01:18:01,066 --> 01:18:03,500
-We got you.
-Today…

1484
01:18:03,567 --> 01:18:06,200
Everyone made physical contact
at the tteokbokki place.

1485
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:08,967
Everyone made physical contact
at the tteokbokki place.

1486
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,333
Excuse me.

1487
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,633
Have you seen this man?

1488
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,834
Please look at this photo.

1489
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,000
Please come to apartment 101, unit 407.

1490
01:18:21,066 --> 01:18:23,734
-She's crying for real.
-She's crying for real.

1491
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,767
-Please help me.
-Unit 407.

1492
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,967
See? Why would you corner me like this?

1493
01:18:31,033 --> 01:18:33,066
-I mean…
-Is that your antic?

1494
01:18:34,867 --> 01:18:37,233
What's important is finding the suitcase.

1495
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:39,000
Yes, we need to find the suitcase.

1496
01:18:39,066 --> 01:18:42,000
-What's important is finding the suitcase.
-Okay.

1497
01:18:42,066 --> 01:18:44,667
-Where is the suitcase?
-Let's go outside.

1498
01:18:44,734 --> 01:18:47,834
Staying in the apartment
won't get us anywhere.

1499
01:18:49,734 --> 01:18:51,767
Are we running again?

1500
01:18:51,834 --> 01:18:53,367
We don't know where to go.

1501
01:18:53,433 --> 01:18:55,900
Where are we going? We should know that.

1502
01:18:55,967 --> 01:18:58,934
Where is everyone going?

1503
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,500
I don't know either.

1504
01:19:00,567 --> 01:19:02,633
I don't know where I'm going.

1505
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,467
-You and I aren't the husband.
-We aren't the husband.

1506
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:09,500
It'd be nice for us to search together.

1507
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,867
Where should we go?

1508
01:19:11,934 --> 01:19:13,900
Grade Three, Class Two, Number Five?

1509
01:19:19,467 --> 01:19:22,233
Is that a unit number?

1510
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,100
Grade Three. The third floor.

1511
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,200
Where would it be?

1512
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,166
I think we should go to the first floor.

1513
01:19:32,233 --> 01:19:34,867
Today, I'll be the guard.

1514
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:39,633
-It's too hard.
-Yes.

1515
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,467
Where did the suitcase come from?

1516
01:19:41,533 --> 01:19:43,633
How many tapes did you have?

1517
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,934
Two.

1518
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,700
It makes no sense.

1519
01:19:46,767 --> 01:19:50,000
It looks like both teams received
the same hints.

1520
01:19:50,066 --> 01:19:50,934
That's right.

1521
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,300
Usually, the winning team gets
something else.

1522
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,433
-The Yus.
-My goodness.

1523
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:00,834
-Just the three of us?
-Yes.

1524
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,333
Give it to us.

1525
01:20:03,433 --> 01:20:05,000
Is it "Bath"?

1526
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,633
Put it inside. The sole of the foot.

1527
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:12,266
How did the winning team get
the same hints as the losing team?

1528
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,100
It makes no sense.

1529
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:19,166
Were there only two tapes in the bag?

1530
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,033
-There was something else, right?
-I didn't see.

1531
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,467
-Tae-hyun.
-Anyone…

1532
01:20:23,533 --> 01:20:27,300
-JENNIE. The Chas, come here.
-The Chas will have a meeting.

1533
01:20:27,367 --> 01:20:29,166
What could it be?

1534
01:20:29,233 --> 01:20:31,333
Grade Three, Class Two, Number Five.

1535
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,433
Grade Three, Class Two, Number 19.

1536
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,700
So 325 and 3219.

1537
01:20:34,767 --> 01:20:36,300
-Everyone suspects me.
-I won't.

1538
01:20:36,367 --> 01:20:38,934
But you didn't hide a hint, did you?

1539
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:41,100
-No.
-No?

1540
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:42,266
Then what?

1541
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:44,033
What are you?

1542
01:20:45,567 --> 01:20:47,333
You know something, don't you?

1543
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,600
Are you wearing a necklace?

1544
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:52,900
-A necklace?
-Can I feel your chest?

1545
01:20:52,967 --> 01:20:54,633
-He doesn't have it.
-What necklace?

1546
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,100
Can I feel your chest?

1547
01:20:56,166 --> 01:20:57,333
-He doesn't have it.
-What necklace?

1548
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,700
-The other half.
-See?

1549
01:20:58,767 --> 01:21:00,800
What? What's the hint?

1550
01:21:00,867 --> 01:21:03,200
-What?
-That woman had…

1551
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:08,033
Please come to apartment 101, unit 407.

1552
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,133
I must find him.

1553
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,066
-She's wearing a half-heart necklace.
-A half-heart necklace?

1554
01:21:13,133 --> 01:21:15,100
A half-heart necklace.

1555
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:16,800
-Thank you.
-Is he her husband?

1556
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,233
Seriously, I…

1557
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,600
-Come here.
-There's something.

1558
01:21:30,667 --> 01:21:31,667
Well…

1559
01:21:33,066 --> 01:21:35,467
I'm only sharing it with you guys.

1560
01:21:35,533 --> 01:21:37,800
I'll show you that it's definitely not me.

1561
01:21:37,867 --> 01:21:38,967
-Okay?
-Okay.

1562
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:40,567
Are you taking us somewhere?

1563
01:21:40,633 --> 01:21:42,533
I'm taking you somewhere.

1564
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,033
What? Tae-hyun.

1565
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,500
He has something. A key.

1566
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,900
-Trust me. It really isn't me.
-Tae-hyun.

1567
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:54,767
We get two each.

1568
01:21:54,834 --> 01:21:55,900
What's inside?

1569
01:21:55,967 --> 01:21:57,467
It's so hard.

1570
01:21:58,467 --> 01:22:01,400
-It was really tasty.
-Why am I so drowsy?

1571
01:22:17,934 --> 01:22:20,400
-It really isn't me.
-Tae-hyun. Why did you hide it?

1572
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:21,467
What?

1573
01:22:21,533 --> 01:22:23,967
-I didn't know who it was.
-Let's hurry up.

1574
01:22:24,033 --> 01:22:27,400
-Right.
-I'm certain it's Jung-ha.

1575
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:28,467
Jung-ha?

1576
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,400
-I found him suspicious all along.
-Okay.

1577
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:40,433
I'm sharing this clue
because I'm certain it's Jung-ha.

1578
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,166
-I'm sorry.
-Why?

1579
01:22:42,233 --> 01:22:43,767
-It was a force of habit.
-Right.

1580
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,066
-You know what I mean.
-Yes.

1581
01:22:45,133 --> 01:22:47,433
-It's a habit.
-It's understandable.

1582
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,934
I would've taken it too.
It's obviously the best clue.

1583
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,166
You know what I mean.

1584
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:53,266
I…

1585
01:22:56,934 --> 01:22:58,367
How did you know?

1586
01:22:58,433 --> 01:23:00,433
-Gosh.
-The unit number is on the key.

1587
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,700
-Gosh.
-The unit number is on the key.

1588
01:23:02,767 --> 01:23:05,266
-It's the drug factory.
-This is it.

1589
01:23:06,266 --> 01:23:09,567
The ones who got caught making and selling
large quantities of drugs…

1590
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,300
married couple…

1591
01:23:11,367 --> 01:23:16,367
had a secret factory set up
inside the apartment.

1592
01:23:29,066 --> 01:23:32,467
The amount of meth they made
is equivalent to 7,300,000 doses

1593
01:23:32,533 --> 01:23:35,066
and worth over 150 billion won.

1594
01:23:40,667 --> 01:23:42,734
-This is unbelievable.
-My goodness.

1595
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,100
This is unbelievable.

1596
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,367
Isn't that Jung-ha?

1597
01:23:48,867 --> 01:23:50,300
Isn't that Jung-ha?

1598
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:17,066
Look at this.

1599
01:24:18,266 --> 01:24:20,567
-Grade Three, Class Two… Hey.
-The suitcase…

1600
01:24:20,633 --> 01:24:23,433
-Grade Three, Class Two… Hey.
-The suitcase…

1601
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:34,867
-It was…
-Grade Three, Class Two, Number Five.

1602
01:24:34,934 --> 01:24:36,333
-Grade Three, Class Two, Number 19.
-And?

1603
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,934
-Number 19.
-Is that right?

1604
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Yes.

1605
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,600
Kim Sang-ah.

1606
01:24:41,667 --> 01:24:43,667
-Choi Geum-ja?
-Choi Geum-ja?

1607
01:24:54,133 --> 01:24:56,100
"Where"?

1608
01:24:56,166 --> 01:24:58,500
Kim Sang-ah. Choi Geum-ja.

1609
01:24:58,567 --> 01:25:00,433
-It isn't me.
-Kim Sang-ah.

1610
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,066
The suitcase should be here. Where is it?

1611
01:25:10,834 --> 01:25:12,900
He's definitely young.

1612
01:25:12,967 --> 01:25:14,400
Jung-ha.

1613
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,166
Yes?

1614
01:25:19,734 --> 01:25:21,867
What? That unit is strange.

1615
01:25:21,934 --> 01:25:22,967
Na-ra.

1616
01:25:25,433 --> 01:25:27,266
Go to the fifth floor.

1617
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:28,800
What? A camera is set up.

1618
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:41,734
-When did you guys come here?
-You startled me.

1619
01:25:42,467 --> 01:25:43,633
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1620
01:25:44,133 --> 01:25:46,834
-Seriously.
-Such a place existed.

1621
01:25:51,834 --> 01:25:53,000
It isn't me.

1622
01:25:53,066 --> 01:25:55,300
How did you find it? Is this it?

1623
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:57,867
-Grade Three…
-Class Two, Number Five.

1624
01:25:57,934 --> 01:25:59,834
Who are Kim Sang-ah and Choi Geum-ja?

1625
01:26:02,934 --> 01:26:04,600
You guys had something else.

1626
01:26:04,667 --> 01:26:06,800
I spotted it and set it aside.

1627
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,133
Where are you going?

1628
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:17,400
Where are you going?
See? Jung-ha is leaving.

1629
01:26:17,467 --> 01:26:19,367
Jung-ha is leaving, everyone.

1630
01:26:19,433 --> 01:26:21,600
-Stay by his side.
-I'll do that.

1631
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,533
-This is a clue for "where."
-I know.

1632
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,400
-Number 5 is Kim Sang-ah.
-Number 19 is--

1633
01:26:31,467 --> 01:26:32,800
Choi Geum-ja.

1634
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,567
Where did Tae-hyun go?

1635
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,667
He went somewhere.

1636
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,100
Where did Tae-hyun go?

1637
01:26:46,934 --> 01:26:49,734
Jae-seok. For goodness' sake.

1638
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:58,934
Sang-ah Top, Geum-ja Top.

1639
01:27:03,266 --> 01:27:05,200
Sang-ah Top, Geum-ja Top.

1640
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:20,100
Sang-ah Top, Geum-ja Top.

1641
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:22,200
It's the rooftop.

1642
01:27:31,567 --> 01:27:34,266
So I hid the drug suitcase…
in a secret place.

1643
01:27:38,533 --> 01:27:39,734
-Se-chan.
-Yes?

1644
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,867
-Where are you?
-Jae-seok went up.

1645
01:27:41,934 --> 01:27:43,667
-Up?
-I think he found it.

1646
01:27:43,734 --> 01:27:45,266
-You think he found it.
-Yes.

1647
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,600
I spotted it and set it aside.

1648
01:28:14,033 --> 01:28:16,300
Where are you going?
See? Jung-ha is leaving.

1649
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:27,400
See?

1650
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:39,233
-He found it!
-What?

1651
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,333
-Na-ra.
-What?

1652
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,500
-Where?
-See?

1653
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:43,033
-It's him.
-I found it.

1654
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,133
It's him.

1655
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,433
Na-ra, it isn't me. It's Tae-hyun.

1656
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,133
-What is he saying?
-Seriously.

1657
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,333
It was here when I got here.

1658
01:28:50,934 --> 01:28:52,900
Which one of you is it?

1659
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:55,166
Na-ra, let me make it clear.

1660
01:28:55,233 --> 01:28:57,600
-All along…
-You've behaved strangely.

1661
01:28:57,667 --> 01:28:59,233
I thought he was behaving strangely.

1662
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,433
I'll go downstairs with Na-ra.

1663
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,100
Do that. Okay. For goodness' sake.

1664
01:29:03,166 --> 01:29:04,934
-What's going on?
-It isn't me.

1665
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,100
Hold on to Tae-hyun.

1666
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:07,633
See? It's him.

1667
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,433
-I'll grab the suitcase.
-Together.

1668
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:10,967
-Come on.
-I'll grab the suitcase.

1669
01:29:11,033 --> 01:29:12,834
-Okay.
-We're carrying it together.

1670
01:29:18,867 --> 01:29:21,266
I can't believe that punk.

1671
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:23,166
-What did he say?
-What?

1672
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:26,367
For goodness' sake. This is frustrating.

1673
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,734
Come this way.

1674
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,133
Come this way.

1675
01:29:33,333 --> 01:29:35,500
Gosh, they're running away.

1676
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:38,867
-Hey.
-Na-ra, follow me.

1677
01:29:40,133 --> 01:29:42,533
Hey, you punk!

1678
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,567
Was it you?

1679
01:29:45,433 --> 01:29:46,533
Hey, you punk!

1680
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,300
Jung-ha took it.

1681
01:29:51,367 --> 01:29:53,333
-This is driving me crazy.
-Where is he?

1682
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,300
Where is he? Sang-ah Top, Geum-ja Top.

1683
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,467
Tae-hyun will follow us.

1684
01:30:03,533 --> 01:30:05,333
-You…
-It isn't me.

1685
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,934
-What was that?
-Hide.

1686
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,867
-What was that?
-Hide.

1687
01:30:08,934 --> 01:30:10,567
This is driving me crazy.

1688
01:30:10,633 --> 01:30:13,200
Hide so that they can't find us.

1689
01:30:13,266 --> 01:30:14,734
It was at the rooftop, right?

1690
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,633
-Jae-seok, Jung-ha drives me insane.
-What?

1691
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,667
Na-ra fell for his antics.

1692
01:30:19,734 --> 01:30:22,100
-How did he know?
-We need to catch him.

1693
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:25,533
-Did he take it?
-Jung-ha took it.

1694
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,333
For goodness' sake.

1695
01:30:27,934 --> 01:30:29,867
I figured it out too late.

1696
01:30:30,767 --> 01:30:32,500
Let's go together.

1697
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:35,367
Let's go together.

1698
01:30:35,433 --> 01:30:37,600
-For goodness' sake.
-We should duck.

1699
01:30:38,367 --> 01:30:40,200
Lure them, okay?

1700
01:30:42,934 --> 01:30:46,166
I shouldn't lure them.
I'm suspicious of you too.

1701
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:51,433
-What?
-Hey.

1702
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,233
-Jung-ha took it.
-Where is it?

1703
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,600
Jung-ha found it.

1704
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:57,600
Jung-ha found it?

1705
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:03,400
Why is no one suspecting Jung-ha?
This is so frustrating.

1706
01:31:03,467 --> 01:31:05,934
-I'm suspicious of Na-ra too.
-What?

1707
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,867
The husband could be a woman.

1708
01:31:07,934 --> 01:31:09,533
It could be a trap.

1709
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,233
Let's go together. Let go.

1710
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,233
No. Why would I let go?
Let's carry it together.

1711
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:16,734
-Okay.
-Together.

1712
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:25,800
Where will we find Jung-ha?

1713
01:31:25,867 --> 01:31:29,100
-Na-ra isn't around.
-She's with him.

1714
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:43,100
There are no such rules.

1715
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:45,133
There are no such rules.

1716
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,333
Did Jung-ha find the suitcase?

1717
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,600
-Jung-ha found it.
-This is ridiculous.

1718
01:31:50,266 --> 01:31:53,967
-It should've been here.
-By the way, why is there hot water?

1719
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,200
…why is there hot water?

1720
01:32:04,767 --> 01:32:06,500
-Pour it.
-Okay.

1721
01:32:06,567 --> 01:32:08,133
-See if words come out.
-Tea.

1722
01:32:14,867 --> 01:32:16,467
A picture is starting to appear.

1723
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,567
A picture is starting to appear.

1724
01:32:25,266 --> 01:32:27,367
-There are no such rules. No.
-Come on.

1725
01:32:27,433 --> 01:32:29,066
Come here.

1726
01:32:29,133 --> 01:32:32,133
-There are no such rules.
-We can't let Tae-hyun have it. Run.

1727
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:34,800
-Come here.
-Hurry up.

1728
01:32:34,867 --> 01:32:37,166
Let go.

1729
01:32:41,533 --> 01:32:43,767
Come here.

1730
01:32:44,333 --> 01:32:45,533
Hey!

1731
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:48,567
Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1732
01:32:48,633 --> 01:32:49,633
Hey!

1733
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,133
Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1734
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,934
Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1735
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,667
Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1736
01:32:58,734 --> 01:33:01,800
Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1737
01:33:04,533 --> 01:33:06,600
A picture is starting to appear.

1738
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,700
-Na-ra.
-Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1739
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,266
Na-ra, catch Jung-ha.

1740
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:16,233
-Na-ra, take it.
-Na-ra, catch Jung-ha.

1741
01:33:21,867 --> 01:33:23,900
-Come on!
-Na-ra!

1742
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:28,867
-Come on!
-Na-ra!

1743
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,567
-Come on!
-Na-ra!

1744
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:43,667
If we're looking for the husband,
it isn't a woman.

1745
01:33:45,433 --> 01:33:47,567
Tae-hyun.

1746
01:33:47,633 --> 01:33:49,967
-You suspected two people.
-You're a bit strange today.

1747
01:33:50,033 --> 01:33:53,200
Are you suspecting me now?

1748
01:33:53,266 --> 01:33:56,066
You're using your acting voice today.
You're a bit off.

1749
01:34:01,533 --> 01:34:05,300
-Jae-seok or you.
-The one who's it stays the quietest.

1750
01:34:05,367 --> 01:34:06,667
-Was I quiet today?
-Yes.

1751
01:34:07,633 --> 01:34:09,867
You were much quieter than usual.

1752
01:34:09,934 --> 01:34:11,467
Why did you hide it?

1753
01:34:11,533 --> 01:34:14,834
-I didn't know who it was.
-Let's hurry up.

1754
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,934
-Come on!
-Na-ra!

1755
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,934
It was Tae-hyun?

1756
01:34:34,967 --> 01:34:36,800
Come on!

1757
01:34:45,266 --> 01:34:49,233
-The residents won.
-Okay.

1758
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:51,367
Hey.

1759
01:34:56,967 --> 01:34:58,300
I must find him.

1760
01:34:58,367 --> 01:35:00,467
Please look at this photo.

1761
01:35:02,367 --> 01:35:04,667
-She's crying for real.
-Please look at this photo.

1762
01:35:04,734 --> 01:35:07,667
-Let me see it.
-Please look at this photo.

1763
01:35:10,066 --> 01:35:14,300
Please look at this photo.

1764
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:20,667
-Come on out.
-Okay.

1765
01:35:20,734 --> 01:35:22,600
Hurry up and come on out.

1766
01:35:22,667 --> 01:35:23,867
What was that?

1767
01:35:23,934 --> 01:35:25,000
Tae-hyun.

1768
01:35:25,066 --> 01:35:27,100
-Hurry up.
-I mean…

1769
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:30,967
"Check the mailbox of unit 407."

1770
01:35:31,967 --> 01:35:35,800
Bring one staff member at a time.

1771
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:40,000
He might be downstairs.
I need to bring him.

1772
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:52,100
"You're the husband of the married couple
that has been selling drugs."

1773
01:35:57,934 --> 01:36:00,467
"Without letting the members know,

1774
01:36:00,533 --> 01:36:03,367
complete the following missions.

1775
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:07,433
Wear the couple necklace you exchanged
with your wife at the wedding

1776
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,967
until the end of the mission.

1777
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:15,600
Whenever you meet your beloved wife,

1778
01:36:15,667 --> 01:36:17,200
hold her hands."

1779
01:36:17,266 --> 01:36:19,900
-What's wrong?
-You should tell us.

1780
01:36:21,367 --> 01:36:23,734
"Hear 'like' from all the members

1781
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,333
except for yourself."

1782
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,500
-March?
-A retreat?

1783
01:36:28,567 --> 01:36:30,300
I really like the idea. When can we go?

1784
01:36:30,367 --> 01:36:31,734
I'd really like it.

1785
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,734
If my second child plays the guitar…

1786
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:35,834
I like the guitar.

1787
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:37,500
Go ahead. I like the idea.

1788
01:36:37,567 --> 01:36:39,367
-What do you think?
-I like the idea.

1789
01:36:43,066 --> 01:36:45,567
-It was so hard.
-I can only imagine.

1790
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:48,233
There were so many missions.

1791
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:49,767
Hey, you worked hard.

1792
01:36:49,834 --> 01:36:51,600
There were so many missions.

1793
01:36:51,667 --> 01:36:53,967
What did you say about
my child learning the guitar?

1794
01:36:54,033 --> 01:36:55,200
-"Like."
-"Like."

1795
01:36:55,266 --> 01:36:56,834
-"I like the idea."
-Yes.

1796
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,333
-I see.
-I see.

1797
01:36:58,967 --> 01:37:01,400
-I see.
-My goodness.

1798
01:37:01,467 --> 01:37:04,000
You didn't mean what you said?

1799
01:37:04,066 --> 01:37:05,734
-Was it fake?
-It was fake.

1800
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,133
I had no idea.

1801
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,667
-And JENNIE was unbelievable.
-Why?

1802
01:37:09,734 --> 01:37:13,467
She spotted the woman's necklace
right away.

1803
01:37:13,533 --> 01:37:16,567
So instead of wearing it around my neck,
I put it here.

1804
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,800
-I wore it here for a long while.
-Really?

1805
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:22,233
That was incredible.

1806
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:24,000
The missions were so hard.

1807
01:37:24,066 --> 01:37:26,166
Toward the end,
what were those baby photos?

1808
01:37:26,233 --> 01:37:29,233
We merged the woman's face
and Tae-hyun's face.

1809
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:30,967
As soon as I saw the photos,

1810
01:37:31,033 --> 01:37:33,900
-I thought, "The faces got merged well."
-No way.

1811
01:37:33,967 --> 01:37:35,300
They looked like me.

1812
01:37:35,367 --> 01:37:37,200
We won!

1813
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:45,700
The biggest meth cartel in Korea
got caught by the prosecution.

1814
01:37:45,767 --> 01:37:47,834
Drug cases are increasing.

1815
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:52,066
Drug use is spreading
among students and all classes of society.

1816
01:37:52,133 --> 01:37:54,133
Drugs that ruin people's lives

1817
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,233
are now spreading among ordinary citizens

1818
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,667
such as office workers and housewives.

1819
01:37:58,734 --> 01:38:03,333
Korea is no longer a nation
that is safe from drugs.

1820
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:13,500
-A university, not an apartment?
-So it's 2011.

1821
01:38:13,567 --> 01:38:16,433
-A freshmen welcome party?
-They're welcoming us.

1822
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:18,800
-Renaissance
-Renaissance

1823
01:38:18,867 --> 01:38:20,266
-The way young people move…
-It's different.

1824
01:38:23,633 --> 01:38:26,400
I'm in here!

1825
01:38:26,467 --> 01:38:29,200
-Is that about unemployment?
-The tuition…

1826
01:38:29,266 --> 01:38:30,800
What are you drawing?

1827
01:38:30,867 --> 01:38:32,066
My future.

1828
01:38:32,133 --> 01:38:35,033
What happened in 2011? At the university?

1829
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:36,633
Catch him!

1830
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,867
It's getting bigger and bigger.
What are you going to do?

1831
01:38:38,934 --> 01:38:41,066
I'll show you how to take over the school.

1832
01:38:41,133 --> 01:38:43,734
We have to check out your skills.

1833
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,967
-We can do it too.
-Here!

1834
01:38:46,033 --> 01:38:46,934
-Come on, JENNIE.
-Let's go.

1835
01:38:48,266 --> 01:38:50,400
Help me!

1836
