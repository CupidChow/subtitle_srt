00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,500
UNIVERSITY

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
- We're off to school!
- We're off to school!

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,633
HIGH SCHOOL

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,734
The number of internet users
has reached 15 million in Korea.

5
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:39,767
Have you ever read a novel
on the internet?

6
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:42,533
The popularity has now gone offline.

7
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:45,900
After getting made into a movie,
it became a new genre.

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,500
The movies that are based on
internet novels are

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,233
about a handsome boy
with skills in fighting

10
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:54,400
who falls in love with an ordinary girl.

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,700
They evoke fantasies among female fans.

12
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:01,033
Teenagers who like to set trends
and dislike falling behind

13
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:04,033
became the target
of the new marketing strategy.

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,567
Due to copycat consumption,
which involves blindly purchasing

15
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,567
what others have,

16
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:16,700
the number of teenagers
with bad credit is rising.

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,867
The need for money has led to crimes.

18
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:21,900
From theft and fraud

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,767
to violence,

20
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:26,967
teenage crime

21
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:30,000
has recently reached
the level of adult crime.

22
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,734
I like you.

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,333
HIGH SCHOOL

24
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,467
Gosh, the way to school...

25
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:35,066
We're going to school.

26
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:39,367
- Hey, friend.
- Yes?

27
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,233
- Nice to meet you.
- You joined naturally.

28
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,300
You took Se-chan's spot today.

29
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,066
I don't know anything,
so I'd appreciate a slow explanation.

30
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,867
Did he flunk a few years?

31
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:52,867
Did he flunk three years?

32
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,266
About four years

33
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,300
- due to personal reasons.
- You're speaking politely.

34
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,333
- Your jacket is small.
- No, it's perfect.

35
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,700
- Did you gain a lot of weight?
- No, I didn't.

36
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,734
I just prefer wearing tight clothes.

37
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:05,667
I'm sorry, but we're high schoolers.
Why are you wearing rings?

38
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,533
Look at those rings.
Don't you know today's theme?

39
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,533
One for friendship and one for love.

40
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:10,433
CHO ANNOUNCES HIS MARRIAGE

41
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:11,467
This watch isn't for a high schooler.

42
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:13,834
I borrowed my mother's watch.

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,033
He comes from a rich family.

44
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:18,066
The backdrop is 2003.

45
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,300
It's 2003?

46
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,400
See? The North Face was trendy then.

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
You know, Se-chan isn't here.

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,333
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.

49
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,333
Do I immerse myself in the situation?

50
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:31,734
I think it'll be fine
even if you keep still.

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,700
- Keep still as you always do.
- Keep still.

52
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,834
Sae-ho is like a peddler
in the world of variety shows.

53
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,867
I brought many funny stories with me.

54
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,233
- Don't I need to share them?
- No.

55
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,967
Inviting Sae-ho to fill in for Se-chan
was a cliché move.

56
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,900
To me, Jae-seok is
the father of variety shows.

57
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,667
Tae-hyun is the uncle of variety shows.

58
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:51,433
- It has been a while.
- Am I the aunt?

59
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:55,300
We aren't that close yet,
so I need some time.

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,500
The in-law of variety shows.

61
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,633
There's still a wall.

62
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:01,934
- The in-law of variety shows.
- Yes. The in-law.

63
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:05,433
You're a substitute, so don't act up.

64
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:06,767
A substitute.

65
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,166
I haven't heard that in a while.

66
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,967
Since it's your command, I'll follow.

67
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,834
The weather is cold today.

68
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:20,033
- You should've worn a jacket.
- I'm regretting my choices.

69
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,834
- Seriously.
- Gosh, it's cold.

70
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,367
Do you want to wear my jacket?

71
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,133
- No, thank you.
- Is it okay? All right.

72
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,934
Don't wear it. It reeks of cologne.

73
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:31,967
It reeks of cologne.

74
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,900
No more perfume on you

75
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,600
- Isn't that it?
- That's right.

76
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,967
- There are students behind us.
- Students are coming.

77
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,400
They must be going to school.

78
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,266
They're going to the same school.

79
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,667
This is fun. This is fascinating.

80
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,300
Hi, guys.

81
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,800
- They look scary.
- Hello.

82
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,934
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

83
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:52,800
- Hi.
- You guys look old too.

84
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,266
- I'm a bit sentimental.
- Okay.

85
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,767
I feel like I'm meeting my friends
on my way to school.

86
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,667
- Really?
- Yes, it's a strange feeling.

87
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:00,834
Gosh.

88
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,300
For goodness' sake.

89
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,867
- Really?
- Yes, it's a strange feeling.

90
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:04,767
Gosh.

91
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,633
For goodness' sake.

92
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:08,033
- What? That's...
- What?

93
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,500
- What? That's...
- What?

94
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,000
- What's going on?
- YEONJUN.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,467
Isn't that YEONJUN?

96
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:16,567
- I mean...
- What?

97
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,834
- Welcome, YEONJUN.
- Hello.

98
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,300
A turn.

99
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:31,300
YEONJUN, what brings you here?

100
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,667
- Do you know me?
- What?

101
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,934
- Do you know me?
- Of course.

102
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,700
- You're YEONJUN.
- Do you know me?

103
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,667
Don't you know us?

104
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,934
- I've never seen you guys before.
- What?

105
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:43,266
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

106
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:44,800
YEONJUN is handsome.

107
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,633
I don't have an ordinary face.

108
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,600
You're handsome.

109
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,567
YEONJUN, you're a sight for sore eyes.

110
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,533
You look very cold.

111
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:57,533
- Is he a student?
- No.

112
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:58,900
He's a returning student.

113
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:02,533
- He's a middle-aged man.
- I mean...

114
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:03,700
This isn't easy.

115
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,734
- He's a librarian.
- Really?

116
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:06,633
I thought he was someone's uncle.

117
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:07,967
He's good.

118
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,867
- Are you guys transfer students?
- No.

119
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:12,533
You guys are wearing different uniforms.

120
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,033
- Are we?
- We must be transfer students.

121
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:17,033
- That's right.
- That must be it.

122
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:19,700
- We'll be late. Let's hurry up and go.
- Okay.

123
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,367
Are you going with us?

124
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:22,734
YEONJUN, you're going with us?

125
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:27,734
- Nice to meet you. Are we all friends?
- You look good in a school uniform.

126
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,667
- What? My goodness.
- What?

127
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:35,000
- What? My goodness.
- What?

128
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:53,066
- How cool.
- What?

129
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,767
Are they high schoolers?

130
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:08,633
It's Si-eun.

131
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,367
- Do you know her?
- Si-eun!

132
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,467
- She must be his girlfriend.
- His girlfriend?

133
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:13,467
It seems that way.

134
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,900
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

135
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

136
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,734
- Hello.
- What?

137
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:22,233
- What?
- Hello.

138
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,133
Hi.

139
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,633
Who's he?

140
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,300
YEONJUN, your girlfriend is leaving.

141
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:30,934
Si-eun, wait for me.

142
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,834
Wait for me.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,033
- Si-eun.
- You know,

144
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:38,266
the scale of this show is quite big.

145
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:39,734
Is he her boyfriend?

146
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:41,667
Why are you running after her?

147
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:42,800
What was that?

148
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,300
Why are you running after her?

149
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,567
All right. The school gates
will close in five seconds.

150
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:52,934
It's Woo-il.

151
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:53,900
- Five.
- Woo-il.

152
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,266
- Four.
- Why are we late?

153
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,867
- Three...
- Wait for me.

154
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,033
- Close the gates.
- Why are we late?

155
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,066
- Close the gates.
- Why are we late?

156
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,033
Hold on.

157
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,800
- Close the gates.
- Mister.

158
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,867
- Get out.
- Woo-il.

159
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,433
- You guys are late.
- Woo-il.

160
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:10,600
- You guys are late.
- Mr. Security Guard.

161
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,700
- You guys are late.
- Woo-il.

162
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,400
- You guys are late.
- Come on.

163
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,734
- Woo-il.
- You guys are late. Get out.

164
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:18,100
Why do they get to pass?

165
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
What are you doing?

166
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,000
- Woo-il.
- Come on.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
- Mr. Security Guard.
- Woo-il.

168
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,633
Punks like you who arrive late

169
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:28,300
- don't need to attend school.
- Woo-il.

170
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,700
Woo-il.

171
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,767
Mr. Im.

172
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,567
- Mr. Im.
- Don't call your teacher by his name.

173
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,600
- Why...
- Please.

174
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,567
- Please.
- Please.

175
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:39,700
Please.

176
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,467
- Stop speaking nonsense.
- Please, Mr. Im.

177
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:44,934
Guys, do you want to take classes?

178
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:45,867
- Yes.
- Yes.

179
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:47,967
- Do you really want to take them?
- Of course.

180
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:50,633
Okay. You guys need to be punished first.

181
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:51,934
Why?

182
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:53,600
- Why?
- You guys arrived late.

183
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,734
Come on in.

184
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,266
I've adapted to the show.

185
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,900
You bragged about JENNIE on Radio Star.

186
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:02,233
- I watched the episode.
- Please.

187
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:04,533
Be quiet.

188
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,600
Why did you brag about JENNIE?

189
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,967
You guys arrived late.

190
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,533
These students also broke the dress code.

191
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,867
Student Guidance Council members
and the ones who broke the dress code,

192
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:18,800
go on in.

193
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,133
Hurry up and go on in.
Wear your uniform properly.

194
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,033
- We wore our uniforms properly.
- What?

195
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:26,166
Who told you to wear a jacket?

196
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,033
- Seriously.
- For goodness' sake.

197
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:31,233
- What's this?
- Mr. Im, he's wearing a jacket too.

198
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,734
My mom told me to wear it
since it was cold outside.

199
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,133
- Your mom?
- He...

200
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,700
- He's wearing rings.
- What are these?

201
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,800
They're just wrong.

202
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,433
This is a friendship ring
I exchanged with Nam Chang-hee.

203
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:42,500
As for this one...

204
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,800
CHO SAE-HO IS IN LOVE
A WEDDING IS ON THE HORIZON

205
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,300
It can't be helped. You can't remove it.

206
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,533
- A couple ring.
- This is...

207
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:53,500
- You're a student.
- Yes.

208
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,166
You shouldn't wear such things.

209
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,233
- Shouldn't you confiscate them?
- Firstly,

210
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:00,533
female students,
stand over here with your arms up.

211
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,700
You arrived late, so put your arms up.

212
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,033
- Put our arms up?
- Yes, arms up.

213
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:07,934
- Male students, get down.
- Mr. Im.

214
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:10,834
- Get down.
- Mr. Im, come on.

215
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,700
- The weather is cold.
- Woo-il.

216
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,233
This is better.

217
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,800
- This is better.
- This is better.

218
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,934
- Woo-il.
- Please.

219
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:21,233
- Please.
- Get down.

220
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:25,867
Why are you giving up
before even trying it?

221
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:28,000
- You shouldn't be such a student.
- Okay.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,967
- We did nothing wrong.
- We arrived late.

223
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,266
- Okay.
- You arrived late.

224
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:33,734
- Give it a try. That's right.
- For goodness' sake.

225
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:34,867
Give it a try. That's right.

226
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,367
- You listen well.
- Of course.

227
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:40,033
Put your arms up.

228
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,333
Put your arms up.

229
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:45,633
- What?
- What?

230
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:48,900
- What?
- What?

231
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,834
Here is today's news.

232
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,367
Teenagers robbed jewelry worth
tens of millions of won

233
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,967
and broke into people's houses repeatedly.

234
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:15,200
They threatened the owner
of a jewelry shop, Mr. Lee, with a weapon

235
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:18,867
and ran away with about 400 items
of jewelry, including gold rings.

236
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:20,100
Jewelry? Hold on.

237
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:25,800
Among them was an expensive item
from Europe,

238
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,934
a teardrop necklace.

239
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,734
- A teardrop necklace?
- A teardrop necklace?

240
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:33,667
With the recent rise
in violent teenage crimes,

241
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,700
the police have begun an investigation.

242
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,667
The reason
behind the violent teenage crimes

243
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:42,333
- was... much to everyone's shock.
- What?

244
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,133
The police are after the teenagers

245
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,967
behind the theft of a teardrop necklace.

246
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,300
- Bad students.
- They must be here.

247
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,266
- Bad--
- They must be in this school.

248
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,000
A teardrop necklace?

249
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,300
WOOSANG HIGH SCHOOL

250
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,834
- Promise to never be late again?
- Yes.

251
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:04,233
- Will you work hard in class today?
- Yes.

252
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:06,066
Okay. Go to your classroom now.

253
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:08,433
- Okay.
- Go.

254
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,633
Okay, Mr. Im.

255
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:10,967
- It has been a while.
- School has started.

256
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,467
Gosh, listen to the school bell.

257
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
This brings back memories.

258
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,433
- I haven't heard a school bell in ages.
- Same here.

259
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:23,133
After spending so much time
at the apartment, we're in school.

260
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,867
- I know.
- Right?

261
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,900
A teardrop necklace.

262
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,967
Earlier, we saw a boy on a motorcycle
and a girl.

263
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,433
- Yes.
- Who were they?

264
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:35,967
Their good looks tell me
that they're the main characters.

265
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,033
Delinquents.

266
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:39,066
Delinquents.

267
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:44,667
Why are there so many good-looking people
these days?

268
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,100
Perhaps we're lacking in comparison.

269
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,633
In comparison?

270
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:52,800
It has been a while
since I've been in a school.

271
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,433
- The school is nice.
- It's so nice.

272
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:56,800
In 2003...

273
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:01,567
We're actually in a school.
I can't believe it.

274
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,233
WOOSANG HIGH SCHOOL

275
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,300
WOOSANG HIGH SCHOOL

276
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,667
Buzz.

277
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,166
- Buzz. Look at Kyung-hoon.
- Yes.

278
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,567
It's my current ringtone.

279
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:25,400
"MONOLOGUE" BY BUZZ

280
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,400
Was "Monologue" released then?

281
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,734
Wow.

282
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,867
- That startled me. What?
- Teacher!

283
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,467
- That startled me. What?
- Teacher!

284
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:49,233
- What?
- What's going on?

285
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,400
Why are you running?

286
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,200
Why are so many things happening?

287
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:07,100
Something must be going on.
What's going on?

288
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,567
Something is going on.

289
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:10,633
So many things are happening.

290
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:15,166
What?

291
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
What's going on?

292
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:20,700
What's going on?

293
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,567
What's going on?

294
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,033
What's going on?

295
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,033
- Guys.
- What are you doing?

296
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,734
- It's YEONJUN.
- YEONJUN's going to fight someone.

297
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:39,133
YEONJUN!

298
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,000
YEONJUN!

299
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,333
YEONJUN!

300
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:48,433
- What's going on?
- How cool!

301
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:49,967
What's up with YEONJUN?

302
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,133
Are you the top dog at this school?

303
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,066
Where are you going, punk?

304
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,033
What's up with YEONJUN?

305
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,066
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

306
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:14,900
How is this a school?

307
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,533
My goodness. How is this a school?

308
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,934
What kind of a school...

309
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,800
How is this allowed in a school?

310
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,967
What's going on?

311
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:46,433
ONLY YEONJUN AND HIS ENEMY ARE LEFT

312
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:49,266
- YEONJUN, don't do that.
- YEONJUN has changed a lot.

313
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:50,467
Stop acting out.

314
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,233
Who are you to tell me what to do?

315
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:53,467
I'll end you.

316
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,667
Don't cry when I beat you up.

317
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,033
What kind of a school...

318
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:58,500
Shouldn't we stop them?

319
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,734
We can't stop them.

320
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:02,367
- Do you want to get ridiculed?
- Do you want to die?

321
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:07,200
Hey, stop it already.

322
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,500
Hey.

323
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:12,900
Who is she?

324
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,266
It's Si-eun.

325
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,734
- Do you know her?
- Si-eun!

326
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:17,767
- She must be his girlfriend.
- His girlfriend?

327
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,033
It seems that way.

328
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,066
- The top dog's girlfriend.
- She's the girlfriend.

329
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,800
- The top dog and his girlfriend.
- A lovers' quarrel?

330
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,266
Answer me. Is it him or me?

331
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:32,266
I like both of you guys.

332
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,033
- Both?
- A lovers' quarrel.

333
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:38,166
Guys, the teacher is coming.
Go back into the classroom.

334
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,200
Go. Don't fight.

335
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,400
- Si-eun.
- Yes?

336
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,800
- Go to the teacher's office.
- Me?

337
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,900
Yes. Hurry.

338
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:47,066
I mean... Hey.

339
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,734
- What kind of a school is this?
- Is this a school?

340
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:54,934
I went to high school, so I know
that students don't fight like that.

341
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:56,800
Is this an action school?

342
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,867
An action school?

343
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:00,700
- An action high school.
- An action high school?

344
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:03,066
- How impressive.
- I think that's the case.

345
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:06,367
What could be the case today?

346
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:11,500
...ran away with about 400 items
of jewelry, including gold rings.

347
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,066
Among them was an expensive item...

348
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,033
a teardrop necklace.

349
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:18,500
I like both of you guys.

350
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,266
What's going on here?

351
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:23,133
What kind of a school is this?

352
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,367
Let's go inside.

353
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,967
Shouldn't the transfer students take
the front door?

354
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:29,000
- Let's be the top dog.
- There's one already.

355
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,500
Seven transfer students in one day?

356
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,967
- Hello.
- Hello.

357
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,200
Hi, guys.

358
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,133
I feel like I'm back in my school days.

359
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:40,867
It has been a while.

360
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,967
THE CLASS MOTTO: HOW DO YOU
SLEEP WITH THOSE GRADES?

361
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,400
This is my seat.

362
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,867
- Hello.
- YEONJUN.

363
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:06,667
- YEONJUN, who sits next to you?
- Hey.

364
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,233
- I met you guys outside the school.
- Hi.

365
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:11,500
Are you okay?
You were involved in a big fight.

366
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,100
It was nothing. Don't worry.

367
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,767
Who is your seatmate?

368
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,166
My seatmate is Jung-ha.

369
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,600
- Who's Jung-ha?
- It's Jung-ha?

370
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,000
Are you Jung-ha?

371
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,533
- I see that top dogs have a connection.
- Top dogs.

372
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:26,133
- Are you Jung-ha?
- Hello, YEONJUN.

373
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:27,400
Nice to meet you, Jung-ha.

374
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,700
- I'm JENNIE's seatmate.
- We're seatmates.

375
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,233
Where's Si-eun, my seatmate?

376
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:33,767
Si-eun.

377
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,533
- What?
- It looks tasty.

378
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:39,867
I haven't had this in forever.

379
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:40,867
Can we eat it?

380
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,867
- I really like this snack.
- What?

381
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,800
- YEONJUN, do you like it?
- Let's share.

382
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,433
Can we eat snacks at school?

383
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:48,500
I got Apollo.

384
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,800
It's my favorite.

385
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,333
- Your favorite?
- My favorite.

386
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,200
- Do you know how to eat it?
- Of course.

387
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,667
- Do you know how to suck on it?
- Of course.

388
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,200
Did Jung-ha and JENNIE eat this snack
back in the day?

389
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,767
Yes, I did.

390
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:02,900
Do you know how to get
all of the candy out of here?

391
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,500
Here's how you can make it come out clean.
Roll it between your hands.

392
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:09,367
- I'll eat it like this.
- Really? Okay.

393
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:11,867
You're trying hard.

394
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,600
Magazines.

395
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,100
Do you guys have a cell phone?

396
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,934
- I have a cell phone.
- What's that?

397
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,033
What kind of a phone is that?

398
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:27,166
- You guys don't have one, right?
- Anycall.

399
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,800
- I have a cell phone.
- Anycall.

400
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,800
Downloading ringtones and whatnot are fun.

401
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,734
Look at this. I Love Star.

402
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:43,100
H.O.T. placed first among the singers.

403
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,000
Won Bin placed first among the actors.

404
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,633
Cha Tae-hyun placed second
among the actors.

405
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:50,300
No way.

406
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,333
I want to take a look.

407
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,266
- I'm among the comedians.
- Yu Jae-seok.

408
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:54,800
Fourth among the comedians.

409
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,300
- Fourth.
- I beat Yu Jae-seok.

410
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,266
- Who was the number one comedian?
- But...

411
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,633
Why was Moon Hee-jun
the number one comedian?

412
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,266
Lee Hwi-jae was number two.

413
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,500
- Number three was Hee-seok.
- This is great.

414
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,333
Where did they get this magazine?
Can I take it?

415
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,800
Why do you want to take it?

416
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,200
It's memorabilia.

417
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,000
- It's hard to find these days.
- It's a prop.

418
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,500
- Jae-keun.
- You know,

419
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,867
- Na-ra looks the same as she did then.
- Is she in there?

420
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,166
- Na-ra looks the same as she did then.
- Is she in there?

421
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,867
- Na-ra.
- I thought you meant me. You startled me.

422
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,100
- Add the last name.
- Okay.

423
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,667
- Jang Na-ra.
- You startled me.

424
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,800
- It wasn't her.
- Sorry.

425
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,533
You startled me. I thought it was me.

426
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,834
You startled me. I thought it was me.

427
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,900
Guys.

428
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,734
- The teacher is coming.
- Okay. We're sorry.

429
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:44,467
- Class President, we're really sorry.
- We're sorry.

430
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,800
We're sorry.

431
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:48,467
- What?
- Where are you going?

432
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:50,133
- Where are you going?
- So sudden.

433
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:51,934
- What about me?
- Hey.

434
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:52,934
Hey.

435
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,433
- YEONJUN.
- Hey.

436
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,533
- YEONJUN.
- Hey.

437
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,133
Quiet down.

438
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,600
- Sit down.
- The teacher is here.

439
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,900
- Si-eun, sit down.
- It's Si-eun.

440
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,400
- Si-eun.
- Hello, Si-eun.

441
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
Si-eun, where were you?

442
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,200
YEONJUN left the classroom.

443
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,600
Yesterday, there was
a disgraceful incident.

444
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,934
Yesterday, a jewelry shop near the school

445
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:20,600
got robbed of a teardrop necklace.

446
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,200
Teenagers robbed jewelry worth
tens of millions of won

447
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,367
from a jewelry shop.

448
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:31,867
Among them is an expensive item...

449
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:33,600
a teardrop necklace.

450
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,934
We received a tip-off that the culprit is

451
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:38,567
a student at this school.

452
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:41,800
So I want to give you an opportunity.

453
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,667
Everyone, close your eyes.

454
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:46,166
- Close your eyes.
- Seriously?

455
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:49,033
Close your eyes.

456
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:50,900
You can't catch a thief this way.

457
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,066
Close your eyes.

458
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,433
This is a very scientific investigation.

459
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:58,533
- Scientific?
- Open your eyes.

460
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:01,367
- So you guys didn't steal it.
- No.

461
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:03,767
I'll inspect your belongings.

462
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,133
- Oh, no.
- I'm in trouble.

463
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,867
- Yu Jae-seok.
- Yes?

464
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,800
What did you do yesterday?

465
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,100
- Yesterday, I stayed at home.
- Did you loaf around?

466
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,333
He took care of children.

467
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,934
Aren't you a high schooler?

468
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,400
- He has a nephew and a niece.
- Yes.

469
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,600
- Is this Teenage Parent?
- A nephew and a niece.

470
00:22:19,734 --> 00:22:23,100
- Teenage Parent doesn't exist yet.
- Yes.

471
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,500
He's a wild child.

472
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,233
- Woo-il is on fire.
- Yes.

473
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:28,433
- Teenage Parent was a good one. Sorry.
- Okay.

474
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,800
So you looked after children.

475
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,734
Cha Tae-hyun, what did you do yesterday?

476
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:35,533
I watched a Radio Star episode
starring Im Woo-il yesterday.

477
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:38,266
Well done.

478
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,633
- Nice.
- Oh Na-ra, how about you?

479
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:41,800
It's gotten a lot of views.

480
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,100
- Na-ra, what did you do?
- I watched Radio Star too.

481
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,266
Im Woo-il only talked about JENNIE.

482
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:48,000
- That's right.
- So I was disappointed.

483
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,567
- JENNIE, what did you do yesterday?
- Yes?

484
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:53,033
Me? I stayed at home.

485
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:54,700
What did you do at home?

486
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,667
- I read a book.
- I see.

487
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,867
- Which book?
- Why are you asking her so many questions?

488
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:03,200
- Are you interested in her?
- You asked her so many questions.

489
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,300
I did it in order to find the culprit.

490
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:08,600
- Sae-ho, what did you do yesterday?
- Yes?

491
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,967
I went on a date.

492
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:10,867
What?

493
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,967
- You're a high schooler.
- A date?

494
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:15,066
He has a serious girlfriend
he plans to marry.

495
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:16,433
Already?

496
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:19,767
To be honest, I had a highball.

497
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,533
- Isn't that bad?
- A highball?

498
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,500
Mr. Im.

499
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,800
- A high schooler drinking highballs?
- Are you insane?

500
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,700
Did you kiss your girlfriend yesterday?

501
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,266
Yesterday...

502
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:30,934
- Hey. "Yesterday"?
-"Yesterday"?

503
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,200
Yesterday, we didn't get to kiss.

504
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:36,400
You drank a highball
but didn't kiss your girlfriend.

505
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,000
I think I saw a highball
in a movie yesterday.

506
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,100
- A student shouldn't drink highballs.
- No.

507
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,367
I got confused.

508
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:49,266
In any case, I gave you a chance.

509
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:51,967
Place your bag on your desk.

510
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,500
- But...
- Place it on your desk.

511
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,633
Place it on your desk.
Don't touch it further.

512
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:58,967
Si-eun.

513
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:03,367
All right, Si-eun.

514
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:15,633
- What's this?
- What?

515
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:18,633
What's this teardrop necklace?
Why did it come out of your bag?

516
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:20,633
It wasn't me.

517
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:23,133
- You didn't steal it?
- It really wasn't me.

518
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:26,533
- Don't play dumb.
- But...

519
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,500
Should I keep quiet?

520
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,767
- What? Do you know something, Sae-ho?
- What?

521
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:30,767
Does Sae-ho know something?

522
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:33,667
- Say something.
- It came out of Si-eun's bag.

523
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:34,867
What is it?

524
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:37,967
- Spill. It's okay.
- Hurry up. I feel so victimized.

525
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:39,333
Cho Sae-ho, spill.

526
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,500
- YEONJUN...
- Okay.

527
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,767
YEONJUN put something
in Si-eun's bag earlier.

528
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,033
Where's YEONJUN?

529
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:48,100
- YEONJUN suddenly left.
- He left in a cool way.

530
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,567
- He left?
- He's cool.

531
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:50,667
- Really?
- Yes.

532
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:53,633
All right. Si-eun, follow me
to the teacher's office.

533
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:55,633
- It wasn't Si-eun.
- She didn't do it.

534
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:57,400
- Follow me.
- Si-eun.

535
00:24:57,967 --> 00:24:59,500
- Follow me.
- Why?

536
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:01,667
I feel so victimized.

537
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,600
What's this teardrop necklace?
Why did it come out of your bag?

538
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:11,600
YEONJUN put something
in Si-eun's bag earlier.

539
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:13,433
- Oh, no.
- The main characters.

540
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:16,200
- Why did you tattle?
- But I...

541
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,633
- What will you do if YEONJUN finds out?
- YEONJUN will beat you up.

542
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:22,367
Seriously, what's going on?

543
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,934
- Si-eun almost took the fall.
- Hey,

544
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,233
- look.
- What's that?

545
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,500
- What's that?
- What?

546
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,066
- A photo.
- There's a photo.

547
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:31,834
We saw it earlier.

548
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,533
- Right? We saw it earlier.
- A field trip photo.

549
00:25:40,867 --> 00:25:43,000
It's a field trip photo. What's this?

550
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,633
Isn't that YEONJUN?

551
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:46,233
Is YEONJUN in the photo?

552
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,633
You know,

553
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:51,667
judging by the photo,
it looks like the students are close.

554
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:55,266
This man. Who's this man?
Isn't he the one who dropped Si-eun off?

555
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:56,667
- That's right.
- Who? Where?

556
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:57,867
- The motorcycle.
- Earlier.

557
00:25:57,867 --> 00:25:59,400
- The man in the back?
- The helmet.

558
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,100
Who's he? He didn't seem like
a high schooler.

559
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,533
I know. Maybe he's...

560
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:13,900
- He didn't come to school.
- He gave Si-eun a ride earlier.

561
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,767
- Is he a stalker?
- Who's he?

562
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:16,934
What?

563
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:19,734
Where did YEONJUN go?

564
00:26:19,734 --> 00:26:21,533
- We must find him.
- Shall we find him?

565
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,133
- What?
- Where are you going?

566
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:25,867
- Where are you going?
- So sudden.

567
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:27,900
- What about me?
- Hey.

568
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:31,200
- I feel so victimized.
- Of course, you do.

569
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
Of course.

570
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,467
The reason behind
the violent teenage crimes

571
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,500
was... much to everyone's shock.

572
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:42,333
- The period ended.
- It's break time.

573
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:43,967
Class President.

574
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:45,066
- Guys.
- Yes?

575
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:49,133
The superior and inferior classes
will be divided for the next period.

576
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:50,834
The superior class will stay here,

577
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,767
and the inferior class
will go to the library.

578
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,400
Don't just sit there. Go.

579
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,567
- Are we in the inferior class?
- Really?

580
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,800
- Are we in the inferior class?
- Are we?

581
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,500
All of us? I see.

582
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,433
- All of us.
- See you later.

583
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:13,100
Let's go to the inferior class.

584
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,300
- Yes. We need to go.
- We're in the inferior class.

585
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,600
It hurts my pride
that we're in the inferior class.

586
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,233
- I know.
- The inferior class.

587
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,500
I'm okay with it.

588
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,700
My path has been decided.

589
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:28,600
I don't care which class I'm in.

590
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,500
What do you want to be?

591
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,233
- What?
- What do you want to be?

592
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:36,834
- I want to be a comedian.
- No comedian.

593
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,433
Don't be a comedian.

594
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:41,834
I want to be a comedian, okay?

595
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,867
The inferior class will take place
in the library.

596
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:44,967
LIBRARY

597
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,400
My mom bought something for you guys.

598
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,633
Really?

599
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:55,333
Ta-da. My mom bought fried chicken
for us to share.

600
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,467
- We're eating chicken at the library?
- Ta-da.

601
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:00,367
- Wow.
- Yeah.

602
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:01,900
My mom bought it for us to share.

603
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,934
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Your mom?

604
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:06,266
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

605
00:28:06,266 --> 00:28:07,467
Chicken.

606
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:09,567
- It's really tasty.
- My goodness.

607
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:12,500
It really suits my taste. Seriously.

608
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:17,533
- The boneless leg meat is tender.
- This one?

609
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:18,633
- Really?
- It's incredible.

610
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,834
It's tasty.

611
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:23,433
It's spicy, tangy, and sweet.

612
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:28,133
What's the nature
of YEONJUN's relationship with Si-eun?

613
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:31,934
If she's his girlfriend,
why would he slip her the necklace...

614
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:33,967
- Seriously.
- ...and back her into a corner?

615
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:37,166
- Right. She isn't his girlfriend.
- I think she's his crush.

616
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,367
Maybe it was a present.

617
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:41,400
Who would give their crush a stolen item?

618
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,734
It'd be strange to think
that they're dating

619
00:28:44,734 --> 00:28:47,633
since Si-eun came to school
on another man's motorcycle.

620
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:50,400
- What? My goodness.
- What?

621
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,934
- What?
- What?

622
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:53,033
What?

623
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:05,800
You'll play a game for a crucial hint.

624
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,934
- All right. Today's case is...
- It's too hard.

625
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:09,633
- It's too hard.
- I know.

626
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,000
This game is Shorten the Explanation.

627
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,867
Shorten the Explanation? I'm confident.

628
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:18,166
I'm really good at this.

629
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,767
- Me too.
- I can shorten anything.

630
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:21,066
I can totally shorten things.

631
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,333
This is a dinosaur.

632
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,300
It's very scary.

633
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
Three claws.

634
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,133
Strong.

635
00:29:32,734 --> 00:29:34,100
Tyrannosaurus.

636
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:39,934
- It's too bright outside.
- The sun is--

637
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:41,400
- No gestures.
- But...

638
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:47,800
Who will go first?

639
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,400
- Go first.
- Why don't you go first?

640
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,233
- Go first.
- You should go first.

641
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:52,166
Go first.

642
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,567
Go first, okay?

643
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:55,967
Go first, okay?

644
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:01,400
The one with a serious girlfriend,
you should go first.

645
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,100
Five, four, three, two.

646
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,066
- Three seconds.
- Five, four, three, two. Yes.

647
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:07,300
Ready, set, go.

648
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:10,667
I have this one too.

649
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:13,567
Think of Star... blank, blank.

650
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,066
- A two-syllable word.
- Drink coffee.

651
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,500
- A two-syllable word.
- Drink coffee.

652
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,734
Tumbler.

653
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:29,400
- Tumbler.
- My goodness.

654
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,467
This is hard.

655
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,533
Gosh, that was incredible.

656
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:39,300
What's up with Tae-hyun?
How did he guess so well?

657
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:45,033
Let's begin. Ready, set, go.

658
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:46,967
This one is a fruit.

659
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:48,333
This fruit is juicy.

660
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:49,900
Baby's bottom.

661
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,800
- Best.
-"Baby's bottom" and "best."

662
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,133
"Baby's bottom" and "best."

663
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,233
Peach.

664
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:57,066
- What?
-"Baby's bottom" and "best."

665
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:58,233
"Baby's bottom."

666
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:01,133
- What?
-"Baby's bottom" and "best."

667
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:04,000
How did he know?
"Baby's bottom" and "best."

668
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,567
I did so well.

669
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:06,767
You did well.

670
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,300
Let's begin. Ready, set, go.

671
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:11,667
It's at a rest stop.

672
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,133
At a rest stop.

673
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:16,867
Was that an echo?

674
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:18,734
It's a skewer.

675
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:20,867
It's a skewer.

676
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:22,266
Sausage and rice cake skewer.

677
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:26,467
What? What was that?

678
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,800
- They're really good.
- What? What was that?

679
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,533
What's up with you?

680
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,433
My children eat
so many sausage and rice cake skewers.

681
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,867
I lost my motivation.

682
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:39,900
Ready, set, go.

683
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,967
SEAFOOD AND SCALLION PANCAKE

684
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,533
This is my favorite dish.

685
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:45,066
It's for rainy days.

686
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:46,033
You pan-fry it.

687
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:47,266
With "makgeol."

688
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,033
With "makgeol."

689
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,233
Hold on.

690
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:52,233
One.

691
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:54,667
- Seafood and scallion pancake.
- Listen.

692
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,800
- Seafood and scallion pancake.
- Listen.

693
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,734
"Makgeol"?

694
00:31:57,734 --> 00:32:00,734
- He said, "makgeol." Is it okay...
- It doesn't count.

695
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:02,867
- ...to cut off a word?
-"Makgeol" doesn't count.

696
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,533
-"Makgeol" doesn't count.
- These days...

697
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,033
- Sae-ho, it's incorrect.
- It's...

698
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:08,066
It was intentional.

699
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:09,400
"Makgeol" doesn't count.

700
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,900
Hey, "makgeol."

701
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,100
- No.
- Makgeolli.

702
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,734
-"Makgeol."
- No.

703
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:14,767
"Makgeol" was...

704
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,433
- It'll be hard to go fast.
- I know.

705
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,834
Ready, set, go.

706
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:19,934
SOY SAUCE MARINATED CRABS

707
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,967
It's a very delicious dish.

708
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:23,100
Love it the most.

709
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,400
Eat rice endlessly.

710
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,467
Soy sauce.

711
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Soy sauce.

712
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,600
Soy sauce marinated crabs.

713
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,500
Soy sauce marinated crabs.

714
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,900
You can't say, "Soy sauce."

715
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,333
- Why?
- It's in the answer.

716
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:35,533
- Incorrect.
- You can't say,

717
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,133
-"Soy sauce."
- Too direct.

718
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:39,500
- It was too direct.
- That was...

719
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,967
- Is it not allowed?
- Why not?

720
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:43,700
- JENNIE says so.
- It isn't allowed.

721
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,166
- JENNIE says so.
- You can't say, "Soy sauce."

722
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:48,133
- Okay. I'll accept it.
- You can't say it.

723
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,800
Ready, go.

724
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,333
HEDGEHOG

725
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,233
This one resembles a toothpick.

726
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,500
I think it's prickly.

727
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,066
Hedgehog.

728
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,367
You cheated.

729
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:07,467
- Why?
- You cheated. No gestures.

730
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,266
- Yes. You cheated.

731
00:33:09,266 --> 00:33:10,533
You cheated.

732
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:12,500
How is this a hedgehog?

733
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,033
- I knew from your gesture.
- Seriously. It tipped me off.

734
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:16,233
- Right?
- Yes.

735
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:18,700
- He cheats a lot.
- He's a cheater.

736
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,600
You're being warned.

737
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,767
- The rules have gotten strict.
- Seriously.

738
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,567
- All right.
- You cheat so much, Sae-ho.

739
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:28,000
You're too much. Seriously.

740
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,100
Sae-ho, you cheat so much.

741
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:32,633
Sae-ho, you cheat so much.

742
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:37,300
- Sae-ho, you cheat so much.
- No.

743
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:40,500
The king of cheating.

744
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,700
- Sae-ho, you cheat so much.
- No.

745
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,000
We can switch later.

746
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,500
- I'll go first.
- Let's go.

747
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,600
- Will you go first?
- Yes.

748
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,400

00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:53,266
- Ready, set, go.
- Good.

752
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,867
He's a master of something.

753
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:01,667
That was a good one. JENNIE is good.

754
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,467
- He possesses a homely charm.
- That was a good one.

755
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:06,900
The cooking king.

756
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,600
- Paik Jong-won.
- Yes.

757
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,400
- Well done.
- Okay.

758
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,734
That was good.

759
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:16,133
- My goodness.
- Okay.

760
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:17,767
- It was great.
- My goodness.

761
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:19,333
That was good.
It was straight to the point.

762
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,934
- My goodness.
- That was good.

763
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,767
-"Master."
-"The cooking king."

764
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:23,900
Ready, go.

765
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,266
HAMSTER

766
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:29,100
- An animal with chubby cheeks.
- My goodness.

767
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,433
My goodness.

768
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:33,100
It's a mini-sized animal.

769
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:36,667
It's very cute.

770
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,100
Squirrel.

771
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,533
Shall I listen to the last explanation?

772
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:45,433
- You answered fast.
- Yes.

773
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,767
Shall I listen to the last explanation?

774
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,200
- Come on.
- Sae-ho, you cheat so much.

775
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,266
- You can do it.
- Okay.

776
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:56,266
Raise it.

777
00:34:56,266 --> 00:34:58,367
One. Time's up.

778
00:34:58,367 --> 00:34:59,667
Guinea pig.

779
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,266
Hamster. I knew it was a hamster.

780
00:35:05,934 --> 00:35:08,633
- Hamster.
- Hamster.

781
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:10,467
- I knew it was a hamster.
- Hamster.

782
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,100
I can't describe a hamster
as a baby rat, right?

783
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,734
I can't do that, right?

784
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:16,667
"A baby rat."

785
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:19,000
I can't describe a hamster
as a baby rat, right?

786
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,567
- It's cheating.
- I see.

787
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:22,166
Cheating? I'm not even playing.

788
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,367
- Cheating?
- How is it cheating?

789
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:26,367
Ready, go.

790
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:27,400
GORILLA

791
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,600
- This one is an animal.
- An animal.

792
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,033
- This one is an animal.
- An animal.

793
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:33,500
It resembles a person.

794
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,133
- King Kong, no?
- What?

795
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:40,367
What's "King Kong, no?"

796
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:43,133
- Gorilla.
- Okay.

797
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:44,400
Okay.

798
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,600
Why is that okay?

799
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,266
- Gorilla.
- Okay.

800
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:48,200
My goodness.

801
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,033
The production crew is lenient on them.

802
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:53,600
- Listen.
- What was that?

803
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
Seriously.

804
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,133
I've been a fan of hers for years.

805
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:02,200
- I love her.
- Go easy on us.

806
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,300
- I...
- Go easy on us.

807
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,033
I'm sorry, but please
get your hands off me.

808
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,533
- Come on.
- I'm a big fan, but...

809
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:13,734
"King Kong, no?" It was a bit...

810
00:36:13,734 --> 00:36:16,200
"King Kong, no?" and this gesture
were too much.

811
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,767
-"King Kong, no?" It's a phrase.
- Go easy on us.

812
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:21,166
- Is it a phrase? It's a phrase.
- Yes, it's a phrase.

813
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:24,066
Is it a phrase? Okay. It's a phrase.

814
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:25,600
It's a phrase.

815
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,667
We let it slide since they were cute.

816
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,500
The Chas won.

817
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,333
- Really?
- Yes.

818
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,734
It's my first time winning as a team.

819
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,233
It's my first time winning.

820
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,100
The team members can open it and check.

821
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,133
Where should we check it?

822
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:43,166
It's a videotape. What do we have?

823
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:48,900
WHAT: CHECK OUT GRADE 1, CLASS 3
WHERE: PLUS, B, CL, FINE DUST

00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,066
Weren't we there earlier?

828
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:08,834
- It's the classroom next door.
- The one next door?

829
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:10,700
- Can we go?
- Yes.

830
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,166
Sae-ho.

831
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:19,300
This...

832
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,667
This should be checked at the biology lab.

833
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,033
- Okay.

834
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,567

839
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,033
- This place is scary.

840
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:00,233
I'll close it. Play the videotape.

841
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,867
Let's watch it here. Put it in there.

842
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,266
What? Why are there a tiger and a dragon?

843
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:28,433
What do they mean?

844
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:37,533
"The king's, teacher's,
and father's love"?

845
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,166
"The king's, teacher's,
and father's love"?

846
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,333
Gosh, you're cool.

847
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,400
How so?

848
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:52,266
- Because I read the Chinese characters?
- Yes.

849
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:56,200
What's that framed picture of carp?

850
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:00,467
Why are there carp?

851
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,667
Doesn't this plushie look unpleasant?

852
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:11,033
- Seriously.
- What's this?

853
00:39:11,033 --> 00:39:13,934
- This plushie looks strange.
- Right?

854
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:18,100
What are these?

855
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
WATER THEM EVERY FRIDAY!

856
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,300
I know what they are.
Jae-seok, do you know?

857
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,100
Of course. Grass heads.

858
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,734
- They were popular back in the day.
- Grass grows from them like hair.

859
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:38,000
- Really?
- You water them.

860
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,700
- Is it real grass?
- It grows.

861
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,567
- How cute.
- Grass heads.

862
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:44,066
- I haven't seen them in a while.
- Grass heads.

863
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,233
What? This is...

864
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,266
"Your girlfriend or boyfriend
in university."

865
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:52,967
In-sung.

866
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,800

867
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:05,367
Go Soo.

Look at Jung-jae.

869
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:16,667
What? Why are there stars?

870
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:24,100
- There are stars.
- Why?

871
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,000
Byung-hun, Jung-jae...

872
00:40:28,734 --> 00:40:30,033
- Lee Jung-jae.
- Park Shin-yang.

873
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:32,166
- Here. Park Shin-yang.
- Park Shin-yang.

874
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:34,266
- Lee Byung-hun.
- In-sung.

875
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,166
Lee, Lee, Park.

876
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:41,300
- Lee...
- What does this mean?

877
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,333
- What?
- What's this?

878
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,834
Is it here for no reason?

879
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:00,734
There are X marks.

880
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:02,400
- On the shoulders?
- What are they?

881
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,500
Why on the shoulders?

882
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:08,600
Why are there X marks on the shoulders?

883
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,066
What? What's this?

884
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:17,600
TODAY'S LUNCH - RICE BALLS,
KKAKDUGI, TOFU, BEANS

885
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,300
In 2003, we watched VHS tapes.

886
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,400
- It's you.
- What?

887
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,166
You must've bought a new car.

888
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,500
Why don't you live in it?

889
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,000
Hi*** understands how you feel.

890
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,633
- That's incredible.
- That's right. Hi***.

891
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,734
Sunny ** is delicious!

892
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:44,734
- It's Jae-seok.
- My goodness.

893
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,900
- It's Jae-seok.
- My goodness.

894
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:49,300
- Sunny **.
- I've seen this commercial.

895
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:53,100
They groomed the students
by giving them an allowance

896
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:55,433
and made them join...

897
00:42:00,133 --> 00:42:04,266
The seniors made the others greet them.

898
00:42:04,266 --> 00:42:05,667
It was like that.

899
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:10,233
They made connections
with students from 11 high schools

900
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,166
and accepted...

901
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:14,300
For each school, they appointed a leader

902
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,266
and used them as...

903
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:19,734
They gave the students an allowance
and money for entertainment regularly.

904
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,266
It's like a scouting process.

905
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:26,734
Since it looked cool...

906
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:28,967
Meanwhile...

907
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,633
Students who wanted to be...

908
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:35,367
were forced to engage in
criminal activities to become members.

909
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:41,166
Since the current case
has become a big social issue,

910
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:44,233
the police are after "A's" gang

911
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,333
that is behind the high school...

912
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:51,900
They're after "A."

913
00:42:56,533 --> 00:43:00,600
So the adults were scouting students.

914
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:06,233
- It's ****.
- Yes.

915
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:08,800
- It's ****.
- Yes.

916
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,767
...get recruited.

917
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,800
Look at this.

918
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,500
"The rules of Grade 1, Class 3.
Live as a family."

919
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:23,266
2. LIVE AS A FAMILY!
BE POLITE TO YOUR SENIORS!

920
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,633
3. BE EACH OTHER'S STRENGTH
WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH!

921
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:28,700
- They don't seem like rules at a school.
- Seriously.

922
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,934
It's ****, isn't it?

923
00:43:32,934 --> 00:43:35,967
- It's ****, isn't it?
- That's right. It's ****.

924
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,734
- I think it's a gang.
- Yes.

925
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:42,333
Top dogs at the schools...

926
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,533
- A dragon tattoo. Isn't that it?
- That's right.

927
00:43:44,533 --> 00:43:47,133
- Gangsters.
- A gang.

928
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:49,066
That's right. Shoulders.

929
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,100
TODAY'S LUNCH - RICE BALLS,
KKAKDUGI, TOFU, BEANS

930
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,567
If we study the rampant juvenile violence,

931
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:32,767
a tendency to imitate the violent scenes
in animated works and movies

932
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:34,333
can be clearly seen.

933
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:40,033
2003
WOOSANG GANGSTER HIGH SCHOOL

934
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,500
The gangs that were dormant
for a short while

935
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,734
are growing
like poisonous mushrooms again.

936
00:44:44,734 --> 00:44:48,166
The fact that middle and high schoolers
are also in these gangs

937
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:49,233
has shocked the nation.

938
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:51,333
Violent cliques in middle and high school

939
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,967
were found to be the breeding ground
for gangsters,

940
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:55,500
much to everyone's shock.

941
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,300
The schools were raising
aspiring gangsters.

942
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,100
Adult gangsters groomed the students

943
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,967
by giving them an allowance

944
00:45:05,967 --> 00:45:08,834
and made them join the gang
upon graduation.

945
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:12,467
Students who were deemed useful
due to their fighting skills and physique

946
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:14,367
were groomed since high school

947
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,233
with drinks and spending money.

948
00:45:16,233 --> 00:45:19,400
Some members of the gang
were made to work as scouters.

949
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:27,934
The government has set out
to cut the schools' ties with the gangs.

950
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:31,633
- I think it's a gang.
- Yes.

951
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:33,166
Top dogs at the schools...

952
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:35,700
They're after "A."

953
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:39,934
The police are after "A's" gang

954
00:45:39,934 --> 00:45:42,834
that is behind
the high school gang recruitment.

955
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,300
There was more.

956
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,934
There were strange symbols.

957
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:56,533
- Chemical symbols.
- What does that mean?

958
00:45:58,533 --> 00:45:59,533
It's Cl.

959
00:46:02,633 --> 00:46:05,433
- I saw Cl.
- Cl is chlorine.

960
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:14,200
Perhaps we're here because of that reason.

961
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:16,200
- The biology lab.
-"Plus."

962
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,834
Let me see the videotape.

963
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:21,900
WHERE: PLUS, B, CL, FINE DUST

964
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:27,967
I can't figure it out
no matter how much I look at it.

965
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:30,033
- B.
- B.

966
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:32,100
- B, Pac-Man.
- B, Pac.

967
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,100
CL.

968
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,467
- CL.
- Yes.

969
00:46:35,467 --> 00:46:37,300
- My goodness.
- What's B?

970
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,166
- What's B?
- B.

971
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,967
My goodness. Why is this boiling?

972
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:44,433
Shall we go to Grade One, Class Three?

973
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:45,633
- Yes.
- What's Cl?

974
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,300
Are there more clues here? There must be.

975
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,700
They might destroy the clues
we need to see.

976
00:47:05,266 --> 00:47:06,667
Which way did they go?

977
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:08,433
- They went this way.
- Here?

978
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:13,900
The video player is here.
This must be where we watch it.

979
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:16,433
They took out the video.

980
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:19,266
You know,

981
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:22,667
there must be a gang in this school.

982
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:24,433
- It seems that way.
- Right.

983
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:26,967
There's a gangster among us.

984
00:47:26,967 --> 00:47:28,767
Is YEONJUN a gangster?

985
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,200
Is YEONJUN a gangster?

986
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,367
That's the plot of My Boss, My Hero.

987
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:39,533
He was the boss of a gang.

988
00:47:40,033 --> 00:47:42,000
Does that mean YEONJUN is

989
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,266
- a gangster who enrolled in school?
- Maybe.

990
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:52,967
Where's "A"?

991
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:55,367
We need to solve the clue for "Where".
Grade One, Class Three.

992
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,767
Grade One, Class Three.

993
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:09,934
What? Grade One, Class Three. Where?

994
00:48:09,934 --> 00:48:12,166
Where? It's a location.

995
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:17,433
A cross. The plus symbol is a cross.
Jung-ha.

996
00:48:17,433 --> 00:48:19,533
The plus symbol is a cross. Jung-ha.

997
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:23,166
- Jung-ha, a cross. B.
- I mean...

998
00:48:25,433 --> 00:48:27,166
- Jung-ha, a cross. B.
- A cross.

999
00:48:27,734 --> 00:48:29,767
- What else was there, Jung-ha?
- B.

1000
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:31,200
Plus, B.

1001
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,934
- Jung-ha, a cross. B.
- I mean...

1002
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:35,467
Is Grade One, Class Three
the answer to "where"?

1003
00:48:35,467 --> 00:48:39,166
- Cl.
- Hey, erase it.

1004
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:44,200
- Excited about something?
- No.

1005
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:46,033
Did you find something?

1006
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:52,767
JENNIE, Na-ra.

1007
00:48:54,233 --> 00:48:55,233
Let's eat.

1008
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,266
JENNIE, Na-ra.

1009
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,500
What are you doing, Mr. Cho?

1010
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,133
PLUS, B, CL, FINE DUST

1011
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:06,700
- Well...
- Is that a belly button?

1012
00:49:08,066 --> 00:49:09,333
Is that a Chinese character?

1013
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,367
The one for "top."

1014
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:12,900
- Saturday.
- I'm just brainstorming.

1015
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,633
- Aren't you going to eat?
- I'm going to.

1016
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:16,667
- Why? What?
- I need to do something.

1017
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,266
Are you going to eat?

1018
00:49:21,734 --> 00:49:22,734
Dust.

1019
00:49:22,734 --> 00:49:23,800
Are you going to eat?

1020
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,767
- I solved it.
- You solved it? How?

1021
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:30,066
- I solved it.
- You solved it? How?

1022
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,934
It's easy.

1023
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,600
Really?

1024
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,767
- Tae-hyun...
- Did you solve it?

1025
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,834
...being on Apartment404

1026
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:40,367
- made me a genius.
- Let's see it.

1027
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:42,233
- Everyone, pay attention.
- Okay.

1028
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:43,400
- Okay.
- All right.

1029
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,367
- Watch.
- Okay.

1030
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:46,767
- First of all...
- Yes.

1031
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:48,100
PLUS, B, CL, FINE DUST

1032
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,300
- Fine dust. This is the clue.
- Yes.

1033
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:52,867
A smiley face? Okay.

1034
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:54,333
Watch.

1035
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:57,600
What does the face
after "fine dust" tell us?

1036
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,367
The face that comes after "fine dust."

1037
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,266
- Is the fine dust level bad or...
- Good.

1038
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:04,033
- Bad.
- It isn't bad.

1039
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:06,834
- Good. Moderate.
- It means moderate.

1040
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:08,467
If the fine dust level is moderate...

1041
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:10,367
Moderate.

1042
00:50:10,367 --> 00:50:12,467
It's a homophone for "infirmary."

1043
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,467
Bed. A red cross.

1044
00:50:14,467 --> 00:50:16,367
It means hospital.

1045
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:17,533
It's the nurse's office.

1046
00:50:18,033 --> 00:50:19,834
It's the nurse's office.

1047
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,266
THE NURSE'S OFFICE

1048
00:50:40,266 --> 00:50:42,700
- How about this?
- They made "bed."

1049
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,400
- B, E, D.
- We didn't need to worry about Cl.

1050
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,533
A cross. Let's go.

1051
00:50:49,033 --> 00:50:50,734
I'm a seasoned member.

1052
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,400
That was incredible.

1053
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,767
Let's do this today.

1054
00:50:57,734 --> 00:51:00,133
The nurse's office.

1055
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,100
That was incredible. I got goose bumps.

1056
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,400
Think of me as the brain of the team.

1057
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,734
You're the brain.

1058
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:08,967
Of course.

1059
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,333
My school had it too.

1060
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:12,767
NURSE'S OFFICE

1061
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,800
- That's the nurse's office.
- There it is.

1062
00:51:15,934 --> 00:51:17,834
The nurse's office. Go slowly.

1063
00:51:18,734 --> 00:51:20,033
Let's slide in.

1064
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:23,400
Hurry up.

1065
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:34,967
NURSE'S OFFICE VISITOR SLIP

1066
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:36,867
RELAXATION ROOM

1067
00:51:49,633 --> 00:51:51,667
What? Isn't that YEONJUN?

1068
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:52,967
Is that YEONJUN?

1069
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,367
No, it isn't him.

1070
00:51:58,767 --> 00:51:59,900
YEONJUN.

1071
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:03,800
- YEONJUN.
- YEONJUN?

1072
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:06,200
- YEONJUN.
- YEONJUN?

1073
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,133
I can't untie my shoelaces.

1074
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:10,900
- It's YEONJUN.
- YEONJUN.

1075
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,934
YEONJUN, are you okay?

1076
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:14,834
What are you doing? Why are you hiding?

1077
00:52:14,834 --> 00:52:16,200
- Why are you hiding?
- Are you okay?

1078
00:52:20,433 --> 00:52:23,567
I watched the news clip
about men in their twenties.

1079
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:24,633
Yes. Gangsters.

1080
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:26,233
Are you Gangster "A"?

1081
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:28,667
Are you Gangster "A"?

1082
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:35,233
It isn't like that.
I wanted to join the gang.

1083
00:52:35,233 --> 00:52:36,767
I wanted to join the gang.

1084
00:52:38,066 --> 00:52:39,033
What?

1085
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,700
What?

1086
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,900
I mean, YEONJUN...

1087
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,066
Why did you put a necklace
in Si-eun's backpack?

1088
00:52:47,066 --> 00:52:48,066
Why did you do that?

1089
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:50,967
Tell us honestly. We can help you.

1090
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,200
I stole the necklace.

1091
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,467
Did you steal the necklace
because you wanted to be a gangster?

1092
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:05,734
I needed to do it to pass the test
and join the gang.

1093
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,967
Meanwhile, adult gangsters
forced high school students

1094
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:12,066
to commit violent crimes

1095
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:14,633
under the guise of them
being a rite of passage.

1096
00:53:30,734 --> 00:53:32,400
I stole the necklace. I'm sorry.

1097
00:53:32,934 --> 00:53:35,000
- Someone made you do it.
- Right?

1098
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,133
Who was it?

1099
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,967
I can't tell you.

1100
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:42,700
- I really like TXT.
- Okay.

1101
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,700
Would you please tell me?

1102
00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:49,066
- To be honest...
- Okay.

1103
00:53:49,066 --> 00:53:51,400
- You watched the news, right?
- Yes.

1104
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:55,166
The police are after "A's" gang

1105
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:58,100
that is behind
the high school gang recruitment.

1106
00:53:59,066 --> 00:54:02,567
- The one the police are after, "A"...
- Yeah?

1107
00:54:06,066 --> 00:54:08,900
What?

1108
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:11,233
- What?
- What?

1109
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:15,700
JENNIE, Na-ra. Let's eat.

1110
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,166
Woo-il, is this where we eat?

1111
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:20,166
Come on in.

1112
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:21,967
- I'll serve the food...
- Okay.

1113
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,900
- ...when the rest of the team comes.
- Okay.

1114
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,767
The spoons and chopsticks are missing.

1115
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:27,467
They were inside.

1116
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,233
Where's that one teammate of yours?

1117
00:54:45,233 --> 00:54:47,834
- Na-ra.
- Na-ra.

1118
00:54:49,133 --> 00:54:51,166
- Oh Na-ra.
- Yes?

1119
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:53,467
You don't listen, do you?

1120
00:54:53,467 --> 00:54:54,567
Did you call me?

1121
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:56,800
- Let's eat.
- It's time for lunch.

1122
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,233
- Here.
- Does everyone get food?

1123
00:54:58,233 --> 00:55:00,500
- Wipe your hands.
- Okay. Thank you.

1124
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,300
- The one the police are after, "A"...
- Yeah?

1125
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:10,700
It's Si-eun.

1126
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,700
What?

1127
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,000
- What?
- What?

1128
00:55:14,867 --> 00:55:18,900
Si-eun is a scouter for the gang.

1129
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,533
- You saw the man on the motorcycle.
- Yes.

1130
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:26,266
- He's a scouter.
- Yes. He's a scouter too.

1131
00:55:29,233 --> 00:55:30,700
I like you.

1132
00:55:33,233 --> 00:55:35,433
It wasn't me.

1133
00:55:39,567 --> 00:55:42,066
It looks like the students are close.

1134
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,367
Is it him or me?

1135
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:54,266
I like both of you guys.

1136
00:55:56,967 --> 00:55:58,266
I like you.

1137
00:55:58,767 --> 00:56:00,767
I like both of you guys.

1138
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,867
You're saying Si-eun is a scouter
who's a part of the gang.

1139
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:11,734
The police are after "A's" gang

1140
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:14,667
that is behind
the high school gang recruitment.

1141
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:22,300
- It's a secret, but...
- Okay.

1142
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,300
- How were you led astray?
- Here's the important thing.

1143
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,467
- Here's the important thing.
- Sorry. I was too absorbed.

1144
00:56:28,467 --> 00:56:31,433
Among the transfer students...

1145
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:32,500
Okay.

1146
00:56:33,834 --> 00:56:35,233
There are two scouters.

1147
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:37,266
There are two scouters.

1148
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,834
Among the transfer students?

1149
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:42,567
I knew that'd be the case.

1150
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:46,567
Among the transfer students,
there are two scouters.

1151
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:47,667
Yes.

1152
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:51,400
The police are after "A's" gang

1153
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,567
that is behind
the high school gang recruitment.

1154
00:56:56,333 --> 00:57:00,900
Scouters select and recruit students
for the gang.

1155
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,300
Once they select the students,

1156
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,633
- they tell Si-eun.
- Si-eun?

1157
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:07,800
Then Si-eun recruits them.

1158
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:10,066
I see. In that case,

1159
00:57:10,834 --> 00:57:11,967
two transfer students

1160
00:57:11,967 --> 00:57:14,533
must be carrying out
a secret mission for Si-eun.

1161
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:16,400
That's right.

1162
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:18,700
Right. They're doing it now.

1163
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:22,200
What do they do for Si-eun?

1164
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:29,500
- Na-ra.
- Oh Na-ra.

1165
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,800
Yes?

1166
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,567
The two of you are the scouters of a gang

1167
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:41,700
who infiltrated the school
in order to recruit gangsters.

1168
00:57:42,934 --> 00:57:45,633
From now on, you'll...

1169
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,100
It's a very difficult mission.

1170
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:57,834
- Gosh, this is... Fish snack.
- My goodness.

1171
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,800
Na-ra.

1172
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,000
- Na-ra.
- Oh Na-ra.

1173
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,066
Yes?

1174
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,900
- There could be a scouter among us three.
- Yes.

1175
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:40,934
I don't know. You guys have to find them.

1176
00:58:41,633 --> 00:58:44,333
- Okay. YEONJUN, see you later.
- Well done.

1177
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,633
My niece likes you very much.

1178
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,800
You have a niece.

1179
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,867
You're my friend's whole life.

1180
00:58:51,867 --> 00:58:54,400
- All right. See you later.
- YEONJUN.

1181
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,100
- Don't get hurt.
- Thank you.

1182
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,100
We'll get going.

1183
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:00,433
Let's join the others.

1184
00:59:00,433 --> 00:59:02,333
- Let's go to the cafeteria.
- The cafeteria.

1185
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:04,500
- Tae-hyun, it's not you.
- This is hard.

1186
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,367
It's not me either.

1187
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,000
Should we tell the others or not?

1188
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:12,967
I think we should do that.

1189
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:16,367
All right. Do you want us

1190
00:59:16,934 --> 00:59:19,066
to share what we found out?

1191
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:21,367
Sure. Go ahead.

1192
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:25,700
There are spies among us.

1193
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,600
No way.

1194
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:38,233
Judging by the timing,

1195
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,300
it'd make sense for Jae-seok
to do it last.

1196
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,600
No.

1197
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,867
His dependable supporter, Tae-hyun,
must be a spy too.

1198
00:59:45,867 --> 00:59:47,700
The Pinggyego duo.

1199
00:59:51,767 --> 00:59:54,967
Although it's Sae-ho's first visit,
he talks a lot.

1200
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:57,200
- He acts out.
- It's suspicious.

1201
00:59:58,633 --> 01:00:01,567
- We tend to make deductions openly.
- That's right.

1202
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:03,767
We were whispering. Why did you eavesdrop?

1203
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:05,500
Did you hear us?

1204
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,700
- We were talking to ourselves, okay?
- Unbelievable.

1205
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,867
I don't know what game you're playing,
but it has nothing to do with me.

1206
01:00:11,367 --> 01:00:13,233
I'm not playing a role.

1207
01:00:13,233 --> 01:00:16,066
If you're holding back information,
I'll end you.

1208
01:00:16,066 --> 01:00:17,133
Trust me.

1209
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:18,734
How about a punch for 100 won?

1210
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:24,834
Na-ra and JENNIE, did you guys
get into fights when you were in school?

1211
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:26,900
I didn't fight at all.

1212
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,967
Me neither.

1213
01:00:28,533 --> 01:00:29,767
Did you?

1214
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:31,667
Me? I never lost.

1215
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:35,900
- Because I never fought anyone.
- You never fought?

1216
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,400
Where's Si-eun? Do we need to find her?

1217
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:54,934
Mr. Im is here.

1218
01:00:54,934 --> 01:00:57,533
Did you enjoy your lunch?

1219
01:00:57,533 --> 01:00:58,834
- Yes.
- Yes, we did.

1220
01:00:58,834 --> 01:01:01,433
- Shall we leave for a game?
- Shall we?

1221
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:02,667
Let's go next door.

1222
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,166
- Okay.
- Next door.

1223
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,500
Your special activity for the day
is called

1224
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,533
- Bell Tag.
- What's that?

1225
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,266
- Bell Tag.
- Bell Tag.

1226
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
- The catchers will begin on this side.
- Okay.

1227
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,667
The runners will begin in the corner
that's diagonal to the catchers.

1228
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:22,166
The representative catcher
will wear a blindfold.

1229
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:25,166
The key is the sound of the bell.

1230
01:01:28,567 --> 01:01:29,967
Take three steps.

1231
01:01:29,967 --> 01:01:32,300
One, two, three. Stop.

1232
01:01:34,934 --> 01:01:37,200
Take large steps
toward your eleven o'clock.

1233
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,600
That's good. Keep going. One more step.

1234
01:01:42,467 --> 01:01:44,200
If the bat touches you, you're out.

1235
01:01:45,433 --> 01:01:46,734
Let's go again.

1236
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:52,934
- Na-ra, go ahead.
- I'll try it. It'll be fun.

1237
01:01:52,934 --> 01:01:55,433
I don't hold back,
so I can take big steps.

1238
01:01:55,433 --> 01:01:56,967
Na-ra doesn't hold back.

1239
01:01:56,967 --> 01:01:59,633
- I don't hold back, okay?
- Okay. We're fine with that.

1240
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:00,767
Let's begin.

1241
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,700
- Five steps.
- Okay.

1242
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,033
- Five steps.
- I prefer that.

1243
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,133
One.

1244
01:02:12,133 --> 01:02:13,400
Three, four.

1245
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:18,233
- All right.
- Okay. Ready, go.

1246
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:20,633
All right.

1247
01:02:20,633 --> 01:02:22,066
Ready, go.

1248
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:25,000
- To our eleven o'clock?
- Eleven o'clock. Turn a bit.

1249
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,200
- I'll take big steps.
- Ready, go.

1250
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,367
One, two.

1251
01:02:28,367 --> 01:02:30,133
- I'll take big steps.
- Ready, go.

1252
01:02:30,133 --> 01:02:33,133
One, two, three, four, five.

1253
01:02:34,066 --> 01:02:37,133
One, two, three, four, five.

1254
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:53,033
You can't pick up your feet.

1255
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:57,367
- She hit him.
- She's no joke.

1256
01:02:57,367 --> 01:02:58,433
She's no joke.

1257
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,567
Okay. Out. Cho Sae-ho is out.

1258
01:03:07,633 --> 01:03:08,633
Out.

1259
01:03:08,633 --> 01:03:11,000
Cho Sae-ho is out. Out.

1260
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,200
- All right. Let's resume.
- Good.

1261
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:18,767
- All right. Let's resume.
- Good.

1262
01:03:20,266 --> 01:03:23,367
- I'll end you guys.
- Good.

1263
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:24,900
Let's begin.

1264
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,633
- That's good.
- Let's begin.

1265
01:03:42,567 --> 01:03:45,066
Okay. Explain in five seconds. Ready, go.

1266
01:03:45,066 --> 01:03:46,834
- One o'clock.
- One o'clock.

1267
01:03:47,467 --> 01:03:49,467
- To the right. There you go.
- Big steps.

1268
01:03:49,467 --> 01:03:50,800
One o'clock.

1269
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,700
Peekaboo.

1270
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,000
- To the right. There you go.
- Big steps.

1271
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,233
Take two big steps.

1272
01:03:54,233 --> 01:03:55,567
- Big steps.
- Very big steps.

1273
01:03:55,567 --> 01:03:56,900
Very big steps.

1274
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,500
Big steps.

1275
01:04:00,433 --> 01:04:02,834
- Big steps.
- Very big steps.

1276
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:31,700
Where is she?

1277
01:04:39,033 --> 01:04:41,367
Out.

1278
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:43,967
- There we go.
- One runner remains.

1279
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:46,166
- Let's go.
- It was like Attack on Titan.

1280
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:47,734
It was like Attack on Titan.

1281
01:04:47,734 --> 01:04:49,467
- Good.
- She's the best.

1282
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:51,233
One runner remains. Let's go.

1283
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,200
One runner remains.
Who's the remaining one?

1284
01:04:58,133 --> 01:04:59,200
- I'll end you.
- All right.

1285
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,300
- Unbelievable.
- I'll end you.

1286
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:06,166
- Ready...
- I'll end you.

1287
01:05:06,166 --> 01:05:07,133
There you go.

1288
01:05:08,133 --> 01:05:09,033
Two steps.

1289
01:05:12,834 --> 01:05:14,033
Two steps.

1290
01:05:14,033 --> 01:05:16,133
WAA (CRYING)

1291
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:19,800
All right.

1292
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:22,700
All right.

1293
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,200
- Yes. That's the direction.
- Yes.

1294
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,767
- That way. Two steps.
- Two steps.

1295
01:05:27,767 --> 01:05:31,900
I'll end you. One...

1296
01:05:34,834 --> 01:05:36,700
- That way. Two steps.
- Two steps.

1297
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,233
I'll end you. One, two.

1298
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,066
- Let's go.
- We did it.

1299
01:05:46,066 --> 01:05:47,066
You got them all.

1300
01:05:47,066 --> 01:05:48,600
- It hurt, didn't it?
- It's okay.

1301
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,700
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1302
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,266
- You're the best.
- Why...

1303
01:05:52,133 --> 01:05:53,367
Oh Na-ra.

1304
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,600
I can't see anything.

1305
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,100
All right.

1306
01:06:12,467 --> 01:06:13,700
Okay. Explain. Ready, go.

1307
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,166
Turn around.

1308
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:20,734
- Take three steps forward.
- Done.

1309
01:06:20,734 --> 01:06:21,734
JUNG-HA'S POINT OF VIEW

1310
01:06:21,734 --> 01:06:23,500
Okay. Swing your bat.

1311
01:06:25,934 --> 01:06:27,500
Okay. Swing your bat.

1312
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,734
Why-- My team is really bad at this.

1313
01:06:40,734 --> 01:06:42,600
Seriously. I can't get anyone.

1314
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,367
I mean...

1315
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:45,934
"My team is really bad at this."

1316
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,200
My team is really bad at this.

1317
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,133
- The winning team will get this.
- Good.

1318
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,533
The winning team.

1319
01:06:53,533 --> 01:06:56,567
The losing team will get this.

1320
01:06:56,567 --> 01:06:57,500
Thank you.

1321
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,400
All right.

1322
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:03,467
Is it a videotape?

1323
01:07:09,967 --> 01:07:12,100
There's a picture of spoons for "who."

1324
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,000
Two spoons?

1325
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,767
Does it mean that there are two people?

1326
01:07:19,867 --> 01:07:21,467
Among the transfer students...

1327
01:07:21,467 --> 01:07:23,033
There are two scouters.

1328
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,767
What do the spoons mean?

1329
01:07:32,767 --> 01:07:35,667
- Two spoons are the hint.
- What did we get?

1330
01:07:35,667 --> 01:07:38,000
What do the two spoons mean?

1331
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,300
You don't think they symbolize
a gold or silver spoon, do you?

1332
01:07:41,867 --> 01:07:44,066
The cafeteria? Rooms 103 and 102?

1333
01:07:44,066 --> 01:07:46,633
- What? There are two spoons.
- Room 102.

1334
01:07:47,867 --> 01:07:49,834
Do their names look like spoons?

1335
01:08:09,934 --> 01:08:10,767
Play.

1336
01:08:16,066 --> 01:08:17,367
Shocking news revealed

1337
01:08:17,367 --> 01:08:20,500
that adult gangsters were recruiting

1338
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,166
underage high schoolers for their gang.

1339
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:26,233
- I see. I think I've seen this before.
- We were right.

1340
01:08:26,233 --> 01:08:30,000
Here is a recording of a conversation
between the boss

1341
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,734
and the scouters.

1342
01:08:31,734 --> 01:08:32,633
What?

1343
01:08:32,633 --> 01:08:38,200
...a recording of a conversation
between the boss and the scouters.

1344
01:08:38,834 --> 01:08:42,133
Aren't there any useful students?

1345
01:08:42,133 --> 01:08:45,166
I told you to recruit
some transfer students.

1346
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:47,300
It isn't easy to do that.

1347
01:08:48,233 --> 01:08:50,567
I told you to recruit
some transfer students.

1348
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,266
Who's that?

1349
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,333
It isn't easy to do that.

1350
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,967
Just bring
the transfer students' fingerprints then.

1351
01:08:59,767 --> 01:09:05,133
We can put their thumbprints
on the application form.

1352
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,467
Between 5 and 5:10 p.m. today,

1353
01:09:12,467 --> 01:09:14,400
hand over the fingerprints to Si-eun.

1354
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,133
Yes, Boss.

1355
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,333
- Si-eun.
- Si-eun?

1356
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,567
From now on,

1357
01:09:22,567 --> 01:09:25,500
you'll collect the members' fingerprints.

1358
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,700
...you'll collect the members' fingerprints.

1359
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:30,834
Between 5 to 5:10 p.m.,

1360
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,834
you must deliver them to Si-eun.

1361
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:33,967
Fingerprints?

1362
01:09:34,567 --> 01:09:36,767
Bring the items
with the members' fingerprints

1363
01:09:36,767 --> 01:09:38,667
to the biology lab

1364
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:41,300
and hand them over to the researcher.

1365
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,367
If the fingerprints can be collected

1366
01:09:43,367 --> 01:09:45,367
from the item, it's a success.

1367
01:09:45,367 --> 01:09:47,633
If they can't be collected,
it's a failure.

1368
01:09:47,633 --> 01:09:49,400
It's a very difficult mission.

1369
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:06,233
Na-ra.

1370
01:10:06,233 --> 01:10:07,767
- Whose item is it?
- Yu Jae-seok's.

1371
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:10,600
- Oh Na-ra.
- Yes?

1372
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,433
You don't listen, do you?

1373
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,900
Did you call me?

1374
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:34,667
- Si-eun.
- Si-eun?

1375
01:10:36,734 --> 01:10:37,667
I see.

1376
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:42,000
I get it now. It seems like the spy
was collecting our fingerprints.

1377
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,166
...the spy was collecting our fingerprints.

1378
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:47,533
The police are looking
for the two scouters

1379
01:10:47,533 --> 01:10:49,633
who collected
students' fingerprints illegally

1380
01:10:49,633 --> 01:10:51,166
and drew up false contracts.

1381
01:10:59,066 --> 01:11:01,000
We need to find the two scouters.

1382
01:11:01,934 --> 01:11:05,867
- Second locker, third-floor chemistry lab.
- All right.

1383
01:11:05,867 --> 01:11:08,433
If you know the whereabouts
of the two scouters,

1384
01:11:08,433 --> 01:11:11,200
please report them
to a nearby police station.

1385
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,066
- Second locker, third-floor chemistry lab.
- Second locker, third-floor chemistry lab.

1386
01:11:17,066 --> 01:11:18,600
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1387
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:25,300
The chemistry lab.

1388
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,867
Chemistry lab's second locker.

1389
01:11:38,266 --> 01:11:39,767
The third-floor chemistry lab.

1390
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:41,800
CHECK OUT THE 2ND LOCKER
IN THE CHEM LAB ON THE 3RD FLOOR

1391
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,533
Let's go to the chemistry lab
on the third floor. Let's hurry.

1392
01:11:45,066 --> 01:11:46,867
Chemistry lab's second locker.

1393
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,066
Chemistry lab's second locker.

1394
01:11:53,233 --> 01:11:55,233
The second locker. This is it.

1395
01:11:57,533 --> 01:11:59,600
The second locker. This is it.

1396
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:05,200
- What's inside?
- It's here.

1397
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,567
A notebook.

1398
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,633
- My goodness.
- What is it?

1399
01:12:11,633 --> 01:12:12,834
- I bet there's a hint.
- What is it?

1400
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:15,767
"The Gangster Code of Conduct."

1401
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:22,133
THE GANGSTER CODE OF CONDUCT

1402
01:12:22,133 --> 01:12:25,667
Since the violent cliques in the school
form ties with the gangs,

1403
01:12:25,667 --> 01:12:29,533
the violence toward students
is becoming crueler by the day.

1404
01:12:29,533 --> 01:12:32,233
The violent cliques make
a code of conduct

1405
01:12:32,233 --> 01:12:35,300
and take revenge on members
who want to leave.

1406
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,600
They aren't much different from the gangs.

1407
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:46,367
"Bow at a 90-degree angle
when you greet someone."

1408
01:12:46,367 --> 01:12:48,333
"Hug the gang members three times a day."

1409
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:50,700
"Shout out loud two times a day."

1410
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,900
So the spies would do these things.

1411
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,333
- Hold on.
- They did already.

1412
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:57,467
I bet they already have.

1413
01:13:05,967 --> 01:13:07,233
Did they speak out loud?

1414
01:13:07,233 --> 01:13:09,233
Hold on. A 90-degree bow?

1415
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:11,834
"Hug three times a day"?

1416
01:13:13,533 --> 01:13:15,734
Who shouted when we first met?

1417
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:20,667
Since we got the code of conduct,
they'll avoid doing these actions.

1418
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:22,000
They'll continue to do them.

1419
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:26,233
Come on.

1420
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,700
Please.

1421
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,700
3. SHOUT OUT LOUD
TWO TIMES A DAY

1422
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:31,834
Okay.

1423
01:13:31,834 --> 01:13:33,633
- YEONJUN, see you later.
- Okay.

1424
01:13:33,633 --> 01:13:36,133
2. HUG THE GANG MEMBERS
THREE TIMES A DAY

1425
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,533
1. BOW AT A 90-DEGREE ANGLE
WHEN YOU GREET SOMEONE

1426
01:13:46,633 --> 01:13:48,667
Hold on. A 90-degree bow?

1427
01:13:50,567 --> 01:13:52,467
- The schoolyard.
- Hug three times a day?

1428
01:13:52,467 --> 01:13:53,767
- The schoolyard.
-"Check out the schoolyard."

1429
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:56,166
WHERE: CHECK OUT THE SCHOOLYARD

1430
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,367
Let's go to the schoolyard.

1431
01:13:57,934 --> 01:13:59,867
- Bow.
- Bow.

1432
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:02,066
Here it is.

1433
01:14:03,767 --> 01:14:04,900
My goodness.

1434
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,300
- What?
- There's something. A notebook.

1435
01:14:11,767 --> 01:14:13,233
Did anyone do these things?

1436
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,667
Hold on. Didn't people hug earlier?

1437
01:14:17,533 --> 01:14:18,533
What?

1438
01:14:21,367 --> 01:14:22,367
What?

1439
01:14:28,533 --> 01:14:29,867
- Who is it?
- I figured it out.

1440
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:31,467
- What?
- Who is it?

1441
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,500
What?

1442
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,333
I'll go and check the schoolyard.

1443
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:36,834
JENNIE, why are you leaving us
hanging? Hold on.

1444
01:14:36,834 --> 01:14:39,000
I need to check the schoolyard.

1445
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,500
Let's check the schoolyard.

1446
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,834
Where should we go?
Can we see it from the classroom?

1447
01:14:42,834 --> 01:14:45,033
Someone definitely hugged.

1448
01:14:45,867 --> 01:14:47,633
I didn't hug anyone.

1449
01:14:47,633 --> 01:14:50,200
- Someone hugged earlier.
- I didn't hug anyone.

1450
01:14:51,934 --> 01:14:53,233
Where did the others go?

1451
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,567
Where did the others go?

1452
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,900
People hugged in front of me earlier.

1453
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,166
You know,

1454
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:02,900
earlier...

1455
01:15:03,567 --> 01:15:06,367
You know, earlier...

1456
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,133
Earlier...

1457
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,500
- Sae-ho...
- Okay.

1458
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,667
- ...and Na-ra hugged.
- Right?

1459
01:15:15,667 --> 01:15:16,633
Yes.

1460
01:15:16,633 --> 01:15:18,867
- Sae-ho...
- Okay.

1461
01:15:18,867 --> 01:15:20,867
- ...and Na-ra hugged.
- Right?

1462
01:15:22,467 --> 01:15:24,934
I've been a fan of hers for years.

1463
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:27,033
- I love her.
- Go easy on us.

1464
01:15:27,033 --> 01:15:29,266
2. HUG THE GANG MEMBERS
THREE TIMES A DAY

1465
01:15:29,266 --> 01:15:31,133
- I...
- Go easy on us.

1466
01:15:31,133 --> 01:15:33,133
I'm sorry, but please
get your hands off me.

1467
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:35,800
- Come on.
- I'm a big fan, but...

1468
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:38,900
- ...and Na-ra hugged.
- Right?

1469
01:15:40,467 --> 01:15:42,066
- They...
- It was during a game.

1470
01:15:42,066 --> 01:15:43,300
- During a game?
- Yes.

1471
01:15:44,867 --> 01:15:47,734
Are the gangsters a team?

1472
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:54,100
- Where did Na-ra go?
- Where did she go?

1473
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,533
- Where did Na-ra go?
- Where did she go?

1474
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,734
Na-ra.

1475
01:16:02,734 --> 01:16:04,767
Oh Na-ra.

1476
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,333
Give me the fingerprints.

1477
01:16:15,333 --> 01:16:16,567
Give me the fingerprints.

1478
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:19,166
Give me the fingerprints.

1479
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:21,533
I'll take it out.

1480
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:30,333
Am I done?

1481
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,066
Just bring
the transfer students' fingerprints then.

1482
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,967
We can put their thumbprints
on the application form.

1483
01:16:43,467 --> 01:16:45,000
Is anyone outside?

1484
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,934
No?

1485
01:16:56,467 --> 01:16:59,200
Si-eun. I don't know where Si-eun is.

1486
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,867
Is she in the schoolyard?

1487
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:02,333
Where is she?

1488
01:17:03,367 --> 01:17:04,967
Si-eun!

1489
01:17:08,567 --> 01:17:10,500
The schoolyard. Something is happening.

1490
01:17:11,266 --> 01:17:13,734
They're playing soccer. I love soccer.

1491
01:17:13,734 --> 01:17:16,734
They're suddenly exercising.

1492
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:19,767
"Check out the schoolyard."

1493
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:22,166
"Check out the schoolyard."

1494
01:17:30,734 --> 01:17:32,300
Is that Si-eun?

1495
01:17:34,467 --> 01:17:37,667
Is that Si-eun? I can't see
because I have bad eyesight.

1496
01:17:38,533 --> 01:17:39,533
Is that Si-eun?

1497
01:17:40,033 --> 01:17:41,700
I don't think she's Si-eun.

1498
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:44,567
How frustrating. I can't see.

1499
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,667
Nice.

1500
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:51,867
What? Something's written on it.

1501
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:53,600
- What? Hold on.
- What?

1502
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,133
- Something's written on it. What? Hold on.
- What?

1503
01:17:56,133 --> 01:17:58,633
- Something's written on it.
- What?

1504
01:18:03,266 --> 01:18:05,934
Something's written on it.

1505
01:18:05,934 --> 01:18:08,133
- Why did you kick it?
- Something's written on it.

1506
01:18:08,133 --> 01:18:11,500
Saeng.

1507
01:18:18,233 --> 01:18:19,934
Pass. Thank you.

1508
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,734
Hak.

1509
01:18:23,734 --> 01:18:25,900
My goodness. I figured it out.

1510
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,433
Tae-hyun, hurry.

1511
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,667
What? What is it?

1512
01:18:32,433 --> 01:18:34,400
I saw the letters.
They made "Student Union."

1513
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,800
Student Union.

1514
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,266
- What's that?
- Gwan.

1515
01:18:37,266 --> 01:18:39,300
- Student Union Building.
- That's right.

1516
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:43,433
- It was on the soccer balls.
- Student Union Building.

1517
01:18:43,433 --> 01:18:44,934
Student Union Building.

1518
01:18:44,934 --> 01:18:46,667
It's right there.

1519
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:47,967
- There.
- There it is.

1520
01:18:50,233 --> 01:18:52,066
STUDENT UNION BUILDING

1521
01:18:52,066 --> 01:18:54,300
Sae-ho, I don't think you're a spy.

1522
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,867
- I'm not a spy.
- Right.

1523
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,100
The code of conduct

1524
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,400
we found...

1525
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,433
Oh, my God.

1526
01:19:01,433 --> 01:19:03,467
The code of conduct we found...

1527
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,033
Oh, my God.

1528
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:07,100
- What?
- Fill it out.

1529
01:19:10,033 --> 01:19:11,767
Violent cliques in middle and high school

1530
01:19:11,767 --> 01:19:14,266
were found to be the breeding ground
for gangsters,

1531
01:19:14,266 --> 01:19:16,000
much to everyone's shock.

1532
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,567
Gangsters managed
the violent cliques in high schools

1533
01:19:19,567 --> 01:19:22,600
and lured students into the gang.

1534
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,033
- What?
- It's scary.

1535
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,700
Hey.

1536
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,533
- YEONJUN.
- Hey.

1537
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,033
What are you doing? Don't join the gang.

1538
01:19:41,033 --> 01:19:42,400
Hurry up and fill it out.

1539
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,033
Don't do it, YEONJUN.

1540
01:19:44,033 --> 01:19:46,066
- Stop.
- I'm going to be a gangster.

1541
01:19:46,066 --> 01:19:47,533
I'll become stronger.

1542
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,166
- Are these our application forms?
- Yes.

1543
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:52,266
- Are these our application forms?
- Yes.

1544
01:19:52,266 --> 01:19:54,500
Our filled-out application forms are here.

1545
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:58,033
- But I never filled one out.
- Me neither.

1546
01:19:58,033 --> 01:20:00,300
Bike Gang.

1547
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:06,533
Si-eun, what are you doing here?

1548
01:20:06,533 --> 01:20:10,100
Do I still look like your friend?

1549
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,967
- You're a gangster.
- What?

1550
01:20:11,967 --> 01:20:13,300
- So scary.
- You're a gangster.

1551
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,367
It's so scary.

1552
01:20:14,367 --> 01:20:17,867
What are we supposed to do?
Are we supposed to join the gang?

1553
01:20:17,867 --> 01:20:20,900
YEONJUN, you shouldn't do that.

1554
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,467
Don't try to stop me.

1555
01:20:22,467 --> 01:20:24,433
I don't know what's going on.

1556
01:20:24,433 --> 01:20:26,200
- Maybe I should just join.
- Tae-hyun.

1557
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,667
He's a spy.

1558
01:20:27,667 --> 01:20:29,367
- Maybe I should just join.
- Tae-hyun.

1559
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:31,000
He's a spy.

1560
01:20:31,767 --> 01:20:32,667
Why would you join?

1561
01:20:32,667 --> 01:20:34,800
Maybe I should join the gang.

1562
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,533
- Do you want to join?
- No.

1563
01:20:36,533 --> 01:20:38,834
Tae-hyun and Na-ra are the spies.

1564
01:20:39,934 --> 01:20:41,734
Tae-hyun and Na-ra are the spies.

1565
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:48,033
There were a dragon and a tiger.

1566
01:20:48,033 --> 01:20:50,800
Tae-hyun's sign is the dragon,
Na-ra's sign is the tiger.

1567
01:20:52,834 --> 01:20:55,667
Tae-hyun's sign is the dragon,
Na-ra's sign is the tiger.

1568
01:20:58,033 --> 01:20:58,967
- You're right.
- Right?

1569
01:20:58,967 --> 01:21:03,233
His sign is the dragon.
And when we met this morning...

1570
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:05,767
- Come to think of it...
- That's right.

1571
01:21:05,767 --> 01:21:07,567
...he was being filmed
with a cell phone camera.

1572
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:09,767
...with a cell phone camera.

1573
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:12,500
Tae-hyun is a spy.

1574
01:21:13,867 --> 01:21:15,800
I noticed something about Na-ra too.

1575
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,934
- Someone is here.
- What?

1576
01:21:16,934 --> 01:21:18,367
- We found them.
- Yes.

1577
01:21:18,367 --> 01:21:19,867
- Na-ra and Tae-hyun.
- We found them.

1578
01:21:19,867 --> 01:21:21,133
- We found them.
- Yes.

1579
01:21:21,133 --> 01:21:22,767
- Na-ra and Tae-hyun.
- We found them.

1580
01:21:22,767 --> 01:21:24,100
Na-ra and Tae-hyun.

1581
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,467
Me and Tae-hyun?

1582
01:21:25,467 --> 01:21:27,200
- Na-ra and Tae-hyun. I know.
- Why me?

1583
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,800
- How do you know?
- It's them.

1584
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,033
For goodness' sake.

1585
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:32,800
- For goodness' sake.
- He talks a lot,

1586
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,967
- right?
- Yes.

1587
01:21:33,967 --> 01:21:36,900
Who could the scouters be?

1588
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:40,133
- Tell me what you know.
- What?

1589
01:21:40,133 --> 01:21:42,166
Did you read the notebook?

1590
01:21:42,166 --> 01:21:43,700
- Yes.
- I saw that.

1591
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,600
- The hug.
- During the game...

1592
01:21:46,533 --> 01:21:47,667
Isn't that it?

1593
01:21:48,767 --> 01:21:49,767
Yes, it is.

1594
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,200
I saw people do this.

1595
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,734
- Na-ra?
- Yes.

1596
01:21:55,734 --> 01:21:58,000
Isn't Sae-ho also a scouter?

1597
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,333
Let me read it.

1598
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:02,333
I saw them do this twice.

1599
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:04,367
- This one.
- Who?

1600
01:22:04,934 --> 01:22:08,500
That's why I'm not saying anything
right now.

1601
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,367
I know that it's him.

1602
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,266
Dear students, this is an announcement.

1603
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:37,433
From now on, the scouters can hand over

1604
01:22:37,433 --> 01:22:39,633
the collected fingerprints.

1605
01:22:39,633 --> 01:22:41,133
When did they get our fingerprints?

1606
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:46,133
If the collected fingerprints
get delivered to Si-eun

1607
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:49,567
by 5:10 p.m., Team Scouters will win.

1608
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:53,900
If they fail,
Team Transfer Students will win.

1609
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:58,166
Both teams, I ask you to do your best
until the very end.

1610
01:22:59,533 --> 01:23:01,266
Si-eun is over there.

1611
01:23:01,266 --> 01:23:02,767
- We found her.
- Si-eun.

1612
01:23:02,767 --> 01:23:04,400
- Stop her.
- Tae-hyun is going closer.

1613
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,433
Stop Si-eun.

1614
01:23:06,433 --> 01:23:07,600
Tae-hyun is going closer.

1615
01:23:10,967 --> 01:23:15,834
- Si-eun.
- Hold on.

1616
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:17,734
Sae-ho is going closer.

1617
01:23:17,734 --> 01:23:19,266
- Hold on.
- I mean...

1618
01:23:19,266 --> 01:23:20,467
- Come here.
- Listen.

1619
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:22,567
It isn't me. In my opinion...

1620
01:23:22,567 --> 01:23:23,900
Sae-ho, step away from her.

1621
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:26,233
- Jung-ha, don't you trust me?
- I don't.

1622
01:23:26,934 --> 01:23:28,700
- Don't you trust me?
- I don't.

1623
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:30,433
- Wipe your snot.
- Snot?

1624
01:23:30,433 --> 01:23:32,166
- Are you getting a fingerprint?
- No.

1625
01:23:32,166 --> 01:23:33,400
What?

1626
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,800
You did this.

1627
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:38,033
I'm very suspicious of Tae-hyun today.
It's him, right?

1628
01:23:38,033 --> 01:23:40,000
The dragon and tiger signs.

1629
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I'd appreciate it if you could come here.

1630
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,100
I'm blocking the path
so that no one gets to Si-eun.

1631
01:23:46,734 --> 01:23:48,834
- Come here. Don't stand there.
- Seriously.

1632
01:23:48,834 --> 01:23:51,000
- Don't stand next to Si-eun.
- No.

1633
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,400
- Come here.
- I'm blocking the path.

1634
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,900
- We need to block it.
- Why did you guys come so close?

1635
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,100
- It really isn't me.
- I mean...

1636
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,700
It really isn't me.

1637
01:24:04,233 --> 01:24:05,500
- Come on out.
- Who is it?

1638
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,533
If time runs out,
the transfer students win.

1639
01:24:07,533 --> 01:24:09,734
- Okay.
- Block the path.

1640
01:24:10,834 --> 01:24:12,967
- Okay.
- Block the path.

1641
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,600
- Okay.
- Block the path.

1642
01:24:20,367 --> 01:24:23,900
All right. Let's start.

1643
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:25,600
- Who are they?
- Let's win.

1644
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,000
Who are the scouters?

1645
01:24:27,767 --> 01:24:30,000
- Who are they? Who are the scouters?
- Let's win.

1646
01:24:32,633 --> 01:24:34,033
- Tae-hyun.
- It isn't me.

1647
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,433
- Who are they? Who are the scouters?
- Let's win.

1648
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:45,033
- Tae-hyun.
- It isn't me.

1649
01:24:45,033 --> 01:24:46,133
Si-eun!

1650
01:24:46,133 --> 01:24:47,867
- What?
- Here!

1651
01:24:47,867 --> 01:24:49,300
Si-eun!

1652
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,834
- What?
- Here!

1653
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:53,834
What?

1654
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,734
- What?
- Here!

1655
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:11,567
- Si-eun!
- What?

1656
01:25:11,567 --> 01:25:12,667
Hurry up.

1657
01:25:12,667 --> 01:25:14,867
- Si-eun!
- What?

1658
01:25:14,867 --> 01:25:18,900
- Si-eun!
- Hurry!

1659
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:21,000
- Hurry!
- Si-eun!

1660
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:26,633
- Si-eun.
- Why is Si-eun so strong?

1661
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,500
- Why are you so strong?
- Si-eun!

1662
01:25:42,133 --> 01:25:44,100
- Where are they?
- Hey.

1663
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,734
Si-eun, no. Protect them.

1664
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:50,133
Si-eun, no. Protect them.

1665
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,834
- Protect them.
- Okay.

1666
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,400
- Si-eun.
- I got them!

1667
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:04,767
- Si-eun.
- I got them!

1668
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:09,367
Well done, Si-eun.

1669
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,600
Well done, Si-eun.

1670
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,967
- Was it JENNIE?
- We won.

1671
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,900
- Was it JENNIE?
- Si-eun.

1672
01:26:29,066 --> 01:26:31,834
The two of you are the scouters of a gang.

1673
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:33,600
- What?
- What?

1674
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,233
We're in school uniforms.
That's unbelievable.

1675
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:38,867
- So we're spies.
- We're spies.

1676
01:26:38,867 --> 01:26:40,533
We must win today.

1677
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,667
- How exciting.
- From now on,

1678
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:45,300
you'll collect the members' fingerprints

1679
01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:48,066
and deliver them to Si-eun.

1680
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:49,800
- Fingerprints.
- Fingerprints.

1681
01:26:52,133 --> 01:26:53,600
Here.

1682
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,600
It'll have fingerprints.

1683
01:26:56,266 --> 01:26:57,767
It's my first time winning.

1684
01:27:01,266 --> 01:27:03,967
Mr. Researcher, do I just give it to you?

1685
01:27:18,467 --> 01:27:20,967
This is for Cha Tae-hyun,
and this is for Cho Sae-ho.

1686
01:27:26,266 --> 01:27:30,233
Also, there's another mission
other than the one about the fingerprints.

1687
01:27:30,233 --> 01:27:31,233
It sounds fun.

1688
01:27:31,233 --> 01:27:33,333
JENNIE, can you shout out loud?

1689
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:34,400
No.

1690
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,266
- We're in trouble.
- I'll give it a go.

1691
01:27:39,066 --> 01:27:41,133
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1692
01:27:41,133 --> 01:27:43,533
- Mr. Im, thank you.
- Thank you.

1693
01:27:43,533 --> 01:27:47,767
1. BOW AT A 90-DEGREE ANGLE
WHEN YOU GREET SOMEONE

1694
01:27:47,767 --> 01:27:49,667
It was so frustrating.

1695
01:27:49,667 --> 01:27:52,100
- You're the best.
- Why...

1696
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,500
You're so good.

1697
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,667
We did it. We did it.

1698
01:27:55,667 --> 01:27:57,767
2. HUG THE GANG MEMBERS
THREE TIMES A DAY

1699
01:27:57,767 --> 01:27:58,967
Why?

1700
01:28:00,266 --> 01:28:02,033
- Go first.
- Go first, okay?

1701
01:28:02,033 --> 01:28:03,533
3. SHOUT OUT LOUD TWO TIMES A DAY

1702
01:28:03,533 --> 01:28:06,100
Oh, no. We'll be late!

1703
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,500
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1704
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,133
- Okay.
- Get ready.

1705
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:17,767
Where's Si-eun?

1706
01:28:17,767 --> 01:28:19,000
First floor.

1707
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,133
- Did we collect them all?
- Yes.

1708
01:28:21,133 --> 01:28:22,266
We need to find Si-eun.

1709
01:28:22,266 --> 01:28:24,333
JENNIE, I'm being suspected.

1710
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:25,934
You should use me.

1711
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,000
- Don't move.
- You shouldn't do that.

1712
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,200
- I love her.
- Go easy on us.

1713
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,900
- I...
- Go easy on us.

1714
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:39,767
- Sae-ho...
- Okay.

1715
01:28:39,767 --> 01:28:41,934
- ...and Na-ra hugged.
- Right?

1716
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:46,200
- Na-ra?
- Yes. Isn't Sae-ho also a scouter?

1717
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,367
I saw them do this twice.

1718
01:28:48,367 --> 01:28:50,533
- Na-ra and Sae-ho?
- Yes.

1719
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:53,533
All right.

1720
01:28:53,533 --> 01:28:55,633
JENNIE.

1721
01:28:56,266 --> 01:28:57,266
Okay.

1722
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:08,867
I...

1723
01:29:17,166 --> 01:29:19,066
Gosh, I'm so disappointed.

1724
01:29:19,066 --> 01:29:20,967
- Is the shoot over?
- Yes.

1725
01:29:20,967 --> 01:29:22,433
I feel like there should be more.

1726
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:25,633
Let's give brief greetings
to wrap up Season One.

1727
01:29:25,633 --> 01:29:26,633
Jung-ha.

1728
01:29:26,633 --> 01:29:29,033
I was clumsy at first.
But if there's a Season Two,

1729
01:29:29,033 --> 01:29:32,266
I'll become the brain of the show
and solve cases diligently.

1730
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:33,233
Thank you.

1731
01:29:38,367 --> 01:29:41,166
What should I do to make good deductions?

1732
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:42,934
Please leave comments.

1733
01:29:42,934 --> 01:29:44,667
I'm frustrated with myself.

1734
01:29:45,767 --> 01:29:48,333
Oh Na-ra's brain is evolving.

1735
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:52,100
- I'm confident in solving all mysteries.
- She's suddenly bragging.

1736
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:55,233
She says that
just because she got it right once.

1737
01:30:01,467 --> 01:30:04,266
I felt like I was here to play.
It was so much fun.

1738
01:30:04,266 --> 01:30:08,533
I'm happy that I made a new family.

1739
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,367
I hope this won't be
our last time together.

1740
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,600
- I'll pray with desperation.
- There should be more.

1741
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:20,800
Thank you very much
for watching Apartment404.

1742
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:24,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1743
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,834
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
