1
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,000
After over 70 years of existence,

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,100
the Soviet Union dissolved
as a sovereign state.

3
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:37,700
As most countries took up
the system of capitalism...

4
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,800
The world has entered
an age of great change.

5
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:49,166
The culprit broke into a neighbor's house
and stole valuables.

6
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:53,200
A threat to poison ice cream
unless the culprit got 50 million won...

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,600
A young life was sacrificed
due to gambling debt.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,667
The culprit has given up on humanity.

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,734
It's the result of the capitalistic jungle

10
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:04,166
that left the greed for capital unchecked.

11
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:54,667
Today, your style is...

12
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:55,734
I'm Shim Shin.

13
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:57,600
I'm Kang Susie today.

14
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,700
Oh, my God.

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,200
You look so handsome.

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,533
Are you a drunkard?

17
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,133
You always work hard
to stick to the concept.

18
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:07,133
JENNIE, what are you?

19
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:10,000
"Don't catch a cold!"

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,300
Don't catch a cold!

21
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,300
- I'll take the lead.
- All right. Take the lead.

22
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,433
Okay.

23
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,433
- Is this the place?
- Is this the place?

24
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,367
Where are we staying today?

25
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:29,600
- Is this the place?
- Unit 504.

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,500
JENNIE.

27
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,033
- Are we entering together?
- Let's enter.

28
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,433
Jae-seok, the unit has gotten bigger.

29
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:36,667
This place is big.

30
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:40,166
- This place is so cozy.
- It's so cute.

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,467
It's warm too.

32
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,900
I want to have sweet potatoes here.

33
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,266
There's a sewing machine too.

34
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,166
- It looks lived-in. It's nice.
- As for this place,

35
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,000
the layout...

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,934
My goodness.

37
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:07,533
- What?
- The rooms are big too.

38
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,834
The rooms... Gosh, are there three rooms?

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,333
It's really big.

40
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,767
- It has been remodeled.
- Why is it so big?

41
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,900
It brings back memories.

42
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:32,567
It even smells lived-in.

43
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,734
- I love the atmosphere.
- I know.

44
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,767
Why is this unit so big?

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,133
It's a household with children.

46
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,533
Hey, look it's Don** Jeongwa.

47
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:48,333
- My goodness.
- When I was a kid, it was like a phone.

48
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:51,500
I wish there was no homework.

49
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,266
It has all the answers.

50
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:01,400
- Jeongwa?
- Yes.

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,867
- It has all the answers.
- Yes.

52
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,333
- I haven't seen Don** Jeongwa in a while.
- Seriously.

53
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,967
- I don't have a clue today.
- What?

54
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,800
I was born in 1986,

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,166
so I was 5 in 1991.

56
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:14,300
You were five?
Then you wouldn't remember anything.

57
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,233
Hold on. JENNIE wasn't even born.

58
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,433
It was years before my birth.

59
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,567
Years before her birth.

60
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:25,667
- Hey, why isn't Jung-ha here?
- Seriously.

61
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,333
One, two, three.

62
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,300
- There he is.
- What?

63
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,200
Happy birthday to you

64
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,967
Is that for me?

65
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:34,300
JENNIE.

66
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,734
-Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

67
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:41,033
- Happy birthday dear JENNIE
- Happy birthday dear JENNIE

68
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:44,100
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

69
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,333
Today...

70
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,900
- Make a wish.
- Thank you.

71
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,300
Make a wish. There you go.

72
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,166
Go ahead.

73
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,767
Thank you.

74
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,266
DETECTIVE JENNIE
WHO OWNS APARTMENT404

75
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:02,233
Was JENNIE's cake the only reason why
you came in late?

76
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,667
That's right. I'm a man
who's dedicated to her birthday.

77
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:07,533
-"A man who's dedicated to her birthday"?
- It's a lie.

78
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:10,200
Do you have a mission?
Why are you stuffing your face?

79
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,667
Why are you stuffing your face?

80
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,667
Na-ra, couldn't you say that more nicely?

81
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:21,266
-"Why are you stuffing your face?"
- It was a correct description.

82
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,967
I was stuffing my face.

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,400
- Shall we watch TV together?
- Let's turn on the TV.

84
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,066
I learned how to do it.

85
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,500
It's... My goodness.

86
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,967
- Jung-ha.
- You don't know how to do it.

87
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,467
- You don't know how to turn it on.
- Pull it or push it.

88
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,200
We aren't the only ones who should learn.

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,300
- The one below that.
- Yes.

90
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,367
You guys should learn old technology too.

91
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:45,867
- The play button?
- JENNIE.

92
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,266
- My goodness.
- JENNIE, how do I do this?

93
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,800
- Open it like this, JENNIE.
- Oh, my god.

94
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,934
Oh, my god.

95
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,367
- Oh, my god.
- Come on.

96
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:56,033
- You push it down.
- Oh, my god.

97
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,767
Okay.

98
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,333
Gosh, it's pretty.

99
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:04,800
"VIOLET FRAGRANCE" BY KANG SUSIE

100
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,633
What? It's Susie.

101
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,133
It's me. I'm dressed up
as Kang Susie today.

102
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:15,600
You came to me gently

103
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,867
I had many sleepless nights
because of her.

104
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,500
She's so innocent and pretty.

105
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:30,600
Susie can sing very well.

106
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,033
- Singers sang live back then.
- They sang live.

107
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,367
- Se-chan.
- My dear

108
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,734
- I need to do the gun dance.
- You're good.

109
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:45,633
- Why do your gums shine so much today?
- They do, don't they?

110
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:46,934
They shine brilliantly.

111
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,767
You're the only one

112
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,700
It brings back memories.

113
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,266
- It's Hee-seok.
- It's Hee-seok.

114
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:56,333
Fan Master.

115
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,500
Excuse me

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,667
Fan Master.

117
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,467
- Excuse me
- He was young.

118
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,667
- It's from 1991.
- My goodness.

119
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:06,300
With your eyes, you look into every matter

120
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,834
This brings back memories.

121
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,800
Is this the fan master's house?

122
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,900
Seriously.

123
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,867
- Yes, yes, you're right
- Yes, yes, you're right

124
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,367
How did you hear about me?

125
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:19,834
Boing!

126
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,000
Everyone sang along to that.

127
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,967
Aren't we going to watch the news today?

128
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:27,533
You're right. Why is there no incident?

129
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,533
Here's what I think.

130
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,533
The backdrop is 1991.

131
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,300
- Are those clips from 1991?
- Yes.

132
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
- They're from 1991?
- I see.

133
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,667
When I debuted, Hee-seok was a rookie.

134
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,867
You guys were colleagues.

135
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:41,133
- Gosh, that startled me.
- Oh, my.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,533
- Gosh, that startled me.
- Oh, my.

137
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,033
- For goodness' sake.
- JENNIE.

138
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,333
I'll go and check.

139
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,100
- That startled me.
- Who is it?

140
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,400
- Could it be the security guard?
- Woo-il.

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,767
- Is it Woo-il?
- It must be.

142
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,300
- I forgot about him.
- Woo-il.

143
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,834
- Hello.
- Is it Woo-il?

144
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,834
Ma'am.

145
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,033
- What?
- Isn't it him?

146
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,900
I'm a resident representative.

147
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,600
Why are the residents of unit 504
still inside?

148
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,367
Today is cleaning day.

149
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:10,767
- Is it today?
- Yes.

150
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,066
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

151
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:15,000
Come on out with a broom and a bucket.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,367
- Okay.
- Okay.

153
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:19,633
- Gosh.
- Today is cleaning day.

154
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,734
They should clean up on another day.
Why does it have to be today?

155
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,667
That explains the cleaning supplies.

156
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:29,533
- Let's clean up.
- Buckets.

157
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:32,367
Hold on.
They are hosing down the hallway properly.

158
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:33,900
Hey, there are so many people.

159
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,633
- Really?
- We're sorry.

160
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,800
The neighbors are cleaning the apartment
to welcome spring.

161
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,900
Why won't the grime come off?

162
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,433
Scrub hard.

163
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,600
My back hurts.

164
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,600
This is killing my back.

165
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,400
Gosh, everyone is cleaning.

166
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,700
- When did they come out?
- Seriously.

167
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,433
There are so many people.

168
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,500
- What am I supposed to do?
- It's cramped here.

169
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,734
- There's no space.
- Seriously.

170
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,800
- Jung-ha, move.
- Am I doing it wrong?

171
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,467
- Move.
- Am I doing it wrong?

172
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:27,567
-"I'm moving."
- No.

173
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,500
"It isn't me."

174
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,700
That's Jung-ha's catchphrase. Move.

175
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,133
Your section is the dirtiest.

176
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,734
We cleaned our sections,
so you should clean yours.

177
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,100
- Okay.
- Okay.

178
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,400
- Why are they saying our section is dirty?
- Right.

179
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,100
Is there something wrong with our section?

180
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
- We've cleaned up a lot.
- Yes.

181
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,000
Cleaned up a lot, my foot.
It's still dirty.

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,467
Scrub hard so that it becomes clean.

183
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:50,934
Let's scrub hard.

184
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:52,133
Okay.

185
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,166
You're working hard on a cold day.

186
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,533
- Yes.
- Yes.

187
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,633
Have a cup of hot coffee.

188
00:09:58,633 --> 00:09:59,700
That sounds great.

189
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,633
Come. Come over here.

190
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:05,066
- Shall we do that? Let's do that.
- All right.

191
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,867
- Shall we do that?
- It was exhausting.

192
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:09,233
- Thank you.
- I love it.

193
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,800
- Isn't it nice?
- Yes.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,200
Ms. Resident Representative,
can we have some too?

195
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,166
Wait patiently, okay?

196
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:20,367
I just made one comment.

197
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:21,867
"Wait patiently, okay?"

198
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,767
- Is it coffee?
- Yes.

199
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,467
- We were craving coffee.
- That's right.

200
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:27,900
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

201
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm out of coffee.

202
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,367
- No way.
- Oh, no.

203
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,734
- Wait right here. I'll bring some more.
- Okay.

204
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:34,834
Okay.

205
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,700
How did she run out of coffee?

206
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,300
All right.

207
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,066
My goodness.

208
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:47,033
Woo-il.

209
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:49,100
- Woo-il, you came.
- Mr. Security Guard.

210
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,767
- I thought you weren't coming today.
- Hey.

211
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:54,300
- I thought you got fired.
- We were worried.

212
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,600
- I thought you went someplace else.
- Yes.

213
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,633
I almost had to retire, but I got lucky.

214
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,767
- Thank goodness.
- I can work some more.

215
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:03,433
- That's good to hear.
- Thank goodness.

216
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:05,600
Are there no problems with this apartment?

217
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,033
Today, there are no--

218
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,100
- What?
- What's going on?

219
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,667
- What's going on?
- What's the matter?

220
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,967
- What?
- What's going on?

221
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,233
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

222
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:19,900
- What?
- Ma'am, what's wrong?

223
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:23,667
- Ma'am.
- What happened?

224
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,066
- What's the matter?
- What?

225
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,433
What's going on?

226
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:27,567
My goodness.

227
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,467
- She's foaming at the mouth.
- Call 119.

228
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,133
- Gosh.
- Call 119.

229
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,800
- Oh, no.
- Are you okay?

230
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,633
Oh, no.

231
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:38,166
- What's wrong?
- What's going on?

232
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,433
The residents who collapsed
are now in critical condition.

233
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:42,867
Wake up.

234
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:45,834
A toxin was found
in the neighbors' bodies.

235
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,100
- Excuse me.
- Oh, no.

236
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:55,467
Mister, what should we do?

237
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:57,600
- Call 119.
- Call 119.

238
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,667
- Are you okay?
- Hurry up and do something.

239
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:02,266
Hold on. I'll go and call an ambulance.

240
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll go and call an ambulance.

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,767
- Did you call 119?
- Yes.

242
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,166
- Hurry up.
- He did.

243
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:11,367
- He did.
- I can't believe it.

244
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,033
- The ambulance is here.
- It actually came.

245
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,100
- It's here.
- Is it here?

246
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,667
Over here.

247
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,533
- Over here.
- Isn't that a police car?

248
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:26,266
Police officers came.

249
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:28,233
- Over here.
- Over here.

250
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:31,000
- They collapsed.
- How did this happen?

251
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,266
See? What's the matter?

252
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Why did you only bring one stretcher
when three people collapsed?

253
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,700
- They'll carry them on their backs.
- I see.

254
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,867
- They'll carry them on their backs.
- I think they rehearsed it.

255
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,667
- They have good teamwork.
- It was well organized.

256
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,233
They have good teamwork.

257
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:52,300
- Ma'am, wake up.
- How did this happen?

258
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,700
- How did this happen?
- He's the only one who didn't collapse.

259
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,400
- Are you the culprit?
- Mister.

260
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:03,834
We're the police.

261
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,867
- Hello.
- Hello.

262
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:09,700
- Who's the resident representative?
- Me. What is it?

263
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,100
The residents collapsed after drinking

264
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,934
the coffee you made.

265
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:15,600
- We received a report.
- A report?

266
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
I simply gave them coffee

267
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,467
since the weather was cold. Why?

268
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,533
Is there something wrong with my coffee?

269
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's talk further at the station.

270
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,967
- What are you talking about?
- Are you okay?

271
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:29,900
I don't like coffee,
so I didn't have any.

272
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,834
You should accompany us as a witness.

273
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,367
- Do I need to go too?
- Yes.

274
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,567
- You should go.
- You should go.

275
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,600
- You should go.
- Why do I need to go?

276
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,567
My goodness.

277
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,066
The truth will prevail.

278
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,633
I'll go with them,

279
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:50,000
- so wait in unit 504.
- Unit 504?

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,867
Where are you going? Why?

281
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,900
- I need to look into things.
- You have to pay me 500 won.

282
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,100
- Don't go.
- Share information.

283
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,367
- Sip a little bit.
- No.

284
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:58,433
I need to look into things.

285
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:00,967
- Get going.
- I need to look into things.

286
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:02,300
- Go inside.
- Okay.

287
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,800
Go inside unit 504.

288
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,533
- Go inside unit 504.
- What's happening?

289
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,467
I think we have a team competition today.

290
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,967
No suspecting each other.

291
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:11,100
This is evidence.

292
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,900
- You brought it?
- I brought it just in case.

293
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,433
It seems like regular coffee.

294
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,667
- She did run out. The container is empty.
- Yes.

295
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,600
- There's coffee, Na-ra.
- There's coffee.

296
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,767
- There's so much coffee.
- Try it.

297
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:26,900
- Try it.
- Na-ra made a mess again.

298
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,900
- There she goes again.
- Seriously.

299
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,800
- Hey, don't drink it.
- How does it taste?

300
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:35,767
What?

301
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:38,033
- Is it good?
- He's out.

302
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,600
- It's bitter.
- It's bitter.

303
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,667
I can't believe him.

304
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,867
It's funny that the incident happened
as soon as Woo-il arrived.

305
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,066
Mr. Incident.

306
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,734
Jung-ha said something
when the police officers came.

307
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,300
- What did he say?
-"The truth will prevail."

308
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,967
"The truth will prevail."

309
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:56,200
I like things like that.

310
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:00,734
Is it okay to just sit around like this?

311
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,600
The incident took place
in front of unit 505.

312
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,667
The resident representative
is the culprit.

313
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:08,367
- That man was suspicious too.
- That man.

314
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:11,867
I simply gave them coffee
since the weather was cold.

315
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,400
How did this happen?

316
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,133
You're working hard on a cold day.

317
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,700
- Shall we go and take a look?
- Shall we?

318
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,600
- Let's look around unit 505.
- Okay.

319
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:33,100
- All right. Let's unveil the truth.
- Okay.

320
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:43,000
This is the crime scene.

321
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,633
- This is it.
- This is it.

322
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:47,467
This is the place
we need to examine thoroughly.

323
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,467
Is this
the resident representative's place?

324
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:53,367
This place is big.

325
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:56,967
Jae-seok, this place exudes wealth.

326
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:02,300
It's a wealthy household.

327
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:04,133
It's a wealthy household.

328
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:08,433
The furniture is extravagant.

329
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,567
Luxury items.

330
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,266
Why is there so much water
in the resident representative's unit?

331
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,867
Gosh, there's so much water.

332
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,300
Why is there so much water?

333
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:24,533
This place is strange.

334
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:34,900
The furniture is extravagant.

335
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:40,233
-Back in 1991, bottled water...
- It wasn't common.

336
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,100
What are we supposed to look at?

337
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:53,900
I see that The General's Son 2
came out in 1991.

338
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,667
Was Seok-jin popular in 1991?

339
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:00,533
Na-ra, when Seok-jin debuted,

340
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:03,867
his album went up
against I Know by Seo Taiji and Boys.

341
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,200
He got annihilated.

342
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:13,533
VIDEO NOT FOUND
DUE TO A LACK OF POPULARITY

343
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,467
- His agency lacked producing skills.
- Yes.

344
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:19,133
On top of that, Seok-jin didn't have
the skills to be an entertainer.

345
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:22,567
All right.

346
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,200
- Only Wednesday...
- Right?

347
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,300
Wednesday.

348
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,166
I think we're missing the hidden clues.

349
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,633
What's this?

350
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,066
- There are a lot of cosmetics.
- Really?

351
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,567
Let's take a look.

352
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:58,633
- Are there a lot?
- Really?

353
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:04,433
Why are there so many cosmetics?

354
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,033
My goodness.

355
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,166
- What do they mean?
- Are those cosmetics?

356
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,667
What is it?

357
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,033
Hide it quickly.

358
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,000
Hide it quickly.

359
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,667
- I think it's nothing.
- Let's see.

360
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,266
It's a list of contacts.

361
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,734
She made a lot of money.

362
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,200
I think it's a clue.

363
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,767
- Se-chan, they're here too.
- What?

364
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,200
- What?
- We have these figurines at our place too.

365
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,700
- Look.
- Yes, the Mandarin ducks.

366
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,934
What do the Mandarin ducks represent?

367
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,033
Isn't it love?

368
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:08,867
If you position them like this,
it's a signal.

369
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:11,800
It's a signal for a romantic night.

370
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,100
- Really?
- Yes.

371
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,300
- If you're mad at your spouse...
- That's right.

372
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,133
My goodness.

373
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,834
- It's a signal.
- That sounds useful.

374
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:23,066
That's right.

375
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:25,367
You didn't know. It's a signal.

376
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,734
We don't know anything yet, right?

377
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:31,166
We don't know anything yet.

378
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,333
Jae-seok.

379
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,367
What's going on today?

380
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:36,533
- This...
- What?

381
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,133
Many things are suspicious.

382
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,467
- This...
- What?

383
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,266
-"Door-to-door sales".
-"Sunaroun"? What's this?

384
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,467
It's a flyer for door-to-door sales.

385
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,867
- Door-to-door sales.
- That's what the flyer says.

386
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:59,200
Door-to-door sales.

387
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,600
Hold on.

388
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,567
Doesn't this face look familiar?

389
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
- It's the resident representative.
- You're right.

390
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,367
- Right?
- I didn't realize.

391
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:17,433
That's right. She must be
a door-to-door salesperson.

392
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,567
Does she sell the products she models for?

393
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,000
- There's something about her.
- It seems that way.

394
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,367
Sunaroun.

395
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:27,900
There must be something about this.

396
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,000
Let's take it.

397
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,900
Hey.

398
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,266
Hey.

399
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,900
- The TV is turning on.
- Hey.

400
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,700
- The TV is turning on.
- Hey.

401
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,734
Come over here.

402
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,066
- Come over here.
- I'm having fun already.

403
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:48,667
- What is it?
- What is it?

404
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,233
What's going on?

405
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,000
What's going on?

406
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,133
- I remember this.
- I do too.

407
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,166
I remember this.

408
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:08,834
Once you get hooked on drugs,
it isn't easy to find a way out.

409
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,734
It's the bait of destruction.

410
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,700
- Drugs?
- A public campaign.

411
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,800
Another public campaign?

412
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,166
"I'll do anything for money.

413
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,166
There's nothing I can't do
to make ends meet."

414
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:26,467
An incident that was
the epitome of mammonism took place.

415
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:28,367
- ...took place.
- Mammonism.

416
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:32,333
In mid-August,
Mr. Hyun sent a letter to...

417
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,000
...and threatened to poison yogurt drinks
unless he got 250 million won.

418
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,300
Poison.

419
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,667
Since the fourth of last month,
he poisoned

420
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,533
- the yogurt drinks over nine times.
- Poison.

421
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,433
This actually happened, right?

422
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:48,166
- Such things happened back then.
- Yes.

423
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,233
Poison was injected with a needle.

424
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:52,800
Victims who drank
the poisoned yogurt drinks

425
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,100
fell into critical condition
before becoming stable.

426
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,266
A total of five people were harmed.

427
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,533
My goodness.

428
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:02,333
Mr. Kim, the site manager
of the Korea Water Resources Corporation,

429
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,500
regularly accepted bribes
from a construction company.

430
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,433
He got arrested by the prosecution.

431
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,333
Due to the thoughtless extravagance
of the middle class,

432
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,934
disharmony between classes is growing.

433
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,233
The middle class?

434
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:20,633
Despite the effort
to spur economic growth,

435
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:24,400
heinous crimes that were brought on
by mammonism and extravagance

436
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,700
are poisoning our society.

437
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,900
What?

438
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,133
Is it about drugs?

439
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,433
Is the incident related to poison?

440
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,867
I think bribery is involved too.

441
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,767
"I'll do anything for money."

442
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,300
...he poisoned the yogurt drinks...

443
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,333
Due to the thoughtless extravagance...

444
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,734
...disharmony between classes is growing.

445
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:47,367
They talked about luxury items.

446
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,300
Luxury items.

447
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,333
Bribes.

448
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:51,033
Luxury items.

449
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:54,200
Did the resident representative do it
for money?

450
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:01,166
What's the matter?

451
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,834
Don't accuse an innocent woman.

452
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,333
Should we check this?

453
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,500
Right? Is there something inside?

454
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:11,033
- The phone is ringing.
- The phone is ringing.

455
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:18,033
- Pick up the phone.
- Pick up the phone.

456
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,734
Hello?

457
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:26,533
This is Min-su's family.
Bring me three boxes right away.

458
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:27,433
What?

459
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,433
Hello?

460
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,066
- What?
- What?

461
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:34,900
- Did the caller hang up?
- Did they stay silent?

462
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:37,367
She said, "Bring me three boxes."

463
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,834
Is it this?

464
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:45,133
- This?
- Is it this?

465
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,767
- Three boxes?
- Three boxes.

466
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,600
- Maybe it's water.
- Three boxes of water.

467
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,233
You wouldn't describe water that way.
Three containers, maybe.

468
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,300
Drugs? Maybe this is a drug house.

469
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,934
Three boxes?

470
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,767
- You can't deliver three boxes of drugs.
- That'd be expensive.

471
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:59,734
- A drug house.
-"A drug house"?

472
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:01,233
All right.

473
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:08,333
The caller asked for three boxes
and hung up immediately.

474
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,800
-It has to be an illegal transaction.
- What kind of a box could it be?

475
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,834
Why was it said so secretly?

476
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:17,033
The caller wasn't high on drugs,
were they?

477
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:18,233
They didn't seem to be.

478
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:20,667
- Did she enunciate?
- The caller was a woman.

479
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,133
- Was she in a hurry?
- She sounded secretive.

480
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
What's the secret today?

481
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,567
So many things are suspicious.

482
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
What's illegal?

483
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Cosmetics? Water?

484
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,500
- Gosh.
- You startled me.

485
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,266
- You startled me.
- You startled me, Woo-il.

486
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:40,900
- Knock before entering someone's home.
- Mr. Security Guard.

487
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,500
I told you to wait at your place.

488
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,333
Why did you come
to the resident representative's unit?

489
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,200
Just in case.

490
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,433
The atmosphere is not good,
so go to your place.

491
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:53,467
- Shall we do that?
- Go to your place.

492
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,266
What could be the secret?

493
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:59,300
- Hurry up and come on out.
- Okay.

494
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,800
Come on out.

495
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,100
All right. Come on out.

496
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,367
It's inconvenient. Are there slippers?

497
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,333
- You shouldn't be here.
- Slippers.

498
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,467
- Slippers?
- Yes.

499
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,900
- Why are you looking for them here?
- Slippers.

500
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,567
- You can't take them.
- I was going to borrow them.

501
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:14,767
Go on in.

502
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:22,033
Gather around. It's time for a game.

503
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:23,333
That's good.

504
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,033
Let's go. It's party time.

505
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:27,867
- Let's play a game.
- Come on out.

506
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:30,567
- I'm ready to play a game.
- Gather around.

507
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:33,700
- Let's play a game.
- Let's play a game for a hint.

508
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,467
What could the secret be?

509
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,900
I don't have a clue today.

510
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:42,667
Did you make that, mister?
Where did you get that?

511
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,867
- All right. I'll explain.
- Okay.

512
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,266
- It's simple.
- Okay.

513
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,734
Roll the dice and find the rainbow items.

514
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:54,967
- The Ohs and the Yus.
- The Ohs and the Yus.

515
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:58,033
- The Ohs and the Yus.
- Na-ra and me.

516
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:00,433
- I'll roll the dice.
- You'll roll it.

517
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,734
Let's say I get blue.

518
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:08,233
Then all six members must bring an item
that is related to blue.

519
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,767
Put them on the table, and it's over.

520
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:11,767
- It's so easy.
- It's easy.

521
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:13,266
- All right.
- Okay.

522
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Watch out for Na-ra.

523
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,734
She's ready to fight everyone today.

524
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:19,900
- You'd better not defy me.
- She's a fighter today.

525
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,834
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

526
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,567
- We're ready.
- Don't get hurt.

527
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:25,200
- Speak for yourself.
- Okay.

528
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,133
The living room is too close,

529
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:29,133
- so the items must be from elsewhere.
- Okay.

530
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:30,400
Understood. Hurry up.

531
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

532
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
Once I roll the die, begin right away.

533
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:36,633
All right.

534
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:38,934
All right.

535
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,200
All right.

536
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:46,967
- Nieun? Giyeok?
- Giyeok. It's giyeok.

537
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:55,200
Giyeok. It's giyeok.

538
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,100
- Nieun? Giyeok?
- Giyeok. It's giyeok.

539
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,500
-Giyeok?
- An item that starts with giyeok.

540
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,934
-Giyeok.

541
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,000
LADLE

542
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,667
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

543
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,300
It's nothing.

544
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:15,767
- Giyeok?
- Giyeok. It's giyeok.

545
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,734
I can't use an item in the living room.

546
00:27:23,734 --> 00:27:26,834
Let me through! Hey!

547
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:28,367
I can't find an item.

548
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:35,166
Come on.

549
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:37,533
Ladle.

550
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:38,567
Ladle counts.

551
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:40,667
- Mirror.
- Mirror counts.

552
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:50,867
Hey, JENNIE. Why are you grabbing me?

553
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:52,400
Let go of me.

554
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,934
-"Gwibi."
- What?

555
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:58,100
- No, the brand is called Yanggwibi.
- Yanggwibi.

556
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,800
- Na-ra tried to cheat.
- Come on.

557
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,300
Get her.

558
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,734
What's up with JENNIE?

559
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:07,266
Stop JENNIE, Jung-ha.

560
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,300
I need to get through. Hey.

561
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,033
- No.
- Stop her.

562
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:17,066
- Jung-ha.
- What's going on?

563
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:19,600
- JENNIE, find an item.
- Get another item.

564
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,734
Potato. Sweet potato.

565
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,133
Sweet potato. She came out.
Jung-ha, hurry up.

566
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:39,066

00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:46,100
Kimchi counts.

571
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
We won.

572
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,200
Gloves.

573
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,867
Okay. Hold on. What's this?

574
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:59,100
- You use it when you're itchy.
- What is it?

575
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,567
- You use it when you're itchy. Giyeok.
- No, that doesn't work.

576
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:04,600
- You use it when you're itchy.
- What is it?

577
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,567
- You use it when you're itchy.
- No.

578
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:12,000
"Golon." "Golon."

579
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,266
"Golon."

580
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,333
- The brand name is Kolon.
-"Golon."

581
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:18,166
"Golon."

582
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,867
- The brand name is Kolon. No.
-"Golon."

583
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:22,166
- We can't air the brand name.
-"Golon" doesn't work.

584
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:23,133
- No.
- No?

585
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:25,967
Hey, bring the painted maple sap.

586
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:27,667
The painted maple sap.

587
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,734
- What items are there?
- I can't think of one.

588
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,467
That's right.

589
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:36,333
What, Jae-seok? What is it?

590
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:37,934
- What is it?
- Hold on.

591
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:40,500
- What is it?
- It doesn't work anyway.

592
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,734
Gyojasang.

593
00:29:41,734 --> 00:29:43,100
- Gyojasang.
- No.

594
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,667
Gyojasang.

595
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,433
- Gyojasang.
- Okay.

596
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:05,667
- Okay. It'll accept it since it's heavy.
- Okay.

597
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,266
- Gyojasang counts.
- Okay.

Okay.

- Okay. The Yus won.
- Gyojasang.

601
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:14,967
Aren't you being too lenient with them
because of JENNIE?

602
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:17,433
- He was witty.
- Witty?

603
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:20,700
He was witty when he called it gyojasang
instead of a table.

604
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,500
- Let's play another round.
- Shall we?

605
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,133
Let's go. We won the first round.
This is so much fun.

606
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:26,767
I'll win this time.

607
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:28,834
- Let's play another round.
- Okay.

608
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:32,266
- Stop doing that.
- Just once.

609
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,600
- He keeps hiding the items.
- Let's go.

610
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,600
- Jung-ha, come here.
- I don't have anything.

611
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,367
- Come here.
- I really don't.

612
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:40,967
You have it right here.

613
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:43,500
Where did you learn such a thing?
Well done.

614
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,033
Let's go.

615
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:50,066
- I'll hit people this time.
- Okay.

616
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:52,867
- I'll hit people.
- I thought you were flying.

617
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:53,867
Let's begin.

618
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:54,934
All right.

619
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:00,100
-Digeut.
- Find an item that starts with digeut.

620
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:03,734
-Digeut.
- Find an item that starts with digeut.

621
00:31:03,734 --> 00:31:04,734
Digeut.

622
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,400
- Digeut.
- Digeut.

623
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,300
- Let's go.
- Digeut.

624
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:12,834
Hold on.

625
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:15,367
We need to look for an item.

626
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:16,633
We need to look for it.

627
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:19,633
- It's me.
- Right.

628
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:22,767
Calendar.

629
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:25,333
Calendar. Okay, that counts.
Calendar counts.

630
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:27,800
Digeut.

631
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,867
All right.

632
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:31,533
HAIR DRYER

633
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:39,133
Let me pass through!

634
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,000
Hey.

635
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,667
- No.
- Hey.

636
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,834

637
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:49,033
- Hey, JENNIE.
- JENNIE, hurry up and go.

638
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,500
Hey, JENNIE.

639
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:53,567
JENNIE.

640
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:54,667
Hey.

641
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,333
JENNIE. Hey.

642
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,667
She kicked my side.

643
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,734
JENNIE kicked my side.

644
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:02,633
Hurry up and find it. Okay.

645
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,000
- Hair dryer.
- Hair dryer counts.

646
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:09,967
Me. I'm a lunatic.

647
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:12,433
Lunatic starts with ssang digeut.
It doesn't count.

648
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,066
Lunatic doesn't work.

649
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,900
Come here. Let's mark Jae-seok.

650
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,100
What items are there? Digeut.

651
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,800
DON** JEONGWA

652
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,133
Do you want to go out?

653
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:32,467
- Se-chan, he's your responsibility.
- What's this?

654
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:35,700
Se-chan, he's your responsibility.

655
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,367
- Give it to me.
- No.

656
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:38,900
No. Hey, stop him.

657
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,467
- It's Don** Jeongwa.
- Hey.

658
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:43,100
Don** Jeongwa.

659
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,900
Only Jae-seok remains.

660
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,333
Stop him. Na-ra, stop him.

661
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:50,333
- Stop him. Na-ra, come here.
- Let's stop him.

662
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,934
JENNIE kicked my side.

663
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:53,600
- Na-ra, come here.
- Let's stop him.

664
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,633
JENNIE kicked my side.

665
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,200
- Don** Jeongwa.
- Okay. Don** Jeongwa counts.

666
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,533
It's okay. It's over.

667
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:07,900
- It counts.
- Don** Jeongwa.

668
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,333
You got kicked by JENNIE many times.

669
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:13,100
- JENNIE kicked my side.
- Me?

670
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,900
Me? When did I do that?

671
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,967
She went, "When did I do that?"

672
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:21,100
-"Me?"
- She kicked my side.

673
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,567
JENNIE was good at the game.

674
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:26,667
- She kicked my side.
- It was so much fun.

675
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,567
She punched the side.

676
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,967
- The last round.
- Come here.

677
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:36,734
- Let's go.
- Make it circle around.

678
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:42,033
- Green.
- Let's go.

679
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,700

681
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:56,400
- Hurry up and go.

682
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,600
- Go.
- Green.

683
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,500
It counts. Yellow green doesn't count.

684
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,700
- Why?
- It's yellow green.

685
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,367
- It's yellow green.
- For goodness' sake. It's green.

686
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:07,834
This green item counts.

687
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:09,333
This green item counts.

688
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,000
- Green.
- It's yellow green.

689
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Stop saying it's yellow green.

690
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:15,300
All right.

691
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:18,734
- Workbook.
- It's yellow green.

692
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:21,800
- Why do you keep saying that?
- I'm serious.

693
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,066
Compared to other items,
it's yellow green.

694
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,367
Green.

695
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,467
- Green.
- Well...

696
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:34,500
- Okay, this item counts.
- Green. Okay.

697
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,300
- Green.
- It's yellow green.

698
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,633
- It's green.
- It's yellow green.

699
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:39,233
- Okay, it counts.
- Green.

700
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,834
- Okay.
- Okay, it counts.

701
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:43,934
JENNIE, come here.

702
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:46,667
I'm stuck here.

703
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:50,300
- Where?
- Where?

704
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,233
- Green.
- It isn't green.

705
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:53,200
- It won't do.
- No?

706
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,233
There are no items.

707
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,633
- There are no green items.
- Se-chan.

708
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:59,066
Se-chan.

709
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:01,367
Okay. It's a green item.

710
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:03,500
- Green.
- It's green, right?

711
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,066
- Okay, it counts.
- Okay. All done.

712
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,667
- We won.
- Okay.

713
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:07,900
- All done?
- We won.

714
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,934
Okay.

715
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:10,300
The Ohs won.

716
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,433
- The Ohs won.
- The Ohs.

717
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:12,533
Who hasn't gone?

718
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:14,233
- We were done.
- Who hasn't gone?

719
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:16,066
- We were done.
- We were done.

720
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:17,233
- We were done.
- Why...

721
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:19,000
- Why did you...
- For fun.

722
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,033
What?

723
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:22,700
Did they toy with us?

724
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,266
When did you guys finish? Is it true?

725
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:30,700
- Green.
- It counts. Yellow green doesn't count.

726
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,900
- It's green.
- Okay, it counts.

727
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,934
- It counts.
- Okay.

728
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:35,033
- Okay, it counts.
- Okay.

729
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,000
- The Yus won.
- We won.

730
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,900
Okay.

731
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:41,467
- The Yus won.
- We won all three rounds.

732
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:43,300
- Let's go, Yus.
- Let's go.

733
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,500
It's hard to bear.
How much longer do I have to wait?

734
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,166
I'll die at this rate.

735
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:51,934
Hurry up and bring me three boxes, okay?

736
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:53,667
I feel like I'm dying.

737
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:55,967
Please bring one box. Hurry up.

738
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,133
I'll die at this rate.

739
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,467
- Since we won, there'll be a hint.
- We'll get something.

740
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:12,033
- We'll get it with the food.
- Yes.

741
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:13,967
I bet it's coming.

742
00:36:14,734 --> 00:36:15,934
Why are you looking at that?

743
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:17,734
I'm looking for clues.

744
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,567
This is...

745
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:25,700
Come to think of it,
I've teamed up with the sneakiest members

746
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,767
of Apartment404.

747
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,667
- JENNIE is--
- She's sneaky.

748
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,233
- Me?
- She's no joke.

749
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,867
She's becoming sneakier.

750
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:37,000
- She's very sneaky.
- My goodness.

751
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,633
She's very sneaky.

752
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:40,000
No, I'm not.

753
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Se-chan acts sneaky,
but he gets fooled in the end.

754
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,333
The new sneaky one.

755
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,567
- She's a sneaky one.
- I watch and learn.

756
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:48,467
I learned a lot from Se-chan.

757
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,834
- Se-chan, today...
- Yes?

758
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,467
- Are my eyes playing tricks on me?
- Why?

759
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:53,767
You look handsome.

760
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:55,433
- I know. I was so surprised.
- Really?

761
00:36:55,433 --> 00:36:57,133
- Yes, you look cool.
- Seriously.

762
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:00,100
- Really? In 1991...
- Yes.

763
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,433
You became cooler after joining Antenna.

764
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:04,834
- It's the Antenna magic.
- I guess so.

765
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:08,900
In my opinion, today's case is
about a married couple's scam.

766
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,133
- Hurry over here.
- Why?

767
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:11,734
He's making wild guesses again.

768
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,800
- Look.
- What?

769
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,000
- The Mandarin ducks.
- Is everything in pairs?

770
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,633
- This too.
- A married couple's scam.

771
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:21,934
The other unit was the same.

772
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:23,300
That's a pair too.

773
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,300
You're right. They're in pairs.

774
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,266
There are two fish too.

775
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:29,667
There are three.

776
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:34,367
There are three.

777
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:36,166
- One is an outcast.
- An outcast?

778
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,800
- Is it a baby?
- Maybe not.

779
00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:40,233
- Maybe not.
- Let's look over there.

780
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,567
- Everything is in pairs.
- Maybe not.

781
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,934
But it's hard to trust your deductions.

782
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,734
Here's what I think.
The resident representative got arrested.

783
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:57,300
Maybe she poisoned the coffee
with that man.

784
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,166
- That man?
- Maybe not.

785
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:02,200
Either the man
or the resident representative did it.

786
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,133
He didn't drink it since he knew.

787
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:06,967
And in my opinion--
Gosh, I finally figured it out.

788
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,767
- What?
- Here we go. It's Jung-ha's time.

789
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:15,400
The resident representative was running
an illegal business in secret.

790
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,233
One of the neighbors knew about it,
so she devised a plan to get rid of her.

791
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,734
What do you think?

792
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:22,333
- Well...
- Not bad.

793
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,367
Anyone can make such deductions.

794
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:25,900
Right?

795
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,867
- But--
- So the one who didn't drink

796
00:38:27,867 --> 00:38:29,433
- is an accomplice.
- That's right.

797
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:32,700
- Well--
- Na-ra, tell me honestly.

798
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,667
Is there a member among us
who knows what's happening?

799
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:37,867
- It isn't me.
- Among us?

800
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:38,900
- Among us.
- No.

801
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,100
- No.
- Right?

802
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,967
In that case, I'm certain
that the culprit is on the other team.

803
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:46,200
I think it's JENNIE.

804
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,967
- JENNIE?
- She's different today.

805
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:49,300
She hit me a lot today.

806
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,233
She's energetic today.

807
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:53,100
- She beat me up.
- Did she beat you up?

808
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,734
Yes. She kicked my side three times.

809
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,734
- Hello.
- My goodness.

810
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:01,800
- All right.
- It's from a good restaurant.

811
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,433
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

812
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:04,734
What is it?

813
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:06,900
- It's suyuk.
- Suyuk?

814
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:12,633
What is it? Gosh, it looks tasty.

815
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:15,533
How did you know
that I liked these dishes?

816
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,734
The food is from a popular restaurant.
It's very tasty.

817
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:21,000
Try it.

818
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:28,800
- It looks so tasty.
- It looks so tasty.

819
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,700
- It's a proper meal.
- Chopsticks.

820
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,233
I brought them.

821
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:35,700
- What?
- There's something, right?

822
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,233
- It's a tape.
- Let's watch it.

823
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:41,433
Did we receive the clue?

824
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:44,600
"Unit 505, star"?

825
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,000
It's the neighboring unit.

826
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,533
I guess it's a hint on unit 505.
We need to go and find it.

827
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:51,734
I guess we need to go to unit 505.

828
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,300
It's kalguksu.

829
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,100
- Cook it yourself.
- Okay.

830
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,967
There's everything, so cook it yourself.

831
00:39:57,967 --> 00:39:59,767
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the food.

832
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,066
What?

833
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:07,767
Unit 505. It's this unit. It's our house.

834
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,567
- What could be in here?
- Let's see.

835
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:16,834
Last time, we could open the tub.

836
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:17,867
Is that it?

837
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:20,400
All right.

838
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,266
- What could it be?
- Hold on. In this room...

839
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,800
My mom once said this to me.

840
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,433
This seasoning packet...

841
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:43,600
You have to add the entire contents
of the packet

842
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,467
to bring out the taste of ramyeon.

843
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,367
Am I the only one who thinks that?

844
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,400
All right. I need to add
the seasoning first

845
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,033
so that it melts in the water
and makes the soup.

846
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:01,600
I'll wait until it boils.

847
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,734
Now,

848
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:06,367
I'll go and blow my nose.

849
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,500
See you in a bit.

850
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,133
I'll go and blow my nose.

851
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:11,900
See you in a bit.

852
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:22,967
The overall flow is related to a star.

853
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:26,400
I need to find the excerpt and solve it.

854
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,734
"Wear glasses, play the janggu"...

855
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,667
How is it related?

856
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:47,300
Firstly-- I need to check the soup.

857
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:52,633
I need to check the soup.
It isn't boiling yet.

858
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,700
I need to find a star. A star.

859
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:58,166
Where are the stars?

860
00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:01,400
Stars.

861
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:06,667
Stars. Wait, I saw a star earlier.

862
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:08,800
Where was it?

863
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:14,700
Oh, it's here.

864
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:25,066
SLICE AND IT WILL STICK AGAIN

865
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:34,967
WEAR GLASSES, PLAY THE JANGGU,
HAVE FUN, EAT MEAT, EAT DUMPLINGS

866
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:37,166
SLICE AND IT WILL STICK AGAIN

867
00:42:37,734 --> 00:42:38,967
Play the video.

868
00:42:38,967 --> 00:42:40,200
- Let's watch it.
- Let's watch it.

869
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,400
- He really doesn't listen.
- We have aired

870
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,633
the video and music for screen adjustment.

871
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:50,500
- Such things actually aired.
- Now...

872
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,967
- On TV?
- ...KVN News will begin.

873
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:01,000
...began to be manufactured in Korea

874
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,100
to be sold to foreigners in Korea
or exported back in 1975.

875
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,667
Sales to Korean nationals
were never permitted.

876
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:09,834
But in most apartment complexes...

877
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:13,000
...gets delivered diligently.

878
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,133
It's illegal sales.

879
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:17,633
- What? Earlier...
- I know.

880
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:21,367
How many households use it
in this apartment complex?

881
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:22,800
About 40 households.

882
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,900
Customers need it,

883
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,000
- but it's too expensive.
- Is it illegal?

884
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,567
The illegal distribution of...

885
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,967
...among the citizens
is becoming widespread,

886
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:33,033
but the government is turning a blind eye.

887
00:43:33,033 --> 00:43:36,633
A harsh criticism of disharmony
between the citizens followed.

888
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:39,767
Since the illegal dealings led
to such problems,

889
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:43,367
the Minister of Health and Social Affairs
prosecuted or closed down

890
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:46,367
48 businesses without a permit.

891
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:47,533
PERMIT REVOKED

892
00:43:57,533 --> 00:43:58,533
Hey.

893
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,900
Hey.

894
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:08,300
Like I said, it wasn't widespread in 1991.

895
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,400
Hey.

896
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,400
It's ***.

897
00:44:15,133 --> 00:44:18,300
WHAT: UNIT 505, STAR

898
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,700
It reads, "Slice and it will stick again."

899
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,300
I think it's a hint.

900
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,800
"Slice and it will stick again."

901
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,767
What is it?

902
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:29,633
What is it?

903
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,033
SLICE AND IT WILL STICK AGAIN

904
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:33,800
Na-ra, then this is a hint too.

905
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,700
-"It will stick again."
- This is a hint too.

906
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,100
EXCHANGES CAN BE MADE TWO TIMES
IN FRONT OF THE STAR,

907
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,333
BUT NOT BEHIND IT

908
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:43,333
"Exchanges can be made two times
in front of the star,

909
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,800
but not behind it."

910
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,066
There were scribbles.

911
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:57,166
The stars are hints.

912
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:58,433
We need to find the stars.

913
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:06,433
"The house explodes, the dog claps"?

914
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:19,633
THE HOUSE EXPLODES,
THE DOG CLAPS

915
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:24,567
EXCHANGES CAN BE MADE TWO TIMES
IN FRONT OF THE STAR,

916
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:26,000
BUT NOT BEHIND IT

917
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:30,166
I figured it out.

918
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:31,467
It means an exchange of goods.

919
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,233
I figured out what the star meant.

920
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,233
- Slicing water with a knife.
- You're smart.

921
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:44,934
This is incredible.

922
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,166
GLASSES, MEAT

923
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,633
DUMPLINGS, JANGGU

924
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:56,367
FUN

925
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:57,633
WATER

926
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:59,033
That's it. It's water.

927
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:01,233
Na-ra, it's water. As you said...

928
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:03,934
Cleaning and coffee.
It's related to water.

929
00:46:15,233 --> 00:46:16,166
Hey.

930
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,533
It's bottled water.

931
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:20,433
- Bottled water?
- Bottled water.

932
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:23,033
- Bottled water was precious back then.
- Bottled water.

933
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:26,000
People bought it in secret back then.

934
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,033
Was bottled water a luxury item?

935
00:46:29,033 --> 00:46:31,800
The news talked about disharmony
between classes.

936
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:34,400
- Bottled water was like that.
- In 1991?

937
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,900
Think about how things were back in 1991.

938
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,166
Back in 1991?

939
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:42,333
Protecting water is akin
to protecting our lives.

940
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:45,433
There is a mineral spring
that is busy all day long.

941
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,367
INTEREST IN CLEAN WATER GROWS

942
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,333
WHAT KIND OF WATER IS GOOD
FOR THE BODY?

943
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:57,300
At a mineral spring by City Hall,

944
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,000
people who drove from Seoul
during the day in order to get water

945
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,066
are lined up with containers.

946
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:06,033
They say mineral water is good for you,

947
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:09,734
so I'm bringing some home.

948
00:47:09,734 --> 00:47:13,367
You need to be determined
to drink clean water.

949
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,533
The Supreme Court will soon decide

950
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:23,100
whether it's lawful to sell water.

951
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,834
In 1976, bottled water

952
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:26,667
was first sold to American soldiers
in Korea.

953
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:30,066
After the 1986 Asian Games
and the 1988 Olympics,

954
00:47:30,066 --> 00:47:32,400
the demand for bottled water
skyrocketed.

955
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,567
Everyone drinks it.
Many people in my apartment do.

956
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:37,166
When I began drinking bottled water,

957
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:40,266
I realized that it was good.
My family likes it too.

958
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:42,300
Although it was illegal
to sell bottled water,

959
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,667
no actions were taken.

960
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:46,734
As a result, there are
14 official bottled water companies

961
00:47:46,734 --> 00:47:49,333
and over 200 companies without a permit
in Korea.

962
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,900
...but it's too expensive.

963
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,834
It isn't gas. I don't understand
why it's so expensive.

964
00:47:54,834 --> 00:47:56,300
WATER IS PRICIER THAN GAS

965
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,100
The illegal distribution of bottled water
among the citizens is becoming widespread,

966
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,133
but the government is turning a blind eye.

967
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:05,834
The officials are only having
an armchair argument regarding the matter.

968
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:11,700
In the '70s,
it was only sold to foreigners.

969
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,300
It's illegal distribution. That's
the resident representative's secret.

970
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,033
- Illegal distribution of bottled water?
- Was it a luxury item?

971
00:48:18,033 --> 00:48:20,000
Back then, people drank boiled water.

972
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,433
They didn't buy water.

973
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,800
You're working hard on a cold day.

974
00:48:26,467 --> 00:48:27,700
What's this?

975
00:48:30,834 --> 00:48:34,033
It's unusual to have
so much bottled water at home.

976
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:38,633
Let's say bottled water is a luxury item.

977
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:40,233
And she distributed it illegally.

978
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:42,600
- I know. What...
- What about it?

979
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:45,300
What about it?

980
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:48,567
Seriously.

981
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:49,967
- I know.
- Seriously.

982
00:48:49,967 --> 00:48:52,834
What do we have to do
with the illegal sales of bottled water?

983
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,066
- Please let go of your anger.
- Okay.

984
00:48:56,066 --> 00:49:00,233
Why did the residents pass away
after drinking coffee?

985
00:49:00,233 --> 00:49:01,500
Well, they didn't pass away.

986
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,300
They were hospitalized.

987
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:06,166
It's based on a true event.

988
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:10,233
If it's a true event,
why did someone poison the drink?

989
00:49:10,233 --> 00:49:11,967
Was it done on purpose or not?

990
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:15,400
I'll visit the other unit.

991
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:16,934
Okay.

992
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,767
You guys aren't scheming anything,
are you?

993
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:22,867
I'm not sure we have the skills
to do that.

994
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,400
JENNIE, we don't have time to sit around.

995
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,200
- Here's what I think.
- Okay.

996
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,633
- We can enjoy lunch...
- Yes.

997
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:42,066
...and take our time with the deductions.

998
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:45,367
Why are you saying that so suddenly?

999
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:46,667
You're acting strange.

1000
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,834
What's up with you? Do you have a mission?

1001
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:53,467
I just don't think we'll get
anything other than water at this point.

1002
00:49:53,467 --> 00:49:56,166
Is there something you know?

1003
00:49:57,467 --> 00:50:00,633
Let's go to unit 505
and figure out the clues.

1004
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:01,533
Okay.

1005
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,633
I'll follow you in a bit.

1006
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:08,300
This food is delicious.

1007
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,934
You said earlier that you were done.

1008
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:12,200
It's really tasty.

1009
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,233
By behaving that way,
you're making yourself look like a spy.

1010
00:50:16,233 --> 00:50:18,433
- I'm not a spy.
- Why do you want to stay behind?

1011
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:19,900
There's a piece of kimchi left,

1012
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,767
- so I'm going to eat it.
- What's up with her?

1013
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:24,834
She totally seems like...

1014
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:28,166
I'm going out even though I know
that you're suspicious,

1015
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:29,300
- JENNIE.
- Okay.

1016
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,467
I'm fully aware that you're a spy.

1017
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:34,500
- Come soon. Are you not coming?
- Okay.

1018
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,133
No, I'll go.

1019
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:40,333
JENNIE is... What's up with her?

1020
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,600
It's tasty.

1021
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,166
I have it.

1022
00:51:01,166 --> 00:51:02,533
- Enjoy the food.
- All right.

1023
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:06,066
Na-ra, there's meat.

1024
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,934
I wish I had dried seaweed.
It's tasty with it.

1025
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,433
Are you enjoying the food?

1026
00:51:10,433 --> 00:51:12,000
- Yes.
- We just started eating.

1027
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,500
- We just had a bite.
- I see.

1028
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,767
- There's nothing.
- Did you find anything?

1029
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:18,300
- No.
- All right.

1030
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,300
We just started eating.

1031
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,934
I have information to share.

1032
00:51:23,934 --> 00:51:25,066
Really?

1033
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:27,333
- It's important.
- What is it?

1034
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:29,233
- JENNIE is...
- Okay.

1035
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:30,967
- ...a spy.
- Right?

1036
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:32,734
We knew it.

1037
00:51:32,734 --> 00:51:35,367
When I suggested coming to this unit
to find the clues,

1038
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:39,200
she said she'd enjoy the food first
since she knew everything.

1039
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,300
Where is she?

1040
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,433
She's in the unit alone.

1041
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:43,633
She insisted on eating alone.

1042
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:46,200
- I think she knows something.
- She knows something.

1043
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,834
- We did suspect her earlier.
- We did.

1044
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:50,767
JENNIE is incredibly active today.

1045
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:52,467
I'll go and check up on her.

1046
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:53,767
Yes, check up on her.

1047
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:56,200
I'll do that.
She might be up to something.

1048
00:52:01,533 --> 00:52:05,133
- In my opinion, Jae-seok is the spy today.
- Why?

1049
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:07,734
Jae-seok hasn't played the role yet.

1050
00:52:07,734 --> 00:52:09,834
- We did suspect him earlier.
- It isn't you.

1051
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:11,900
- It isn't me.
- It isn't you.

1052
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,967
We did suspect Jae-seok earlier.

1053
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:17,367
That's why I'm leaving
the two of them alone.

1054
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,367
- I want to see what they'll do.
- Really?

1055
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:23,600
- Where are you going?
- I want to visit.

1056
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:28,266
Jung-ha, believe in your teammates.

1057
00:52:28,266 --> 00:52:30,567
Believe in me and Na-ra.

1058
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:31,533
Okay.

1059
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,133
- JENNIE.
- Yes?

1060
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:44,567
You're under suspicion.

1061
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:45,567
Me?

1062
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:47,867
For what? I didn't do anything suspicious.

1063
00:52:47,867 --> 00:52:49,467
You didn't do anything suspicious?

1064
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,400
- It's true.
- JENNIE.

1065
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,900
What do you know?

1066
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,700
Nothing. I know nothing.

1067
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,567
- You know something.
- No, I don't.

1068
00:52:58,567 --> 00:52:59,667
Hurry up and spill.

1069
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:02,133
- Na-ra.
- Yes?

1070
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:03,567
You're going a bit overboard.

1071
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:05,767
It has been a while,

1072
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:07,700
- so I'm motivated.
- She's excited.

1073
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,066
We've all pretty much figured it out.

1074
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:10,600
- We have.
- Water.

1075
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,700
- We know it's about water.
- It's water.

1076
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,467
What does it have to do with poison?

1077
00:53:17,633 --> 00:53:19,100
What's going on?

1078
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,500
- What's going on?
- What's the matter?

1079
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,200
Is there something wrong with my coffee?

1080
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:29,266
The resident representative was running
an illegal business in secret.

1081
00:53:29,266 --> 00:53:31,066
One of the neighbors knew about it...

1082
00:53:31,066 --> 00:53:33,000
They talked about disharmony.

1083
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,500
Did someone who couldn't get water get mad
and poison the drink?

1084
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,767
What happened to the three boxes?

1085
00:53:39,767 --> 00:53:43,500
Seriously. Someone might be moving
those three boxes.

1086
00:53:47,066 --> 00:53:49,000
What? Who is it?

1087
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,000
Who is it?

1088
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,767
- Hello.
- Detective.

1089
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,166
Hold on.

1090
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,734
Detective.

1091
00:54:00,734 --> 00:54:04,166
We're the police.
Who's the resident representative?

1092
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:05,300
- Detective?
- Hold on.

1093
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:08,100
I thought you might be curious,
so I came to share what we found out.

1094
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

1095
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,600
The resident representative
has been cleared of the charge.

1096
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,367
- What?
- She's not connected to the incident?

1097
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:18,400
The resident representative
simply poured the coffee this morning.

1098
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,934
- Yes.
- She wasn't the one who made the coffee.

1099
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:31,834
- I see.
- We looked into the matter

1100
00:54:31,834 --> 00:54:35,533
and found that there was nothing wrong
with the items she sold.

1101
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,700
- What?
- Nothing wrong?

1102
00:54:45,066 --> 00:54:46,300
COFFEE - POSITIVE

1103
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,600
UNIT 505 WATER - NEGATIVE

1104
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:52,667
- She isn't the culprit.
- Then who is?

1105
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:54,300
- Who's the culprit?
- Who?

1106
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,934
We need to investigate further.

1107
00:54:55,934 --> 00:54:57,033
- Okay.
- Okay.

1108
00:54:57,033 --> 00:54:59,033
But what's important is this.

1109
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:02,400
- On the collapsed residents' bodies...
- Yes, the three residents.

1110
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,300
...there were unusual blue rashes.

1111
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,967
We believe that they've been poisoned.

1112
00:55:09,533 --> 00:55:12,200
...there were unusual blue rashes.

1113
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,834
- We've switched to an open investigation.
- Okay.

1114
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:29,400
If you happen to find the culprit...

1115
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,900
- One of us is the culprit.
- By 5 p.m...

1116
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,266
You'll see a police car
in front of the apartment.

1117
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:38,700
By 5 p.m...

1118
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:42,900
...put the culprit's belongings

1119
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,000
inside the police car
in front of apartment 108.

1120
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:50,834
The culprit's belongings?

1121
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:52,333
Where is everyone?

1122
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:53,600
Why? Where is everyone?

1123
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,900
-I'm looking.
- The eighth floor?

1124
00:55:58,433 --> 00:56:00,767
Then we'll apprehend the culprit.

1125
00:56:03,133 --> 00:56:05,233
If you put the culprit's belongings...

1126
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:12,800
Okay.

1127
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:17,233
Okay. The culprit's belongings. I got it.

1128
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:18,967
- Okay.
- My goodness.

1129
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,133
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1130
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:26,233
Salute.

1131
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:27,834
- Salute.
- Salute.

1132
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:29,100
- Salute.
- Unity.

1133
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,533
All right.

1134
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:33,834
So the resident representative
has been cleared.

1135
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:40,066
The residents collapsed upon drinking
the coffee you made.

1136
00:56:40,066 --> 00:56:41,266
We received a report.

1137
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,767
We believe that they've been poisoned.

1138
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:50,700
That means one of us might be the culprit.

1139
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,066
Among us...

1140
00:56:53,066 --> 00:56:56,033
- Listen. There might be more than one.
- Yes.

1141
00:56:56,033 --> 00:56:57,800
- No way.
- There might be two.

1142
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,033
It's one of us.

1143
00:56:59,033 --> 00:57:03,800
No way. It's about time
Jae-seok played the role.

1144
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,367
- Hey, it isn't me.
- Jae-seok.

1145
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:08,233
- It's about time you played the role.
- It really is.

1146
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:10,900
Those glasses are
Jae-seok's only belongings.

1147
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,033
We can't take them off
because he'll be too ugly.

1148
00:57:13,033 --> 00:57:14,800
He'll be too ugly.

1149
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,467
I'm curious about something.
In the video...

1150
00:57:19,467 --> 00:57:23,266
Na-ra, when did you take
JENNIE's cute item?

1151
00:57:23,266 --> 00:57:25,367
You're ruining it.

1152
00:57:25,367 --> 00:57:26,567
I'm ruining it?

1153
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:29,734
- Aren't you a character from a fairy tale?
- What?

1154
00:57:29,734 --> 00:57:31,934
- The wolf.
- The wolf?

1155
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:33,734
It's fitting.

1156
00:57:33,734 --> 00:57:36,367
The wolf in Little Red Riding Hood.

1157
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:42,066
What kind of poison is it?

1158
00:57:42,066 --> 00:57:43,300
What exactly is it?

1159
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,967
We don't know that.

1160
00:57:44,967 --> 00:57:47,166
- It resulted in a blue rash.
- Toxins.

1161
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:49,200
- Copper sulfate.
- Copper sulfate?

1162
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,533
- Copper sulfate?
- What?

1163
00:57:51,533 --> 00:57:53,934
Who is it?

1164
00:57:55,233 --> 00:57:56,500
- It's coming from the room.
- From the room.

1165
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,700
- What?
- It's a different sound.

1166
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,934
What is that sound?

1167
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:01,533
Is it...

1168
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:05,200
I'm scared.

1169
00:58:05,834 --> 00:58:07,700
The sound is coming from the room.

1170
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,166
It sounds like construction.

1171
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,333
- Such sounds are so scary.
- That startled me.

1172
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:15,934
- What's that sound?
- I don't know.

1173
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,000
- A banging sound.
- What's this?

1174
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,333
- What?
- What's this?

1175
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:21,266
See.

1176
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:24,033
- Don't do it.
- Don't do it.

1177
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,166
- I can't believe you.
- Hey, JENNIE.

1178
00:58:26,166 --> 00:58:29,200
I wanted to check
in case there was something.

1179
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,367
Why did sounds come from this room?

1180
00:58:32,266 --> 00:58:33,734
What?

1181
00:58:33,734 --> 00:58:35,400
Stop it. I'm really scared.

1182
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,467
What?

1183
00:58:37,734 --> 00:58:40,233
What? Stop it. I'm really scared.

1184
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:41,467
Stop it.

1185
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:44,133
- Stop it.
- What's going on?

1186
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,367
- Blue light. What?
- What's this?

1187
00:58:47,367 --> 00:58:49,700
- What's this on your clothes?
- What?

1188
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,367
- There's something.
- What's up with me?

1189
00:58:51,367 --> 00:58:53,000
- What?
- What's up with you?

1190
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,467
Someone has been going around
smearing this on the members.

1191
00:58:55,467 --> 00:58:57,266
- What's this?
- What's this?

1192
00:58:57,266 --> 00:58:59,567
- Do I have it?
- You have it. You too.

1193
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:03,500
On the collapsed residents' bodies,
there were unusual blue rashes.

1194
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,133
- You have it.
- I do?

1195
00:59:05,133 --> 00:59:06,834
- It's on your neck.
- You have it.

1196
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,400
You have it. It's no joke.

1197
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,433
- You have a lot.
- I have it.

1198
00:59:09,433 --> 00:59:11,467
- I have it.
- I have it.

1199
00:59:11,467 --> 00:59:13,066
Mine is dark. What is it?

1200
00:59:13,066 --> 00:59:14,734
Do I have it? I have it here.

1201
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,033
- Na-ra.
- What?

1202
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:18,533
Why is your face clear?

1203
00:59:18,533 --> 00:59:20,200
I have it on my body.

1204
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,767
- She has a lot.
- She has it.

1205
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,300
- Only JENNIE doesn't have it.
- Jung-ha is the same.

1206
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,867
- Jung-ha is the same.
- He has it.

1207
00:59:25,867 --> 00:59:27,233
- He has it.
- He has it.

1208
00:59:27,233 --> 00:59:28,800
- It's JENNIE.
- No.

1209
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,367
- JENNIE is the culprit.
- It's JENNIE.

1210
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,100
She has it.

1211
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,900
- It's invisible since my top is white.
- No, she has it.

1212
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,133
- JENNIE has it.
- She has it.

1213
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:39,533
She has it.

1214
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,400
Hold on, Jae-seok. One of them put it

1215
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,400
on their own face.

1216
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,900
The culprit put it on their body.

1217
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,166
- Is it you?
- It isn't me.

1218
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:53,867
- It looks awkward.
- It isn't me.

1219
00:59:53,867 --> 00:59:55,900
- Yours does look excessive.
- Whose?

1220
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,667
It looks like you put it on yourself.

1221
00:59:57,667 --> 00:59:59,800
- You should've known.
- No.

1222
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,700
- Do you have it on your face?
- JENNIE, that's excessive too.

1223
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,633
- But...
- These are blue rashes.

1224
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:09,467
These are blue rashes.

1225
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:11,367
- Right.
- These are blue rashes.

1226
01:00:11,367 --> 01:00:13,100
The detective talked about them.

1227
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,700
On the collapsed residents' bodies,

1228
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,567
there were unusual blue rashes.

1229
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:19,467
Poison.

1230
01:00:19,467 --> 01:00:21,800
Was there something we ate together?

1231
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:25,734
- You had soup, right?
- Yes.

1232
01:00:25,734 --> 01:00:27,734
We had the kalguksu soup.

1233
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:42,734
- We were all poisoned.
- Did you eat it?

1234
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,100
This is an announcement for the residents.

1235
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,233
Due to a problem with the generator,

1236
01:00:51,233 --> 01:00:55,433
the electricity got cut off,
and we had a momentary power outage.

1237
01:00:55,433 --> 01:00:58,934
The problem has been fixed,

1238
01:00:58,934 --> 01:01:00,700
so please be understanding.

1239
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,500
When was it smeared?

1240
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,867
- Did we get a rash due to poison?
- Yes.

1241
01:01:05,867 --> 01:01:07,667
We've already been poisoned.

1242
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,166
We got poisoned.

1243
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,700
Didn't we eat kalguksu together?

1244
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,066
I didn't eat kalguksu today.

1245
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:15,333
I didn't eat kalguksu.

1246
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:16,767
- Barley tea.
- I had some.

1247
01:01:16,767 --> 01:01:18,734
I didn't eat anything in this unit.

1248
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,533
You had coffee in the beginning.

1249
01:01:21,533 --> 01:01:23,333
So that's how I was poisoned.

1250
01:01:25,567 --> 01:01:27,533
- There she goes again.
- Seriously.

1251
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:29,900
- Hey, don't drink it.
- How does it taste?

1252
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,367
- It's good.
- Is it good?

1253
01:01:32,867 --> 01:01:34,333
Do you mean the coffee from me?

1254
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:37,033
- The two of you drank it.
- We drank coffee.

1255
01:01:37,033 --> 01:01:40,900
- I had noodles because of you.
- We had ramyeon.

1256
01:01:41,533 --> 01:01:43,166
- Do you want to try it?
- Is it good?

1257
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,333
It's a bit salty.

1258
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,367
- It's hot.
- The kalguksu is tasty.

1259
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,567
It's hot.

1260
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:49,166
It's a bit salty. Jung-ha made it.

1261
01:01:53,467 --> 01:01:55,867
Why did you ask me to taste it?

1262
01:01:55,867 --> 01:01:58,200
Didn't it taste good at that moment?

1263
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,834
Why did you ask me to taste it?

1264
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:04,433
Are you suspecting me?

1265
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,333
I can speak to you with confidence.

1266
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:08,967
Why did you ask me to try
the salty kalguksu?

1267
01:02:08,967 --> 01:02:10,667
I'm not the culprit this time.

1268
01:02:10,667 --> 01:02:12,033
They're cute.

1269
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,967
- He asked you to try the salty kalguksu.
-"Why did you do that?"

1270
01:02:15,967 --> 01:02:17,166
Why did you do that?

1271
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,100
- It isn't me.
- You're suspicious.

1272
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,767
- They're cute.
- They're cute.

1273
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,000
Testing.

1274
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,800
This is an announcement for the residents.

1275
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,867
- A residential gathering will begin soon.
- It's about time.

1276
01:02:28,867 --> 01:02:32,100
- I ask every resident to come...
- All right.

1277
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,767
...to the Senior Center.

1278
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:35,734
- Let's go.
- That place.

1279
01:02:35,734 --> 01:02:37,266
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1280
01:02:37,266 --> 01:02:39,100
When was it smeared on?

1281
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,233
You have to keep suspecting someone.

1282
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:47,900
- You can't trust anyone.
- You can't trust anyone.

1283
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,934
- You can't trust...
- Anyone.

1284
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,200
Where did Jung-ha go?

1285
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:55,333
Jung-ha is missing.

1286
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:57,233
- Did Jung-ha leave?
- He's in the restroom.

1287
01:02:57,233 --> 01:02:59,300
- I don't know.
- He's in the restroom.

1288
01:02:59,867 --> 01:03:02,233
It's a hassle to wait.

1289
01:03:02,233 --> 01:03:05,734
In any case, we need to put
the belongings in the police car.

1290
01:03:05,734 --> 01:03:08,900
Tae-hyun, I'm just going to put Jung-ha
in the police car.

1291
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,266
Let's put in a person.

1292
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:12,500
If we take Jae-seok's glasses,

1293
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,000
what is he supposed to do?

1294
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,567
- Shall we take off his overalls?
- Socks.

1295
01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:18,233
- We can cut his hair.
- Listen.

1296
01:03:18,233 --> 01:03:21,100
- We'll cut your hair.
- I'm not the culprit.

1297
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,500
- I'm not the culprit.
- When you weren't around,

1298
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:27,333
- Tae-hyun painted you as the culprit.
- He's the worst.

1299
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:29,734
- For goodness' sake.
- He pestered us.

1300
01:03:29,734 --> 01:03:32,300
- I don't know what to do with him.
- I mean...

1301
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,467
Let's hurry to the gathering.

1302
01:03:33,467 --> 01:03:35,800
- Mr. Residential Gathering.
- What was that?

1303
01:03:37,433 --> 01:03:39,367
My goodness.

1304
01:03:39,934 --> 01:03:41,734
I sat down like a middle-aged man.

1305
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:44,200
- Gosh.
- He's a middle-aged man.

1306
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,400
I'm getting nervous about the game.

1307
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:49,200
My team is kind of in trouble.

1308
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,633
- JENNIE.
- I have a bad feeling about this.

1309
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:54,300
- JENNIE, look at me.
- I have a bad feeling about this.

1310
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,834
What do you mean, "kind of"?

1311
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,266
You'll play Liar Mafia.

1312
01:03:59,266 --> 01:04:00,667
- Liar Mafia?
- Liar Mafia.

1313
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:02,400
Liar Mafia?

1314
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,000
- It's really easy.
- Really? Do you know the game?

1315
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,333
You'll each get a piece of paper
with a key word.

1316
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:10,600
The five people who get the key word
are the civilians,

1317
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,700
and the one person who gets the star
is the mafia member.

1318
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:17,333
One at a time, you will make a sound,

1319
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,533
do an action,

1320
01:04:18,533 --> 01:04:19,967
make a sound,

1321
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,600
and do an action.

1322
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,166
The civilians will describe the key word

1323
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:25,300
- so that the mafia member doesn't get it.
- Good.

1324
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,166
Even if the mafia member gets caught,

1325
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:29,800
if they figure out the key word,
they will win.

1326
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,500
We need to come up with sounds and actions
that'll fool the mafia member.

1327
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,734
We have to do an action?

1328
01:04:34,734 --> 01:04:36,433
- But don't make it obvious.
- No.

1329
01:04:36,433 --> 01:04:37,667
An action or a sound?

1330
01:04:37,667 --> 01:04:38,967
- We alternate.
- Either one.

1331
01:04:38,967 --> 01:04:40,400
A, S, A, S.

1332
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,467
If you're the mafia member,
guess from other people's clues.

1333
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:44,767
What are A and S?

1334
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:47,834
- Action and sound.
- Why are you so nervous?

1335
01:04:47,834 --> 01:04:50,367
He said, "A, S, A, S."

1336
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:52,300
Don't shorten the words.

1337
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,600
- A, S.
- Extend them.

1338
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,533
- Extend them? Actions and sounds.
- Okay.

1339
01:04:56,533 --> 01:04:57,800
I'm sorry.

1340
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,533
- Good.
- A, S.

1341
01:04:59,533 --> 01:05:02,800
- Take one. It's random.
- Okay.

1342
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,533
I won't lose today.

1343
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:05,767
Don't be ridiculous.

1344
01:05:16,467 --> 01:05:17,567
- Okay.
- Let's begin.

1345
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,633
- Tae-hyun.
- Do I start?

1346
01:05:19,633 --> 01:05:21,133
S, A, S, A, S, A.

1347
01:05:21,133 --> 01:05:24,700
I'll twist it two times, okay? Two times.

1348
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,767
Two times.

1349
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:30,066
If I make it obvious, the mafia will know.

1350
01:05:30,066 --> 01:05:32,100
- You're flustered about going first.
- No.

1351
01:05:33,233 --> 01:05:35,600
No. Listen, Jae-seok.

1352
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,266
- You're flustered about going first.
- No.

1353
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:38,734
No.

1354
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:40,000
- We got you.
- No.

1355
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,533
- He became talkative.
- He became talkative.

1356
01:05:42,533 --> 01:05:43,500
I mean--

1357
01:05:45,867 --> 01:05:48,467
- Hold on. Shall we start from there?
- Yes.

1358
01:05:48,467 --> 01:05:50,266
- I should go first.
- Go first.

1359
01:05:50,266 --> 01:05:51,934
Should I make it obvious or not?

1360
01:05:51,934 --> 01:05:53,500
- Make it obvious.
- Make it obvious.

1361
01:05:54,166 --> 01:05:56,834
Hold on. The two of them asked me
to make it obvious.

1362
01:05:56,834 --> 01:05:59,400
- Okay.
- Make it obvious.

1363
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:05,900
All right.

1364
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,667
- He did well.
- Action.

1365
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:09,367
Action?

1366
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,166
All right. That's it.

1367
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:19,767
- I make a sound, right?
- Yes.

1368
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:23,800
Wow.

1369
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,333
What was that? Tae-hyun.

1370
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,233
- What was that?
- Wow.

1371
01:06:28,233 --> 01:06:30,300
- Let's reserve our judgment for now.
- Wow.

1372
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,333
- An action, right?
- Yes.

1373
01:06:32,467 --> 01:06:33,700
Firstly...

1374
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:40,066
That was perfect.

1375
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:42,533
- You know what it is, right?
- That was perfect.

1376
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:03,066
That was perfect.

1377
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:05,367
Tap.

1378
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:07,100
It's him.

1379
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,500
Do it again. What was that?

1380
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,867
- Hard, right?
- I missed it.

1381
01:07:09,867 --> 01:07:11,033
"Hard, right?"

1382
01:07:11,033 --> 01:07:13,033
- Tap.
-"Tap"?

1383
01:07:13,033 --> 01:07:14,867
- My goodness.
- I see.

1384
01:07:14,867 --> 01:07:16,533
Did you get it?

1385
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:17,633
-"Tap"?
- Action.

1386
01:07:18,767 --> 01:07:20,133
It's hard, right?

1387
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,233
This is driving me crazy.

1388
01:07:25,233 --> 01:07:28,400
- Hold on. This is--
- My hint was too telling.

1389
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,700
Hold on.

1390
01:07:30,934 --> 01:07:33,333
Let's see everything quickly. Ready, go.

1391
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,233
- The mafia member figured it out.
- Look.

1392
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:45,300
Isn't mine relatable?

1393
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,333
Wow.

1394
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:49,567
- It isn't that relatable.
- What?

1395
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:51,233
That could go with anything.

1396
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,166
- Wow.
- From now on,

1397
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:55,433
I'll do it for every sound.

1398
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:57,967
- Wow.
- I'll do it for every sound.

1399
01:07:57,967 --> 01:07:59,600
Wow.

1400
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,567
It's a bit strange.

1401
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:03,700
Wow.

1402
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,834
- Let me answer. It's Na-ra.
- This is--

1403
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:07,900
Why do you think so?

1404
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,367
- Why?
- It isn't Na-ra.

1405
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:10,800
I'm a civilian.

1406
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:13,467
I'm a civilian.

1407
01:08:14,433 --> 01:08:15,433
It isn't me.

1408
01:08:15,433 --> 01:08:17,266
- What did Na-ra do?
- Wait. That's right.

1409
01:08:17,266 --> 01:08:19,100
- Do it again.
- Perhaps JENNIE figured it out.

1410
01:08:20,066 --> 01:08:23,033
It isn't easy
to figure it out from one hint.

1411
01:08:23,033 --> 01:08:25,867
- She saw mine. Yes.
- She guessed from Se-chan's sound

1412
01:08:25,867 --> 01:08:28,567
- and did something similar.
- She doesn't know what it is.

1413
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,667
- That's right.
- Right?

1414
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:33,533
Right? These two actions aren't guesswork.

1415
01:08:33,533 --> 01:08:36,533
Stop giving away hints.
Na-ra needs to guess now.

1416
01:08:36,533 --> 01:08:40,400
One, two, three.

1417
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,867
- Na-ra.
- JENNIE.

1418
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:44,133
- Na-ra.
- Na-ra. It can't be helped.

1419
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:45,467
- It's JENNIE.
- Na-ra.

1420
01:08:45,467 --> 01:08:46,800
Na-ra got the most votes. Na-ra.

1421
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,867
- I'm the mafia member.
- See?

1422
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:58,767
- I'm the mafia member.
- See?

1423
01:08:58,767 --> 01:08:59,900
- Really?
- She's good.

1424
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,734
- It was Na-ra.
- See, Se-chan?

1425
01:09:04,133 --> 01:09:06,033
- Na-ra.
- JENNIE, you're incredible.

1426
01:09:06,033 --> 01:09:08,600
No, Na-ra doesn't know the key word.

1427
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,367
- Ramyeon.
- See?

1428
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:19,333
- See?
- Look at that.

1429
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:22,367
- Look at that.
- That's right.

1430
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,400
- The details were different.
- No?

1431
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,000
- That's right.
- I got it right.

1432
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,200
- Jjajangmyeon.
- That was dangerous.

1433
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,333
That was dangerous.

1434
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,300
JENNIE had a clear idea.

1435
01:09:33,533 --> 01:09:37,200
I knew what he was doing.
He gets the dish and goes, "Wow."

1436
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,033
You always do that on variety shows.

1437
01:09:39,033 --> 01:09:41,633
- Wow, it looks tasty.
- Wow.

1438
01:09:41,633 --> 01:09:43,834
Wow, look at this. My goodness.

1439
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,734
- Wow.
- Wow.

1440
01:09:45,734 --> 01:09:48,367
"Wow" works for everything.

1441
01:09:48,367 --> 01:09:50,600
- Wow.
- Next.

1442
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,867
If I get a sound, "Wow" is mine.

1443
01:09:53,533 --> 01:09:55,000
Wow.

1444
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:06,567
- What?
- A, S, A, S, A, S.

1445
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:08,200
Will you twist it or not?

1446
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:09,834
I'll give it away.

1447
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,200
- Okay.
- I'll make it obvious.

1448
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:17,133
That's right.

1449
01:10:18,867 --> 01:10:20,433
That's right.

1450
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,433
- That's right.
- Good.

1451
01:10:22,433 --> 01:10:23,400
Okay.

1452
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,066
Wow.

1453
01:10:26,633 --> 01:10:29,367
- Wow.
- Hey.

1454
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:31,266
I don't know what to think of that.

1455
01:10:31,266 --> 01:10:32,834
Wow.

1456
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:34,300
- It's her.
- JENNIE.

1457
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,467
- It was too much.
- Wow.

1458
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:38,600
If I get a sound, "Wow" is mine.

1459
01:10:40,166 --> 01:10:41,567
Shall I twist it or not?

1460
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,700
Twist it no matter what.

1461
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,834
Shouldn't he make it obvious?

1462
01:10:47,834 --> 01:10:49,400
- Go ahead.
- It's confusing.

1463
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,367
Okay.

1464
01:10:52,033 --> 01:10:53,166
Go ahead.

1465
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:08,000
My goodness.

1466
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:10,867
I think people will be confused.

1467
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,333
A sound.

1468
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:16,033
Ding.

1469
01:11:16,033 --> 01:11:20,834
Yes. That's right.

1470
01:11:20,834 --> 01:11:23,700
Ding.

1471
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,967
- An action, right?
- Yes.

1472
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:27,166
Will you twist it or not?

1473
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:29,433
- I'll make it obvious.
- Okay.

1474
01:11:30,834 --> 01:11:31,767
What?

1475
01:11:32,567 --> 01:11:35,500
- What?
- That's right. That's...

1476
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,767
- What?
- That's right. That's...

1477
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:42,667
That's... Hold on. From the reactions,

1478
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:44,900
I can tell who knows the key word.

1479
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,800
- Jung-ha's eyes are shifting.
- I--

1480
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,467
No.

1481
01:11:52,633 --> 01:11:53,800
All right.

1482
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,133
Hold on. What's this?

1483
01:11:56,967 --> 01:11:58,867
- You're a civilian for sure.
- Yes.

1484
01:11:58,867 --> 01:12:00,967
That's right. Maybe it's JENNIE.

1485
01:12:00,967 --> 01:12:02,934
-"Wow" wasn't fitting.
- Wow.

1486
01:12:02,934 --> 01:12:04,433
You wouldn't say "Wow" to that.

1487
01:12:04,433 --> 01:12:07,567
I said "Wow" while looking at you.

1488
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,533
- I think it's JENNIE.
- I think it's JENNIE.

1489
01:12:10,533 --> 01:12:15,400
- One, two, three.
- I really-- Hold on. Hear me out.

1490
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,700
- Guess the key word.
- Who do you think is the mafia member?

1491
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,066
- Here's what I think.
- Guess the key word.

1492
01:12:20,767 --> 01:12:23,166
- Come on.
- We're on the same team. I'm a civilian.

1493
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:27,500
- The one I'm suspicious of--
- Who is it?

1494
01:12:28,767 --> 01:12:30,900
You.

1495
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,433
Jae-seok, the gesture was cool.

1496
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:38,600
She picks me when things are uncertain.

1497
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,967
- This action was spot on.
- Listen.

1498
01:12:41,967 --> 01:12:43,700
- It was spot on.
- It was too spot on.

1499
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:44,900
- Right.
- JENNIE.

1500
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:48,667
He was showing off
because he had figured it out.

1501
01:12:48,667 --> 01:12:50,400
- You think he figured it out.
- Yes.

1502
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,967
All of us twisted it.

1503
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,667
- Go ahead.
- The two of you will take turns.

1504
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:56,734
JENNIE.

1505
01:12:56,734 --> 01:12:59,333
My sound is... Wow.

1506
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,000
I really am not the mafia member.

1507
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,066
Ding.

1508
01:13:03,066 --> 01:13:06,000
- This is my action.
- It's spot on.

1509
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:07,667
Ta.

1510
01:13:08,233 --> 01:13:09,433
- My goodness.
- Listen.

1511
01:13:09,433 --> 01:13:11,800
- Why don't you trust me this once?
- Okay.

1512
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,033
- Trust me this once.
- You're under pressure.

1513
01:13:14,033 --> 01:13:15,967
Seriously, it's Jae-seok.

1514
01:13:15,967 --> 01:13:17,734
Me?

1515
01:13:17,734 --> 01:13:19,233
Mafia, be quiet.

1516
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:20,734
- One, two, three.
- We're on...

1517
01:13:20,734 --> 01:13:21,934
- JENNIE.
- JENNIE.

1518
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,533
- For goodness' sake.
- Do you feel victimized?

1519
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:29,200
- I'm not the mafia member.
- No?

1520
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,133
- What?
- No?

1521
01:13:31,133 --> 01:13:32,867
- No?
- It's Jae-seok.

1522
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,400
- It isn't me.
- No?

1523
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,800
It really isn't me.
JENNIE, it's not you?

1524
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,867
If you're the mafia member...

1525
01:13:38,867 --> 01:13:40,300
- It really isn't me.
- No?

1526
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,834
- Then why did you do that?
- Is it Se-chan?

1527
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,367
- Is it Se-chan?
- It isn't me.

1528
01:13:43,367 --> 01:13:45,300
- It isn't me.
- Then who is it?

1529
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,133
- It isn't me.
- Then who is it?

1530
01:13:47,133 --> 01:13:49,200
- Is it you?
- It isn't me.

1531
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,934
- It isn't me.
- Then who is it? Is it you?

1532
01:13:51,934 --> 01:13:53,166
It isn't me.

1533
01:13:55,266 --> 01:13:56,800
Is it this man? Is it?

1534
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,700
- That came out wrong.
- Is it you?

1535
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,066
- It's you, isn't it?
- It has to be you.

1536
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:04,200
I'm the mafia member, okay?

1537
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:07,800
- No way.
- No way.

1538
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,100
- How did he manage that?
- What did you do?

1539
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,567
- JENNIE, I'm sorry.
- JENNIE.

1540
01:14:12,567 --> 01:14:15,333
- Why did you do that?
- Why did you say, "Wow"?

1541
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:17,233
- Why did you do that?
- As I said it,

1542
01:14:17,233 --> 01:14:19,367
- I moved my head.
-"Wow" wasn't fitting.

1543
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:21,100
I wanted to do this. "Wow."

1544
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,934
- I...
- JENNIE.

1545
01:14:22,934 --> 01:14:24,967
What's the key word?

1546
01:14:24,967 --> 01:14:27,600
- Wait, I'm confused.
- You're unbelievable.

1547
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,800
What is it? Hurry up and answer.

1548
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,333
- Revolving door?
- What?

1549
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:33,600
Washing machine.

1550
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,533
- You spun.
- No way.

1551
01:14:35,533 --> 01:14:36,934
Na-ra did this.

1552
01:14:36,934 --> 01:14:40,266
I said I'd twist it, so I did this.

1553
01:14:40,266 --> 01:14:43,400
People seemed to accept that,
so I thought, "Okay."

1554
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:49,033
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

1555
01:14:49,033 --> 01:14:52,200
I thought you were imitating a top loader.

1556
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,533
- No way.
- Seriously.

1557
01:14:53,533 --> 01:14:55,100
- Revolving door.
- You were brave.

1558
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,800
- The Yus won.
- Yes.

1559
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,600
This is our game.
Jae-seok, we found our game.

1560
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,000
The losing team gets a clue too.

1561
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,333
- Really?
- Don't share the clue.

1562
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:06,700
Shall we go?

1563
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,500
- Let's go.
- Do we go back?

1564
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,834
You mafia.

1565
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:13,633
Jae-seok has his eyes on me.

1566
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,100
LOOK AT THE CLUB IN UNIT 504

1567
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,166
- Not the stars?
- I guess there's something else.

1568
01:15:19,934 --> 01:15:22,834
- Where is my shoelace?
- Why is it missing?

1569
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:25,200
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1570
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,333
- What?
- Someone took my shoelace.

1571
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:28,900
Someone took your shoelace.

1572
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,567
Really?

1573
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:31,834
It's too much.

1574
01:15:31,834 --> 01:15:34,200
Someone took my shoelace.

1575
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,467
By 5 p.m.,

1576
01:15:37,467 --> 01:15:39,333
put the culprit's belongings

1577
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:41,266
inside the police car
in front of apartment 108.

1578
01:15:41,767 --> 01:15:43,600
- Unbelievable.
- When did it happen?

1579
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,667
- My shoelace.
- That's so funny.

1580
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:47,800
- Did you do it?
- I didn't do it.

1581
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,934
- Come here, Se-chan.
- I didn't do it.

1582
01:15:49,934 --> 01:15:51,834
- It must be you.
- I really didn't do it.

1583
01:15:51,834 --> 01:15:53,900
- It's you, right?
- It has to be Tae-hyun.

1584
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,734
I can't believe these punks.

1585
01:15:55,734 --> 01:15:58,100
- Where did my shoelace go?
- I was waiting for 5 p.m.

1586
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,333
- Can we do it now?
- His shoelace was taken.

1587
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:01,633
- Gosh.
- When was it taken?

1588
01:16:01,633 --> 01:16:04,500
Tae-hyun, bring my shoelace.

1589
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,600
- It really wasn't me.
- Jae-seok.

1590
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,767
- Bring it while I'm asking nicely.
- Shoelace.

1591
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:09,867
- Hey.
- I feel so bad for you.

1592
01:16:09,867 --> 01:16:11,633
I can't believe my shoelace went missing.

1593
01:16:19,734 --> 01:16:23,800
By 5 p.m.,
put the culprit's belongings

1594
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,100
inside the police car.

1595
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:29,233
That means one of us might be the culprit.

1596
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,166
Let's check the clue. Is it another video?

1597
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:36,367
It's a video.

1598
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,166
JENNIE, close the door.

1599
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:41,233
- I closed it.
- Those punks play so dirty.

1600
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,934
Gosh, those punks took my hat.

1601
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:47,700
They took everything.

1602
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,667
Those punks came in here

1603
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:53,500
and took everything.

1604
01:16:57,133 --> 01:16:59,500
- Jae-seok.
- I can't believe them.

1605
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,600
Look at this. Look at this, Jae-seok.

1606
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,100
- What does it say?
- Look. Who is...

1607
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,567
- What does it say?
- Look.

1608
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,100
For "who," it says, "Unit 504, club."

1609
01:17:12,934 --> 01:17:14,800
- What?
- Who...

1610
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,934
The clue to who did it is in unit 504.

1611
01:17:28,934 --> 01:17:31,967
For "what"... What's this? "Pi, he..."

1612
01:17:31,967 --> 01:17:34,633
- What?
- "Pi, he, number one."

1613
01:17:36,934 --> 01:17:39,100
Do you think pi is the English letter P?

1614
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,367
- Hold on. What's that?
- P.

1615
01:17:40,934 --> 01:17:44,100
What are the two missing letters? P...

1616
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,667
"Phone number"?

1617
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:47,133
- What's this?
-"Phone number"?

1618
01:17:47,133 --> 01:17:48,300
"Pi, he, no..."

1619
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,600
Letters would go in the blanks.

1620
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:54,066
I thought it was "phone,"
but then it should be "ph."

1621
01:17:55,233 --> 01:17:56,300
Let's play it.

1622
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:05,100
For goodness' sake.

1623
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,233
- Come on.
- Come on.

1624
01:18:08,633 --> 01:18:11,467
- Come on.
- Come on.

1625
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:14,166
You guys should know better than that.

1626
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:15,633
I can't believe them.

1627
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,600
- What are you doing?
- All right.

1628
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,233
Give us Jae-seok's shoe.

1629
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:22,367
Give us Jae-seok's shoe with the shoelace.

1630
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,233
Seriously, don't come here.

1631
01:18:26,233 --> 01:18:28,333
- All right.
- Seriously.

1632
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:31,367
- All right.
- Seriously.

1633
01:18:33,033 --> 01:18:34,033
Take out an insole.

1634
01:18:34,967 --> 01:18:36,867
- There's no insole.
- An insole.

1635
01:18:37,834 --> 01:18:40,000
- I can't take out the insole.
- Really?

1636
01:18:43,033 --> 01:18:44,567
Close the door.

1637
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,033
All right.

1638
01:18:52,734 --> 01:18:54,500
THE 1ST
KBS COLLEGE COMEDY FESTIVAL

1639
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,734
College Comedy Festival?

1640
01:18:55,734 --> 01:18:57,266
It's contestant number nine.

1641
01:18:57,266 --> 01:18:59,200
From Seoul Institute of the Arts...

1642
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,467
- Is that you?
- Yes.

1643
01:19:00,467 --> 01:19:02,266
That's you. You're unmistakable.

1644
01:19:02,266 --> 01:19:03,533
Congratulations.

1645
01:19:03,533 --> 01:19:06,767
Why did they make it so obvious?
Jae-seok must be embarrassed.

1646
01:19:06,767 --> 01:19:08,467
He must be flustered.

1647
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:13,233
Let's watch a scene
from a popular commercial.

1648
01:19:13,934 --> 01:19:17,233
- My mom can cook well.
- It's so boring.

1649
01:19:17,233 --> 01:19:19,300
She makes many tasty dishes.

1650
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,467
- It's so boring.
- Is it from 1991?

1651
01:19:21,467 --> 01:19:23,834
- It's from 1991. I was a college freshman.
- Really?

1652
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,500
Mom, isn't it true?

1653
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,734
Yes. Go ahead and eat.

1654
01:19:27,734 --> 01:19:29,233
It's...

1655
01:19:29,233 --> 01:19:30,133
What?

1656
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,967
Can I have more?

1657
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,400
What?

1658
01:19:39,367 --> 01:19:40,767
What was the line?

1659
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:43,567
Did you say that it was rotten?

1660
01:19:48,467 --> 01:19:50,266
In Daegu, foul-smelling...

1661
01:19:50,266 --> 01:19:52,333
kept the citizens from doing the laundry.

1662
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,100
It happened because of...

1663
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,633
About 2 g is a lethal amount...

1664
01:19:57,934 --> 01:20:02,600
As it reacts with other chemicals,
its odor and toxicity intensify.

1665
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:05,066
It builds up in living organisms

1666
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:09,567
and causes pulmonary edema,
muscular paralysis, and cancer.

1667
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,800
Due to the stench,
people began purchasing bottled water.

1668
01:20:18,767 --> 01:20:21,767
Hey, that's the news.

1669
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:27,867
It's...

1670
01:20:27,867 --> 01:20:29,633
About 2 g is a lethal amount...

1671
01:20:29,633 --> 01:20:32,233
...people began purchasing bottled water.

1672
01:20:34,967 --> 01:20:37,900
It was all over the news. Phenol.

1673
01:20:39,433 --> 01:20:40,967
Phenol?

1674
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:44,900
Phenol. It was called
the Phenol Incident of 1991.

1675
01:20:49,367 --> 01:20:52,533
Foul-smelling tap water
kept the citizens...

1676
01:20:52,533 --> 01:20:54,900
It happened because of phenol spillage

1677
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,767
into the reservoir of the Nakdong River.

1678
01:21:03,867 --> 01:21:05,600
It was revealed

1679
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,633
that wastewater containing phenol
was dumped into the Nakdong River.

1680
01:21:08,633 --> 01:21:11,734
The tap water quickly became contaminated
with phenol.

1681
01:21:16,467 --> 01:21:19,066
It was all over the news. Phenol.

1682
01:21:19,066 --> 01:21:21,433
That was why I made that skit.

1683
01:21:21,433 --> 01:21:23,600
It's phenol milk.

1684
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,400
Can I have more?

1685
01:21:28,767 --> 01:21:32,400
Then those letters must be
a chemical symbol.

1686
01:21:41,367 --> 01:21:43,867
Back then, people boiled barley tea.

1687
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,000
Barley tea is tasty.

1688
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,967
Hey, don't drink it.

1689
01:21:52,834 --> 01:21:54,367
- It's hot.
- The kalguksu is tasty.

1690
01:21:58,367 --> 01:21:59,900
- Blue light.
- What's this?

1691
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,600
- What?
- What's this on your clothes?

1692
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,300
- There's something.
- What?

1693
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:07,000
Meanwhile, the company
behind the phenol incident was identified.

1694
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,700
Meanwhile, the company
behind the phenol incident was identified.

1695
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:14,333
It was further revealed
that the insiders of the company

1696
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:16,433
attempted to cover up the incident.

1697
01:22:16,433 --> 01:22:17,700
Is that so?

1698
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:19,166
The insiders.

1699
01:22:19,767 --> 01:22:21,500
The company insider

1700
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,767
instigated A to put the blame
on the resident representative

1701
01:22:24,767 --> 01:22:28,233
who sold bottled water illegally
at an apartment

1702
01:22:28,233 --> 01:22:31,033
by making the phenol incident
look like a poisoning case.

1703
01:22:31,033 --> 01:22:33,133
The revelation shocked everyone.

1704
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,667
- Are there no problems?
- Today, there are no...

1705
01:22:39,667 --> 01:22:41,367
- What?
- What's going on?

1706
01:22:41,367 --> 01:22:43,734
I simply gave them coffee
since the weather was cold.

1707
01:22:43,734 --> 01:22:45,467
Don't accuse an innocent woman.

1708
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,233
While the police
have gotten a hold of the insider,

1709
01:22:54,233 --> 01:22:56,667
A's whereabouts remain unknown.

1710
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:59,266
The police are after A
in an open investigation.

1711
01:23:10,166 --> 01:23:13,000
- You put the blame on the woman.
- You put the blame on her.

1712
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,066
The police are after you, Jae-seok.

1713
01:23:15,066 --> 01:23:16,300
It isn't me.

1714
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,400
- It has to be you.
- Hey.

1715
01:23:18,967 --> 01:23:20,800
This is an announcement.

1716
01:23:21,533 --> 01:23:25,233
From 4:30 to 5 p.m.,

1717
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,934
you can bring the belongings
of the person you think is A

1718
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,333
to the police car.

1719
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:36,333
The first person to put A's belongings
in the car

1720
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:37,900
will win.

1721
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:42,400
However, you only have two chances
to put the belongings inside.

1722
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,567
If you fail to catch A
in the two chances you have

1723
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:49,100
or fail to identify them by 5 p.m.,

1724
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,867
the residents will lose.

1725
01:23:50,867 --> 01:23:53,734
So please choose carefully.

1726
01:23:53,734 --> 01:23:55,567
We have to choose carefully.

1727
01:24:02,834 --> 01:24:04,333
Where is the club?

1728
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,200
LOOK AT THE CLUB IN UNIT 504

1729
01:24:09,967 --> 01:24:12,500
We're here.

1730
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,467
My goodness,
I thought it was the detective.

1731
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,367
We're here.

1732
01:24:17,367 --> 01:24:20,467
- I'm sorry.
- We're here.

1733
01:24:20,467 --> 01:24:21,600
We're here.

1734
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,600
- What were you watching?
- Hey.

1735
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,967
Hey.

1736
01:24:25,967 --> 01:24:27,767
I don't know which one of you did it,

1737
01:24:27,767 --> 01:24:29,734
but you need to stop

1738
01:24:29,734 --> 01:24:32,467
taking my items from my bag.

1739
01:24:33,066 --> 01:24:36,300
...you need to stop
taking my items from my bag.

1740
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,934
Why did you take my fur hat?

1741
01:24:37,934 --> 01:24:39,200
It wasn't me. It really wasn't.

1742
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,266
Who was it?

1743
01:24:40,266 --> 01:24:41,367
Who took my fur hat?

1744
01:24:41,934 --> 01:24:44,200
- Se-chan.
- It wasn't me.

1745
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,600
Jae-seok, it wasn't me. I don't have it.

1746
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,166
Jae-seok, where is the club?

1747
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:51,166
Hold on. Let's talk
now that everyone is here.

1748
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:52,200
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

1749
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:56,100
What's the mission of the day?
In the police car...

1750
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,033
The culprit's--

1751
01:24:57,033 --> 01:24:59,100
We put in Jae-seok's belongings, right?

1752
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,200
I'm not the culprit.

1753
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,967
- Is that what we need to do?
- Yes.

1754
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:04,700
- We need to do it first.
- First.

1755
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,266
The first one to do it becomes the winner.

1756
01:25:07,266 --> 01:25:09,233
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

1757
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,734
That's what we need to do.

1758
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:14,600
First...

1759
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:16,900
- Na-ra, you came late.
- Is that it?

1760
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,200
Where?

1761
01:25:27,633 --> 01:25:28,767
An airplane.

1762
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:34,667
There's only one. There it is.

1763
01:25:34,667 --> 01:25:36,567
An airplane.

1764
01:25:41,934 --> 01:25:42,934
An airplane.

1765
01:25:42,934 --> 01:25:43,934
All right.

1766
01:25:47,734 --> 01:25:49,033
- An airplane.
- An airplane.

1767
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:50,800
- Light aircraft.
- What does it mean?

1768
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,667
Seriously, what does it mean?

1769
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:55,233
A glider. Light aircraft.

1770
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:01,734
- Light aircraft.
- Light aircraft.

1771
01:26:01,734 --> 01:26:03,367
What's this?

1772
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:05,066
- Come here.
- Okay.

1773
01:26:06,467 --> 01:26:08,700
- There are three clubs.
- Three?

1774
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:11,166
There are three.
This one and the two airplanes.

1775
01:26:13,033 --> 01:26:17,400
RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE

1776
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,300
"You can't see
what's right under your nose"?

1777
01:26:21,433 --> 01:26:23,300
- What was your hint?
- Did you see this?

1778
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,433
What? No.

1779
01:26:24,433 --> 01:26:25,667
All right.

1780
01:26:32,033 --> 01:26:33,300
It's the character for "woods."

1781
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,266
Jae-seok, hold on.

1782
01:26:35,266 --> 01:26:37,433
- The woods.
- What?

1783
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:47,700
Tell me. I'm so frustrated. Seriously.

1784
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,233
What is it? Tell me.

1785
01:26:49,233 --> 01:26:52,800
Se-chan, we're sharing information.
I'll tell you later.

1786
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,500
- Be serious.
- Okay.

1787
01:26:56,467 --> 01:26:57,834
Will you share information?

1788
01:26:57,834 --> 01:27:01,200
- I'll tell you.
- The hint is a toxic substance.

1789
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,400
- Toxic substance?
- Really?

1790
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,700
Yes. The hint is a toxic substance.

1791
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:09,467
We just got "The so-and-so Incident."
It's the name of the toxic substance.

1792
01:27:09,467 --> 01:27:11,834
"The so-and-so Incident"?

1793
01:27:11,834 --> 01:27:13,967
- Beef shank.
-"Beef shank"?

1794
01:27:14,533 --> 01:27:16,834
- It rhymes with incident.
- Jae-seok...

1795
01:27:17,767 --> 01:27:19,033
What's up with your shoes?

1796
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:20,900
Jae-seok, what's up with your shoes?

1797
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,900
- It's hip-hop.
- Jae-seok.

1798
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,300
It's hip-hop.

1799
01:27:27,567 --> 01:27:30,200
- It isn't me.
- I believe you.

1800
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,000
But if you walk around like that,
you'll look like the culprit.

1801
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,233
You look so cute.

1802
01:27:34,233 --> 01:27:36,133
It isn't me.

1803
01:27:36,133 --> 01:27:37,734
- Jung-ha.
- Yes?

1804
01:27:37,734 --> 01:27:41,700
It really wasn't me.
Don't corner me like this.

1805
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,367
- It wasn't you, was it?
- It really wasn't me.

1806
01:27:45,734 --> 01:27:47,667
- But--
- What could that mean?

1807
01:27:47,667 --> 01:27:49,200
Isn't it Jae-seok?

1808
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,567
- Why would that mean Jae-seok?
- I mean...

1809
01:27:51,567 --> 01:27:54,266
- JENNIE.
- Yes?

1810
01:27:54,266 --> 01:27:57,133
Tae-hyun, while there's a chance
of Jae-seok being the culprit...

1811
01:27:57,133 --> 01:27:59,600
It'll be a disaster if it isn't him.

1812
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,934
Seriously. We just need to solve
this clue.

1813
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,100
Let's take out all the shoelaces.

1814
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,633
Which one do you want?

1815
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:23,867
For now, I don't know who the culprit is.
So I'm getting all the shoelaces.

1816
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:34,867
- Why do you keep stealing?
- What?

1817
01:28:34,867 --> 01:28:36,667
I need the belongings.

1818
01:28:39,934 --> 01:28:41,500
You're taking the whole bag?

1819
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,633
- Will you carry it?
- Let's do that.

1820
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,567
I don't think it's Na-ra.

1821
01:28:45,567 --> 01:28:46,967
You never know.

1822
01:28:46,967 --> 01:28:49,266
If you guess wrong,
you need another belonging.

1823
01:28:49,266 --> 01:28:50,934
- We only get two chances.
- Yes.

1824
01:28:51,934 --> 01:28:53,000
Hold on.

1825
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,900
Jae-seok, someone took my shoe.

1826
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,700
Hey, you punks.

1827
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Come here.

1828
01:29:04,567 --> 01:29:08,000
You should've left my shoe behind.
Why did you take it?

1829
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,400
- I can't believe them.
- This isn't the way to do it.

1830
01:29:12,734 --> 01:29:14,066
What?

1831
01:29:14,066 --> 01:29:16,200
Someone took a shoe.

1832
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,100
This is wrong.

1833
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,467
This is wrong.

1834
01:29:22,033 --> 01:29:23,967
There's only a pair of slippers.

1835
01:29:23,967 --> 01:29:27,166
- Is that it?
- That's right.

1836
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:29,033
What's the connection?

1837
01:29:38,834 --> 01:29:41,433
- Does it refer to this part?
- Yes.

1838
01:29:41,433 --> 01:29:44,633
What is it? A button? What is it called?

1839
01:29:44,633 --> 01:29:48,300
- A dial. Does it have to do with planes?
- I don't know.

1840
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,567
"Right under your nose"?

1841
01:29:50,567 --> 01:29:53,066
- Is that a clue?
- Yes, it's in the other room.

1842
01:29:53,066 --> 01:29:55,066
- Really?
- And there's a drawing.

1843
01:29:55,066 --> 01:29:56,834
- A drawing?
- A drawing in a sketchbook.

1844
01:29:58,433 --> 01:30:00,133
"Right under your nose."

1845
01:30:01,567 --> 01:30:03,133
JENNIE, where is my shoe?

1846
01:30:03,133 --> 01:30:06,200
- Se-chan, I'm...
- What is it?

1847
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:10,300
What could be the hint here?

1848
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:12,800
The culprit... It isn't you, is it?

1849
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,700
It isn't me. I'm walking around like this
since my shoe is gone.

1850
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:17,700
I'm walking around like this.

1851
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:21,000
I'm walking around like this
since my shoe is gone.

1852
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,500
I'm walking around like this.

1853
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,667
- Really?
- It isn't me.

1854
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:25,166
Let's solve the clue then.

1855
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:27,900
- You think that means glasses?
- I don't think so.

1856
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,800
Glasses and crooked teeth.

1857
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,633
That can't be it.

1858
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,600
What could it be?

1859
01:30:35,133 --> 01:30:37,367
What's the meaning of
"Right under your nose"?

1860
01:30:37,367 --> 01:30:38,900
Right under your nose.

1861
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:41,033
There's one on the TV?

1862
01:30:45,967 --> 01:30:48,600
Three?

1863
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,867
Panel. Button.

1864
01:30:50,867 --> 01:30:51,767
Dial.

1865
01:30:52,934 --> 01:30:54,567
Three ieungs?

1866
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,533
Wait.

1867
01:31:00,633 --> 01:31:02,800
Jung-ha? Lee Jung-ha?

1868
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,800
LEE JUNG-HA

1869
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,033
There's an airplane here too.

1870
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,834
MOVING

1871
01:31:17,433 --> 01:31:20,900
- Why isn't Jung-ha here?
- I'm not sure.

1872
01:31:21,533 --> 01:31:23,133
Where did Jung-ha go?

1873
01:31:23,867 --> 01:31:25,300
Jung-ha is missing.

1874
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,100
- Jung-ha.
- Yes?

1875
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:34,967
It really wasn't me.
Don't corner me like this.

1876
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:39,467
Na-ra, Jung-ha is A.

1877
01:31:39,467 --> 01:31:40,367
Gosh.

1878
01:31:41,567 --> 01:31:43,000
Did everyone go down?

1879
01:31:44,233 --> 01:31:45,066
Where is he?

1880
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,533
Where is he?

1881
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,500
Did you go downstairs?

1882
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,367
Where is the police car?

1883
01:32:07,734 --> 01:32:10,133
Did they really go?

1884
01:32:12,567 --> 01:32:16,200
Na-ra, that's my phone.
Na-ra, it isn't me.

1885
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:19,133
It isn't me. I'm serious.

1886
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,166
I know who the culprit is.

1887
01:32:22,166 --> 01:32:23,767
It isn't me.

1888
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:27,600
Where is the police car?

1889
01:32:37,467 --> 01:32:38,834
Where is the police car?

1890
01:32:40,166 --> 01:32:42,533
Where is the police car? The police car.

1891
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,667
It isn't me.

1892
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:50,600
What? Someone is running.

1893
01:32:56,333 --> 01:32:57,667
Where is the police car?

1894
01:32:57,667 --> 01:32:58,767
What is it?

1895
01:33:01,567 --> 01:33:02,667
I'm exhausted.

1896
01:33:03,734 --> 01:33:05,033
All right.

1897
01:33:08,066 --> 01:33:09,333
It's Lee Jung-ha's.

1898
01:33:13,467 --> 01:33:15,700
Why isn't Jung-ha here?

1899
01:33:19,667 --> 01:33:23,333
LEE JUNG-HA

1900
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,500
Lee Jung-ha...

1901
01:33:35,633 --> 01:33:37,533
Lee Jung-ha isn't the culprit.

1902
01:33:37,533 --> 01:33:38,600
- He's not?
- No.

1903
01:33:40,533 --> 01:33:42,400
Lee Jung-ha isn't the culprit.

1904
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,400
- He's not?
- No.

1905
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,100
Jae-seok!

1906
01:33:46,667 --> 01:33:48,266
- It isn't him.
- It isn't him.

1907
01:33:48,266 --> 01:33:50,000
- No?
- I told you so.

1908
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,166
Jae-seok, it isn't Jung-ha.

1909
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:56,800
We only have one chance left.
Gosh, I can't believe him.

1910
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,734
I thought it was Jung-ha, but I was wrong.

1911
01:33:59,633 --> 01:34:01,800
I thought it was Jung-ha, but I was wrong.

1912
01:34:10,633 --> 01:34:11,867
You're right.

1913
01:34:19,066 --> 01:34:20,600
Is there another one?

1914
01:34:25,166 --> 01:34:29,033
KOREAN BEEF IS
THE BEST KIND OF BEEF

1915
01:34:29,033 --> 01:34:31,033
"Korean beef is the best kind of beef."

1916
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,266
Hold on.

1917
01:34:36,667 --> 01:34:37,767
Hold on.

1918
01:34:40,333 --> 01:34:42,333
"Right under your nose."

1919
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:44,166
RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE

1920
01:34:44,734 --> 01:34:45,800
What does it mean?

1921
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,000
- Light aircraft.
- Light aircraft.

1922
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:51,133
- The two characters make "the woods."
- I know.

1923
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:52,700
The woods.

1924
01:34:59,834 --> 01:35:01,467
My goodness. Tae-hyun.

1925
01:35:01,467 --> 01:35:02,633
What?

1926
01:35:02,633 --> 01:35:03,567
- Tae-hyun.
- Yes?

1927
01:35:03,567 --> 01:35:04,734
Tae-hyun.

1928
01:35:04,734 --> 01:35:05,767
- Tae-hyun.
- Yes?

1929
01:35:05,767 --> 01:35:07,200
- I figured it out.
- What?

1930
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,233
What kind of a plane is that?

1931
01:35:09,233 --> 01:35:11,166
- A paper plane.
- No, a light aircraft.

1932
01:35:11,166 --> 01:35:14,033
- A light aircraft.
- A light aircraft.

1933
01:35:14,033 --> 01:35:15,500
It sounds similar to "security guard."

1934
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,633
It sounds similar to "security guard."

1935
01:35:31,467 --> 01:35:33,100
KOREAN BEEF IS
THE BEST KIND OF BEEF

1936
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:35,900
"Cow" and "One" make Woo-il.

1937
01:35:37,033 --> 01:35:38,767
"Right under your nose."

1938
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,100
- Green.
- It's blue green.

1939
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:42,934
- It's green.
- Blue green

1940
01:35:45,367 --> 01:35:47,600
The two characters make "the woods."

1941
01:35:51,166 --> 01:35:53,767
The buttons are three circles.

1942
01:35:54,367 --> 01:35:55,867
Im Woo-il.

1943
01:35:55,867 --> 01:35:58,000
IM WOO-IL

1944
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,567
The company insider
instigated "A" to put the blame

1945
01:36:00,567 --> 01:36:02,400
on the resident representative

1946
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,000
by making the phenol incident
look like a poisoning case.

1947
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,266
The police are after "A"
in an open investigation.

1948
01:36:19,266 --> 01:36:21,266
You're working hard on a cold day.

1949
01:36:21,767 --> 01:36:24,300
Have a cup of hot coffee.

1950
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:26,967
- That sounds great.
- Let's do that.

1951
01:36:32,533 --> 01:36:35,333
Why me? Goodness.

1952
01:36:35,333 --> 01:36:37,767
- It looks tasty.
- Noodles.

1953
01:36:38,834 --> 01:36:39,900
People boiled tap water.

1954
01:36:40,633 --> 01:36:44,400
They made corn tea and barley tea
in a kettle at home.

1955
01:37:04,266 --> 01:37:05,100
You're right.

1956
01:37:06,266 --> 01:37:07,533
Should I try it or not?

1957
01:37:07,533 --> 01:37:09,433
Hey, that isn't what's important.

1958
01:37:09,433 --> 01:37:13,667
- It's Woo-il.
- It's Woo-il.

1959
01:37:13,667 --> 01:37:15,633
What about the clubs?

1960
01:37:15,633 --> 01:37:18,333
The airplane. How is that related to him?

1961
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:20,700
- Isn't that Woo-il?
- Where is he?

1962
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:22,767
- Security guard.
- Security guard?

1963
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:24,433
- A light aircraft.
- Really?

1964
01:37:24,433 --> 01:37:27,667
- A security guard.
- A light aircraft?

1965
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:31,900
- Really?
- Where is he? Which floor was it?

1966
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,200
Let's hurry.

1967
01:37:39,533 --> 01:37:40,667
How far do I need to go?

1968
01:37:46,767 --> 01:37:52,700
- I should've taken the elevator.
- What are you doing here?

1969
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:53,900
- The rooftop?
- No.

1970
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:55,533
- Isn't he there?
- No.

1971
01:37:55,533 --> 01:37:57,400
- Did you find him?
- No.

1972
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,967
- He isn't here. Was I mistaken?
- No.

1973
01:38:01,233 --> 01:38:03,033
He isn't here. Let's go.

1974
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,900
Where is Woo-il hiding?

1975
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,567
That's right.

1976
01:38:08,567 --> 01:38:10,367
Hey, Na-ra.

1977
01:38:10,367 --> 01:38:12,667
- Yes? How about the bull?
- Take your bag.

1978
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:14,734
For goodness' sake.

1979
01:38:14,734 --> 01:38:16,867
- How about the bull?
- Take your bag.

1980
01:38:16,867 --> 01:38:18,433
For goodness' sake.

1981
01:38:18,433 --> 01:38:21,400
I can't believe it.

1982
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:24,166
Seriously.

1983
01:38:24,166 --> 01:38:27,200
Where did my shoelaces go?

1984
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,600
JENNIE, here you go.

1985
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,667
At least you only lost your shoelaces.

1986
01:38:32,667 --> 01:38:34,900
I lost my shoes.

1987
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:36,367
My shoes...

1988
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:40,100
Woo-il. But--

1989
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:42,734
- Where will we catch him?
- Seriously.

1990
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:46,333
Woo-il. Where is the security guard?

1991
01:38:47,767 --> 01:38:49,066
Where is Im Woo-il?

1992
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,700
Why is it so dark here?

1993
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,266
There's no way he's here.

1994
01:38:54,266 --> 01:38:56,834
The basement is empty.

1995
01:38:56,834 --> 01:38:58,967
Woo-il, you aren't hiding, are you?

1996
01:38:58,967 --> 01:39:00,900
Where is everyone?

1997
01:39:04,867 --> 01:39:05,934
Oh, my god.

1998
01:39:07,867 --> 01:39:09,066
Oh, my god.

1999
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,200
Oh, my god.

2000
01:39:18,533 --> 01:39:20,066
Oh, my god.

2001
01:39:23,133 --> 01:39:24,266
Woo-il, no.

2002
01:39:32,533 --> 01:39:34,200
Woo-il, no.

2003
01:39:34,767 --> 01:39:36,900
I can't run.

2004
01:39:37,433 --> 01:39:39,200
I can't run.

2005
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,467
Woo-il.

2006
01:39:40,467 --> 01:39:42,133
I can't run, Woo-il.

2007
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:43,700
Woo-il.

2008
01:39:46,333 --> 01:39:48,767
Woo-il, I can't run.

2009
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,300
I can't run. Come on.

2010
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:54,467
Mr. Security Guard.

2011
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,734
Why is he so passionate about his role?

2012
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,433
Come on. Listen to me.

2013
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:10,700
Mr. Security Guard.

2014
01:40:12,734 --> 01:40:14,867
It's Woo-il!

2015
01:40:15,567 --> 01:40:19,066
It's Woo-il! It's Woo-il!

2016
01:40:19,066 --> 01:40:22,033
It's Woo-il!

2017
01:40:23,233 --> 01:40:24,567
Hey!

2018
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,700
It's Woo-il!

2019
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:29,300
Where is he?

2020
01:40:29,834 --> 01:40:31,800
Let's go down.

2021
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,033
Where is he?

2022
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:35,467
There he is.

2023
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,934
Where is Im Woo-il?

2024
01:40:39,233 --> 01:40:40,567
What?

2025
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:09,567
Trip him.

2026
01:41:12,467 --> 01:41:16,400
Trip him.

2027
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:19,100
Woo-il, hold on.

2028
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:20,867
Hold on. Woo-il, hold on.

2029
01:41:20,867 --> 01:41:23,166
Hold on.

2030
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,400
Hey.

2031
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,000
I got you.

2032
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,033
Catch him!

2033
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,934
Let go.

2034
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,333
My goodness!

2035
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:03,934
My goodness!

2036
01:42:08,667 --> 01:42:10,100
I'm exhausted.

2037
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:14,633
Jae-seok.

2038
01:42:15,734 --> 01:42:17,033
Catch Jae-seok.

2039
01:42:18,734 --> 01:42:19,867
Catch Jae-seok.

2040
01:42:23,567 --> 01:42:26,633
JENNIE.

2041
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:29,834
JENNIE.

2042
01:42:31,834 --> 01:42:34,166
Come on. We need to finish this.

2043
01:42:34,166 --> 01:42:35,066
Come on.

2044
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,367
- It's the culprit's belongings.
- Is it done?

2045
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,133
Okay. I was the first one.

2046
01:42:58,133 --> 01:42:59,633
Yu Jae-seok won.

2047
01:42:59,633 --> 01:43:01,767
Okay. I was the first one.

2048
01:43:05,633 --> 01:43:06,467
It was Woo-il.

2049
01:43:06,467 --> 01:43:09,934
- You did all the work.
- You figured it out well.

2050
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:11,667
I thought we were a team,

2051
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:13,433
so I shared what I knew.

2052
01:43:13,433 --> 01:43:14,734
It was an individual event.

2053
01:43:14,734 --> 01:43:16,700
Why did you give away the information?

2054
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:20,100
I felt proud. I was like,
"Isn't this correct?"

2055
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:23,300
Today's story was based
on the Phenol Incident from 1991.

2056
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:24,367
That's right.

2057
01:43:24,367 --> 01:43:27,033
- You were the main character.
- You had a big role.

2058
01:43:27,033 --> 01:43:29,133
- Look at you.
- Woo-il.

2059
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:34,000
I felt like my heart was going to burst.

2060
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:34,900
Was it thrilling?

2061
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:36,700
- Yes. I loved it.
- It was thrilling.

2062
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:37,834
JENNIE loved it too.

2063
01:43:37,834 --> 01:43:40,166
I loved it. I had fun.

2064
01:43:40,166 --> 01:43:41,734
In any case, the winner is

2065
01:43:41,734 --> 01:43:44,834
- Yu Jae-seok.
- Okay. I won for the first time.

2066
01:43:46,433 --> 01:43:48,834
In Daegu, foul-smelling tap water

2067
01:43:48,834 --> 01:43:52,100
kept the citizens from drinking the water
and doing the laundry.

2068
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,066
A direct cause
of the drinking water crisis was

2069
01:43:54,066 --> 01:43:57,934
the unethical tendency of a corporation
that only chased after profit.

2070
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,834
An electronics company
that claimed to collect

2071
01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:03,100
old electronics to preserve nature

2072
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:07,600
was caught discarding the waste illegally
to cut down on costs.

2073
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:11,300
Factories that were secretly discarding
chemical-laden wastewater

2074
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:12,934
were caught.

2075
01:44:21,834 --> 01:44:23,567
- Stop right there!
- Stop, you punk!

2076
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,166
Love isn't a sin!

2077
01:44:29,133 --> 01:44:31,333
Have you seen this man?

2078
01:44:31,333 --> 01:44:33,467
He's someone precious to me.

2079
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:36,500
Don't worry. We'll find him.

2080
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:38,033
A hint will give me an idea.

2081
01:44:38,033 --> 01:44:39,734
He was called Heung-bu.

2082
01:44:39,734 --> 01:44:41,400
We were nearly there.

2083
01:44:42,033 --> 01:44:43,000
I found two!

2084
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,567
- Let go!
- What?

2085
01:44:46,567 --> 01:44:48,000
Move out of the way!

2086
01:44:52,967 --> 01:44:55,433
- I'm so scared.
- It was like a movie.

2087
