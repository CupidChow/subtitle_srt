1
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:26,033
With the miracle of the Han River,
Korea showed rapid economic growth.

2
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,000
With a determination to end poverty
and live well, Saemaul Undong began.

3
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,734
RAPID GROWTH
DUE TO BLOOD AND SWEAT

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,233
KOREA LEADS THE WORLD
IN ECONOMIC GROWTH

5
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:51,700
ECONOMIC GROWTH LEADS
TO STRUCTURAL DISEQUILIBRIUM

6
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:53,967
TIGHTENING ENFORCEMENT
ON ECONOMIC OFFENSES

7
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:58,867
Criminals of violent crimes, extortion,
gambling, smuggling,

8
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,667
and drug-related offenses,

9
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:06,533
who have tormented innocent citizens
and poisoned our society,

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,200
will be rooted out.

11
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:12,700
Such social evils will have no place
in people's lives.

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,266
It's cold, so I must keep moving.

13
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,734
-I need to warm up my body quickly.
-I know.

14
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,633
-Like an amateur soccer club.
-Yes.

15
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,800
Why are we filming on such a cold day?

16
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:33,900
Jae-seok, on a day like this one…

17
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:35,900
Hey, they didn't pick a cold day.

18
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:37,100
It just happens to be cold.

19
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:40,400
That should be your mind-set.

20
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,333
-Aren't we going to the apartment today?
-What?

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,667
-The apartment.
-I guess we aren't going there.

22
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,967
It was nice at the apartment.

23
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:50,266
-I know. It was nice.
-It was nice.

24
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,667
-We moved back and forth.
-I got attached to it.

25
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:59,934
Hey!

26
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,000
Seriously.

27
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:04,166
-Where are your warm clothes?
-You'll be cold.

28
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:05,333
-It's cold.
-Get a jacket.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,767
Everyone is bundled up.

30
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,633
You guys really look out for yourselves.

31
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,433
-Where are your gloves?
-Do I need them?

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,000
-Of course.
-You'll be cold.

33
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:15,667
Na-ra, didn't you bring your gloves?

34
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,166
You're giving yours to me?

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,400
-Buy some like these.
-Give them to me.

36
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:23,133
Buy some like these. They're great.

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,867
-Na-ra, what will you do without gloves?
-What?

38
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,834
Wear warm gloves like these.

39
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,066
It was one attack after another.

40
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,934
-He's wearing string-knit gloves.
-Wear them at the very least.

41
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:37,967
Why are we the only ones here today?

42
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,867
-There must be something.
-You gave him a mission.

43
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:42,500
There must be something.

44
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,367
I'm so happy right now

45
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,533
-that I could fly away.
-No!

46
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:51,700
Okay. The excitement
the two of you feel…

47
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:54,433
Instead of Jung-ha, we'll be joined by…

48
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,834
-That's amazing.
-No way.

49
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,934
-Hello.
-My goodness.

50
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:06,133
-Hello.
-My goodness.

51
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,700
All right.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,133
-My goodness.
-All right.

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,600
-Welcome, YEONJUN.
-Hello.

54
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,166
-All right.
-Hello.

55
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:19,800
BTS' LITTLE BROTHER GROUP, TXT,
TOPS THE BILLBOARD 200 CHART

56
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,233
-Welcome, YEONJUN.
-Hello.

57
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,533
-All right.
-Hello.

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,667
YEONJUN.

59
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,233
Na-ra, have you met him before?

60
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,367
-It's our first time meeting.
-That's right.

61
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,633
-Hey.
-Nice to meet you.

62
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,800
-What was that?
-Why did you say his name so casually?

63
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:42,734
You pretended to know him.

64
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,834
I was happy to see his bare hands.

65
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,400
We're the only ones with bare hands.

66
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,266
It's okay. You should wear them.

67
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,900
-He pulled the gloves back right away.
-He's something else.

68
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:55,000
-I know.
-You must be cold. Your clothes are thin.

69
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:58,367
-Today, the backdrop is the '70s.
-Okay.

70
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:00,400
-The '70s?
-Okay.

71
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:02,800
-Do they know anything about that era?
-The '70s.

72
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,667
I was born in 1999.

73
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,233
-You were born in 1999.
-Yes.

74
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,367
-You were born in 1999?
-Yes, I was.

75
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:10,633
-You were born in 1999.
-Yes.

76
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,333
At least you were born
in the 20th century.

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,467
That's right.

78
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,100
It must be the one on the left.

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,300
It's called Maple Apartments.

80
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:26,467
What's this?

81
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,266
-Smuggling…
-A large group of North Korean spies…

82
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,867
Criminals of violent crimes…

83
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:35,633
A mop-up operation
on social evils has begun.

84
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,433
It's fascinating.

85
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,834
-Is it fascinating?
-Yes.

86
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:53,233
Everyone must be cold.

87
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,000
-What?
-That startled me.

88
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,900
-What? What's happening?
-That startled me.

89
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:59,033
I just need earmuffs now. What?

90
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,867
-What?
-What? What's happening?

91
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,233
-What are you doing?
-What?

92
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,667
-What's going on?
-What?

93
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:05,033
-Me?
-What?

94
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:07,400
What's going on?

95
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:09,567
What's going on?

96
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,767
What? Me?

97
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:14,433
Me? Do I need to be blindfolded? Why?

98
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,867
-But my makeup looks nice today.
-My eyelashes.

99
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,000
-I'm scared.
-Hold on.

100
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,900
-We got separated from YEONJUN right away.
-Slow down. I'm scared.

101
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:27,900
YEONJUN.

102
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,200
-JENNIE.
-Na-ra, I'm scared.

103
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:32,900
-JENNIE, where are they dragging you?
-Na-ra, I'm so scared.

104
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,100
You didn't explain what we were doing.

105
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,500
You didn't explain what we were doing.

106
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:42,767
Hold on. What's this?

107
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,533
-The raised entrance.
-The entrance?

108
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,900
How much is it raised?

109
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:49,567
It's-- You can put your foot down.

110
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,700
Jae-seok, save me.

111
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,800
There's a chair. You can sit down now.

112
00:05:57,867 --> 00:05:59,533
-Here?
-A chair.

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
-I sat on a chair. It's warm.
-Once more.

114
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,333
-What's this?
-What's this?

115
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,834
What's this?

116
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,000
My goodness.

117
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,000
Jae-seok.

118
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,333
What awaits us today?

119
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:19,166
Why did we get separated today?

120
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,500
"Become the cane of the people."

121
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:38,367
Is today's episode a police special?

122
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,734
BECOME THE CANE OF THE PEOPLE!

123
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,767
"Mayor"?

124
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:47,700
A WORKER FOR A LIVABLE CITY!

125
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:51,734
I'm a customs official.

126
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,967
THE HONEST
AND INCORRUPTIBLE NATION!

127
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,734
"Trader"? What's this?

128
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,066
TRADER

129
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,100
What's going on?

130
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,433
TRADER

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,033
Was this here before?

132
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,533
-What's this?
-"Trader"? What's this?

133
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,667
What's this?

134
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,667
Should I watch it?

135
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:18,333
What? It's an old commercial.

136
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,867
Little brother, you eat
The Nongshim ramyeon first

137
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:24,033
-Big brother first.
-Big brother first. Little brother first.

138
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,700
I remember this commercial. Oh, no.

139
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,500
-Gu Bong-seo and Kwak Kyu-seok.
-I know it.

140
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:29,133
Nongshim ramyeon

141
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,967
-What ramyeon?
-What ramyeon?

142
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,066
BEEF RAMYEON

143
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,266
"Root out social evil."

144
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,834
Is this the '70s?

145
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,033
Hurry up and throw it!

146
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,200
Isn't that smuggling?

147
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:56,834
It's smuggling.

148
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,667
The government identified
smuggling, tax evasion, illegal lumbering,

149
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,467
drugs, and violence

150
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:05,333
as the five social evils
that impede modernization

151
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,567
and began dedicating all efforts
into eradicating them.

152
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,400
Today's episode is about smuggling.

153
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:12,900
That's right.

154
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:15,700
There are criminals
among the 30 million citizens

155
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:18,433
who smuggle goods for personal gain.

156
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,934
There are criminals
among the 30 million citizens…

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,033
-What was that?
-…who smuggle goods for personal gain.

158
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,967
"One Western cigarette is okay."

159
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:31,867
-If that's what you think…
-It was called the Western cigarette.

160
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:33,533
It was prohibited.

161
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,834
Coffee. Was coffee not allowed?

162
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,533
Was coffee smuggled back then?

163
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,000
Smugglers should see
the error of their ways

164
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:45,367
and accompany the great journey
to economic independence.

165
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,133
Smuggling.

166
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:53,633
So smugglers are running rampant here.

167
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,600
Operations to eradicate smuggling
are taking place.

168
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,367
They're the selfish individuals
who smuggle goods for personal gain.

169
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,533
I'm the cane of the people, right?

170
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,633
I need to catch them, right?

171
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,100
This is scary.

172
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,500
-"Let's begin the labor"?
-So I need to work.

173
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,233
"Let's begin the labor"?

174
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,667
Testing, testing.

175
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:33,133
All members, please come outside.

176
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:38,433
All members, please come outside.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,533
Mr. Security Guard.

178
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,767
-Mr. Security Guard.
-Please come outside.

179
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,400
Hello.

180
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,367
Mister.

181
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,967
-What's this?
-Seriously. What's this?

182
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,200
Is this a construction site?

183
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:52,800
-All right.
-What's this?

184
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:58,633
What's this?

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,734
-The scale is no joke, right?
-Yes, it's no joke.

186
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,433
This is Apartment404.

187
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,633
-What's this?
-What?

188
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
-How cute. There's a set.
-What?

189
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:23,233
What could this be?

190
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,333
I hear something.

191
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:29,100
-Look over there.
-Na-ra.

192
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,433
It's Saemaul Undong.

193
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,100
Look over there.

194
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,100
Na-ra.

195
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,600
-It's Saemaul Undong.
-I can't believe it.

196
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:39,567
What's this?

197
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,166
Why do I know this song?

198
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:42,533
-You do, right?
-I know it.

199
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,200
Hey, this song…

200
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:47,734
The morning bell has rung
And a new day has begun

201
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,967
We can sing along.

202
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:51,934
-And a new day has begun
-And a new day has begun

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,300
-Let us rise
-Let us rise

204
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,834
-I know this song.
-And build a new village

205
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,066
-My livable
-What?

206
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:02,333
Isn't that Woo-il?

207
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,567
Is that Woo-il?

208
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,500
Congratulations.

209
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,000
You've been invited to Saemaul Plan.

210
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:15,233
Why was his voice distorted?
We can see his face clearly.

211
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,333
This is the Maple Apartment
construction site.

212
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:28,734
Firstly, you'll be divided into teams.

213
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:32,667
They will be Team Traders
and Team Public Officials.

214
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,467
-Two teams.
-It's a team competition.

215
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,567
I want to be a public official.

216
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:39,233
-Team Traders consists of Se-chan…
-Me.

217
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,934
…Na-ra, and YEONJUN.

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,166
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

219
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:46,433
Team Public Officials consist

220
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,066
-of Mayor Jae-seok…
-I'm the mayor?

221
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,567
…Police JENNIE,

222
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:51,734
-and Customs Official Tae-hyun.
-Police?

223
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,166
Jae-seok!

224
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,166
I'm the mayor.

225
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,734
-Hey.
-We're a team.

226
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,500
-I'm the mayor.
-Mr. Mayor.

227
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,300
-I'm the mayor.
-You're the mayor?

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,033
The secret of the apartment
will be revealed

229
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,533
when you complete the bingo board
with 25 squares in front of you.

230
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,500
-The bingo board.
-We need to complete it.

231
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:22,233
There are 25 spaces

232
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,400
with various sums of money and conditions.

233
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:28,600
Once the construction
of the Maple Apartments begins

234
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:32,000
you'll have six hours
until the end of construction.

235
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,767
If all 25 spaces get filled,

236
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,133
Team Traders will win.

237
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,000
-All of them.
-We must fill them.

238
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:41,400
-The team that fills more…
-All of these spaces.

239
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:45,033
If Team Traders is stopped

240
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,767
and fails to fill all 25 spaces in time,

241
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,667
Team Public Officials will win.

242
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:52,667
-We stop them.
-We're the ones

243
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:53,800
-who stop them.
-Yes.

244
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:56,700
-We need to stop you guys.
-We're confident.

245
00:12:56,767 --> 00:13:01,100
Team Traders will find the items
near the apartment complex

246
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,433
that match the conditions
of the bingo spaces.

247
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,800
An item with a name
I can say correctly five times.

248
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:08,700
Choco Pie.

249
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,033
Choco Pie, Choco Pie.

250
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
All right. Choco Pie.

251
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,367
Once you get a pass
from the public official,

252
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:19,300
you can win the allotted money.

253
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,500
-You need to find something.
-Yes.

254
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,533
We need to bring these items.

255
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,900
If the customs official

256
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,667
finds an item
that doesn't match the condition,

257
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:32,834
he will fine you 10,000 won
and send the item back.

258
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,367
How nice.

259
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,233
What should I do?

260
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,667
It's 10,000 won.

261
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:42,400
If Team Traders gets caught

262
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:45,066
by the police or the mayor…

263
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,400
they must pay a fine of 10,000 won
and return the item.

264
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,367
Thank you.

265
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:56,100
…they must pay a fine of 10,000 won
and return the item.

266
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,633
This is…

267
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,900
-Gosh.
-They'll take all the money.

268
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:05,433
I forgot to share
the most important detail.

269
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,867
The members of the winning team

270
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:10,800
will receive the actual money

271
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,600
they collected throughout the mission.

272
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,900
-Gosh, that's incredible.
-Ten times?

273
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,266
Ten times?

274
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,166
-Oh, yes.
-That's nice.

275
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,834
Among the members of the losing team,

276
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,233
the one who collected the most money

277
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:30,000
will receive it in cash.

278
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:32,700
My goodness.

279
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:33,900
-It's an individual game.
-Yes.

280
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:37,000
-This one is.
-It's both a team and individual game.

281
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:40,567
The game will begin with a siren.

282
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:44,033
I ask you to join forces and work hard.

283
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,066
This game is totally…

284
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:52,066
-My goodness.
-It's grand.

285
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,600
The scale is on another level.

286
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,500
-You've heard the rules.
-Yes.

287
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,800
Since you're bad at explaining,
they film it ahead of time now.

288
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,000
Well done.

289
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,433
I'll catch you.

290
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,734
I won't get caught.

291
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:10,767
We need to put them on, right?

292
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:12,266
Yes, put the armbands on.

293
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,533
The apartment will be built now.

294
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,300
Na-ra, put on the gloves.

295
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:19,700
-I brought them.
-Did you bring them?

296
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,500
Na-ra, wear these string-knit gloves.

297
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,300
-It's okay.
-These are warmer.

298
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:25,767
-Give them here.
-It's okay.

299
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,867
-These are warmer.
-For goodness' sake.

300
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:29,467
You're making my heart flutter.

301
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,700
I'm okay with these.
You should wear warm gloves.

302
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,734
-Are you flirting?
-Don't be ridiculous.

303
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:38,100
Just because I gave Na-ra these gloves,
she went, "Are you flirting?"

304
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,500
-You're flirting, you punk.
-No.

305
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:41,633
You should wear warm gloves.

306
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,500
-Don't go for a difficult love.
-Okay.

307
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,633
"Don't go for a difficult love."

308
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,667
You're pretending to be in your thirties.

309
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:50,066
Don't go for a painful love.

310
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,433
I'll give you 100,000 won each.

311
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,734
One, two…

312
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,100
-I'll catch them nonstop.
-…three, four…

313
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,033
That's how we make money.

314
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,300
-Yes.
-We're confident. Today,

315
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,667
we have the quick YEONJUN

316
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:08,400
-and the cunning Se-chan.
-Yes.

317
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,133
Looking forward to working with you.

318
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,300
-Okay.
-Nice to meet you.

319
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:14,667
-I'll make a lot of money today.
-Okay.

320
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,600
-Let's go.
-Let's do this.

321
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,300
-Do well, YEONJUN.
-See you soon.

322
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:20,633
-Let's go.
-Na-ra, let's go.

323
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,900
They can't catch me.

324
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,033
"An item you can ride."

325
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:36,233
A traffic cone. I can ride it.

326
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,467
I can't ride it.

327
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,967
You can run well, right?

328
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,533
I'm pretty quick.

329
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:53,066
Tiger's energy, come to me.

330
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:55,467
Mount Suri's energy.

331
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,834
Ride the bike around
and chase the traders.

332
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:00,934
Let JENNIE ride on the back.

333
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:03,533
-Okay. There you go.
-Okay.

334
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,533
-Let's go.
-Team Public Officials, let's go.

335
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,834
For round one,
the time limit is 20 minutes.

336
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,300
-It begins now.
-Here we go.

337
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:12,633
-Let's go.
-Now…

338
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,734
-Here she comes. Na-ra.
-Here she comes.

339
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,700
-Here comes a trader.
-Hey.

340
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,467
My goodness.

341
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,533
-I haven't even gotten started.
-What?

342
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,400
You got a bicycle?

343
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:28,133
We'll walk around as well.
Let's keep it here for now.

344
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:31,166
I'm innocent. I don't have anything on me.

345
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:34,000
-Don't you have something?
-Have a good day.

346
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:37,000
-Don't you have something? Okay.
-No. The round just started.

347
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:39,567
-Have a good day.
-Hold on. I need to find Se-chan.

348
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:43,700
Okay. Gosh, there's a rice cooker.

349
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,767
What's the brand?

350
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,200
I bet it's 40 years old.

351
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,000
Was this made in Korea?

352
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:55,066
MADE IN KOREA

353
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:58,600
Hold on. I won't take this one. Hold on.

354
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,367
A spicy item. A shiny item.
An item that can hold food.

355
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:04,100
An item that can hold food, 50,000 won.
Here it is.

356
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,834
Can I take two items at once? Just one?

357
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,367
-Okay.
-I'll put it on.

358
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,033
I can go now, right? Let's go.

359
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,600
So this is how it works.

360
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Hold on.

361
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:27,967
Let's look for the hidden items.

362
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,700
An item that's 10 to 15 kg?
I don't think so.

363
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,200
An item you can hold with one hand
for ten seconds or longer?

364
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,433
Two, three, four,

365
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,667
five, six, seven, eight…

366
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:46,667
I can do it.

367
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,567
What? It's JENNIE.

368
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,767
I feel like I'm going to school.

369
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,834
Hello.

370
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:20,533
I see that you're holding something.

371
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:24,567
Se-chan, you have the delivery sticker.
Let's go.

372
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,200
Let's run.

373
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,433
-JENNIE, hold on.
-Okay. Let's talk.

374
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,967
JENNIE, stay there.

375
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:35,166
I don't care
if my team wins or loses today.

376
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,967
Gosh, you startled me.

377
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,100
I don't care
if my team wins or loses today.

378
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:43,834
Gosh, you startled me.

379
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,734
YEONJUN is running.

380
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,467
Hey!

381
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:55,433
Gosh, his legs are too long.

382
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:57,600
Gosh.

383
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,767
-What?
-Hey, YEONJUN.

384
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,633
Hey, YEONJUN.

385
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,600
Come here.

386
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,333
Oh, no.

387
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,767
Even if you run,
you won't have anywhere to go.

388
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,633
Running won't get you far.

389
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,533
I'll hide my legs behind the wheel.

390
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,367
-Come here.
-Jae-seok.

391
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,467
-Come here.
-Jae-seok.

392
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,700
Jae-seok.

393
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,066
Come here.

394
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:41,800
Come here, YEONJUN.

395
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:45,300
-Jae-seok.
-Come here.

396
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,300
It's 10,000 won.

397
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,867
-Come here.
-Jae-seok, why are you so fast?

398
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,867
YEONJUN, come here. It's 10,000 won.

399
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,433
You're too fast.

400
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,567
Let's go.

401
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,800
Let's run.

402
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:02,867
-Watch the stairs.
-No.

403
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,300
-JENNIE.
-Se-chan, the stairs.

404
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:06,834
I can't run because of the stairs.
Hold on.

405
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,033
Hurry up.

406
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,633
At this rate, I won't even get ten won.

407
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,867
-Okay.
-Stay there.

408
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:17,800
-I'll stay here.
-Let me go.

409
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:20,667
Once I earn money with this, I'll give you

410
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:21,867
-10,000 won.
-Give me 30,000 won.

411
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,800
-Right now?
-I'll let you go.

412
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,233
-You want 30,000 won now?
-Yes.

413
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,667
-But…
-Then I won't chase after you again.

414
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:29,133
-Listen.
-It's a toll.

415
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,367
This is worth 50,000 won.

416
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:32,433
If you let me go,
I'll give you 10,000 won.

417
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,066
Come on. I can tap you and get 10,000 won.

418
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,367
-You can't catch me.
-Se-chan.

419
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,133
I did Pilates.

420
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:42,133
Hey, make up your mind.
If you want 10,000 won, let me go now.

421
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,600
-Make it 20,000 won.
-Okay.

422
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,266
What? I can't make it 20,000 won.

423
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,800
Give me 20,000 won and run.

424
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:48,433
-Jae-seok is over there.
-Where?

425
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
He went to catch YEONJUN.

426
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,700
-Exactly, JENNIE.
-You need to run away.

427
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:56,800
The item is worth 50,000 won.
Give me 20,000 won and go.

428
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:59,033
Give me 20,000 won and go.

429
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:01,867
I can't give you 20,000 won.
I might get caught.

430
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:04,133
-Hurry up.
-I'd hand over 20,000 won and run.

431
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
Forget it. I'll run.

432
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:07,133
-I'll run.
-I'll catch you.

433
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,633
-I'm ready.
-Okay.

434
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,400
I'll run at full speed.

435
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:13,600
Then I'll catch you
before you start running.

436
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,300
Stop it.

437
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,033
Let's run.

438
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,734
You're going that way?

439
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:21,967
Let's avoid JENNIE.

440
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:26,133
Se-chan, hold on.

441
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,266
The mayor put a sandbag on you.

442
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:31,133
-What? A sandbag?
-Okay. Nice.

443
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,467
Also, the mayor can use
one of the two policies.

444
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:40,467
He can put a sandbag on one trader.

445
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,700
Then it'll be harder to run.

446
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:43,867
The mayor has it the best.

447
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:46,467
Hey, I have it the best.

448
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,533
-Yang Se-chan.
-Okay.

449
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,633
All right, YEONJUN.

450
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,867
Hold on. Stay away.

451
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:55,800
-Come here.
-I need to put on a sandbag.

452
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:56,967
Go ahead and put it on.

453
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,867
-She keeps asking…
-Jae-seok.

454
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:00,667
-…for bribes.
-That isn't true.

455
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:03,000
I tried to catch him, but he ran away.

456
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,133
-Did you arrest him?
-No.

457
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,166
-I arrested him.
-What's this?

458
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,500
They were putting a sandbag on me.

459
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:13,533
Give me 10,000 won. Come on.

460
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,700
Se-chan, I gave you a chance earlier.

461
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,300
-JENNIE.
-Give me 10,000 won.

462
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,767
I'll go and catch someone else.

463
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,333
Where are the traders?

464
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,734
-Mr. Mayor.
-Yes?

465
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,400
-I'll help you make money.
-Okay.

466
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,934
So please leave me be, okay?

467
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:35,367
I'll give you 20,000 won.
It's a good deal for you.

468
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:36,834
Did I give you 30,000 won?

469
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,967
-It's 20,000 won.
-Yes.

470
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,667
-I…
-Leave me be.

471
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:44,834
I won't put a sandbag on you.
I'll put it on YEONJUN.

472
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,600
-Okay. Do that.
-For an additional 10,000 won.

473
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,266
-You're a thief.
-Give me more money.

474
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,700
-I'm wearing it.
-No.

475
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:51,934
-Listen.
-I promise you this.

476
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
If I make 50,000 won with this item,

477
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,433
I'll give you your share in secret.

478
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,900
-Is that so?
-JENNIE asked for money too.

479
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,934
Give me 20,000 won and go.

480
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,834
-Okay. Go.
-Let me make money first.

481
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,700
-Pretend you didn't see me.
-I'll let you go.

482
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:11,400
-Loyalty.
-Okay.

483
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:13,700
-To an honest and incorruptible nation.
-Okay.

484
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:14,800
Hello, sir.

485
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:17,500
-Is that for me? Let's get started.
-Yes.

486
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:18,567
-Here.
-Let's see it.

487
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:22,433
-It's an item that can hold food.
-An item that can hold food.

488
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,100
-Take a look.
-An item that can hold food.

489
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:29,000
Usually, I give it a pass
only when there's food inside.

490
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:30,800
That's right. Do you know what's inside?

491
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:33,133
My love is inside.

492
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,433
-I need to check.
-That's right.

493
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,700
If there's no food…

494
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,033
If there's no food,
I can't give it a pass.

495
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,600
Come on. Take a look inside.

496
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:44,800
-There's no food inside.
-My goodness.

497
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:45,934
I put something inside.

498
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,867
Without food, how am I supposed to know
if it's a food container?

499
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:50,700
There it is. Take it.

500
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:52,700
Put it in your pocket.

501
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,900
It's clearly an item
that can hold food.

502
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,934
There it is. Take it.
Put it in your pocket.

503
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,700
It's clearly an item
that can hold food.

504
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:03,667
-Okay.
-All right.

505
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:05,934
-All right.
-This is…

506
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,333
This is better than food.

507
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:10,600
-Pass.
-To an incorruptible nation.

508
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:11,734
-Loyalty.
-Incorruptibility.

509
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,133
-Pass.
-Pass.

510
00:25:13,633 --> 00:25:15,467
What else should I bring?

511
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:16,967
All right.

512
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:18,533
-Thank you.
-Okay.

513
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,600
Take care.

514
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,133
-Did you put on the sticker by mistake?
-Yes, I did.

515
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,166
Let's talk. What are you looking for?

516
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,967
I just want to take a stroll.

517
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:31,133
Wasn't there an item with a name
you needed to say correctly five times?

518
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,900
-I believe it was worth 30,000 won.
-Oh, was there?

519
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,500
I'm not sure.

520
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,600
This is my first time. Gosh.

521
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:40,233
This is my first time. Gosh.

522
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,467
-Do you know what it is?
-I get it now.

523
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:45,133
-Do you know what it is?
-Yes, I do.

524
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,166
-You know…
-Yes.

525
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:49,000
I can sell this.

526
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,900
An item with a name
you can say correctly five times.

527
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:54,633
Popeye, Popeye.

528
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
Okay. This is good.

529
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:58,467
Let's see.

530
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:01,400
Hold on. How much is it worth?

531
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:04,233
-It's worth 20,000 won.
-I see.

532
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,467
Don't you want to buy it for 10,000 won?

533
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,500
Don't you want to buy it for 10,000 won?

534
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,800
-For 10,000 won?
-Yes.

535
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:12,567
-It's 10,000 won.
-Oh, no.

536
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:15,400
-Let's split the profits too.
-The profits too?

537
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:17,700
Should I give you 10,000 won then?

538
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:20,200
-No, you should give me 30,000 won.
-30,000 won?

539
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:22,266
-Just now…
-No.

540
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,800
-Look. There are no people.
-Okay.

541
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:26,700
If you run over to customs,
you'll get 20,000 won for it.

542
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:31,700
Okay. I admit that 30,000 won is hefty.

543
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:33,900
-So it's 10,000 won.
-Yes. I'll give it to you.

544
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,233
I'm being generous
because I'm tender-hearted.

545
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
All right.

546
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,066
-Did you put on the sticker?
-What?

547
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,533
Hold on.

548
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,467
-Are you serious?
-You must put it on.

549
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:48,433
Should I go after putting it on?

550
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,066
-Okay.
-Put it on.

551
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,767
Put it on.

552
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,500
Yes.

553
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:01,567
Yes.

554
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:03,367
You need to pay a fine of 10,000 won.

555
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:06,233
It has to be done.

556
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,934
-JENNIE.
-I'm sorry. I feel bad.

557
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,300
I tasted the bitterness of life.

558
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:11,467
It's 10,000 won.

559
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:14,266
JENNIE, seriously.

560
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,600
-I'm sorry.
-JENNIE.

561
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,133
This is my fourth week on the show,
so I've changed.

562
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,367
So this is how it's done.

563
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:22,100
Yes. This makes my heart ache too.

564
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,000
-Understood.
-Okay.

565
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:27,200
I'm sorry. I must take this as well.
Gosh, I feel so bad.

566
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:29,667
I have something to do over there.

567
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:30,900
Take care.

568
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,333
See you later.

569
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:40,000
-There's money all over the place.
-It's all over the place.

570
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:42,333
It's so easy to earn money.

571
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:44,800
-What a place.
-Seriously.

572
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:48,467
-There's money all over the place.
-It's all over the place.

573
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,500
You earned a lot of money.

574
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,467
Hey, you earned a lot of money.

575
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:58,433
-What?
-What's this sound?

576
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:00,867
What's this?

577
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,066
-What's this?
-Will ghosts come out?

578
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,734
What's this?

579
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
-What?
-Maybe the typhoon is a clue.

580
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:17,800
Is that the sound of wind?

581
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:20,967
Is there something
behind the current mission?

582
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:25,066
…who smuggle goods for personal gain.

583
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:27,734
Such social evils will have no place
in people's lives.

584
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,367
Is there a secret?

585
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,700
With one hand?

586
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:44,166
All right. There'll be an inspection.

587
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:46,633
These money-grubbers are driving me crazy.

588
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,667
Let me make money.

589
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:49,567
How much is it worth?

590
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:51,367
It's worth 30,000 won.
I'll pay 10,000 won.

591
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:55,433
Jae-seok, JENNIE will definitely run
toward me, so please stop her.

592
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,934
-Okay.
-I'll pay you later.

593
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,100
-Here's 10,000 won.
-Okay.

594
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,166
That's mine.

595
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:03,066
-Give me that too.
-Then I won't have anything left.

596
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:04,433
-Please stop JENNIE.
-Okay.

597
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,333
Please stop her.

598
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:10,967
Then I won't have anything left.

599
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:13,300
-Please stop JENNIE.
-Okay.

600
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:17,600
-In any case…
-Jae-seok.

601
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,166
-In any case, we help…
-Jae-seok.

602
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:20,767
-…each other.
-What's in your bag?

603
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:23,166
-JENNIE. You're--
-Mr. Mayor.

604
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,233
Hold on to her.

605
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,667
Okay.

606
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:35,233
All right.

607
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,900
In any case, we have to help each other.

608
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:40,300
-Mr. Mayor.
-Listen.

609
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:42,066
-You disappoint me.
-JENNIE.

610
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:43,533
I expected better when I voted for you.

611
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,367
We help each other.

612
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:47,834
-And this is the '70s.
-Okay.

613
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,567
-You didn't become mayor via an election.
-Really?

614
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:54,133
Mayors were appointed by the government.

615
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,767
This was before the local governments.

616
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:58,734
You need to know
the historical background.

617
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,233
So I wasn't elected by the people.

618
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,633
I see. I understand.

619
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:06,700
To an honest and incorruptible nation.

620
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:08,000
Incorruptibility.

621
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:10,633
-Hello.
-Okay.

622
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,734
Mr. Customs Official.

623
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,100
Sticking money there
isn't very incorruptible.

624
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,700
This isn't money. It's decoration.

625
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,500
You don't need to see anything else.

626
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,333
Just look at the green bill.

627
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,300
It's an item I can hold with one hand.

628
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:27,000
-What? An item you can hold with one hand?
-I can do it for ten seconds.

629
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:27,900
Let's see it.

630
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:33,000
It's a piece of cake.
I can do it for a minute.

631
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:34,533
Mr. Customs Official.

632
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,266
The bill is too heavy.
You should remove it.

633
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,166
I'm not sure if it's enough.

634
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,033
-It's light.
-It's too light.

635
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,767
Is that so?

636
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:50,300
Mr. Customs Official,
you're out of control.

637
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:54,333
Hold on. Who's there?
I think someone came.

638
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,967
Who came? Who is it?

639
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:59,166
My goodness, must you ask?
It's another 10,000-won bill.

640
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,233
Hold it for ten seconds.

641
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,934
All right.

642
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,800
-Pass.
-Pass.

643
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,100
Incorruptibility.

644
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,100
Taste it.

645
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:13,200
You're good, Se-chan.

646
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:14,700
It's nothing.

647
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:18,300
Here's 30,000 won.

648
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:20,333
-Please fill it.
-It's 30,000 won.

649
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:25,300
You need to play it.

650
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:28,066
-Even if you include a bribe…
-I'll show you. Hold on.

651
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:32,133
-Time is ticking.
-Okay.

652
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,367
-Mr. Customs Official, I'll play it.
-You need to play it.

653
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,767
-An item that can be played.
-I'll play it.

654
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:39,633
-Let's see if you can play it.
-Please watch.

655
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,600
I can hear it.

656
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:46,266
I can hear it.

657
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,900
How strange. I see that it can be played.

658
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:54,266
I didn't know that it was
a musical instrument.

659
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,333
I see that it can be played.

660
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:03,567
-You're good.
-I see that it works.

661
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:04,834
-Is it a pass?
-Pass.

662
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,600
Pass! Thank you.

663
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,533
It can be played.

664
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,467
I didn't know such a thing existed.

665
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,000
I'll be back. Good luck.

666
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,300
Good luck.

667
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:21,433
What's up with that?

668
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,567
-What's that?
-It's strange, right?

669
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:25,500
-Is the LED screen broken?
-It's strange.

670
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:27,433
-It's broken.
-It is?

671
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,633
-But it shows clouds.
-Right?

672
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,533
It disappeared.

673
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,367
-I completed that space earlier.
-What?

674
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,066
What?

675
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:38,700
-Is it an actual dog?
-No.

676
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,467
What's up with the crow sounds?

677
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,100
-We keep hearing noises.
-I heard the wind.

678
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,667
This time, it's the sound
of a dog barking.

679
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,667
Wind and barking sounds.

680
00:32:58,233 --> 00:33:00,367
-Is there a secret?
-I don't know.

681
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,900
I…

682
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:06,800
What's that?

683
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,100
I still have 100,000 won.

684
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,100
YEONJUN, why do you have 100,000 won?

685
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,066
-Tae-hyun is no joke.
-I lost a lot of money.

686
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:16,100
Tae-hyun has 100,000 won.

687
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:18,734
How did that happen?

688
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,700
-YEONJUN, you did well.
-Seriously.

689
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,066
I thought I was doing the worst.

690
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:27,333
-What did I do?
-I ran diligently.

691
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,433
Only two.

692
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,834
How much was it worth?

693
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,567
-I'm at the bottom.
-I need to be more strict.

694
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:36,734
-It's time for lunch.
-Okay.

695
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,567
Let's first play the Bucket Game
for a hint.

696
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:40,467
-Okay.
-Okay.

697
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,000
All right. The Bucket Game.

698
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:02,467
The game involves moving ingredients
from the second floor to the first floor.

699
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,133
From there to here?

700
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,033
The member on the first floor
will describe the needed ingredients.

701
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,133
The member on the second floor
will find the ingredients

702
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,333
that match the description.

703
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,834
Then the ingredients will be put
into a bucket and sent to the first floor.

704
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,200
-Okay.
-It's cute.

705
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:23,767
Here's what you will do
with the ingredients.

706
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,567
You'll make a dish.

707
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:30,734
So you shouldn't let the other team send
the right ingredients.

708
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:33,467
The defense will be on both floors

709
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:36,633
where they will use various tools
to keep the opposing team

710
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,266
from communicating
the ingredients clearly.

711
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,633
It'll bring good cheer.

712
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,400
The results will be determined
by the quality of the dish.

713
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,633
The offense should send
the correct ingredients,

714
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,333
and the defense should make them send
the wrong ingredients.

715
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,600
Here it comes.

716
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:04,033
-Let's make gimbap. Gimbap sounds good.
-Yes.

717
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,033
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

718
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,300
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

719
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:12,200
Let's begin.

720
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:14,066
I'm the one who's cooking.

721
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:17,100
-Tae-hyun, can you hear me?
-Yes.

722
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,834
-Can you hear me?
-Yes.

723
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,633
Although you can hear her now…

724
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:25,367
As if it's your last

725
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:28,667
You can't stand so close to me.

726
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,200
I'll push you away.

727
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:34,000
As if it's your last

728
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,133
For goodness' sake.

729
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,533
He's a singer and I'm a musical actor.

730
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,967
Ready, set--

731
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:44,633
Se-chan, play the music!

732
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,066
Play the music.

733
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:50,033
Yes!

734
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:02,300
It lives in the sea.

735
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:04,767
It lives in the sea.

736
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:06,734
Hey.

737
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,266
It lives in the sea.

738
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:21,967
It isn't a fish.

739
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:25,934
It lives in the sea.

740
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,567
It isn't a fish.

741
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:35,934
Time's up. Stop.

742
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,867
-Okay.
-Time's up.

743
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:40,033
Mister, please stop now.

744
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
She got it.

745
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:46,433
I know what it is.

746
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,300
I have a hunch.

747
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,200
-Here it comes.
-Okay.

748
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,667
-Here it comes.
-Here it comes.

749
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:00,333
What?

750
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,066
We got seaweed.

751
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,600
-Seaweed?
-Seaweed.

752
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
Why did you give us seaweed?

753
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:11,400
Something that lives in the sea
and isn't a fish.

754
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:14,100
Why did she give us seaweed?

755
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,834
Did she get it wrong?

756
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,600
Why did you take this role
if you couldn't shout?

757
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,900
Jae-seok, she can't hear me
because of them.

758
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:30,633
I'll do it this time.

759
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,667
What's next? We need ham.

760
00:37:35,734 --> 00:37:36,934
How do I describe it?

761
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,834
-Tuna?
-Let's begin.

762
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,600
Ready, go.

763
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,967
The sea.

764
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,300
The emperor of the sea.

765
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,467
What?

766
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,867
The emperor of the sea.

767
00:37:54,934 --> 00:37:57,533
-The emperor of the sea.
-The fruit of the sea.

768
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,433
A fish.

769
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,900
The emperor of the sea.

770
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:03,233
-The emperor.
-The fruit of the sea.

771
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:05,700
The fruit of the sea.

772
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:07,367
The fruit of the sea?

773
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:09,033
It can't be dried pollack.

774
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,900
Anchovies?

775
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:12,667
The fruit of the sea.

776
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:17,100
Five, four, three…

777
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:20,967
-Five, four, three…
-The emperor of the sea?

778
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,567
-Hold on.
-One.

779
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,633
-Send it down.
-Come over here.

780
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,867
Hurry up.

781
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:31,266
-What's the emperor of the sea?
-There you go.

782
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:33,500
Hold on. Is there more?

783
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:35,800
-That's it.
-I think it's anchovies.

784
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:38,066
-Anchovies?
-Not this one. Yes.

785
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:43,800
-All right. Here it comes.
-Hold on.

786
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:45,734
-Hold on. No.
-JENNIE…

787
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,934
-No!
-JENNIE…

788
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,633
-Hold on. No.
-JENNIE…

789
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,000
-No!
-JENNIE…

790
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:51,700
-Here it comes.
-No!

791
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:54,333
-Here it comes. JENNIE chose it.
-Here it comes.

792
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,900
-Here it comes.
-What is it?

793
00:38:58,834 --> 00:38:59,767
What is it?

794
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:02,467
-For goodness' sake.
-The emperor of the sea.

795
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:04,433
How is anchovy the emperor of the sea?

796
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,367
-Anchovies.
-Anchovies.

797
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:09,667
-For goodness' sake.
-JENNIE chose anchovies.

798
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:11,734
-I'm so annoyed.
-Unbelievable.

799
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,934
-It's too late.
-Correct.

800
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,900
Se-chan, that punk.

801
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:18,633
What are we going to do?

802
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,533
We'll need to use the anchovies.

803
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,300
I'll get the eggs.

804
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:24,433
What should I do?

805
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:27,633
I started cooking the seaweed in water.

806
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,967
Well done.

807
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,166
Ready, set, go.

808
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:37,533
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

809
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,166
Egg. Cock-a-doodle-doo.

810
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:42,633
-Squid egg?
-Egg.

811
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,266
-Egg.
-Egg.

812
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:46,500
-Cock-a-doodle-doo.
-Squid egg.

813
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:48,800
Your voice is gone. Move out of the way.

814
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,200
Not ketchup.

815
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:55,600
Ketchup. Not ketchup.

816
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:59,133
Ketchup. Not ketchup.

817
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,266
Not ketchup.

818
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:15,367
Stop.

819
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:16,767
You couldn't hear it, right?

820
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,767
-Se-chan, seriously.
-Go, JENNIE.

821
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,333
I couldn't hear anything.
But it was pretty long.

822
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,166
"Naninanya." It was something like that.

823
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,800
"Ahneunyanya." It had four syllables.

824
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,066
Did he say, "Red cabbage"?

825
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,100
One, two-- Hurry up and send it down.

826
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,333
-I don't know.
-Hold on.

827
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,000
Is it coming down? What is it?

828
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:41,000
It's hooked.

829
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,967
He started counting, so I got whatever.

830
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:44,567
Let's go.

831
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:46,367
-What is it?
-What?

832
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,233
Blueberries?

833
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:52,900
Blueberries.

834
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,600
-We have to use it.
-It's a delicacy.

835
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,066
What are we making?

836
00:40:57,934 --> 00:41:01,667
-We have to do it.
-We have to use the ingredients.

837
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,633
-Let's switch places.
-Switch places?

838
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,900
-I can't listen to kkwaenggwari anymore.
-Go over there.

839
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,000
It was a kkwaenggwari hell.

840
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,033
Why does it keep changing?

841
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:22,100
I don't miss anything.

842
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,900
What? What's that?

843
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:27,033
The screen changed again.

844
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,767
There's something about it, Jae-seok.

845
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:32,967
-A picture is coming along.
-I think so.

846
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,467
A picture is coming along.

847
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,400
-What's this?
-Is there a secret?

848
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,867
There must be a twist.

849
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:50,834
-YEONJUN and Se-chan.
-Yes.

850
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,400
-Speak clearly with your mouth wide open.
-Okay.

851
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:56,100
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, I can.

852
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:57,433
All right.

853
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:02,333
It's so loud.

854
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:05,934
Tae-hyun, do you want to play it?

855
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,300
Western breakfast?

856
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:15,700
Shall I ask for milk?

857
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,800
-Let's begin.
-Milk.

858
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:20,133
Ready, go.

859
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,533
-Na-ra. Dairy cow.
-What?

860
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,667
A drink. Dairy cow.

861
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:28,867
Pachinko?

862
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:30,867
Hold on. I can't hear you.

863
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,233
-Rice wine?
-Moo.

864
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,300
Spam?

865
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:39,367
Dairy cow.

866
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:43,633
-Mouse.
-No gestures.

867
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,667
I'll open my ears.

868
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,300
-Open your nose.
-I'll open my ears.

869
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:52,500
Mice like it.

870
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:55,734
-Who likes it?
-Mice.

871
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,500
-Who likes it?
-Mice like it.

872
00:43:00,467 --> 00:43:01,934
Time's up.

873
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,967
Ten…

874
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,867
It was like an exorcism.

875
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:09,166
-All right.
-We were like…

876
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:11,934
-As we got into it…
-I can see it.

877
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,100
I can see it. I can see your future.

878
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:20,333
I can see your future.

879
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,600
I can see your future.

880
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:25,200
It's coming.

881
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:27,433
-It's coming.
-Right here,

882
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,433
-we're performing an exorcism.
-It's coming.

883
00:43:34,867 --> 00:43:38,100
-JENNIE, you're funny.
-Someone likes this ingredient.

884
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:40,033
-Mice like it?
-All right.

885
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,600
-Mice. Cheese.
-Cheese.

886
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:44,433
Hold on. Cheese.

887
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,000
Mice like it.

888
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:50,233
-YEONJUN.
-The ingredient mice like.

889
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,200
-What is it?
-It's coming.

890
00:43:53,266 --> 00:43:54,200
All right.

891
00:43:54,266 --> 00:43:55,700
Mice like it.

892
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:57,867
-That's right!
-Mice.

893
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:02,100
-That's right!
-Mice.

894
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,834
My goodness.

895
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,800
What?

896
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:06,967
Mice like it.

897
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:10,133
Mice like Cheese Sand.

898
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,734
-It's okay.
-Mice like Cheese Sand.

899
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,266
They're crackers with cheese filling.

900
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,800
For goodness' sake.

901
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:18,834
What's this?

902
00:44:19,934 --> 00:44:21,533
Isn't it correct?

903
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,400
-It's correct.
-Na-ra's hearing is bad.

904
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,133
How are we supposed to eat this?

905
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,700
Shall we ask for lettuce next?

906
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:35,200
It's easy.

907
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:37,166
Let's begin.

908
00:44:37,233 --> 00:44:39,033
It's coming.

909
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,700
-Ready, set, go.
-Let's go.

910
00:44:44,834 --> 00:44:47,133
-It's green.
-Green.

911
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,500
-Vegetable.
-Green.

912
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:49,600
Vegetable.

913
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:54,800
-Vegetable.
-A slicker.

914
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:02,033
Apartment404.

915
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,767
What will be the secret of the day?

916
00:45:08,767 --> 00:45:10,100
Vegetable.

917
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,533
Vegetable.

918
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,533
-Vegetable.
-Stop.

919
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,600
YEONJUN, it looks like you're very angry.

920
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:24,066
They're too loud.

921
00:45:24,133 --> 00:45:25,200
I can't hear anything.

922
00:45:25,967 --> 00:45:27,200
That's so funny.

923
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,834
They're too loud.

924
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,600
JENNIE, you're having so much fun.

925
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:36,533
You should try busking on the street.

926
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,433
-It suits you.
-I found a talent.

927
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:43,867
All right. Here it comes.

928
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:45,767
Here comes the answer.

929
00:45:47,066 --> 00:45:48,467
Will it be correct?

930
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,600
Green.

931
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:51,667
Na-ra.

932
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,800
Na-ra.

933
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:57,467
-It's green, but--
-Good.

934
00:45:57,533 --> 00:45:58,433
What is it?

935
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:00,633
-Perilla leaves.
-Perilla leaves.

936
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,667
Green.

937
00:46:01,734 --> 00:46:04,200
-Perilla leaves.
-Green.

938
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:07,300
Make wraps with them.

939
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,433
-Bread and perilla leaves.
-My goodness.

940
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,600
It'll be a fusion dish.

941
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:16,500
Na-ra's hearing is bad.

942
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:17,734
For goodness' sake.

943
00:46:20,033 --> 00:46:21,667
-Ham.
-What?

944
00:46:21,734 --> 00:46:23,867
-Gift set.
-What?

945
00:46:23,934 --> 00:46:26,600
-A round and red vegetable.
-A student.

946
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:27,700
Red.

947
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:31,300
Foreigners eat it instead of rice.

948
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:33,867
Instead of rice.

949
00:46:33,934 --> 00:46:35,200
No, I can't hear it.

950
00:46:36,266 --> 00:46:38,166
-What is it?
-Pineapple.

951
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:40,700
Seaweed bugak that's in
a Chuseok gift set.

952
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:41,767
What?

953
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,600
-Looks good.
-You have to eat it, right?

954
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:53,533
No.

955
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,100
-Yes.
-No.

956
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:58,700
-The more plausible one will win.
-Okay.

957
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:00,333
Gimbap won.

958
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,600
Why?

959
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:04,800
We added cheese-filled crackers
to our sandwich.

960
00:47:04,867 --> 00:47:06,900
-Pineapple.
-Blueberries don't suit gimbap.

961
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:10,233
-We made a dish with the ingredients.
-Yours didn't work.

962
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,300
-It's too bad.
-I know.

963
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,934
-Here it is.
-Did you find it?

964
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,133
Turn on the TV.

965
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,233
-Let's watch it.
-Let's watch it.

966
00:47:26,967 --> 00:47:28,000
Is it working?

967
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:34,500
In Korea, the economy will grow

968
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:36,166
and construction projects will come along.

969
00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:38,600
Seoul is changing day by day.

970
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:42,367
Bugak Skyway, which cuts
across Mount Bukhan, opened recently.

971
00:47:42,433 --> 00:47:44,066
Bugak Skyway.

972
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:46,066
I go there often.

973
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:49,266
-It was built in 1968.
-Really?

974
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:52,266
-It was built in 1968.
-Really?

975
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:55,000
That's right. Samil Overpass.
It has been demolished.

976
00:47:55,066 --> 00:47:57,400
The groundbreaking ceremony
for Namsan's second tunnel

977
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,700
took place
at the National Cultural Center.

978
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:04,700
On 245 acres of land,
housing for citizens without homes

979
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:07,734
is being constructed continuously
without any breaks.

980
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,300
Our economy will grow more rapidly.

981
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:15,433
If we live our lives
in a more relaxed way,

982
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,600
the society will show an improvement.

983
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,467
What?

984
00:48:20,533 --> 00:48:21,800
That's it?

985
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:23,233
Is that a hint?

986
00:48:24,433 --> 00:48:27,934
From the late '60s to the early '70s,

987
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,300
as the video showed…

988
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:31,700
-It's related to construction, right?
-Yes.

989
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:33,233
-That was what we heard.
-Yes.

990
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,667
I have no idea what this video means.

991
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:37,567
What were those sounds we heard?

992
00:48:37,633 --> 00:48:40,900
-We heard wind blowing. What was that?
-That's right.

993
00:48:40,967 --> 00:48:44,233
-And a barking dog.
-Barking. There were scary sounds.

994
00:48:45,033 --> 00:48:47,033
-What?
-What's this sound?

995
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:51,300
-What's this?
-Will ghosts come out?

996
00:48:52,467 --> 00:48:55,066
-What's up with the crow sounds?
-What?

997
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,867
…is being constructed continuously
without any breaks.

998
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,533
Perhaps it was
a corrupt construction project.

999
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,600
What's this?

1000
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:08,867
tvN?

1001
00:49:08,934 --> 00:49:10,333
-tvN?
-It's not tvN?

1002
00:49:12,233 --> 00:49:13,834
No, it isn't. It's YNT.

1003
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,734
-There's something here.
-You're right.

1004
00:49:20,133 --> 00:49:21,800
What's YNT?

1005
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,700
-TNY?
-YTN?

1006
00:49:24,767 --> 00:49:27,200
-Is it a news channel?
-YTN.

1007
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:34,533
-In any case, we're in the '70s.
-Yes, the '70s.

1008
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,700
We need to focus on that.

1009
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:38,767
-Construction.
-"Good materials, cozy site."

1010
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:41,333
"Good materials, moral construction."

1011
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,700
GOOD MATERIALS, COZY SITE,
MORAL CONSTRUCTION

1012
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:45,166
-It's related to construction.
-Yes.

1013
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:49,266
And wasn't Woo-il a manager
from a construction company?

1014
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,367
-It's related to construction.
-Definitely.

1015
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:53,867
-We got four clues about it.
-That's right.

1016
00:49:53,934 --> 00:49:55,200
That's right.

1017
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,266
My goodness.

1018
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:00,633
Gosh, this is incredible.

1019
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:03,700
Let's get some rice.

1020
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:08,333
What? Gosh.

1021
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,734
What? Gosh.

1022
00:50:12,734 --> 00:50:14,200
For goodness' sake.

1023
00:50:14,266 --> 00:50:16,934
-Fortune of the day, bad.
-I have no luck.

1024
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,834
-Seriously.
-You destroyed it.

1025
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,934
I have no luck.

1026
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:26,300
-Thank you, Tae-hyun.
-Okay. Eat up.

1027
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:28,367
-Thank you.
-My goodness.

1028
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:35,333
-Woo-il, come here.
-YEONJUN, is there a seat?

1029
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,667
-Yes.
-Woo-il, come here.

1030
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,200
Come here. Sit down.

1031
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,867
You're eating with gusto.

1032
00:50:49,934 --> 00:50:51,333
I enjoy eating.

1033
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,967
-Do you eat all sorts of food?
-Yes.

1034
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,667
-Where's the water?
-Over here.

1035
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:57,867
-Is it this one?
-Yes.

1036
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:05,633
-I absolutely love ramyeon.
-Really?

1037
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,300
-Eat ramyeon.
-Ramyeon party.

1038
00:51:17,734 --> 00:51:18,967
What kind of water is this?

1039
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:22,633
-Woo-il, what kind of water is it?
-What?

1040
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,400
-It's barley tea.
-What?

1041
00:51:24,467 --> 00:51:25,700
Is this barley tea?

1042
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,233
-Hold on.
-I cooked ramyeon with it.

1043
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:31,567
Did you cook ramyeon with barley tea?

1044
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:33,467
I cooked ramyeon with barley tea.

1045
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:36,200
No wonder the color is dark.

1046
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:39,533
Hold on. Give me a cracked egg.

1047
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,200
-It's coming out.
-What?

1048
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:47,767
-Mister.
-What?

1049
00:51:47,834 --> 00:51:48,834
What?

1050
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:54,000
-Mister, haven't you ever lived alone?
-I have.

1051
00:51:54,066 --> 00:51:55,567
You need to be gentle.

1052
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:59,133
-Woo-il is older than you, right?
-Much older.

1053
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,600
Woo-il, when did you debut?

1054
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:02,100
-In 2010.
-Attention.

1055
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:03,800
I'm joking.

1056
00:52:03,867 --> 00:52:05,233
Attention.

1057
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,934
I'm joking.

1058
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,166
I'm from a different TV station.

1059
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,200
-Why would you bring that up?
-I'm from a different TV station.

1060
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:14,000
I was like, "Attention."

1061
00:52:14,066 --> 00:52:15,633
-He did it.
-Yes.

1062
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,967
-Which TV station?
-KBS.

1063
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,867
-KBS?
-Yes.

1064
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:20,166
-You're from KBS?
-Yes.

1065
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:21,800
-Attention.
-What?

1066
00:52:21,867 --> 00:52:23,467
He's from KBS.

1067
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:25,400
I debuted in 1995 through KBS.

1068
00:52:25,467 --> 00:52:27,333
-In 1995? Attention.
-Through an open recruitment.

1069
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,667
I debuted in 1991.

1070
00:52:28,734 --> 00:52:30,967
I debuted in 1991 through KBS.

1071
00:52:31,033 --> 00:52:32,533
-How about you?
-My debut year?

1072
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,166
-Yes.
-I debuted in 1997.

1073
00:52:34,233 --> 00:52:36,200
You should stand at attention too.

1074
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:38,967
-Hurry up and stand at attention.
-Na-ra, attention.

1075
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:41,133
-Attention.
-Jae-seok has seniority.

1076
00:52:41,934 --> 00:52:43,066
YEONJUN, when did you debut?

1077
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:45,533
-I was born in 1999. Attention.
-What?

1078
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,633
He was born…

1079
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,967
-You were born in 1999?
-Yes.

1080
00:52:48,033 --> 00:52:49,066
Attention.

1081
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,734
-JENNIE, when were you born?
-In 1996.

1082
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,066
In 1996? Attention.

1083
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,000
-At ease. Now…
-At ease.

1084
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,900
-…I rarely come across senior colleagues.
-Seriously.

1085
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,867
It looks tasty.

1086
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,633
You cooked it well.

1087
00:53:04,867 --> 00:53:05,867
Is it okay?

1088
00:53:08,967 --> 00:53:12,367
Ramyeon tastes great
when you eat it outside on a cold day.

1089
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,700
Gosh, it's good.

1090
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,533
Gosh, it's good.

1091
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:23,867
-Gosh.
-Is it good?

1092
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,166
What do you think?

1093
00:53:25,233 --> 00:53:27,600
-It tastes a bit like green tea.
-Green tea.

1094
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:29,700
-It tastes a bit like green tea.
-Green tea.

1095
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:34,300
He probably didn't expect
the shoot to be like this.

1096
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:39,033
What was the clue?

1097
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,100
-It was nothing.
-What was it?

1098
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:43,967
You don't need to know.
There isn't much to say.

1099
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:45,600
Still, you should tell us.

1100
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:47,433
JENNIE, what was it?

1101
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,834
-Gosh.
-Was it bad?

1102
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,900
-The clue?
-Totally.

1103
00:53:49,967 --> 00:53:52,266
-Today's clue…
-I don't have a clue.

1104
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:55,133
-Today's clue was useless.
-It didn't tell us anything.

1105
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,934
-JENNIE became good at feigning ignorance.
-Just tell us if there's a spy. Is there?

1106
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,667
-It's related to construction.
-Yes.

1107
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:04,934
In Korea, the economy will grow
and construction projects will come along.

1108
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:10,433
When we looked around,
we became certain that there was a secret.

1109
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,266
To be honest, I have no idea.

1110
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,600
Let's begin a game for a clue.

1111
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:15,734
-Okay.
-Okay.

1112
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,400
You'll now play Guess the Key Word.

1113
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:19,300
-Key Word.
-Key Word.

1114
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:21,433
Guess the Key Word?

1115
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,433
It's a team competition.

1116
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,266
One will be the guesser
and the rest will be the narrators.

1117
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:28,066
EINSTEIN

1118
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:31,867
The two members will take turns to explain
the letters that make up the word.

1119
00:54:31,934 --> 00:54:34,300
Ga, na, da, ra, ma, ba, sa, ah, ja…

1120
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:36,734
-Ah, ja, cha, ka, ta.
-Ah, ja, cha, ka, ta.

1121
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,867
-What are we?
-Okay.

1122
00:54:38,934 --> 00:54:41,967
-Human.
-It's a Chinese character. Baby.

1123
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:43,667
-The same thing.
-Time's up.

1124
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,834
Taina?

1125
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,467
-Incorrect.
-Gosh.

1126
00:54:53,533 --> 00:54:55,900
-This is hard.
-You rack your brain three times.

1127
00:54:55,967 --> 00:54:58,533
It's so hard.
I've never played such a game.

1128
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,700
Which team will go first?

1129
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:02,567
-They should go first.
-We can't do it.

1130
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,467
-We lack the motivation.
-We can't do it.

1131
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:06,700
-Play rock-paper-scissors.
-Go ahead.

1132
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:09,066
Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors.

1133
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:12,600
Hey, are you the captain?

1134
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:13,900
Rock-paper-scissors.

1135
00:55:13,967 --> 00:55:15,567
Hey, are you the captain?

1136
00:55:15,633 --> 00:55:17,767
-He got scolded.
-It just happened that way.

1137
00:55:17,834 --> 00:55:19,500
-Who are you to go?
-It's invalid.

1138
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:21,734
-I'm the captain.
-What's wrong with him?

1139
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,000
-The captain will go.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

1140
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,834
Okay. Nice.

1141
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,333
Go, JENNIE.

1142
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,734
-Is JENNIE the captain?
-Yes, I am.

1143
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,633
She's the captain.

1144
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,467
Okay. A match between the captains.

1145
00:55:34,533 --> 00:55:35,600
Rock-paper-scissors.

1146
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,800
For goodness' sake.

1147
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:41,400
-There we go.
-Okay.

1148
00:55:41,467 --> 00:55:45,233
It's time for me to step forward.

1149
00:55:47,767 --> 00:55:50,967
-Of course.
-The real captain will go.

1150
00:55:51,834 --> 00:55:52,834
Rock-paper-scissors.

1151
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:56,300
-Gosh.
-Okay.

1152
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:59,166
All right.

1153
00:56:01,133 --> 00:56:02,667
The ones with the protruding mouth
will go.

1154
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,934
The ones with the protruding mouth
met in the end.

1155
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,834
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

1156
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:11,834
-Okay.
-You're the best.

1157
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:15,533
That took a long time.

1158
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,767
All right. Go.

1159
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:17,867
-Okay.
-Get ready.

1160
00:56:17,934 --> 00:56:19,767
Set, go.

1161
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,867
AMERICANO

1162
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:24,600
I see.

1163
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:26,100
Yes.

1164
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:27,600
-No.
-Okay.

1165
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:30,200
Safa…

1166
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:32,533
-Safa?
-Safa…

1167
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,467
Safa…

1168
00:56:34,533 --> 00:56:37,000
-What's "Safa"?
-Do you know it or not?

1169
00:56:37,066 --> 00:56:40,133
-What's "Safa"?
-Do you know it or not?

1170
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,367
-Mao…
-What?

1171
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:44,867
Maoism.

1172
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,266
-Na-ra.
-Hurrah for Korea.

1173
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:48,300
-Na-ra.
-Hurrah for Korea.

1174
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:51,300
-Na-ra.
-Hurrah for Korea.

1175
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:55,033
-Mina…
-Ri.

1176
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,233
-No. Ri.
-Fruit.

1177
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,467
It's a fruit that's-- What was it?

1178
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:02,400
You're so bad at explaining.

1179
00:57:02,467 --> 00:57:05,133
-It's light green.
-Watermelon.

1180
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,734
-It isn't a watermelon.
-Melon.

1181
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,700
-That's good.
-Melon.

1182
00:57:09,767 --> 00:57:11,300
-Melon.
-Melon.

1183
00:57:11,367 --> 00:57:12,667
Don't answer, Na-ra.

1184
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:16,066
-Melon?
-The first syllable.

1185
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,867
-Melon?
-Just the first syllable.

1186
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,066
Just the first syllable.

1187
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:20,600
It's too…

1188
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:21,934
It's too…

1189
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,333
What kind of an explanation was that?

1190
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,300
-Is it "Mel"?
-It's "Mel."

1191
00:57:27,367 --> 00:57:29,767
-It's "Mel."
-Gosh.

1192
00:57:29,834 --> 00:57:31,400
No. A. A. No.

1193
00:57:31,467 --> 00:57:33,767
Americano.

1194
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:35,834
What? My goodness.

1195
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,233
-Americano.
-What? My goodness.

1196
00:57:38,734 --> 00:57:41,200
-Hold on.
-For goodness' sake.

1197
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:43,233
-Hey.
-We-- Hold on.

1198
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,133
Why did you explain it with melon?

1199
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,800
Middle-aged men pronounce it as "Meron."

1200
00:57:47,867 --> 00:57:50,600
Middle-aged men pronounce it as "Meron."

1201
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,633
I was so surprised.

1202
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,667
-Who pronounces it as "Melon"?
-It's "Melon."

1203
00:57:58,467 --> 00:58:00,767
MUSHROOM TANGSUYUK

1204
00:58:00,834 --> 00:58:03,033

00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:10,300
-Guest room? Room?
-Room.

-Guest room? Room?

-Room? Is it "Room"?
-Room.

00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:17,467
-Room?
-Don't confirm it.

1209
00:58:17,533 --> 00:58:20,667
Jae-seok, stop talking to him.

1210
00:58:20,734 --> 00:58:22,734
-Stop talking.
-Go.

1211
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,767
This is number two.

1212
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:26,800
-Six, yuk. Yuk and room?
-Yuk and room.

1213
00:58:26,867 --> 00:58:29,133
Yuk and room. What's the word?

1214
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,834
Let's go. Number three.

1215
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:34,834
Woo, Mi, Yang, Ga. The grading system.
What comes first?

1216
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,767
-Su.
-There you go.

1217
00:58:36,834 --> 00:58:38,934
-Throw. Trash.
-If you have trash…

1218
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,533
-Mush it.
-Yes.

1219
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,100
-Mush it.
-Yes.

1220
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:43,600
-Yuk, room, mush…
-Yes.

1221
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,166
-Go on.
-And…

1222
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,967
-Yuk, room, mush…
-Yes.

1223
00:58:51,033 --> 00:58:51,867
-Go on.
-And…

1224
00:58:51,934 --> 00:58:53,266
Mushroom.

1225
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,700
Mushroom. Mushroom yukgaejang. Mushroom.

1226
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:06,333
Mushroom yukgaejang. Mushroom.

1227
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,834
Mushroom yuk--

1228
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,900
-Mushroom tangsuyuk.
-For goodness' sake.

1229
00:59:11,533 --> 00:59:13,266
-Mushroom yuk…
-Mushroom tangsuyuk.

1230
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:15,400
For goodness' sake.

1231
00:59:15,467 --> 00:59:17,667
Mushroom yuk.

1232
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:20,700
-There's no mushroom yukgaejang.
-How annoying.

1233
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:23,834
There's no mushroom tangsuyuk.

1234
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:29,367
A SUNFLOWER SEED

1235
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:32,400
-Food. Okay. It's food.
-All right.

1236
00:59:32,467 --> 00:59:34,934
-Na-ra…
-Oh.

1237
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,500
-Honorific.
-Big sister.

1238
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:39,333
-Princess?
-Senior.

1239
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:42,867
-Actor.
-One syllable.

1240
00:59:42,934 --> 00:59:45,166
-Actor. Nim.
-One syllable.

1241
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:47,567
-Ssi? Ssi.
-That's right.

1242
00:59:47,633 --> 00:59:49,500
-That's right.
-Ssi.

1243
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:50,700
Ms. Oh Na-ra.

1244
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:53,066
-We ate it just now.
-Ramyeon.

1245
00:59:53,133 --> 00:59:54,133
Myeon.

1246
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,066
-Not the moon, but…
-The sun.

1247
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:58,000
-There you go.
-Sun. Ssi.

1248
00:59:58,066 --> 01:00:00,967
-There you go.
-Sun. Ssi. Myeon.

1249
01:00:01,033 --> 01:00:04,066
My goodness. Ga, na, da, ra, ma…

1250
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:05,033
-Ba.
-Sa.

1251
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,066
Ma.

1252
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:06,967
-Ba.
-Sa.

1253
01:00:07,033 --> 01:00:07,867
Ma.

1254
01:00:07,934 --> 01:00:08,934
-Ba.
-Sa.

1255
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,033
No. Ma.

1256
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,033
Ga, na, da, ra.

1257
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,233
-Ma.
-Ma, ba.

1258
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,266
-An animal with a long neck.
-Giraffe.

1259
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:17,433
-Okay.
-Almost done.

1260
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,333
Giraffe.

1261
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,367
-Okay.
-Almost done.

1262
01:00:19,433 --> 01:00:22,300
-Gi.
-What's the answer?

1263
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:24,633
-Give her time.
-Give me a bit of time.

1264
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,633
-Sun.
-Sun.

1265
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,333
-Ssi.
-Myeon.

1266
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,500
Myeon.

1267
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,000
Myeon.

1268
01:00:31,066 --> 01:00:33,233
-Gosh.
-Ga, na, da, ra, ma.

1269
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,333
Ba. Ra.

1270
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,934
-Gosh.
-Sun.

1271
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,266
Ba. Ssi…

1272
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,567
My goodness.

1273
01:00:40,633 --> 01:00:43,367
-Gosh. Ba. Ssi…
-Sun.

1274
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:44,266
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1275
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:52,033
My goodness.

1276
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:57,734
-What about bassi? It means nothing.
-Ra.

1277
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,033
Ra. A sunflower seed.

1278
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,834
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1279
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,300
Ra. A sunflower seed.

1280
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,233
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1281
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,767
Gosh.

1282
01:01:07,433 --> 01:01:08,533
Impressive.

1283
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,967
-It's about memory.
-Next team.

1284
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,633
-It's about memory.
-Memory.

1285
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,934
Let's go.

1286
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,967
-We did well.
-We really did well.

1287
01:01:15,033 --> 01:01:17,000
-YEONJUN, let's go.
-Let's go.

1288
01:01:17,066 --> 01:01:18,834
Open your mouth wide.

1289
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,200
-What?
-What's going on?

1290
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:26,867
-What?
-What?

1291
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,934
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

1292
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,166
-Who splashed water?
-What?

1293
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:32,900
Why are you doing this?

1294
01:01:36,834 --> 01:01:38,734
In Korea, the economy will grow

1295
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,867
and construction projects will come along.

1296
01:01:50,734 --> 01:01:52,066
-What?
-Was it rain?

1297
01:01:52,133 --> 01:01:55,300
I thought someone was splashing water
at us for being loud.

1298
01:01:55,367 --> 01:01:57,500
I thought someone was peeing.

1299
01:01:57,567 --> 01:01:59,100
I was so startled.

1300
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:02,133
What was that? Was it spit?

1301
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,667
-You can see more parts of the picture.
-What?

1302
01:02:04,734 --> 01:02:05,633
What?

1303
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,400
It's a school. Maybe not.
Is it an apartment?

1304
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,066
I became absorbed in the sounds
without even realizing it.

1305
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,200
What's the secret of this apartment?

1306
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,934
Were the sections revealed
in the order of the bingo spaces?

1307
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,900
-The bingo spaces we filled?
-Yes.

1308
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:44,367
-What's this?
-You need a hint to get to the secret.

1309
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:46,300
Do you always keep the members
in the dark?

1310
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,033
What's this? So it isn't a mistake.
There's a picture.

1311
01:02:51,433 --> 01:02:53,767
-Let's check out the hint.
-By ourselves?

1312
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:55,367
Let's go. Na-ra, come here.

1313
01:02:55,433 --> 01:02:56,567
Let's go.

1314
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:58,367
What's this?

1315
01:02:58,433 --> 01:02:59,433
It was here before.

1316
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,133
-I bet there's a meaning.
-Seriously. What could it be?

1317
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,400
-What's this?
-Y, N, T.

1318
01:03:03,467 --> 01:03:05,266
-This one.
-YNT.

1319
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:08,667
X, Z, L, Y, N, T.

1320
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:19,400
-I don't even know what I'm looking for.
-Seriously.

1321
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:20,467
Let's watch it.

1322
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,066
…that caused a stir in society…

1323
01:03:30,934 --> 01:03:33,266
…were arrested and brought to justice.

1324
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:34,400
UNLICENSED

1325
01:03:35,467 --> 01:03:37,266
-"Unlicensed"?
-"Unlicensed."

1326
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:40,266
At the court-martial that took place
in Gyeonggi Province,

1327
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:42,400
those who insulted the youths' spirits…

1328
01:03:42,467 --> 01:03:44,233
To set an example,

1329
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,800
they received prison sentences
of three months to a year.

1330
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:55,667
Twenty-one people were arrested.

1331
01:03:55,734 --> 01:03:57,834
On November 20th…

1332
01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:01,800
…were imprisoned for the violation of…

1333
01:04:01,867 --> 01:04:05,200
The police continue to investigate
the related personnel.

1334
01:04:06,066 --> 01:04:09,867
The Central Intelligence Agency
is investigating their additional crimes.

1335
01:04:09,934 --> 01:04:12,734
THE FIRST CAUSE,
UNLICENSED TRADERS

1336
01:04:13,367 --> 01:04:15,734
-Who were these people?
-What?

1337
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,700
Is this a hint?

1338
01:04:16,767 --> 01:04:18,233
Who were these people?

1339
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,934
-Is this a hint?
-It has to be a hint.

1340
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,867
Who were these people?

1341
01:04:22,934 --> 01:04:25,700
-They weren't thugs, right?
-They weren't thugs.

1342
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:27,767
-What?
-I think this is something big.

1343
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:29,233
X-Y-T.

1344
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,400
Is this a hint? I still have no idea.

1345
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:33,767
-Seriously.
-I still don't have a clue.

1346
01:04:33,834 --> 01:04:36,200
I don't think they were politicians.

1347
01:04:36,266 --> 01:04:37,633
I have no clue.

1348
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,734
What's this?

1349
01:04:40,066 --> 01:04:43,333
-It's impossible to figure out the hint.
-I have no idea.

1350
01:04:48,033 --> 01:04:52,033
We'll now begin the final round.

1351
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,533
-Good. You know…
-Okay.

1352
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,266
-…I think both sides should be flexible.
-Understood.

1353
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:59,166
-YEONJUN, be flexible.
-Okay.

1354
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:00,734
You're the most rigid.

1355
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:07,033
…you'll have six hours
until the end of construction.

1356
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,567
If all 25 spaces get filled,

1357
01:05:09,633 --> 01:05:11,166
Team Traders will win.

1358
01:05:13,834 --> 01:05:16,767
If Team Traders gets stopped

1359
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:18,800
and fails to fill all 25 spaces in time,

1360
01:05:18,867 --> 01:05:21,266
Team Public Officials will win.

1361
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:25,734
Among the members of the losing team,

1362
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,333
the one who collected the most money

1363
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,400
will receive it in cash.

1364
01:05:35,066 --> 01:05:37,767
Traders, go to your positions.

1365
01:05:40,467 --> 01:05:42,166
I haven't the slightest idea.

1366
01:05:42,233 --> 01:05:45,467
The hint was so difficult.
I don't have a clue.

1367
01:05:46,066 --> 01:05:48,033
-Who were those people?
-Beats me.

1368
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,567
I lived through the era,
but I don't remember.

1369
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:54,400
-At first, I thought they were thugs.
-Okay.

1370
01:05:54,467 --> 01:05:57,667
-Maybe they were in construction.
-I don't have a clue.

1371
01:05:57,734 --> 01:06:00,166
-In any case, good luck.
-See you soon.

1372
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:04,967
I'll remember that this is
an individual match.

1373
01:06:05,533 --> 01:06:07,567
I'll aim to fill a line
on the bingo board.

1374
01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:11,233
I need to make a line,
but all the spaces are full.

1375
01:06:12,467 --> 01:06:16,166
If a trader completes a line,

1376
01:06:16,233 --> 01:06:19,567
he or she will receive
100,000 won in addition.

1377
01:06:21,934 --> 01:06:24,333
-It's an individual game.
-Yes.

1378
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:32,734
Mr. Customs Official.

1379
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,700
-I'd like to talk to you.
-Okay.

1380
01:06:34,767 --> 01:06:38,700
I'll give you a lot of money,

1381
01:06:38,767 --> 01:06:41,367
-so please be lenient with my items.
-Okay.

1382
01:06:41,433 --> 01:06:44,500
Even if I bring two or three items,
please overlook them.

1383
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,633
I'll be lenient in the beginning.

1384
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,734
All right. This is the final round.

1385
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,133
Ready, go.

1386
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:57,767
Let's scout the area.

1387
01:06:59,567 --> 01:07:01,367
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

1388
01:07:01,433 --> 01:07:03,066
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

1389
01:07:03,133 --> 01:07:05,100
-He's carrying some items.
-Se-chan.

1390
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:08,300
-His hands are full.
-He's bringing some items.

1391
01:07:08,367 --> 01:07:10,834
Please let me go. Please turn a blind eye.

1392
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,367
We might be able to turn a blind eye

1393
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:15,533
if you help us out.

1394
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,567
-You'll get a lot of money for these.
-I know.

1395
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:20,900
All of these items are
only worth 50,000 won.

1396
01:07:20,967 --> 01:07:22,700
-He'll get 80,000 won.
-It's 20,000 and 10,000 won.

1397
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:23,667
He'll get more.

1398
01:07:23,734 --> 01:07:26,967
-Give us 20,000 won each.
-Did you say 20,000 won each?

1399
01:07:27,033 --> 01:07:30,333
Didn't you talk about being flexible?
You're so rigid.

1400
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,300
Three items will get you more money.

1401
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:35,567
-We weren't so strict with you.
-Seriously.

1402
01:07:35,633 --> 01:07:37,567
-You've earned a lot of money.
-I know.

1403
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:39,133
Here's 10,000 won.

1404
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,000
-You're rich.
-No, I'm not.

1405
01:07:41,066 --> 01:07:43,266
-Give us 30,000 won each.
-No.

1406
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:45,200
-Give us 30,000 won each.
-Be flexible.

1407
01:07:45,266 --> 01:07:48,166
-We can't let you go then.
-We can't let you go then.

1408
01:07:48,734 --> 01:07:50,033
Give us 30,000 won each.

1409
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,567
-Thank you.
-Please go now.

1410
01:07:52,633 --> 01:07:54,800
-Let's go.
-You can pass.

1411
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:58,767
I'm sorry, but you guys are like
thugs in the alley.

1412
01:07:58,834 --> 01:07:59,934
You robbed me in the alley.

1413
01:08:00,066 --> 01:08:02,266
-We build relationships through gifts.
-Yes.

1414
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:05,066
-Take care.
-For goodness' sake.

1415
01:08:05,133 --> 01:08:07,467
By the way, you're a police officer, but…

1416
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:11,300
You're like a thug.

1417
01:08:11,867 --> 01:08:13,300
See you later, Mr. Mayor.

1418
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:15,000
Where is YEONJUN?

1419
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,500
You know…

1420
01:08:26,433 --> 01:08:28,066
Why is there a video player here?

1421
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,700
Is it for us to use?

1422
01:08:34,433 --> 01:08:36,367
What's going on today?

1423
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:39,333
YEONJUN.

1424
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,633
Okay. Well done.

1425
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,834
-That one too.
-Here you are.

1426
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:47,900
-That one too.
-Here you are.

1427
01:08:48,633 --> 01:08:49,900
I looked for you everywhere.

1428
01:08:49,967 --> 01:08:51,767
-This is…
-My goodness.

1429
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:55,200
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere.

1430
01:08:55,266 --> 01:08:57,100
-I'll help.
-I'm studying.

1431
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,367
-To get into university.
-Let's see.

1432
01:08:58,433 --> 01:09:00,667
I have to get into university.

1433
01:09:00,734 --> 01:09:02,066
Good luck.

1434
01:09:02,133 --> 01:09:05,367
Hold on, where are you going?

1435
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,166
-How did you get paid so much?
-No.

1436
01:09:07,233 --> 01:09:09,233
-This is a lot.
-I just received it.

1437
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,600
-What?
-Just now.

1438
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:12,600
-Is that so? You made a lot of money.
-Yes.

1439
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:14,400
-Give me 20,000 won.
-What?

1440
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:15,333
Give me 20,000 won.

1441
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,400
Isn't this too much?

1442
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,867
This is just robbery.

1443
01:09:19,934 --> 01:09:21,166
Don't you have an item?

1444
01:09:21,233 --> 01:09:23,867
-You can go then. Don't you have an item?
-No, I don't.

1445
01:09:23,934 --> 01:09:27,100
You'd better not get caught by me.

1446
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,934
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why am I so scared?

1447
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:31,433
What is it?

1448
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,333
An item with a person's face.

1449
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,066
-An item with a person's face.
-Yes.

1450
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:37,133
Ta-da.

1451
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,200
BOY SCOUTS

1452
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,400
-An item with a person's face.
-You're right. It's spot on.

1453
01:09:50,467 --> 01:09:51,700
It's spot on, right?

1454
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:53,800
I also have an item with a person's face.

1455
01:09:54,367 --> 01:09:56,467
-Let's make a deal.
-What's this?

1456
01:09:56,533 --> 01:09:57,700
An item with a person's face.

1457
01:09:58,367 --> 01:10:00,400
-Take a look.
-Please.

1458
01:10:00,467 --> 01:10:03,467
-I see.
-A person's face.

1459
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:06,567
If you open the book,
you'll see a person's face. Open it.

1460
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:07,934
There's a person, right?

1461
01:10:08,433 --> 01:10:10,767
-There is, right?
-Gosh.

1462
01:10:10,834 --> 01:10:13,834
-There is. I see a good person.
-Yes.

1463
01:10:14,433 --> 01:10:16,367
-Don't be like that.
-A person's face.

1464
01:10:16,433 --> 01:10:18,066
Stop it. We're on the same team.

1465
01:10:18,133 --> 01:10:19,700
-Seriously.
-I need that space.

1466
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:22,834
I do too. This is the only way
I can complete a line.

1467
01:10:26,533 --> 01:10:29,166
It'll be meaningless to take it.
You won't get to complete it.

1468
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:30,567
I'll take care of it.

1469
01:10:30,633 --> 01:10:32,633
Are you both going for a bingo?

1470
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,367
-Gosh, a bingo.
-This hurts my pride.

1471
01:10:35,433 --> 01:10:36,967
Gosh, this is bad.

1472
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:39,166
I don't know if I can allow it.

1473
01:10:39,233 --> 01:10:41,200
-Help me.
-What should I do?

1474
01:10:41,266 --> 01:10:42,967
If you bribe me like this,

1475
01:10:43,033 --> 01:10:44,734
you'll lose everything at customs.

1476
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:47,033
-If you look over here--
-Hold on.

1477
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,900
-This is--
-Hold on.

1478
01:10:48,967 --> 01:10:50,500
Come on, Tae-hyun.

1479
01:10:51,734 --> 01:10:53,934
You put me in a tight spot.

1480
01:10:55,133 --> 01:10:57,734
-I'm giving you three.
-Three?

1481
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:02,500
I'm giving you three.

1482
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:03,633
Let's go.

1483
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,633
Remember the 20,000 won
I gave you earlier?

1484
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,533
-I've decided.
-You've decided.

1485
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,900
You've decided.

1486
01:11:09,467 --> 01:11:12,000
I'll give it to Na-ra.

1487
01:11:12,066 --> 01:11:14,367
Thank you.

1488
01:11:14,433 --> 01:11:16,967
-All right.
-Thank you.

1489
01:11:17,033 --> 01:11:19,900
-Hey, you're rolling in dough.
-Okay.

1490
01:11:19,967 --> 01:11:22,600
-You'll buy an apartment at this rate.
-No.

1491
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:24,900
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1492
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,400
ITEM WITH A PERSON'S FACE

1493
01:11:33,633 --> 01:11:36,667
There's a playground.
Is there something I can sell?

1494
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:41,300
What's this? Why is there a rice cooker?

1495
01:11:42,033 --> 01:11:46,066
It'll be a good idea
to take the rice cooker and sell it.

1496
01:11:47,066 --> 01:11:50,934
Students passing by will think
that I'm strange.

1497
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,333
Is this okay?

1498
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,500
My goodness.

1499
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:56,200
I'm a bit embarrassed.

1500
01:11:59,233 --> 01:12:00,934
Hello.

1501
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,367
Hello.

1502
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,734
Hello.

1503
01:12:06,133 --> 01:12:07,500
Hello.

1504
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,166
Hello.

1505
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,300
Hello.

1506
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:14,734
I'm embarrassed.

1507
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,633
I need to get out of here.

1508
01:12:20,266 --> 01:12:21,934
There's a guitar too.

1509
01:12:23,934 --> 01:12:25,533
I have a favor to ask.

1510
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,066
Please pick up this guitar.

1511
01:12:27,633 --> 01:12:30,266
I'll take all the items and sell them.

1512
01:12:32,834 --> 01:12:35,900
I don't know what's going on,
so I'll focus on making money.

1513
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,934
If my team loses,

1514
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,166
I'll need to have something for myself.

1515
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,934
So let's do this.

1516
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:53,734
Hey, what are you doing?

1517
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,934
-Are you a customer?
-Yes.

1518
01:12:57,633 --> 01:12:59,066
Come on.

1519
01:13:00,867 --> 01:13:02,834
Take your pick.

1520
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,900
Are there any customers?

1521
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:08,066
-A business?
-It's a flea market.

1522
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:11,834
-A flea market?
-That's right. This is a good item.

1523
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,400
-It's nice.
-It's heavy.

1524
01:13:13,467 --> 01:13:15,266
-How much is it?
-Let's see.

1525
01:13:16,233 --> 01:13:19,467
In my opinion, this item can be sold
for 40,000 won.

1526
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:22,533
-Did you say 40,000 won?
-It's 15 kg to 20 kg.

1527
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,600
-Did you try lifting it up?
-Yes, I did.

1528
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:27,700
I'll let you have it for 20,000 won.

1529
01:13:27,767 --> 01:13:29,800
What if I buy these two items?

1530
01:13:29,867 --> 01:13:30,867
-This one too?
-Yes.

1531
01:13:31,967 --> 01:13:33,967
This item was hard to find.

1532
01:13:34,767 --> 01:13:38,000
You know, I could've gone
and collected the items myself.

1533
01:13:38,066 --> 01:13:40,166
Then I would've caught you and asked

1534
01:13:40,233 --> 01:13:41,934
-for 10,000 won.
-Right. Understood.

1535
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,934
I'll give you these items for 50,000 won.

1536
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I only have 30,000 won.

1537
01:13:47,066 --> 01:13:49,433
-Did you say 30,000 won?
-I'm poor. I lost it all.

1538
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,734
-Don't lie.
-I'm serious.

1539
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,633
If you only have 30,000 won,
take this one.

1540
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:55,033
It was 20,000 won.

1541
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,400
-The price has risen since then.
-You're a swindler!

1542
01:13:57,467 --> 01:14:00,934
Aren't you a cop?
Listen, you said it was 20,000 won.

1543
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,834
I don't remember.

1544
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:06,734
I'm determined to earn money diligently
and get out of last place.

1545
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,433
It's bound to weigh 13 kg.

1546
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,734
For goodness' sake.

1547
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,133
It weighs around 5 kg.

1548
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,500
It doesn't weigh around 5 kg.

1549
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,033
All right. You can take it for 30,000 won.

1550
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,433
My goodness.

1551
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,900
Must you go that far?

1552
01:14:19,467 --> 01:14:21,367
I can't figure out the hint,

1553
01:14:21,433 --> 01:14:23,133
-so I'll just run a business here.
-Okay.

1554
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,133
-I'll give you 30,000 won.
-Take the item.

1555
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,633
-I'll take the item.
-Okay.

1556
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:31,066
Should I go and find more items?

1557
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,633
I think this is lucrative.

1558
01:14:35,467 --> 01:14:39,233
What's the secret of this apartment?

1559
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,734
I think this pattern holds a clue.
What could it be?

1560
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,166
What could it be? Z, X…

1561
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:49,433
I think they're connected.

1562
01:14:53,133 --> 01:14:55,734
All right. JENNIE.

1563
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,567
JENNIE.

1564
01:15:02,734 --> 01:15:05,700
X. Who could be X among us?

1565
01:15:07,266 --> 01:15:09,200
Is the culprit among us?

1566
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,467
What could it be?

1567
01:15:13,033 --> 01:15:15,133
I can't figure it out.

1568
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,166
-Mr. Customs Official, I'm here.
-Which item did you bring?

1569
01:15:20,233 --> 01:15:21,900
-An item that brings laughter.
-Okay.

1570
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:26,700
-I don't laugh easily.
-Okay.

1571
01:15:26,767 --> 01:15:28,467
One, two, three.

1572
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,066
You're taking so many bribes.

1573
01:15:40,133 --> 01:15:42,700
-Oh Na-ra, pass.
-Pass.

1574
01:15:42,767 --> 01:15:44,934
-It made me laugh.
-An item that brings laughter.

1575
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,700
-Pass.
-Pass.

1576
01:15:47,767 --> 01:15:48,900
My goodness.

1577
01:15:50,066 --> 01:15:51,967
-My goodness.
-Here's 20,000 won.

1578
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:55,200
Why is my sticker
on a space I didn't fill out?

1579
01:15:55,266 --> 01:15:56,400
Was it moved?

1580
01:15:57,467 --> 01:16:00,066
Why is my sticker
on a space I didn't fill out?

1581
01:16:00,133 --> 01:16:01,133
Was it moved?

1582
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,433
-It was changed.
-You should've been more careful.

1583
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,567
-I'll give it to Na-ra.
-Thank you.

1584
01:16:06,633 --> 01:16:08,400
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1585
01:16:08,467 --> 01:16:10,500
-Sir.
-Yes?

1586
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:11,967
He's the mayor.

1587
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:15,100
You're the mayor. I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor.

1588
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:18,100
You can switch spaces, right?
Please do that for me. I'll pay you.

1589
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:21,133
The mayor can switch spaces

1590
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,433
and keep a trader from completing a bingo.

1591
01:16:27,867 --> 01:16:29,500
I don't have more. This is it.

1592
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,100
Give me 70,000 won.

1593
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:33,367
-I'll give you 50,000 won.
-It's worth a lot.

1594
01:16:33,433 --> 01:16:36,633
Listen, you. I mean, listen, Mr. Mayor.

1595
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,433
Let's say I give you 70,000 won.

1596
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,467
If you switch spaces for other traders,

1597
01:16:41,533 --> 01:16:43,033
my fist won't stay still.

1598
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:47,233
I'm serious. I won't care
if you're a mayor or a public official.

1599
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,834
Hold on. I'll make a change.

1600
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,433
Was it changed? Was such a thing possible?

1601
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,066
I guess he bribed the mayor.

1602
01:16:57,133 --> 01:16:59,066
For goodness' sake. Okay.

1603
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,500
Jae-seok. Mr. Mayor.

1604
01:17:02,567 --> 01:17:05,367
-Wait, the mayor will make a lot of money.
-Mr. Mayor.

1605
01:17:05,433 --> 01:17:06,934
If I empty my pockets…

1606
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,633
I'll tell you this.

1607
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,500
I've given you 70,000 won earlier.

1608
01:17:12,567 --> 01:17:13,600
Mr. Mayor.

1609
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,533
Hello, Mr. Mayor. I told you earlier

1610
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,233
-that I might have something you need.
-I'm with a complainant,

1611
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,500
so please come back later.

1612
01:17:21,567 --> 01:17:24,500
-You don't have money.
-I don't. This is all I have.

1613
01:17:24,567 --> 01:17:26,867
-This is my last resort.
-Who will you push away?

1614
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,834
-What?
-Who will you push away?

1615
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:31,767
Come to the mayor's office one at a time.

1616
01:17:31,834 --> 01:17:33,400
Hold on.

1617
01:17:35,033 --> 01:17:36,834
-Hold on.
-Let's have a talk.

1618
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,066
Where is my money?

1619
01:17:38,133 --> 01:17:39,934
Complainants keep following me.

1620
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,967
You opened a counseling office.

1621
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:44,734
-Enter one at a time.
-Please wait here.

1622
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,467
Mr. Mayor.

1623
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:50,900
Mr. Mayor, I'll cut to the chase.

1624
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:54,133
I have 40,000 won right now.

1625
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,767
Didn't you have more?

1626
01:17:56,834 --> 01:18:00,767
I had 110,000 won,
but I gave you 70,000 won.

1627
01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:02,200
I'm out of money. I'm serious.

1628
01:18:02,834 --> 01:18:04,967
I'm out of money.

1629
01:18:05,533 --> 01:18:07,166
I need 10,000 won at the very least.

1630
01:18:07,233 --> 01:18:08,333
Take 30,000 won.

1631
01:18:09,433 --> 01:18:11,367
I just need to go there and yell, "Bingo."

1632
01:18:11,934 --> 01:18:13,400
Then I'll be done.

1633
01:18:14,567 --> 01:18:16,867
Okay, I'll think about it.

1634
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,467
Wait. You'll think about it?

1635
01:18:19,533 --> 01:18:21,467
Will you take the money
and forget about me?

1636
01:18:21,533 --> 01:18:24,400
If you make a deal with someone else--
Hold on.

1637
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:26,467
-I could use my fist.
-Look.

1638
01:18:26,533 --> 01:18:28,200
-This is the mayor's office.
-I'm sorry.

1639
01:18:28,266 --> 01:18:30,367
This is where I work for the government.

1640
01:18:30,433 --> 01:18:31,767
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1641
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:34,233
Please keep your promise.

1642
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:37,700
It's simple. You just need to go down
and make a small change.

1643
01:18:37,767 --> 01:18:39,133
All right.

1644
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,166
Okay.

1645
01:18:40,233 --> 01:18:44,300
By the way, if anything happens later
it has nothing to do with me.

1646
01:18:44,367 --> 01:18:45,633
Of course.

1647
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,633
I'll keep my mouth shut. I met no one.

1648
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:49,133
All right. You can go now.

1649
01:18:50,233 --> 01:18:53,233
Do you have about one million won?
You have so much money.

1650
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,166
-What are you saying?
-Mr. Mayor.

1651
01:18:55,233 --> 01:18:57,300
It's nothing. Besides, it's…

1652
01:18:57,367 --> 01:18:59,100
-Is it for state affairs?
-Yes.

1653
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:00,433
Okay. Please sort things out.

1654
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,667
-Okay, understood.
-I have 10,000 won now.

1655
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:05,600
I'm dirt poor now.

1656
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:07,066
Mr. Mayor.

1657
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,667
-Come on in.
-Okay.

1658
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:15,066
The column I can complete for a bingo

1659
01:19:15,133 --> 01:19:20,066
has Se-chan and YEONJUN's stickers.

1660
01:19:20,133 --> 01:19:22,000
If you could please remove them.

1661
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:25,800
As you may know,

1662
01:19:25,867 --> 01:19:27,333
being a public official…

1663
01:19:29,467 --> 01:19:33,934
I've become quite wary
of affecting people's relationships--

1664
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,133
Gosh, it's hot.

1665
01:19:39,934 --> 01:19:41,834
-How much do you have there?
-My goodness.

1666
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,867
The total amount of money I have

1667
01:19:44,433 --> 01:19:46,233
is 60,000 won.

1668
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,667
I'll give you half of it.

1669
01:19:48,734 --> 01:19:50,467
-Half.
-Yes. Half.

1670
01:19:50,533 --> 01:19:53,100
-In that case, let's do this.
-What?

1671
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:54,767
Just use that money for yourself.

1672
01:19:58,633 --> 01:20:03,400
Na-ra, throughout my long career
as a public official,

1673
01:20:03,467 --> 01:20:06,133
I've accepted bribes.

1674
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,567
-Okay.
-Okay?

1675
01:20:08,633 --> 01:20:10,500
To be honest, I've accepted them.

1676
01:20:10,567 --> 01:20:12,433
It's half of my entire fortune.

1677
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,033
Someone gave me everything
except for 10,000 won.

1678
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,700
-I'm dirt poor now.
-For goodness' sake.

1679
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:19,467
Unbelievable. You want everything.

1680
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:23,233
-I'm being honest since we're close.
-At that rate, you'll become bald.

1681
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,033
-Let's make a deal some other time.
-Forget it.

1682
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:28,333
-Some other time.
-Okay.

1683
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,734
Some other time.

1684
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:31,266
Unbelievable.

1685
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:33,934
How much did Se-chan give him?

1686
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,166
I need to find a spicy item.

1687
01:20:36,233 --> 01:20:37,633
Where was the spicy ramyeon?

1688
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,500
What?

1689
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:44,333
I think it's gotten bigger.

1690
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,000
What's this? Y, N, T, L, X, Z.

1691
01:20:49,033 --> 01:20:51,166
For goodness' sake.

1692
01:20:51,233 --> 01:20:52,800
I don't understand the meaning.

1693
01:21:00,567 --> 01:21:01,567
What?

1694
01:21:05,633 --> 01:21:06,633
What?

1695
01:21:07,467 --> 01:21:09,867
What's this videotape? What's this?

1696
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,500
Why is there a video player here?

1697
01:21:18,033 --> 01:21:19,600
What's going on today?

1698
01:21:21,166 --> 01:21:23,066
Hold on. I'll watch it over there.

1699
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:40,166
Yes.

1700
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:44,867
ERADICATING
PUBLIC OFFICIALS' CORRUPTION

1701
01:21:44,934 --> 01:21:46,834
"Eradicating
public officials' corruption"?

1702
01:21:53,166 --> 01:21:55,567
EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGE

1703
01:21:55,633 --> 01:21:59,133
Prime Minister Jeong investigated
corruption among public officials

1704
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,333
and promised to take on the new missions

1705
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,433
of protecting the honest public officials

1706
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:06,367
and creating a system
of inspection requests.

1707
01:22:06,433 --> 01:22:08,166
10 TONS OF GOODS EMBEZZLED

1708
01:22:08,934 --> 01:22:11,600
Embezzled during transportation?

1709
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:17,633
What's that TV?

1710
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:19,867
There's a videotape inside.

1711
01:22:21,667 --> 01:22:23,300
"Public officials' corruption."

1712
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:25,333
Money.

1713
01:22:27,367 --> 01:22:30,533
What I did today was misconduct.

1714
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,867
Then the hint video I watched was about

1715
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:36,300
busting the public officials' corruption.

1716
01:22:36,367 --> 01:22:38,967
Was I committing that crime?

1717
01:22:39,033 --> 01:22:41,133
Maybe I'll get arrested.

1718
01:22:46,433 --> 01:22:47,800
This is a story about us.

1719
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,033
This is a story about us.

1720
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:56,700
So something got embezzled

1721
01:22:56,767 --> 01:22:58,500
while being transported.

1722
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:01,834
What on earth

1723
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:05,567
is the meaning behind
the sound of the wind, the dog barking,

1724
01:23:05,633 --> 01:23:07,700
and the splash of water?

1725
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,600
How are they connected?

1726
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,700
Gosh, it's so hard.

1727
01:23:15,767 --> 01:23:17,834
Apartment404 is so hard.

1728
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,233
-All right.
-Take it.

1729
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,066
Gosh, someone might see.

1730
01:23:26,133 --> 01:23:28,433
It's an item that's over 40 years old.

1731
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,233
An item that's over 40 years old
and an item that's over a meter long.

1732
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,033
Okay. Here it is.

1733
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,266
I'll give it some wings.

1734
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:37,066
The shoe shines now.

1735
01:23:37,133 --> 01:23:40,500
Then I'll do a cool turn.

1736
01:23:40,567 --> 01:23:41,600
Okay.

1737
01:23:41,667 --> 01:23:44,633
I put something inside.

1738
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,533
-My goodness.
-Isn't it nice?

1739
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,433
Okay.

1740
01:23:48,834 --> 01:23:51,166
-It's 40,000 won.
-Thank you.

1741
01:24:04,633 --> 01:24:06,100
Hello.

1742
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:08,200
I brought a spicy item.

1743
01:24:08,266 --> 01:24:10,367
A spicy item?

1744
01:24:10,433 --> 01:24:12,233
If you haven't brought food,

1745
01:24:13,233 --> 01:24:14,600
I'll need to see it.

1746
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,233
Spicy, right?

1747
01:24:24,867 --> 01:24:26,734
-She hit him so hard.
-No way.

1748
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,934
She hit him so hard.

1749
01:24:29,367 --> 01:24:30,567
Spicy, right?

1750
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:35,266
-Are you okay?
-No way.

1751
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:37,133
-You hit him so hard.
-It's spicy.

1752
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,533
-I heard a cracking sound.
-I heard it.

1753
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,767
How spicy.

1754
01:24:41,467 --> 01:24:43,033
You hurt my pride.

1755
01:24:43,967 --> 01:24:45,767
Was it spicy or not?

1756
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,266
-Okay.
-Okay.

1757
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:50,467
-Okay.
-Okay.

1758
01:24:50,533 --> 01:24:51,800
Here's 50,000 won.

1759
01:24:51,867 --> 01:24:52,934
-Thank you.
-I went easy on you

1760
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,433
-since you've paid me well. Okay.
-Thanks.

1761
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,567
SPICY ITEM

1762
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,633
Mr. Mayor.

1763
01:25:01,133 --> 01:25:03,300
-I need a word with you.
-Okay.

1764
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,200
Change the spaces for me.

1765
01:25:06,266 --> 01:25:08,900
The round will end soon,
so change the spaces for me.

1766
01:25:08,967 --> 01:25:09,967
You know…

1767
01:25:10,033 --> 01:25:11,133
Yes?

1768
01:25:13,934 --> 01:25:15,533
This is a story about us.

1769
01:25:17,433 --> 01:25:18,734
You know…

1770
01:25:20,567 --> 01:25:21,567
What is it?

1771
01:25:22,734 --> 01:25:23,967
What is it?

1772
01:25:24,734 --> 01:25:26,166
Everything will come to an end.

1773
01:25:26,233 --> 01:25:28,433
If I help him get a bingo, it'll end.

1774
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,467
Making a bingo is an individual match.

1775
01:25:30,533 --> 01:25:32,400
It only benefits him, not us.

1776
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:35,967
-It's an individual match.
-Why would you help him make it?

1777
01:25:36,033 --> 01:25:38,133
I see that I shouldn't help him make it.

1778
01:25:38,734 --> 01:25:40,400
Mr. Mayor.

1779
01:25:40,467 --> 01:25:42,867
-He said I shouldn't do it.
-Mr. Mayor.

1780
01:25:43,433 --> 01:25:45,867
Then give me back my 100,000 won.

1781
01:25:45,934 --> 01:25:49,000
You almost lost everything.
What are you doing?

1782
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:51,400
-He paid 100,000 won?
-The 30,000 from earlier.

1783
01:25:53,033 --> 01:25:54,467
How about the 70,000 won?

1784
01:25:54,533 --> 01:25:57,166
I can't give that back.
I changed the spaces once.

1785
01:25:57,233 --> 01:25:59,734
-I changed the spaces once.
-Unbelievable.

1786
01:26:00,367 --> 01:26:01,834
-Guys.
-I've never seen

1787
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,367
such a delinquent mayor.

1788
01:26:04,433 --> 01:26:05,967
Mister, listen.

1789
01:26:06,033 --> 01:26:07,734
Why don't you want to do it?

1790
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,700
-I can't do it. I watched a video.
-Okay.

1791
01:26:10,767 --> 01:26:12,333
Everyone got arrested in it.

1792
01:26:13,567 --> 01:26:16,100
Corrupt public officials got arrested.

1793
01:26:17,266 --> 01:26:18,600
So take it.

1794
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:20,100
-Give me an additional 20,000 won.
-What?

1795
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:22,166
And stay abroad for a while.

1796
01:26:25,367 --> 01:26:28,667
You gave us the most money.

1797
01:26:28,734 --> 01:26:30,834
If I open my mouth,
all of you will go down.

1798
01:26:33,033 --> 01:26:33,867
Hey.

1799
01:26:34,567 --> 01:26:36,834
I have a bad feeling about this.

1800
01:26:38,166 --> 01:26:39,166
Later on…

1801
01:26:40,467 --> 01:26:43,100
-We…
-We might suffer the consequences

1802
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:44,734
of taking bribes at the end.

1803
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,166
I know. I'm worried
that I'll go to prison.

1804
01:26:48,233 --> 01:26:49,433
Seriously.

1805
01:26:50,734 --> 01:26:52,133
We took bribes.

1806
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:55,567
-As public officials, we took bribes.
-That's right.

1807
01:26:55,633 --> 01:26:58,066
Was it an event
that took place in the '70s?

1808
01:26:58,133 --> 01:27:01,367
Twenty-one people were arrested.

1809
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:06,300
That must be the case.

1810
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,200
-We…
-"That must be the case."

1811
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:12,867
We figured out the secret.

1812
01:27:13,433 --> 01:27:16,333
After watching that video,

1813
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,834
I actually feel very anxious.

1814
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,800
-What's going on?
-Perhaps it's a ploy to make us anxious.

1815
01:27:21,867 --> 01:27:24,367
-I don't know.
-Money.

1816
01:27:24,433 --> 01:27:26,700
You took so many bribes.

1817
01:27:26,767 --> 01:27:28,200
Seriously.

1818
01:27:28,266 --> 01:27:31,600
I'll stay in prison for at least 30 years.

1819
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:33,967
-Seriously, Jae-seok.
-It won't end with ten years.

1820
01:27:34,033 --> 01:27:36,266
Even if the setting is the '70s,

1821
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:38,433
I'll stay in prison for decades.

1822
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,600
Ji-ho will visit you.

1823
01:27:46,934 --> 01:27:48,533
-What?
-What? Hold on.

1824
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,767
-What?
-What? Hold on.

1825
01:27:50,934 --> 01:27:52,000
What? Hold on.

1826
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:53,900
-Jae-seok.
-What?

1827
01:27:53,967 --> 01:27:57,333
-What's going on? Hold on.
-What's this?

1828
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,333
-Hold on.
-What?

1829
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,400
-Hold on.
-What?

1830
01:28:04,433 --> 01:28:06,066
Is it a fire?

1831
01:28:09,166 --> 01:28:11,033
-No way.
-For a while…

1832
01:28:16,266 --> 01:28:17,700
Is it a fire?

1833
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,500
What's this?

1834
01:28:22,133 --> 01:28:23,934
It must be a sign.

1835
01:28:24,867 --> 01:28:26,133
That's what it feels like.

1836
01:28:30,367 --> 01:28:31,633
What should I do?

1837
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,700
What should I do with all this money?

1838
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,033
I have something to do over there.

1839
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:42,934
I'm determined to earn money diligently
and get out of last place.

1840
01:28:45,066 --> 01:28:46,867
What should I do with all this money?

1841
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,900
I was crazy about money.

1842
01:28:54,934 --> 01:28:56,967
-I'll think of it as pocket money.
-Okay.

1843
01:28:57,033 --> 01:28:58,233
Okay.

1844
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,133
-Give us 30,000 won each.
-No.

1845
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,200
What's this?

1846
01:29:07,533 --> 01:29:08,734
This comb--

1847
01:29:09,867 --> 01:29:11,133
This comb--

1848
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,533
They're so obsessed with the bingo
that they don't care about the smoke.

1849
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,467
-I can't believe them.
-Don't they see the smoke?

1850
01:29:17,533 --> 01:29:19,934
Money has blinded them.

1851
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,033
The apartment is burning.

1852
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,166
Listen.

1853
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:27,333
There's smoke coming out,
but you're still trying to get a bingo.

1854
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:30,867
All right. We saw it.

1855
01:29:30,934 --> 01:29:32,300
-Did you see it?
-Yes, he did.

1856
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,367
I saw it.

1857
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,233
-Mr. Mayor.
-Yes?

1858
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,467
-I need to talk to you for a second.
-Why?

1859
01:29:38,533 --> 01:29:41,300
-Please do me one last favor.
-What is it?

1860
01:29:41,367 --> 01:29:44,333
One bingo space will get
an orange sticker.

1861
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,800
Please make it go away.

1862
01:29:46,734 --> 01:29:49,967
-Mr. Mayor, this is my entire fortune.
-What is it?

1863
01:29:50,033 --> 01:29:52,967
This is my entire fortune.

1864
01:29:53,033 --> 01:29:54,500
-The bingo?
-Yes.

1865
01:29:54,567 --> 01:29:56,567
-Please let me get a bingo.
-This is wrong.

1866
01:29:56,633 --> 01:29:58,900
-It's okay.
-It's too late to be upright.

1867
01:29:58,967 --> 01:30:01,734
-"It's too late to be upright"?
-It's too late to be upright.

1868
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,533
-This is wrong.
-Please take it.

1869
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,800
It's my entire fortune.

1870
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:08,367
It's over.

1871
01:30:08,433 --> 01:30:09,767
-Are all the spaces full?
-Yes.

1872
01:30:09,834 --> 01:30:10,667
All the spaces are full.

1873
01:30:16,033 --> 01:30:18,834
-The final round has ended.
-Okay.

1874
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,734
Se-chan has a lot,
but he failed to get a bingo.

1875
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,266
Hey, I…

1876
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:27,967
I gave you so much money.

1877
01:30:28,033 --> 01:30:30,266
I gave you so much money.

1878
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:32,266
-Police, over here.
-Okay.

1879
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:34,200
-Police, over here.
-Okay.

1880
01:30:34,266 --> 01:30:36,667
-You can't do this.
-Here.

1881
01:30:37,233 --> 01:30:40,967
While we do the final calculations,
please go to the room you started in.

1882
01:30:41,033 --> 01:30:42,300
Shall we go? Okay.

1883
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:47,600
-There must be a catch.
-The overall situation isn't good.

1884
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:50,133
You accepted a lot of bribes. As for you,

1885
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,834
-your arrest is a given.
-Hey.

1886
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:55,867
-Your arrest is a given.
-It won't be only me.

1887
01:30:55,934 --> 01:30:57,767
-You took a lot of bribes too.
-Jae-seok.

1888
01:30:57,834 --> 01:30:59,600
-I didn't take as much as you.
-You punk.

1889
01:31:00,233 --> 01:31:02,734
-I didn't take as much as you.
-If I get arrested,

1890
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,834
-I won't let you be.
-Me?

1891
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,800
-I won't let you be.
-Okay.

1892
01:31:06,867 --> 01:31:08,500
For goodness' sake.

1893
01:31:08,567 --> 01:31:11,066
I don't know what's happening today.

1894
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:13,800
What could it be?

1895
01:31:15,033 --> 01:31:17,266
"An honest and incorruptible nation."

1896
01:31:18,567 --> 01:31:22,266
I have no idea what this means.

1897
01:31:23,266 --> 01:31:24,667
What's this?

1898
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,700
Y, W…

1899
01:31:28,934 --> 01:31:30,433
I can't solve English clues.

1900
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:35,433
Let's count the money.

1901
01:31:36,567 --> 01:31:39,367
Forty thousand, fifty thousand…

1902
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,066
I took too much money.

1903
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:52,600
That's 28, 29, 30.
I have 300,000 won.

1904
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,100
Twenty-one.

1905
01:32:02,567 --> 01:32:04,667
I accepted a lot of money.

1906
01:32:04,734 --> 01:32:05,900
Twenty-one.

1907
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:12,000
I made 210,000 won today.

1908
01:32:14,166 --> 01:32:16,533
I got my money robbed.
I used to have a lot.

1909
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,233
I have 230,000 won.

1910
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,200
Twenty-eight.

1911
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,767
It's the sweet taste of capitalism.

1912
01:32:36,967 --> 01:32:38,567
-Jae-seok.
-Yes?

1913
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,133
Would you return 280,000 won?

1914
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,700
I'm sorry,

1915
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:49,600
but what'll happen at the end
according to the rules?

1916
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:51,667
I'll ask you one last time.

1917
01:32:51,734 --> 01:32:53,900
Would you return 280,000 won?

1918
01:32:53,967 --> 01:32:55,633
So why are you asking…

1919
01:32:56,133 --> 01:32:58,467
Would you return 160,000 won?

1920
01:32:59,667 --> 01:33:02,900
Where did 160,000 won come from?
Is it an arbitrary amount?

1921
01:33:02,967 --> 01:33:05,000
Would you return 160,000 won?

1922
01:33:06,934 --> 01:33:08,300
Why are you asking me that?

1923
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,700
Would you return it?

1924
01:33:10,767 --> 01:33:12,800
What if I return it and become a fool?

1925
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:16,000
I thought the amount was tied to victory.

1926
01:33:16,567 --> 01:33:18,533
Would you return it?

1927
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,533
What?

1928
01:33:20,934 --> 01:33:23,367
Would you return 60,000 won?

1929
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,700
Sixty thousand won?

1930
01:33:26,467 --> 01:33:28,300
Why would I return 60,000 won?

1931
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,000
Would you return it?

1932
01:33:32,667 --> 01:33:35,834
Hold on. What's the catch?

1933
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:38,567
Just decide whether or not to return it.

1934
01:33:38,633 --> 01:33:41,333
Are we getting robbed by someone above us?

1935
01:33:43,133 --> 01:33:44,000
Is that it?

1936
01:33:44,066 --> 01:33:46,967
In that case,
would you return 280,000 won?

1937
01:33:47,033 --> 01:33:48,266
For goodness' sake.

1938
01:33:49,033 --> 01:33:51,767
I can't believe these people's antics.

1939
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:54,166
You made me look like a bad person.

1940
01:33:55,467 --> 01:33:57,934
If I return 160,000 won,
only 50,000 won will remain.

1941
01:34:02,834 --> 01:34:05,467
If I return the money…

1942
01:34:05,533 --> 01:34:07,633
Would it be bad?

1943
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,934
What are the final results?

1944
01:34:18,734 --> 01:34:20,367
The scale keeps getting bigger.

1945
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,266
The final results will be revealed.

1946
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:27,667
The final results?

1947
01:34:27,734 --> 01:34:29,033
I had a lot.

1948
01:34:38,033 --> 01:34:40,266
-What's going on?
-My goodness.

1949
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:42,433
-What's going on?
-My goodness.

1950
01:34:43,033 --> 01:34:46,800
-What's going on?
-My goodness.

1951
01:34:46,867 --> 01:34:48,200
-What's going on?
-Gosh.

1952
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:51,700
Gosh, everything is getting destroyed.

1953
01:34:51,767 --> 01:34:54,133
-Everything is getting destroyed.
-What's going on?

1954
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,266
-Everything is getting destroyed.
-What's going on?

1955
01:34:57,033 --> 01:34:59,900
-What?
-I knew this would happen.

1956
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,533
Everything is getting destroyed.

1957
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,667
What's going on?

1958
01:35:10,233 --> 01:35:11,400
What's this?

1959
01:35:11,467 --> 01:35:13,000
What?

1960
01:35:14,233 --> 01:35:17,567
-Gosh.
-What was that?

1961
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,166
What's the theme today?

1962
01:35:29,233 --> 01:35:32,333
-What? Everything collapsed.
-It collapsed.

1963
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,500
Faulty construction?

1964
01:35:34,567 --> 01:35:37,233
It's no wonder
the construction was faulty.

1965
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:40,667
-There are many cracks in the walls.
-No way.

1966
01:35:40,734 --> 01:35:42,066
What's this?

1967
01:35:42,133 --> 01:35:44,567
-What's YNT?
-YTN?

1968
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,900
-What's this?
-Y, N, T.

1969
01:35:46,967 --> 01:35:48,133
Y, N, T.

1970
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,967
I think it's gotten bigger.

1971
01:35:51,633 --> 01:35:54,133
Is it a crack on the wall?

1972
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:03,633
What?

1973
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,834
What's up with the crow sounds?

1974
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,400
What?

1975
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,500
-What's this?
-Will ghosts come out?

1976
01:36:17,767 --> 01:36:19,734
-What are you doing?
-What?

1977
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:20,633
Who splashed water?

1978
01:36:23,767 --> 01:36:26,934
They're so obsessed with the bingo
that they don't care about the smoke.

1979
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:27,834
Right now…

1980
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:32,266
Listen. There's smoke coming out,
but you're still trying to get a bingo.

1981
01:36:32,333 --> 01:36:33,700
All right. We saw it.

1982
01:36:33,767 --> 01:36:37,734
Money has blinded them.
The apartment is burning.

1983
01:36:42,033 --> 01:36:43,767
That explains the leakage.

1984
01:36:43,834 --> 01:36:47,900
-That explains the leakage and smoke.
-The wind too.

1985
01:36:47,967 --> 01:36:49,834
It was about faulty construction.

1986
01:36:50,867 --> 01:36:56,166
The traders and public officials
took bribes.

1987
01:36:56,233 --> 01:36:57,767
Of course, the construction was faulty.

1988
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:00,200
Items got taken out.

1989
01:37:00,266 --> 01:37:02,400
Even with the clue, I had no idea.

1990
01:37:02,467 --> 01:37:05,033
The secret of the apartment today
was based

1991
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:08,900
on what took place on April 8, 1970,
in Changcheon-dong, Mapo-gu.

1992
01:37:08,967 --> 01:37:12,834
It was the collapse
of the Wau Citizen Apartment Complex.

1993
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:15,233
The Wau Citizen Apartment Complex.
I've heard of it.

1994
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:17,433
-I know the incident.
-The collapse.

1995
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:21,433
The collapse of the Wau Citizen Apartment
that took place in the '70s

1996
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,900
caused quite a stir in society.

1997
01:37:23,967 --> 01:37:25,734
That was the story of the day.

1998
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:39,133
A four-month-old apartment
in Changcheon-dong, Mapo-gu

1999
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:40,700
called the Wau Citizen Apartment Complex

2000
01:37:40,767 --> 01:37:45,100
collapsed with a roaring sound
at 6 a.m. this morning.

2001
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:46,433
Due to this incident,

2002
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:50,166
33 apartment residents lost their lives.

2003
01:37:50,233 --> 01:37:52,100
WAU CITIZEN APARTMENT COLLAPSES

2004
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,500
INVESTIGATION BEGINS

2005
01:38:05,367 --> 01:38:07,367
To an honest and incorruptible nation.

2006
01:38:07,433 --> 01:38:08,667
Incorruptibility.

2007
01:38:09,467 --> 01:38:14,367
You don't need to see anything else.

2008
01:38:14,433 --> 01:38:16,867
-Pass.
-Pass. Incorruptibility.

2009
01:38:16,934 --> 01:38:19,133
I just received 10,000 won.

2010
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:31,633
FOUR INCLUDING THE FORMER
HEAD OF MAPO-GU ARRESTED

2011
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:34,133
It's an item that's over 40 years old.

2012
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,600
-Take it.
-Gosh, someone might see.

2013
01:38:37,667 --> 01:38:40,300
-I see a good person.
-Yes.

2014
01:38:40,367 --> 01:38:43,300
I can hear it.

2015
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,133
POOR CONSTRUCTION REVEALED

2016
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,633
INSUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF CEMENT

2017
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:51,367
UNLICENSED BUILDERS
USED FAULTY MATERIALS

2018
01:38:51,433 --> 01:38:52,467
TO CUT BACK ON THE COST

2019
01:38:52,533 --> 01:38:54,000
5 BUILDERS ARRESTED

2020
01:38:58,033 --> 01:38:59,300
-Give me 20,000 won.
-What?

2021
01:38:59,367 --> 01:39:01,333
-Give us 20,000 won each.
-Did you say 20,000 won each?

2022
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,800
BLINDED BY COMPETITION

2023
01:39:03,433 --> 01:39:04,333
POOR CONSTRUCTION LEADS TO DEATH

2024
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:07,800
MAYOR KIM HYUN-OK'S NICKNAME
WAS BULLDOZER

2025
01:39:07,867 --> 01:39:09,300
You can switch spaces, right?

2026
01:39:09,367 --> 01:39:11,000
Please do that for me. I'll pay you.

2027
01:39:11,066 --> 01:39:13,000
Hold on. I'll make a change.

2028
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:18,400
A 60-DEGREE SLOPE

2029
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:32,066
RETIREMENT ON A SICKBED

2030
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,800
THE FIRST
DISHONORABLE RETIREMENT

2031
01:39:34,867 --> 01:39:37,533
FOLLOWING THE APARTMENT COLLAPSE

2032
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:48,934
Had the construction been done properly,

2033
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,400
the apartments would've been built
like that.

2034
01:39:52,467 --> 01:39:55,333
-Citizen Apartments.
-Citizen Apartments.

2035
01:39:56,266 --> 01:39:58,934
-We asked you to return the money.
-Yes.

2036
01:39:59,667 --> 01:40:02,367
It was the amount of money
you had earned through illegal means.

2037
01:40:02,433 --> 01:40:04,700
-I see.
-I see.

2038
01:40:04,767 --> 01:40:05,867
Okay.

2039
01:40:10,633 --> 01:40:13,667
The ones who returned the money
they earned through illegal means,

2040
01:40:13,734 --> 01:40:16,033
Jae-seok, JENNIE, and Na-ra

2041
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,934
are the final winners of the day.

2042
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,800
-Yes!
-Yes!

2043
01:40:20,867 --> 01:40:23,567
-Yes!
-Yes!

2044
01:40:24,233 --> 01:40:26,033
-JENNIE.
-My goodness.

2045
01:40:26,667 --> 01:40:28,600
I can't believe these people's antics.

2046
01:40:28,667 --> 01:40:31,600
I'm the mayor, okay?

2047
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,166
Three…

2048
01:40:33,233 --> 01:40:34,567
Take it.

2049
01:40:36,867 --> 01:40:38,433
I'll return it.

2050
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:43,166
I'll return it. Let me return it.

2051
01:40:43,233 --> 01:40:45,900
I was supposed to be
the cane of the people.

2052
01:40:45,967 --> 01:40:49,066
I'm ashamed of what I did today.

2053
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:54,867
I had that realization a while ago.
Please let me return it.

2054
01:40:58,033 --> 01:40:59,600
Do what you need to do.

2055
01:41:02,133 --> 01:41:04,367
I have no intention to return it.

2056
01:41:05,467 --> 01:41:07,200
No, I won't.

2057
01:41:07,266 --> 01:41:08,333
No.

2058
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:11,533
I won't return it.
It was hard to make this money.

2059
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,834
It was so hard to make 60,000 won.

2060
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,467
Why would I return it?

2061
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,734
-Yes!
-Yes!

2062
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,533
-JENNIE.
-My goodness.

2063
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,166
Didn't you return it?

2064
01:41:23,233 --> 01:41:26,000
You should've done it.
YEONJUN, why didn't you return it?

2065
01:41:26,066 --> 01:41:28,500
-The amount was too large.
-My goodness.

2066
01:41:28,567 --> 01:41:30,166
-How much did you have?
-280,000 won.

2067
01:41:30,233 --> 01:41:31,667
-Unbelievable.
-My goodness.

2068
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:36,266
Although it happened in the '70s,

2069
01:41:36,333 --> 01:41:38,867
so many people lost their lives.

2070
01:41:38,934 --> 01:41:43,233
It was an incident
that should never have happened

2071
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:44,533
in our history.

2072
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:47,233
-It was where people lived.
-I know.

2073
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:51,000
The Wooam Apartment collapse in Cheongju…

2074
01:41:51,066 --> 01:41:52,734
Plasterboard fell in the apartment…

2075
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,500
Insulating materials and rebars…

2076
01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:57,166
Many builders got arrested
for poor construction.

2077
01:41:57,233 --> 01:42:01,166
They had subcontracted their work
to another company.

2078
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:24,133
…have given up on humanity.

2079
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,266
…capitalism…

2080
01:42:29,767 --> 01:42:30,967
Hello.

2081
01:42:31,033 --> 01:42:32,567
She's foaming at the mouth.

2082
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:38,333
-This is the sound.
-What is it?

2083
01:42:40,033 --> 01:42:43,266
Why? Please don't do this! I'm scared.

2084
01:42:43,333 --> 01:42:45,200
-Call 119.
-Call 119.

2085
01:42:45,266 --> 01:42:46,900
-Here they come.
-Here.

2086
01:42:48,567 --> 01:42:50,300
I think they rehearsed it.

2087
01:42:50,367 --> 01:42:53,100
-They had good teamwork.
-It was systematic.

2088
01:42:56,934 --> 01:42:58,734
Let me go.

2089
01:42:58,800 --> 01:42:59,934
Hey.

2090
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:01,600
It's not yours!

2091
01:43:03,033 --> 01:43:04,433
Jung-ha, move out of the way.

2092
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:06,266
I'll move out of the way.

2093
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:08,667
Don't take it.

2094
01:43:09,233 --> 01:43:10,867
That isn't how you do it.

2095
01:43:10,934 --> 01:43:14,500
I know that there's a culprit.
It's not me.

2096
01:43:14,567 --> 01:43:15,967
For goodness' sake.

2097
01:43:16,033 --> 01:43:17,200
Hey.

2098
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,600
Let's unveil the truth.

2099
01:43:19,667 --> 01:43:21,066
Hello.

2100
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:23,400
Jae-seok. Catch Jae-seok.

2101
01:43:23,467 --> 01:43:25,200
Gosh!

2102
01:43:25,266 --> 01:43:26,233
No.

2103
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,700
Now, it'll…

2104
01:43:28,767 --> 01:43:30,000
I got chills.

2105
01:43:30,066 --> 01:43:31,066
Gosh, you startled me.
