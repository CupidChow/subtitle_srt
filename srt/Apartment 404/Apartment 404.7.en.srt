00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,834
UNIVERSITY EPISODE

2
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,700
In Gangnam in particular,

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,133
parents' fervor for education
is increasing the price of apartments.

4
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:38,633
In some cases, environmental factors
such as nearby schools are used.

5
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:40,867
One apartment attracted would-be residents

6
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:44,233
by promoting
its educational environment in flyers.

7
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,133
Sing the miracle!

8
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,767
Superstar K!

9
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,400
- Be mine
- Be mine

10
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,734
After the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers,

11
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:32,233
the global financial market
has come to a standstill.

12
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,033
There are growing concerns
of an economic slowdown

13
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:36,333
amidst the stagnation
in employment and consumption.

14
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:41,834
The top 500 companies in terms of sales
will be scaling back

15
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,667
on new hires next year.

16
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:47,133
The youth unemployment crisis continues.

17
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,300
Amidst the severe unemployment,

18
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,300
becoming a civil servant
is getting increasingly difficult.

19
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,233
The Grade Nine civil service position
has witnessed a record ratio

20
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,200
of 93 applicants for every available spot.

21
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,700
Please save us!

22
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,300
Help!

23
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:25,033
Anyone!

24
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:27,500
Anyone!

25
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,233
- Anyone!
- Help!

26
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:43,767
Anyone! There are people in here!

27
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:46,066
- Anyone!
- Please save us!

28
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,266
- Please save us!
- Please save us!

29
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,433
Anyone!

30
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,400
There are people in here!

31
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,133
Please save us.

32
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:56,900
Anyone.

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,633
- Where's JENNIE?
- JENNIE's outfit is cute today.

34
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,867
How cute is JENNIE today?

35
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:10,934
Gosh, she startled me.
She's dressed like a cheerleader.

36
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:12,300
Hello.

37
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,166
- JENNIE. What's this?
- You look like a freshman.

38
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,033
It's the 2010s.

39
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,266
What are you wearing?

40
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:23,867
Today, I stand out too much
even from afar.

41
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:26,100
Did you dress up as yourself today?

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,467
That looks so tacky.

43
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:32,400
- This jacket was hard to get.
- That's right.

44
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,867
What's this, JENNIE?

45
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:37,734
JENNIE, why is your face so puffy?

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,567
- JENNIE, did you just wake up?
- You should've brought your eyes.

47
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,800
JENNIE isn't looking up.

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,867
I wore glasses.
My face is a bit puffy today.

49
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,433
- Bring your eyes next time, okay?
- Okay.

50
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:52,967
All right. She's so cute.

51
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,667
- What are you? Ginyu Force?
- Today...

52
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:59,500
Are you Ginyu Force from Dragon Ball?

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,467
I'm certain she's Ginyu Force.

54
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:02,867
Go, "Ginyu Force!"

55
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,300
Ginyu Force!

56
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,533
-Why did we come to a university today?
- Seriously.

57
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,266
The incident will happen at a university.

58
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:13,200
It seems that way.

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,834
Hold on. In 2011,

60
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,033
- JENNIE was in middle school.
- I was 15. That's right.

61
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,333
I was in seventh grade.

62
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,367
- Really?
- Yes.

63
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,567
I remember 2011 clearly.

64
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,300
- I was in the army.
- I see.

65
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,767
- In 2011, I... Hold on.
- I was a soldier.

66
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,066
I think I remember what I did.

67
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:32,934
I trained for rowing
on Infinite Challenge.

68
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,433
- I see.
- I see.

69
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:36,567
- How do you remember everything?
- Rowing.

70
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,100
I trained for rowing in 2011.

71
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,266
What did I do in 2011?

72
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:43,333
What did I do in 2011?

73
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,400
They must be having a welcoming ceremony.

74
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,834
They're recruiting students for clubs.

75
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,233
What's this?

76
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,500
I want to join a club.

77
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,834
Are we freshmen?

78
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,867
- Shouldn't we join a club?
- We should.

79
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,667
The university campus
is bustling with students.

80
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:15,734
The clubs have set out
to recruit new students.

81
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:18,667
On a university campus,
blue tents that promote clubs

82
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,600
are lined up.

83
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,200
I'm looking forward to joining a club.
It's exciting.

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,433
It's fun to watch students
run the booths enthusiastically.

85
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:30,567
It's an opportunity to make
different kinds of friends.

86
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,633
- I feel like a university student.
- Really?

87
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,900
You know, they move differently.

88
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,600
- I know.
- The movement of youth.

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,000
- They're energetic.
- Yes. It shows in their movements.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,367
- They're healthy.
- It's different.

91
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,700
We can move like that.

92
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,533
Listen. You can open a business too.

93
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:56,800
- The extras always ignore us.
- They ignore us.

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,500
They carry on by themselves.

95
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,100
- They can't see us.
- Seriously. Can't you see us?

96
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,700
Can't you see us?

97
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,033
Welcome, freshmen!

98
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,900
They're welcoming us. We must be freshmen.

99
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,467
- Yes.
- Hello.

100
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:12,033
Hello.

101
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,233
We're freshmen.

102
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:15,700
- Renaissance!
- Renaissance!

103
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,700
- Come on!
- Hip-hop!

104
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,934
I'm scared.

105
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:29,767
- Hip-hop!
- I guess we need to join a club.

106
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,300
Hip-hop.

107
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,600
- Hipster.
- Yes, hip-hop.

108
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,667
- Say, "Ho!"
- Ho!

109
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,900
The man who took the scene by storm

110
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,800
- Yes.
- Is this a hip-hop club?

111
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,033
University is all about freedom.

112
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:47,066
- Find freedom at Nakwon University.
- Freedom. Yes.

113
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,633
- Yo, freedom.
- Yo, freedom.

114
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,033
Boots and cats and boots and cats!

115
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:58,533
- Boots and cats and boots and cats!
- Hip-hop!

116
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,900
You don't move like a university student.

117
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,767
- What do I move like?
- A senior citizen.

118
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,633
You didn't move like a university student.

119
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,667
I moved like a hip-hop musician.
Boots and cats.

120
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,200
JENNIE, let's join a club today.

121
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:22,633
- It's a movie I starred in.
- Tae-hyun.

122
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,233
My goodness, this is incredible.

123
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,900
Is this a movie club?

124
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes, it is.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,633
Se-chan, all of this must be a clue.

126
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:34,734
That's right. It must be.

127
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:38,700
- What could it be? Seriously.
- There must be something.

128
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,734
I can't do anything
because everything seems suspicious.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,100
What?

130
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,900
- What's this?
- Are you interested in entrepreneurship?

131
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,700
- Let's build connections...
- Yes.

132
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,166
...study, and open a business
so that we can succeed in life.

133
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,200
If you join Fly Together,

134
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,967
you can get information

135
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:11,533
and study ways to better yourselves
by talking about entrepreneurship.

136
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,133
If this is 2011, you should invest
in stocks or Bitcoin.

137
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:17,767
- We should hurry up.
- We should hurry up and buy Bitcoin.

138
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:20,166
Invest in Bitcoin. You'll make it big.

139
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,667
If you invest in Bitcoin, you'll be able
to buy all of these buildings.

140
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:27,133
- If it's 2011, invest in Bitcoin.
- Buy anything.

141
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28,800
It isn't too late. Invest in Bitcoin.

142
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,967
I'm from the future.

143
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:33,300
Buy anything. I'm telling you this.

144
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,667
You gave him advice.

145
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,467
- Renaissance!
- Renaissance!

146
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:40,667
You can be the next Picasso!

147
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:44,066
- Renaissance!
- You said nothing when we were here.

148
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,066
What if we can't?

149
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,266
You suddenly started when we came here.

150
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:49,867
- Freshmen, show us your skills.
- Show us your skills.

151
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,467
- Renaissance!
- Renaissance!

152
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,767
This is me.

153
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,900
I'll draw your portrait.

154
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,533
- A portrait.
- I'll draw your portrait.

155
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,400
- Go ahead.
- Then please draw his portrait.

156
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,033
Whenever I do this,
they exaggerate my protruding mouth.

157
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,734
Please show me a big smile.

158
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,967
- What?
- She told me to smile.

159
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,066
You're smiling.

160
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,367
Is it going well?

161
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:17,533
Ta-da.

162
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,934
What's this?

163
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,500
- What's this?
- It looks exactly like you.

164
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,033
It looks exactly like you.

165
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,867
- What's this?
- Renaissance!

166
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:33,133
- What's this?
- What's this?

167
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,066
- Are you kidding me?
- This is...

168
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:36,767
- You wasted our time.
- What's this?

169
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,767
I thought he'd be good at drawing.

170
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:41,900
- It's a mess.
- What was that?

171
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,200
This club is the most ridiculous.

172
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,734
- It's a mess. It's the worst.
- This club...

173
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:49,233
- This club is the worst.
- Art Club is the worst.

174
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,166
We shouldn't get sidetracked.

175
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,467
That's right. We need to find the clues.

176
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,300
Are you making ramyeon?

177
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,800
- Yes.
- Gosh.

178
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,433
- Please give us a bite.
- Please.

179
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:09,100
JENNIE got lured by ramyeon.

180
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,567
- Ramyeon.
- It's Lee Kyung-kyu's ramyeon.

181
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,367
- It came out in 2011.
- That's right.

182
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:15,367
- My goodness.
- JENNIE, is it tasty?

183
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,100
I'll join this club.

184
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,400
Chicken Michelin.

185
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,700
Can I have one too?

186
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,300
Is this for us to eat?

187
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,700
What's going on? Hold on. Look at that.

188
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,200
They're suddenly going somewhere.

189
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,900
- What?
- Why? What's going on?

190
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:41,767
What?

191
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,266
- You were making ramyeon.
- What?

192
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:45,033
Why is everyone leaving?

193
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,433
- What's going on?
- You're joking.

194
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,934
- Really?
- Is it a flash mob?

195
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,767
- My goodness.
- What?

196
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:56,266
- What?
- I have goose bumps.

197
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,400
- My goodness.
- What?

198
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,767
- What?
- I have goose bumps.

199
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,400
What?

200
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,500
What?

201
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,533
What?

202
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,433
- What?
- I have goose bumps.

203
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:11,133
What's this? Look at that.
Look at the way young people move.

204
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,567
- Is it different?
- Yes.

205
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,333
- It's different.
- Isn't that a popular dance?

206
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,233
But they're an art club.

207
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:18,100
- What are they doing?
- What are they doing?

208
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,867
- Are they cheerleaders?
- This is very sudden.

209
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,066
I know this song.

210
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:26,433
Even if you push me away
I'll come back to you

211
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:29,266
- Roly-poly, roly, roly
- Roly-poly, roly, roly

212
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,433
This is exciting.

213
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:34,934
- This is the song of 2011.
- Let's go.

214
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,700
-"Good Day."
- IU.

215
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,734
-"Good Day."
- IU.

216
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:48,333
- Tears well up, so I raise my head
- Tears well up, so I raise my head

217
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,500
- So that they won't fall
- My goodness.

218
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,166
- It came out when I was in the army.
- It was 2011.

219
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,166
- This song was a big hit.
- That's right.

220
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,266
You know

221
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:11,166
- You're the one
- That's right.

222
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,900
- I like
- I like

223
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,700
Oh, gosh!

224
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,133
What should I do?

225
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:20,133
This song captures the 2010s perfectly.

226
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,066
That was nice.

227
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,233
- How sudden.
- Why did you dance?

228
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,533
Where are they going?

229
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,400
- Is it over?
- It's as if nothing happened.

230
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,900
- Flash mob.
- Yes.

231
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,834
I see. Flash mob.

232
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,700
- It was cool.
- Amazing.

233
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,900
- Back in 2011, flash mobs were trendy.
- That's right.

234
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,000
Hold on.

235
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,533
They began dancing
in the middle of making ramyeon.

236
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:42,800
Catch him!

237
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,600
What's going on? What?

238
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:51,100
- Catch him!
- What?

239
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,033
Oh, no.

240
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:55,600
What?

241
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:08,667
Oh, my god.

242
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,033
Oh, my god.

243
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:19,066
- What's happening?
- It's dangerous.

244
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,934
- It's dangerous.
- What's happening?

245
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,900
- What's happening?
- It's dangerous.

246
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,467
- My goodness.
- It's dangerous.

247
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:27,967
Mister, slow down.

248
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,533
Mister, slow down.

249
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,266
Mister, slow down.

250
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,667
Be careful.

251
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,133
Be careful.

252
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,200
Oh, no! It's an actual crash!

253
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:07,166
Seriously?

254
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,000
- Seriously?
- Oh, no.

255
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:18,467
- Oh, no.
- Why...

256
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:20,166
- He spun.
- I know.

257
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,367
- Is he okay?
- It was an actual crash.

258
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,467
Should we listen to what the police say?

259
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,367
- I didn't hear what they said.
- I mean...

260
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,934
- Is he okay?
- The police.

261
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,667
You have the right to remain silent.

262
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,934
Anything you say
can and will be used against you.

263
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:35,467
- You jerk.
- You have the right to an attorney. Okay?

264
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,667
You serial robbing punk,
you should've stopped already.

265
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,567
- He's a culprit.
-"Serial robbing punk."

266
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,033
He's a serial robber.

267
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,533
A robber. A serial robber.

268
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,400
He got arrested.

269
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,100
They're detectives, right?

270
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,100
- Their performance was so realistic.
- It was no joke.

271
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,867
It was really... My goodness.

272
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,767
- What happened?
- What about the motorcycle?

273
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,166
- What?
- They left.

274
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,867
Isn't the speed limit
15 km per hour on campus?

275
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,633
Isn't the speed limit
15 km per hour on campus?

276
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,800
I know. They went over the speed limit.

277
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:25,667
- A serial robber?
- A serial robber.

278
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,367
- I'm already scared.
- I know.

279
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,500
Why...

280
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,000
"Serial robbing punk." What's going on?

281
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,200
So the case is set in 2011.

282
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,533
I was alive back then.

283
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:44,900
Of course, you were alive.

284
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,633
- We were alive back then.
- We were alive.

285
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:50,934
You're right.

286
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:52,500
- Congratulations.
- We might know.

287
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,667
That's right.

288
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:58,133
What happened on a university campus
back in 2011?

289
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,233
Serial robbery on a university campus?

290
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:02,200
- It's Woo-il.
- Woo-il.

291
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,967
- Woo-il.
- Hello.

292
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,500
- You look like a senior.
- Woo-il.

293
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,066
Are you guys
this year's incoming freshmen?

294
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,633
- Yes.
- Yes.

295
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:12,967
- What are you supposed to be?
- I'm Im Woo-il,

296
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,967
the legendary returning student of 2009.

297
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,567
How cool.

298
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,033
How cool.

299
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:19,767
- You're the security guard.
- I know.

300
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,200
- No.
- The security guard.

301
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,700
- No.
- You're the security guard.

302
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,834
- No.
- No?

303
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,934
You'll become a security guard later.

304
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,266
- You are.
- You'll become one.

305
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:29,900
- Just you wait.
- You'll become one.

306
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,500
- You'll become one.
- Do I become

307
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,900
a security guard?

308
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,934
I saw it in the future.

309
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:37,467
- Do I become one in the future?
- Yes.

310
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:40,600
- It's in the past, not the future.
- The past.

311
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,800
- Really?
- Yes.

312
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,433
In any case, it's nice to meet you.

313
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,667
Each one of you joined a club.

314
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,066
- Really?
- When did I do that?

315
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:49,567
- We just looked around.
- I didn't.

316
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,233
- Didn't you join a club?
- No.

317
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:57,433
- Your parents did it for you yesterday.
- Excuse me?

318
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,834
- We're in university.
- Parents?

319
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,333
- We're in university.
- They signed you guys up.

320
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,900
In the Band Club are

321
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,100
Tae-hyun, Na-ra, and Jung-ha.

322
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,333
Jae-seok, Se-chan, and JENNIE
are in the Dance Club.

323
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:15,800
All right. This is promotional matrimony
on the school.

324
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,567
- Captains, here.
- You mean "material."

325
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,900
Material.

326
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,500
What even is "promotional matrimony"?

327
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,433
- The legendary returning student of 2009.
- Is he a Pokémon?

328
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,900
- I'm Woo-il.
- Woo-il.

329
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,433
-"Promotional matrimony."
- Captains, take this.

330
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,633
Make sure you don't "loose" it.

331
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,667
WELCOME TO NAKWON UNIVERSITY

332
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:35,734
THE CLUBS OF NAKWON UNIVERSITY

333
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,967
NAKWON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS MAP

334
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:49,133
Captains, take this.
Make sure you don't "loose" it.

335
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,633
-"Loose"?
- You mean "lose."

336
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,200
You mean "lose."

337
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,433
Hey!

338
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:57,133
I'm the legendary returning student,
Woo-il.

339
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:58,467
All right, Woo-il.

340
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:01,300
- Go to your respective club rooms.
- Shall we do that?

341
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,600
Hurry up and move.

342
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:06,367
There are handwritten posters.

343
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,033
- Woo-il, can we read them?
- Go ahead.

344
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,000
A tuition increase.

345
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:18,433
"My blood is boiling."

346
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:22,000
"How could they increase the tuition?"
It's about tuition.

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,100
PLEASE KEEP YOUR PROMISE
ABOUT CUTTING TUITION IN HALF!

348
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,233
The six university representatives
of the Korea College Students' Union

349
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,233
held a press conference
at Gwanghwamun Square

350
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:33,567
and asked the government to keep
its promise of cutting tuition in half.

351
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,000
The attendees criticized the government

352
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,333
for tormenting the students
with high tuition.

353
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,500
That's right. While movies and songs
were incredibly popular back then,

354
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,333
there was a social conflict
over the issue of half-price tuition.

355
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,800
Tuition was an issue. That's right.

356
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:52,567
- Tuition.
- For students...

357
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,533
- Yes.
- For students, tuition is daunting.

358
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,633
- It's expensive.
- Parents struggled.

359
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,166
Let's go inside.

360
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,233
- Shall we go?
- Okay.

361
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:02,667
- This university seems to have a problem.
- I know.

362
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,934
Every place we visit has a problem.

363
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,500
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

364
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,333
Woo-il, you're handsome.

365
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,100
Thank you. I hear that a lot.

366
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,367
I'm sick and tired of it.

367
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:15,900
Seriously.

368
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,834
When did they put up these banners?

369
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,734
- This is incredible.
- Right?

370
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,433
WELCOME, YOU DON'T NEED
TO HIDE ANYMORE

371
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,767
WELCOMING
THE INCOMING STUDENTS OF 2011

372
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,467
When did they put up these banners?

373
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,033
- This is incredible.
- Right?

374
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:42,367
Oh, yes.

375
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,367
Do you think they're accomplices?
Jae-seok, it's the same jacket.

376
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:48,867
- What?
- Look at them.

377
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,100
He was wearing that jacket.

378
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,500
The police.

379
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,867
You serial robbing punk...

380
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,900
- A serial robber?
- A serial robber.

381
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:06,533
He got arrested.

382
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,200
Do you think they're accomplices?
Jae-seok, it's the same jacket.

383
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,934
- He was wearing that jacket.
- Robbers.

384
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:14,500
- What?
- What?

385
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,967
- Robbers.
- What?

386
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:21,100
- Robbers.
- What?

387
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,133
They were wearing the same jacket
as the robber we saw.

388
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,233
What's up with them? What's this?

389
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:26,667
- What?
- What?

390
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:39,800
SET UP YOUR USERNAME:
I WON'T CRY ANYMORE

391
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:50,166
What's this?

392
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,700
"How big is the harvest?"

393
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,433
-"I don't have it either."
-"Eun-jung got exposed."

394
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:58,934
"Senior Eun-jung got exposed."

395
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:01,300
"The senior line"? What's this?

396
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,166
"I don't have money."

397
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,667
"How about the freshman?
Is the freshman okay?"

398
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,700
What's this?

399
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,467
-"Answer me, freshman."
- You don't use messaging apps.

400
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:15,867
- It's us.
- Jae-seok.

401
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:18,266
-"Answer me, freshman."
- You don't use messaging apps.

402
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:19,800
- It's us.
- Jae-seok, can you type?

403
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,667
- Of course.
- You don't use messengers. He doesn't.

404
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,433
Jae-seok, send a reply. Write something.

405
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,033
- Jae-seok.
-"Answer me, freshman."

406
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,033
"I'm sorry."

407
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:36,934
-"What?"
- What are you doing?

408
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:39,900
- Shall I type?
- What are you doing? What did you type?

409
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,100
The hunt-and-peck typing
isn't going to cut it.

410
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,433
They'll know that you aren't a freshman.

411
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:47,033
-"What?"
-"What?"

412
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,333
- Why didn't you add a question mark?
- That's enough.

413
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,367
-"What."
- They'll understand.

414
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,000
- They replied.
- My goodness.

415
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,900
- They replied.
- My goodness.

416
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:02,600
"Who are you?"

417
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:04,500
"The freshman."

418
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:06,934
"The freshman."

419
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:10,600
- That's too casual.
-"The freshman."

420
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,300
- Too casual.
-"No, you're not."

421
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,000
"No, you're not." You got caught.

422
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,567
Maybe a freshman among us should type.

423
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:18,533
Se-chan, go ahead.

424
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:20,633
I'm not a freshman. These two are.

425
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:21,700
"Who are you?"

426
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,066
- Go ahead. You know how to type.
- Reveal your name.

427
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:25,734
- Type, "JENNIE."
- Can you type fast?

428
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:27,333
Can you type fast?

429
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,200
I'M JENNIE

430
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,767
- That was so fast.
- You can type fast.

431
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:36,800
- I should practice typing.
- What?

432
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,500
- You're busy already.
- You should.

433
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,567
I should practice typing.

434
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,967
What if I get arrested
for revealing my name?

435
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:44,834
- He left.
- He left.

436
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,633
- The name is Kim Kwang-won.
- He left.

437
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,400
- Leader Kim Kwang-won.
- Kim Kwang-won?

438
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,867
He was wearing that jacket.

439
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,133
Leader Kim Kwang-won
must be up to something.

440
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,934
What's this? Is it a crime ring?

441
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:07,400
It must be a crime ring. The freshman.

442
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:09,934
- You know that I like you a lot.
- It's you.

443
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:10,900
It's you, Se-chan.

444
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,233
Don't suspect me because of my outfit.
It isn't me.

445
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,033
What's the story?

446
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:19,133
- It's this way.
- This way?

447
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,800
There are so many clubs.

448
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,500
- What's going on today?
- I have no clue.

449
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,166
This is the Dance Club.

450
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,133
It's the Dance Club room. Go on in.

451
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:33,967
- Wow.
- Gosh, it's warm.

452
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,100
You don't know me

453
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
- That song came out in 2011.
- You don't know me

454
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,834
Jae-seok, there are socks.

455
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,867
- What?
- There are socks.

456
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:58,867
- Shall we wear a pair each?
- Shall we?

457
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:01,300
- What? There are no socks.
- No?

458
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,700
- Socks would be perfect.
- There are no socks.

459
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,333
- It'd be nice to wear them.
- Yes. They envelop your feet.

460
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:09,266
What? There's something here.

461
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:10,700
What? There's something here.

462
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,934
- What?
- Is there something?

463
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:17,100
"Tuition Rises by 30 Percent in 5 Years,
Which Is Twice the Inflation Rate."

464
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:20,266
Is there a story about tuition?

465
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:24,367
"From 2005 to 2010,

466
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:26,900
educational expenses rose
by 22.8 percent."

467
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,333
"My blood is boiling."

468
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,867
"How could they increase the tuition?"
It's about tuition.

469
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:35,834
You serial robbing punk,
you should've stopped already.

470
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:37,834
What's this?

471
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:40,633
- Someone's at the door.
- A clue...

472
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:42,900
What?

473
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:46,333
What?

474
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,600
What?

475
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,467
- What?
- Aiki.

476
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:53,333
- It's Aiki.
- Aiki. What are you doing?

477
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,000
- What are you doing? You just got here.
- Seriously.

478
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,066
You just got here.

479
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,166
- Aiki.
- You just got here.

480
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,567
Hello.

481
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:07,033
Aiki, why are you wearing shoes
when we took off ours?

482
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:08,467
- Gosh, this is...
- Wow.

483
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:13,934
It's too much.

484
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,567
- You didn't even say hi.
- She's freestyling.

485
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,700
- Oh, my god.
- She's good.

486
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,200
- She's so good.
- She's good.

487
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,667
- Hi.
- Hello.

488
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:29,367
Hi. Welcome to the Dance Club.

489
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,934
I'm a junior and also the best dancer.

490
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,233
My name is Hye-in.

491
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,600
- What?
- Hye-in?

492
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,233
- Hye-eun?
- Hye-in.

493
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:38,834
- Hye-in.
- Hye-in.

494
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:41,200
You brought back memories.

495
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,567
- What?
- Song Eun-i was like her back in school.

496
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:48,000
Seriously. Song Eun-i looked
exactly like her.

497
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
She just needs tinted glasses.

498
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,533
- Song Eun-i.
- They do look similar.

499
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,433
She practically dressed up as Song Eun-i.

500
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:58,000
- Senior Song.
- Song Eun-i. Senior Song.

501
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:02,600
What are we supposed to do?

502
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,233
You joined because you were interested
in dancing.

503
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:07,100
- Of course.
- That's right.

504
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,734
Let's get started.

505
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:15,166
We need to perform.

506
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,333
- What?
- What?

507
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,533
You want me to perform in this state?

508
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,133
Would you be okay with that?

509
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:22,600
- I already made up my mind.
- Okay.

510
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,800
We'll give a performance
of the hottest song,

511
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,133
"Heartbeat" by 2PM.

512
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:29,633
-"Heartbeat."
- Can you feel my heartbeat?

513
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,066
- I called over some seniors.
- Really?

514
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:46,000
- Seniors.
- It'd be funny

515
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,266
- if 2PM came.
- The best dancers.

516
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:52,133
Welcome.

517
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,533
- They're here.
- What?

518
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:56,934
- Earlier, they were with the Hip-Hop Club.
- Didn't they do hip-hop?

519
00:26:56,934 --> 00:27:00,600
He was rapping terribly earlier.

520
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Find freedom at Nakwon University.

521
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:12,800
Here comes the first move.

522
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,166
Pound your chest.

523
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,100
This dance is very well-known.

524
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:21,800
Pound your chest. The second move.

525
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,000
Run plaintively.

526
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,500
That's right. You need to act like
you're going somewhere.

527
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:27,667
Run like this.

528
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:30,033
Run.

529
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:33,467
Are you doing the grasshopper dance?
That's what it looks like.

530
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:34,600
I've seen it somewhere.

531
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:37,567
- I got it.
- Good.

532
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,033
JENNIE, we'll dance behind you.

533
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,133
Okay.

534
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,266
Become self-absorbed.

535
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:46,033
Let's go.

536
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:57,033
Move to the side. Pretend to be a zombie.

537
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:58,200
It's this way.

538
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,367
- You didn't teach us this move.
- This move.

539
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:04,033
How are we supposed to dance?

540
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:05,300
- Here it comes.
- Here it comes.

541
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,200
- Run. Let's go.
- Here it comes.

542
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:08,967
How cool.

543
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:15,033
Se-chan.

544
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,533
Now, show us 2PM.

545
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,734
That was perfect.

546
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:31,000
You need to succeed in doing
the human pyramid

547
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,333
for us to give a good performance.

548
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,500
Okay.

549
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,166
What a puzzling day.

550
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,100
- There must be something more.
- I know.

551
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,133
What's this?

552
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:41,767
- Now, the saddle position.
- The human pyramid.

553
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:47,800
- Let's see the human pyramid.
- Hey.

554
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:57,066
- It was perfect.
- It was perfect.

555
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:57,967
It was perfect, right?

556
00:28:57,967 --> 00:29:00,300
What was the meaning of that?

557
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,100
I'm sure the human pyramid
means something.

558
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,400
I think so.

559
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:08,533
- You hear the sound.
- Yes, we do.

560
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:10,567
Yes. My body is twitching already.

561
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:34,433
That's right.

562
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:37,767
- Aren't they the DICKPUNKS?
- From Superstar K?

563
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,100
- Who are you guys?
- Hello.

564
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,133
- We're the Band Club.
- The Band Club, N.O.B.

565
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,900
N.O.B?

566
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:48,934
It stands for Nakwon's only band.

567
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:51,300
We're preparing to enter Superstar K.

568
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,834
Guys,

569
00:29:55,834 --> 00:30:00,133
you'll win if you change the band name.

570
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,700
Finally...

571
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,900
Hello. We're DICKPUNKS.

572
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,433
"DIFUNKS."

573
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:08,033
DICKPUNKS.

574
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:11,166
Thus, they celebrated passing
the audition.

575
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:18,100
If you want to join the Band Club,
we need to test your skills.

576
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,033
- That sounds good.
- Will you test our skills?

577
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,867
By the way, you have the same name as me.

578
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:24,000
Oh, yes.

579
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,734
Tae-hyun can sing well.

580
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:27,066
- That's right.
- Yes.

581
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:30,433
Tae-hyun, do you know a song titled
"The Two Line Bridge"?

582
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:32,734
...do you know a song titled
"The Two Line Bridge"?

583
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:34,700
I've heard of it.

584
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,967
I have a feeling
that you'll sing that song well.

585
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:38,734
I'm getting that same feeling.

586
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,100
- Come here and sing.
- Thank you.

587
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,700
I have a bad cold,

588
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,000
- but I'll give it a go.
- What's that?

589
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
Is that a prompter?
Do you have bad eyesight?

590
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Those are the lyrics.

591
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,667
All right. This is an honor.

592
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:03,033
What? It isn't trot music.

593
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,800
It's rock.

594
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,333
One, two, one, two, three, four.

595
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:16,100
The last farewell on the two line bridge

596
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,066
He's cool.

597
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:21,900
- The passing wind makes my heart ache
- He's cool.

598
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:26,934
- I stand there without asking you to stay
- He's good.

599
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:28,667
He's good.

600
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,400
I stand there alone

601
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,900
That's good.

602
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,600
I turn around multiple times

603
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,367
In order to look at you

604
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:43,700
But I'm a fool who can't ask you to stay

605
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,500
Standing at either end
Of the two line bridge

606
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,400
We call for each other

607
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,100
- What do you think?
- He's good.

608
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,967
- He is?
- He's in.

609
00:31:57,967 --> 00:32:00,934
My heart aches

610
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:03,500
Our love

611
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:10,300
Can't be realized

612
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,233
Thank you.

613
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,166
Thank you.

614
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,033
- You're good.
- My goodness.

615
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:21,166
You can sing well.

616
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:22,800
Did I pass?

617
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,066
Join the band as a vocalist.

618
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:28,433
- I didn't like it.
- Why not?

619
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:30,500
His vibrato was too old-fashioned.

620
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:34,600
His vocals do sound old.

621
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,734
Right? His vocals have that worn-out vibe.

622
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:39,567
- He doesn't sound like a freshman.
- Right?

623
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:40,967
Still, it was nice.

624
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:45,200
What should I do?

625
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Let's try the perfect pitch test.

626
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,700
- I see.
- That's the plan.

627
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,867
That sounds good.

628
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,300
- Are you good at it?
- I don't know.

629
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,233
Do

630
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:57,700
Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do

631
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,033
Guess the note.

632
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:01,633
- Do
- Do

633
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,266
- Do
- Do

634
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:07,166
- Mi
- Mi

635
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,200
Mi. Next.

636
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:13,967
- La
- La

637
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:17,200
- It's been easy so far.
- It's been easy so far.

638
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,533
It might start to get a bit difficult.

639
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:19,900
What's this note?

640
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,700
Fi

641
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,567
- Fi
- What?

642
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:29,100
- Fa sharp
- You know.

643
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,700
You know.

644
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,300
Not many people recognize that note.

645
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,266
- What's fi?
- Fa sharp.

646
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:36,567
- Amazing.
- What was it?

647
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,633
- Fa sharp. Fi
- Fi.

648
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:41,166
You're exactly right.

649
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:43,467
Fi. Fi.

650
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:46,367
This time, Tae-hyun and Jung-ha
should guess.

651
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,767
- That's unfair.
- Here.

652
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,700
- Skip a turn.
- Skip a turn.

653
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,033
It can't be helped.

654
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,333
What?

655
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,266
It can't be helped.

656
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,400
- What?
- Guys.

657
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,567
Have you seen Min-su?

658
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,867
Min-su. We haven't seen Min-su.

659
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:02,433
- He hasn't come to school for three days.
- Min-su?

660
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:03,867
- Call me if you find him, okay?
- Okay.

661
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,834
- Call me.
- He hasn't come to school for three days.

662
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,600
- Guys.
- Yes?

663
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,967
Have you seen Min-su?

664
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:14,967
Who's Min-su?

665
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:17,033
He hasn't come to school for three days.

666
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:18,934
- Call me if you find him.
- Okay.

667
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,934
- Three days. Min-su.
- Min-su.

668
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,166
- Min-su?
- Is he the one who got arrested?

669
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,367
I'm in here!

670
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:28,200
Help!

671
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,166
Anyone!

672
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:38,000
Okay. Let's hurry up.

673
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,333
Let's hurry up and move.

674
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,333
Come this way.

675
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,133
- Are you practicing hard?
- We brought some seniors.

676
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:47,800
- DICKPUNKS.
- DICKPUNKS.

677
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,567
- DICKPUNKS. Seniors.
- They aren't DICKPUNKS.

678
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,900
- They're N.O.B.
- We're N.O.B.

679
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,066
They're N.O.B.

680
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,767
Isn't that Yong-jin in the back?

681
00:34:57,834 --> 00:34:59,166
- In the back?
- No.

682
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,233
Isn't that Lee Yong-jin?

683
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,867
I was mistaken. I'm sorry.

684
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:06,033
- I've heard that many times.
- I thought he was Yong-jin.

685
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:08,200
- There's a big resemblance.
- Right?

686
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,166
- I thought he was Yong-jin.
- Seriously.

687
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:13,233
Who do we have here? Senior, you're here.

688
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,600
- My goodness.
- She's Song Eun-i.

689
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,600
- Eun-i and Yong-jin.
- Senior Song.

690
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,900
- Senior Song.
- Come on in.

691
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,467
- The Dance Club. JENNIE, come here.
- Senior Song.

692
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:24,400
Senior Song.

693
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,300
The game you'll play this time is
Relay Singing with Animal Sounds.

694
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,734
What's that?

695
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:31,400
It's the Dance Club versus the Band Club.

696
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,100
- We'll show you a song title.
- Okay.

697
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,433
Everyone else will wear a headset,

698
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:39,200
and you'll sing with animal sounds.

699
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,133
They are excited.

700
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,800
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

701
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,934
Let's hurry up and leave

702
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:56,400
"Woman on the Beach" by COOL.

703
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,900
There you go.

704
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,600
- That was easy.
- Sorry.

705
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,433
The winning team will receive
a vital clue and a delicious meal.

706
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:06,500
- We must win.
- Yes. Let's go.

707
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,567
- We must win.
- We must win.

708
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:10,567
- I'll give the question.
- Wouldn't it be better to guess?

709
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:12,133
- Jung-ha.
- Mouse.

710
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:13,533
Tae-hyun, King Kong.

711
00:36:13,533 --> 00:36:15,900
- Na-ra, dolphin.
- Dolphin?

712
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,900
Let's begin.

713
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,367
- Get ready.
- Good.

714
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:19,467
Set, go.

715
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,333
What was it?

716
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:35,600
That's incredible. Keep going.

717
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,700
- Go.
- Go.

718
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,266
- Hurry up and go.
- Go.

719
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:39,934
My goodness.

720
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,166
The melody is easy,
but I don't know the song title.

721
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,600
- Just sing.
- I'll remember.

722
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,433
- I'm King Kong.
- Okay.

723
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:57,066
He channeled King Kong.

724
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:03,300
- Na-ra knows it.
- He's good.

725
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,200
- Na-ra knows it.
- You're a dolphin.

726
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,100
What's the song title?

727
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,633
What's the song title?

728
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:13,166
Hey, it's...

729
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,900
It's a very famous song.

730
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,367
Ready, go. Dolphin.

731
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,533
Na-ra.

732
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:27,500
Hold on.

733
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,633
It sounds like someone is pulling her.

734
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:37,967
Hold on.

735
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:42,367
- He got it.
- He got it.

736
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:45,800
Korea Sings.

737
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:48,133
- Who's the artist?
- What?

738
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,633
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

739
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:52,533
- The artist of Korea Sings?
- Four, three,

740
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:54,633
- two, one.
- Is there an artist?

741
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:56,233
- Tae Jin-ah.
- Is there an artist?

742
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,433
Tae Jin-ah.

743
00:37:57,433 --> 00:37:59,000
- Tae Jin-ah.
- Is there an artist?

744
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,567
Why did you sing
"Apartment" by Yoon Su-il like that?

745
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:04,100
- For goodness' sake.
- It was "Apartment"?

746
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,033
For goodness' sake.

747
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,300
It was "Apartment"?

748
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,333
"APARTMENT" BY YOON SU-IL

749
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:09,367
It was...

750
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:13,100
- Na-ra, why did you even try so hard?
- My goodness.

751
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,400
What was the melody?

752
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:16,133
Oh, that's right!

753
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,834
- I'm sorry.
- He sang the theme song for Korea Sings.

754
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:23,500
King Kong is too hard.

755
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,600
Ready, go.

756
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:31,233
- It's easy.
- Hey.

757
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:33,600
- It's easy.
- It's easy. But you never know.

758
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:35,700
Hey.

759
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,533
He got it.

760
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:59,000
How should I do this?

761
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:01,900
How should I do this? I'm King Kong.

762
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,266
- King Kong isn't easy.
- King Kong and the dolphin.

763
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,433
It's a monster.

764
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,900
It's a monster.

765
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,800
- He's charismatic.
- The Hulk.

766
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,467
Na-ra doesn't recognize it.

767
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:25,533
He's the problem.

768
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,533
No.

769
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,767
No, stop.

770
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,834
What was that? Listen.

771
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:37,233
How am I supposed to sing as King Kong?

772
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,767
I...

773
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:46,100
- Hold on.
- Why?

774
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,300
- Go.
- Look at her toes.

775
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,033
- She keeps them pointed.
- They give her energy.

776
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,100
I'm an actress.
Can't you protect my image?

777
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:05,533
I don't know what song it is.

778
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,767
- I think you know it.
- I don't know it.

779
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,667
- That's the correct melody.
- Is it?

780
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:15,800
Go ahead.

781
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,400
- What's the answer? Five, four...
- It's correct.

782
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,867
- He'd know.
- ...three...

783
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:24,500
The melody really is correct.

784
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,667
- The melody really is correct.
- It's correct.

785
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:32,934
"10 Minutes" by Lee Hyo-ri. Is it correct?

786
00:40:32,934 --> 00:40:33,834
Is it correct?

787
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,000
Is it correct?

788
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,133
Is it correct?

789
00:40:40,867 --> 00:40:42,200
"10 Minutes"?

790
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:44,000
Hey.

791
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,567
It's hard to sing it as King Kong.

792
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:47,433
It was "10 Minutes."

793
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:49,667
- Another one. This is fun.
- She has perfect pitch.

794
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,967
- I have perfect pitch.
- Seriously.

795
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:54,600
- Here comes the last one.
- You have perfect pitch.

796
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,900
Jung-ha, you're a duck.

797
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,734
- Crow.
- Cuckoo.

798
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:59,100
Get ready.

799
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:03,066
Set, go.

800
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,166
This one. They should get this one right.

801
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,066
They should.

802
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:13,166
It's easy.

803
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
That's it.

804
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:20,066
I see.

805
00:41:20,066 --> 00:41:22,734
It's easy. Okay.

806
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:25,500
- It's a freebie.
- It's a freebie.

807
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,800
- He's friends with the artist.
- They're friends.

808
00:41:37,133 --> 00:41:38,166
It was so nice.

809
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:39,567
He's a vocalist.

810
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:42,667
Five, four,

811
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,000
three, two, one.

812
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,934
What's the answer?

813
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:49,000
- You have to know it.
- Sing it again.

814
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,500
- Hey.
- I love that song.

815
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,433
I hope he gets it right.

816
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:56,700
The lyrics go...

817
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,333
This is driving me crazy.

818
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,600
Hey, he's your friend.

819
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:05,066
- Gosh, this is...
- This is a catastrophe.

820
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,266
Hold on.

821
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,200
- Three, two, one. What's the answer?
- He doesn't know.

822
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:22,200
Jong-kook!

823
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,100
Is it incorrect?

824
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,900
Jong-kook!

825
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,800
Is it incorrect?

826
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,900
- How could you not know this song?
- Man, this is--

827
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,967
- You got the artist right.
- Jong-kook.

828
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:31,400
-"One Man."
- Jong-kook.

829
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,533
Kim Jong-kook's "One Man."

830
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:36,533
- I did nothing wrong. We did well.
- For goodness' sake.

831
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:38,533
- He failed to get it right.
- Just now...

832
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:39,600
That was a bit...

833
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,166
He should starve.

834
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:43,066
- I know. It can't be helped.
- What was that?

835
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:44,767
It's your punishment.

836
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:47,467
- I was so close.
- It can't be helped.

837
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:49,066
The Dance Club won.

838
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:53,133
- The Dance Club is the best.
- Of course.

839
00:42:54,967 --> 00:42:56,867
Here's your crucial hint.
Take these meal tickets.

840
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:04,934
Go to room 1403 to take a class.

841
00:43:04,934 --> 00:43:06,734
- Okay.
- Okay.

842
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:11,967
Let's go and eat.

843
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,367
As for the losing team...

844
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:16,533
- Please wait here for a moment.
- It looks like tteokbokki.

845
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:19,433
- It isn't half bad. I like it.
- What?

846
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:20,333
What is it?

847
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,400
Triangle-shaped gimbap.

848
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,633
It's perfect for university students.

849
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:27,233
- Yes.
- The combo meal of young people.

850
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:35,233
Let's go and take a look.

851
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:37,266
- Room 1403.
- Room 1403.

852
00:43:37,266 --> 00:43:38,500
Let's go.

853
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:41,100
Hold on.

854
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,233
Room 1403.

855
00:43:45,734 --> 00:43:47,867
Why are there so many club rooms?

856
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:50,567
- There must be something.
- The club rooms...

857
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:52,667
What's going on today?

858
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,934
What's the story today?

859
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:57,834
What is it?

860
00:43:57,834 --> 00:43:59,767
Room 1403.

861
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:04,967
I'm wearing skinny jeans
for the first time in years.

862
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:05,934
- What?
- Right. Skinny jeans.

863
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,367
It has been years.

864
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:10,233
- Skinny jeans used to be popular.
- In the 2010s...

865
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:13,967
They call colorful skinny jeans
mom jeans now.

866
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:15,700
Yes. "Why did you wear mom jeans?"

867
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,100
Girls' Generation.

868
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,333
What? Room 1403.

869
00:44:21,233 --> 00:44:22,500
- Room 1403.
- What's this place?

870
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,700
This is incredible.

871
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:38,300
Hello.

872
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:41,433
- Isn't that Woo-il?
- Woo-il.

873
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:43,533
You guys are freshmen.

874
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:44,667
- We're late.
- Sit down.

875
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:45,633
Okay.

876
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:48,367
Sit at the front.

877
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:50,900
I'm Teaching Assistant Im

878
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,066
of criminology.

879
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:53,633
He became a teaching assistant.

880
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:54,834
Isn't he a security guard?

881
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:58,967
Today's presentation is very important.

882
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:00,700
You should know

883
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,867
that I'll show it only once.

884
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,033
- Only once.
- It must be a clue.

885
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:09,400
Please listen to the lecture.

886
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,867
What's criminology?

887
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:14,467
-"Susuland" defined it...
- Excuse me?

888
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:16,867
-"Susuland" defined it...
- Excuse me?

889
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:18,266
- Sir.
- Who defined it?

890
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:20,433
Did you say "shoes"? What was that?

891
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:21,433
Please repeat yourself.

892
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:23,834
- What did he say?
- Please repeat yourself.

893
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:26,066
SUTHERLAND'S DEFINITION

894
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:30,834
-"Criminology versus criminal justice."
- What?

895
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:35,700
- Please read the English words.
-"The study of making laws, breaking laws,

896
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,900
and reacting to the breaking of laws."

897
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:43,166
That must be it.

898
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,667
These days, you can easily find

899
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:02,500
university students
who take a semester off.

900
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:05,900
These days, many students
attend university for five years.

901
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,633
College students left their schools

902
00:46:11,633 --> 00:46:13,233
and turned to robbery.

903
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:15,000
- Why?
- Students in their twenties...

904
00:46:16,533 --> 00:46:19,700
Students in their twenties
who were attending local universities...

905
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,367
Having run out of money,

906
00:46:21,367 --> 00:46:24,100
they hit a drunken man in his fifties
and stole his wallet

907
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,400
in the early morning hours of December 31

908
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,567
in Bongcheon-dong.

909
00:46:28,767 --> 00:46:29,800
Are you serious?

910
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,533
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

911
00:46:31,533 --> 00:46:34,500
At one convenience store
in Gangnam after 2 a.m.,

912
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,500
a masked man entered.

913
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,233
He suddenly took out a knife
and began to threaten the female employee.

914
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:42,166
Oh, my god.

915
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,633
All college students.

916
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:46,400
Since last November,
Mr. Jung, a college student...

917
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,900
After losing ten million won
and squandering the rest,

918
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,567
he turned to crime.

919
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:52,700
- What could it be?
- Well...

920
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,400
I'm out of college. I graduated.

921
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,133
That's what I think.

922
00:46:57,133 --> 00:47:00,367
I was tired of working part-time
while pursuing a college education.

923
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:04,633
Three youths were arrested
on robbery charges.

924
00:47:05,266 --> 00:47:07,900
Regretting their actions now
won't help them.

925
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,934
ROBBERY CASES
RESULTING IN BODILY INJURY

926
00:47:09,934 --> 00:47:12,233
Is it a serial robbery case?

927
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,066
CHECK OUT THE CLUB ROOMS:
ART, PHOTOGRAPHY, GARDENING

928
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:16,133
- Club rooms.
- Club rooms?

929
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,667
- Art, Photography, Gardening.
- Art, Photography, Gardening.

930
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:21,800
Art, Photography, Gardening.

931
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,467
What did you think of the video?

932
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:27,567
What?

933
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:30,333
- Where are the students?
- Where are they?

934
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:31,867
- That startled me.
- What?

935
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,567
- Where are the students?
- Where are they?

936
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:35,834
- That startled me.
- What?

937
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:36,800
- Where are they?
- Where are they?

938
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,700
Where are they?

939
00:47:40,934 --> 00:47:41,767
What?

940
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:45,667
Where did they go?

941
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,600
- There's no door.
- When...

942
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,734
- Where are they?
- There's no door.

943
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:55,433
- Where did they go?
- What?

944
00:47:55,433 --> 00:47:57,266
- Where did they go?
- Where did they go?

945
00:47:57,266 --> 00:47:59,700
- I can't believe it.
- No way. When did they disappear?

946
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,333
- Why does the scale keep getting bigger?
- What?

947
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:05,367
No way.

948
00:48:12,533 --> 00:48:13,667
No way.

949
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,200
- Is this magic?
- Where did they go?

950
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:20,767
- Where did they go?
- My goodness.

951
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:23,166
Art, Photography, and Gardening?

952
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,166
What was the missing information?

953
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:27,467
Since last November, Mr. Jung...

954
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:30,033
After losing ten million won
and squandering the rest,

955
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:31,900
he turned to crime.

956
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,734
What was the reason why
he lost ten million won?

957
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:37,934
- Did he gamble?
- That could be the case.

958
00:48:37,934 --> 00:48:40,200
We should go to those club rooms.

959
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,533
My goodness.

960
00:48:41,533 --> 00:48:43,433
Art, Photography, and Gardening.

961
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:47,800
Shall we check out the clue?

962
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,233
Yes, let's check out the clue. Is this it?

963
00:48:50,233 --> 00:48:51,567
- Here.
- Is there a clue inside?

964
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,467
"Check out the club rooms: Art Club,
Photography Club, and Gardening Club."

965
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,567
Art, Photography, and Gardening.

966
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,100
- Now?
- Shall we check them out first?

967
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,533
- Let's do that.
- Let's go.

968
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,100
The other team
must've gotten a better clue.

969
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,133
That's right.

970
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:13,800
Art Club, Photography Club...

971
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,333
- Here's the Art Club.
- Art Club.

972
00:49:19,433 --> 00:49:20,600
Let's go inside.

973
00:49:22,233 --> 00:49:24,734
- They're painting something.
- She's the senior we saw earlier.

974
00:49:34,934 --> 00:49:37,100
Guys. Have you seen Min-su?

975
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,567
Why are you painting the canvas black?
What are you painting?

976
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:44,433
My future.

977
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,500
- What?
- What did she say?

978
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,133
She's painting her future.

979
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:50,834
She's painting her future.

980
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:55,133
Is there only this bit of hope?

981
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:58,500
- We have to finish it by today.
- You have to finish it by today?

982
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:02,100
They have to finish it by today.

983
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,567
Her future.

984
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:06,834
They have to finish it by today.
What do they need to finish?

985
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,433
Look at these.

986
00:50:10,533 --> 00:50:11,500
They're all dark.

987
00:50:12,066 --> 00:50:13,533
- They're black.
- They're black.

988
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:15,300
- Is this a puzzle?
- Seriously.

989
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:21,433
How do we put them together?

990
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:22,900
The paintings...

991
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,633
One is entirely black.
One was painted diagonally.

992
00:50:25,633 --> 00:50:26,834
Why are they different?

993
00:50:26,834 --> 00:50:29,734
I'm really bad at things like this.
My brain doesn't work.

994
00:50:31,433 --> 00:50:32,900
- Photography Club.
- Right.

995
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,967
Art, Photography, Gardening.

996
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:36,734
The Dance Club is coming.

997
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:38,734
What should we do?

998
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,100
We didn't figure anything out.

999
00:50:43,734 --> 00:50:45,367
What's in there?

1000
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:51,667
There are people inside.

1001
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,967
- Photography Club.
- Jae-seok, Photography Club.

1002
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:04,100
Art, Photography, Gardening.

1003
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:21,734
Shall we find the clue?

1004
00:51:21,734 --> 00:51:24,000
Back then... Yes. DSLR.

1005
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:30,200
Back then, phone photos
weren't high-resolution like they are now.

1006
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,367
That's right.

1007
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:33,000
Back then, people carried cameras.

1008
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:35,266
DSLR.

1009
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,700
Photos.

1010
00:51:39,467 --> 00:51:42,033
Jae-seok, the photos must mean something.

1011
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:43,400
What could they mean?

1012
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,600
Photos or drawings usually contain clues.

1013
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,834
Yes.

1014
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:55,533
Cat. Tiger.

1015
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:56,700
Animals.

1016
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,600
It's a photo of the Louvre Museum.

1017
00:52:06,433 --> 00:52:07,767
The Louvre.

1018
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,900
- That's the Eiffel Tower.
- Paris.

1019
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,300
- I see a lot of French scenery.
- France.

1020
00:52:18,734 --> 00:52:20,400
- Let's visit other club rooms too.
- Okay.

1021
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,567
- Why the photo of the Louvre?
- Good question.

1022
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:26,100
- Why the photos of Europe?
- Paris.

1023
00:52:32,934 --> 00:52:34,867
There are animal photos.

1024
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:36,967
Three dogs.

1025
00:52:36,967 --> 00:52:39,000
The Louvre.

1026
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:41,633
What's this photo?

1027
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:42,533
What is it?

1028
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:49,900
Am I stupid?
Why can't I figure anything out?

1029
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,233
Let's go to the room next door.

1030
00:52:51,233 --> 00:52:53,767
We'll be able to find
the common denominator.

1031
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:01,767
Gardening Club.

1032
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,300
This room is full of greenery.

1033
00:53:15,467 --> 00:53:17,333
Na-ra, the blueberry juice looks good.

1034
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,333
- What is it?
- I don't know. Can we drink it?

1035
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,467
The blueberry juice is out of place.

1036
00:53:29,934 --> 00:53:32,367
This room has nothing in common
with the other rooms.

1037
00:53:32,367 --> 00:53:33,533
- It's here.
- Here.

1038
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:38,367
What? There are students inside.

1039
00:53:38,867 --> 00:53:39,934
What? Why...

1040
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,900
What could these be?

1041
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:48,767
There are numbers.

1042
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:54,300
There are so many.

1043
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:55,867
This is number 17.

1044
00:53:55,867 --> 00:53:57,233
Jae-seok, let's take all of them.

1045
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,200
- Yes.
- We should take all of them.

1046
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:03,467
What? I think the students
are making similar paintings.

1047
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,900
They're painting the paper black.

1048
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,333
Shall we go somewhere more spacious
and put these together?

1049
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:11,400
- Shall we do that?
- Yes.

1050
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,967
Let's look for a hint.

1051
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:21,033
Jae-seok, this is number one.

1052
00:54:21,033 --> 00:54:22,266
- Number two.
- Number two.

1053
00:54:22,266 --> 00:54:24,033
- Which way should I lay it?
- Hold on.

1054
00:54:24,533 --> 00:54:25,633
Here.

1055
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,200
- Number three.
- It's missing.

1056
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,166
Number 13.

1057
00:54:31,734 --> 00:54:32,900
- Twenty-two--
- Here's number three.

1058
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,967
Give me number three.

1059
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,533
- What?
- Jae-seok, this is it.

1060
00:54:39,433 --> 00:54:40,767
It's a triangle.

1061
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,300
Why am I always clueless?

1062
00:54:44,133 --> 00:54:45,800
What are we supposed to look at?

1063
00:54:47,767 --> 00:54:49,000
A triangle.

1064
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:52,934
A triangle.

1065
00:54:52,934 --> 00:54:54,367
- You're right.
- A Triangle.

1066
00:54:57,367 --> 00:54:58,900
- It's that way.
- That way.

1067
00:54:59,467 --> 00:55:01,233
There should be another one in the middle.

1068
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:04,300
What case is related to triangles?

1069
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,667
- You're right.
- A triangle.

1070
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:15,767
A case that's related to triangles.

1071
00:55:16,266 --> 00:55:17,533
- Here.
- That's right.

1072
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:20,400
Here.

1073
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,467
Having run out of money,

1074
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:25,233
they hit a drunken man in his fifties
and stole his wallet

1075
00:55:25,233 --> 00:55:27,467
in the early morning hours of December 31

1076
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:29,133
in Bongcheon-dong.

1077
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:31,567
"How big is the harvest?"

1078
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:38,800
"How big is the harvest?"

1079
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,533
- I know what it is.
- What?

1080
00:55:44,533 --> 00:55:45,867
A pyramid.

1081
00:55:46,433 --> 00:55:48,367
- A pyramid? No way.
- A pyramid.

1082
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:51,467
- A pyramid.
- It's a pyramid.

1083
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:54,400
A case that's related to triangles.

1084
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,367
- A pyramid.
- A pyramid.

1085
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:58,600
- It must be a pyramid.
- A pyramid case.

1086
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00,967
- Pyramid scheme.
- You're right.

1087
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:08,834
Come to think of it,

1088
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:10,934
Nakwon University's symbol is a pyramid.

1089
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,734
You're right. The school symbol.

1090
00:56:12,734 --> 00:56:14,834
- The school symbol is a pyramid.
- The symbol.

1091
00:56:16,266 --> 00:56:17,266
That's incredible.

1092
00:56:17,266 --> 00:56:18,800
It's a pyramid.

1093
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,033
Is "pyramid scheme" today's key word?

1094
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:24,266
I think I vaguely remember
a case involving students.

1095
00:56:24,266 --> 00:56:27,900
Their family members gave information
to news outlets and whatnot.

1096
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,867
With the new school year upon us,

1097
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:33,800
illegal pyramid schemes targeting
college students are becoming prevalent.

1098
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,133
The blueberry juice looks good.

1099
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,233
The blueberry juice is out of place.

1100
00:56:38,834 --> 00:56:42,166
Health food items were sold
at ten times the production cost.

1101
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,934
I looked for a job in order to earn money.

1102
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:47,734
They said I could make
ten million won a month.

1103
00:56:48,233 --> 00:56:50,233
There are handwritten posters.

1104
00:56:51,467 --> 00:56:54,900
-"My blood is boiling."
-"How could they increase the tuition?"

1105
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,166
PYRAMID

1106
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:58,600
College students who joined
a company running a pyramid scheme

1107
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,166
turned to robbery
when they couldn't meet the quota.

1108
00:57:05,934 --> 00:57:07,967
You serial robbing punk...

1109
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:10,166
- He's a culprit.
-"Serial robbing punk."

1110
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:13,500
I went there thinking
that it was a job fair.

1111
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,600
They drew a pyramid and said...

1112
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,333
- Do.
- Do.

1113
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,066
- Mi.
- Mi.

1114
00:57:19,066 --> 00:57:20,800
- La.
- La.

1115
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:22,800
Fi.

1116
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,100
What are they doing? A flash mob?

1117
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:31,867
The shape of the Louvre.

1118
00:57:31,867 --> 00:57:33,867
- The Louvre Pyramid.
- Pyramid.

1119
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,000
I see.

1120
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,400
There's a photo of a vanishing point.

1121
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:47,266
We know the pyramid scheme has a leader.

1122
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:49,000
That's right.

1123
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,767
- We need to find Min-su.
- Min-su.

1124
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,233
Min-su. That's right.

1125
00:57:53,233 --> 00:57:54,734
Let's put these away.

1126
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,333
Find Min-su.

1127
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:59,533
What's going on today?

1128
00:57:59,533 --> 00:58:02,367
- Did you find anything?
- Why didn't you go to eat?

1129
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,000
- Is it a packed lunch?
- Gimbap.

1130
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,433
I see. That sounds good.

1131
00:58:05,433 --> 00:58:06,700
It contains protein.

1132
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,533
It's nice. It isn't half bad.

1133
00:58:08,533 --> 00:58:10,333
Did you find anything?

1134
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,367
Find what?

1135
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:14,033
- I don't know anything.
- Your shoulders tell me that you do.

1136
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:17,667
- Do my shoulders hold a clue?
- Your shoulders. Lend them to me later.

1137
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:19,100
Do my shoulders hold a clue?

1138
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,934
Which one of us is it today?

1139
00:58:22,934 --> 00:58:24,133
There's something, right?

1140
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,533
We don't know if a spy is among us or not.

1141
00:58:27,867 --> 00:58:29,233
- What?
- It's a cafeteria.

1142
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:31,533
It is. I bet it'll be great.

1143
00:58:44,767 --> 00:58:46,300
Cafeteria.

1144
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,700
What about us?

1145
00:58:52,266 --> 00:58:54,700
- I love cafeterias.
- I see.

1146
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,567
- I'm a huge fan. What?
- What?

1147
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,100
What? What is it?

1148
00:59:02,867 --> 00:59:03,800
Peeakaboo.

1149
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,667
- What? My goodness.
- What?

1150
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,500
Just how much do they pay you?

1151
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,533
Woo-il, are you trying to get rich?

1152
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:11,367
Woo-il is here again?

1153
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:14,567
Does Woo-il get paid per scene?

1154
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:18,133
Who is he this time? Auntie Woo-il?

1155
00:59:18,133 --> 00:59:19,367
Woo-il.

1156
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:22,100
- It isn't easy to make a living.
- Auntie Woo-il.

1157
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,867
You're like a chameleon.

1158
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:27,066
- Put your meal ticket here.
- Okay.

1159
00:59:27,066 --> 00:59:29,667
- I feel like I'm at school.
- I know.

1160
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:34,767
It's stir-fried pork.

1161
00:59:35,467 --> 00:59:37,100
This kimchi looks delicious.

1162
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,834
Gosh, this is great. There's rice.

1163
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:46,700
I'll put the stir-fried pork over rice.

1164
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,533
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the food.

1165
00:59:48,533 --> 00:59:49,600
I'll enjoy the food.

1166
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,834
- I haven't had this milk in a while.
- Take one.

1167
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:55,633
- I haven't had this milk in a while.
- Thank you for the food.

1168
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:56,934
Enjoy the food.

1169
00:59:58,133 --> 01:00:00,934
- I'm so happy.
- Why?

1170
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:02,567
- I have food.
- Right.

1171
01:00:02,567 --> 01:00:04,934
- I feel like a student.
- Enjoy the food.

1172
01:00:05,934 --> 01:00:08,033
This is a taste I absolutely love.

1173
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:09,900
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

1174
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:13,000
It's tasty.

1175
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:16,867
Jung-ha.

1176
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:19,500
It's tasty.

1177
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,967
It's definitely a pyramid scheme.

1178
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:34,734
- How do you know?
- Look over there.

1179
01:00:34,734 --> 01:00:36,233
Pizza. Ramyeon.

1180
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,700
Miyeokguk or seaweed soup. Dressed salad.

1181
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,100
PYRAMID

1182
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:43,767
The milk is shaped like a pyramid too.

1183
01:00:43,767 --> 01:00:45,900
- It's a triangle.
- That's right.

1184
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,166
You're right.

1185
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:50,500
Jae-seok, they don't know
about the key word,

1186
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,734
- pyramid.
- They do.

1187
01:00:51,734 --> 01:00:54,266
- Do they?
- Jung-ha came to me and asked.

1188
01:00:54,266 --> 01:00:56,734
- Can you share information?
- I figured it out.

1189
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,233
- I figured it out too.
- Really?

1190
01:00:59,867 --> 01:01:01,567
Does it have three syllables?

1191
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:04,266
The next key word has one syllable.

1192
01:01:05,934 --> 01:01:07,233
- Is it right?
- Yes.

1193
01:01:07,233 --> 01:01:09,266
- I think they only have a vague idea.
- Yes.

1194
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,633
A vague idea.

1195
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,500
Hold on. I feel like
people are disappearing one by one.

1196
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,500
Why do people keep leaving
in the middle of eating?

1197
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,200
Aren't they leaving
since they finished eating?

1198
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,233
- Right?
- Yes. That has to be the case.

1199
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:33,433
Gosh, they don't let up
even during mealtime.

1200
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,300
Jung-ha.

1201
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,200
Yes, Jae-seok?

1202
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,033
You shouldn't get up
before an elder finishes eating.

1203
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,500
- I'm sorry.
- Come here.

1204
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:50,367
Thank you.

1205
01:01:53,567 --> 01:01:55,967
Why are you questioning everything
during mealtime?

1206
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,533
- Aren't you going to make deductions?
- What?

1207
01:01:58,533 --> 01:02:01,533
Aren't you going to make deductions?
You aren't here to eat.

1208
01:02:01,533 --> 01:02:03,867
The culprit will get caught
by the time we finish filming.

1209
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,600
Don't worry.

1210
01:02:08,166 --> 01:02:10,133
The culprit will get caught
by the time we're done.

1211
01:02:10,133 --> 01:02:11,166
You have a point.

1212
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:14,967
Today is finally the day
Jae-seok has a role.

1213
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:21,400
Why does he keep whispering?

1214
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:26,500
- They all left.
- Yes. They all disappeared.

1215
01:02:31,467 --> 01:02:33,166
What does it mean?

1216
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:36,500
They left since they were done eating.
They couldn't stay here all day.

1217
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,767
You have a point.

1218
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:39,266
- Right?
- Yes.

1219
01:02:39,266 --> 01:02:40,233
Thank you for the food.

1220
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:44,300
Do I put it in here?

1221
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,066
I think you can leave it there.

1222
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:47,567
Thank you for the food.

1223
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:50,400
What?

1224
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:55,300
There's no exit over here.
How did the students leave?

1225
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,367
TRAY RETURN

1226
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,567
Their food trays are here,
but they disappeared.

1227
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:21,133
I just find it so strange.

1228
01:03:21,133 --> 01:03:22,734
Why did they disappear?

1229
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,867
What?

1230
01:03:26,767 --> 01:03:29,433
- Where did they go?
- There's no door.

1231
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:32,300
- Jae-seok, there must be a secret.
- Seriously.

1232
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,834
Finding the door must be our mission.

1233
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:37,667
Today, we must receive
the second crucial clue.

1234
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,934
We must win the second game.

1235
01:03:50,867 --> 01:03:54,500
You'll now play a game
for the second crucial clue.

1236
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,533
That sounds good.

1237
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,166
All right.

1238
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,633
We must win this clue.

1239
01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:02,467
It's the Dance Club versus the Band Club.

1240
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:04,567
Please decide on your team chant.

1241
01:04:04,567 --> 01:04:06,867
The team chant should be short.

1242
01:04:06,867 --> 01:04:09,533
Ours will be JENNIE.

1243
01:04:09,533 --> 01:04:10,433
JENNIE.

1244
01:04:11,033 --> 01:04:12,033
- Yes. JENNIE.
- JENNIE.

1245
01:04:12,033 --> 01:04:14,166
- JENNIE is perfect.
- JENNIE.

1246
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:16,266
- Bong-seok?
- Bong-seok.

1247
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:20,867
The game you'll play this time is
Say Two Things Each.

1248
01:04:20,867 --> 01:04:21,767
Two things?

1249
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:24,000
Saying one thing is hard enough.

1250
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,867
For example,
Name two three-syllable foods each.

1251
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,166
Bong-seok. Tonkatsu. Seaweed soup.

1252
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:31,467
- Jjajangmyeon.
- You need to go faster.

1253
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:32,734
JENNIE. Tonkatsu, jjajangmyeon.

1254
01:04:32,734 --> 01:04:34,300
Seaweed soup, fried dumplings.

1255
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,500
Tangsuyuk, mala soup.

1256
01:04:37,834 --> 01:04:39,633
- You're the best.
- Mala soup was ingenious.

1257
01:04:39,633 --> 01:04:41,033
- All right.
- You're the best.

1258
01:04:41,033 --> 01:04:42,900
This game requires quick wits.

1259
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,800
Name two male actors each.

1260
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:50,400
JENNIE.

1261
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,200
- JENNIE.
- JENNIE.

1262
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,500
Lee Jung-jae, Jung Woo-sung.

1263
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,800
Son Suk-ku, Zo In-sung.

1264
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,300
- Cha Tae-hyun, Jung-ha.
- All right.

1265
01:04:58,467 --> 01:04:59,600
- Cha Tae-hyun, Jung-ha.
- All right.

1266
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:02,467
- So fast.
- Male actors.

1267
01:05:02,467 --> 01:05:04,467
Bong-seok. Yes.

1268
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:05,700
Cha In-pyo, Cha Tae-hyun.

1269
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,467
Bong-seok. Yes. Cha In-pyo, Cha Tae-hyun.

1270
01:05:08,467 --> 01:05:11,767
It ended when you said "Yes."

1271
01:05:14,266 --> 01:05:17,967
- JENNIE. Won Bin, Jung Woo-sung.
- Son Suk-ku, Zo In-sung.

1272
01:05:17,967 --> 01:05:20,667
- Cha Tae-hyun, Jung-hyun.
- All right.

1273
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:23,900
Jung-hyun.

1274
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:26,500
- Hurry up.
- Here.

1275
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,266
Yes. Here.

1276
01:05:28,266 --> 01:05:31,433
Jang Hyuk, Jang Hyuk, Jang Hyuk.
What am I doing?

1277
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:35,266
Jang Hyuk. What am I doing?

1278
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:38,967
For goodness' sake.

1279
01:05:39,934 --> 01:05:42,567
JENNIE. Cha In-pyo, Cha Bum-kun.
That came out wrong.

1280
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,266
Cha In-pyo, Cha Bum-kun.
That came out wrong.

1281
01:05:46,834 --> 01:05:47,767
Hold on.

1282
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:51,000
Cha In-pyo, Cha Bum-kun.
That came out wrong.

1283
01:05:51,567 --> 01:05:52,734
- Go, Na-ra.
- Okay.

1284
01:05:52,734 --> 01:05:54,900
Jung-ha.

1285
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,734
-"Bong-seok" is the team chant.
- Right.

1286
01:05:57,667 --> 01:06:01,166
Right. Bong-seok.

1287
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,000
Cha In-pyo, Cha Tae-hyun.

1288
01:06:05,033 --> 01:06:07,367
JENNIE. Lee Jung-jae, Jung Woo-sung.

1289
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:10,367
Gosh.

1290
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,700
JENNIE. Cha In-pyo, Cha Tae-hyun.

1291
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,000
Son Suk-ku, Zo In-sung.

1292
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,533
Shim Yang-hong, Jung-ha.

1293
01:06:16,533 --> 01:06:18,533
Well done.

1294
01:06:18,533 --> 01:06:21,433
- Shim Yang-hong. Okay.
- It has been a while...

1295
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,734
- Gosh.
- Jung-ha?

1296
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:25,200
Why just "Jung-ha"?

1297
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,133
- It's Lee Jung-ha.
- It's Lee Jung-ha.

1298
01:06:28,133 --> 01:06:29,533
- Jung-ha.
- It's Jung-ha.

1299
01:06:29,533 --> 01:06:31,600
It's Jung-ha. Okay.

1300
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,600
- It's hard to say them suddenly.
- Yes.

1301
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,767
- If someone says your answer--
- You get flustered.

1302
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:36,967
You get flustered.

1303
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:39,266
Let's begin.

1304
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:40,900
Capitals.

1305
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,066
JENNIE. Tokyo and Washington, DC.

1306
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:44,800
- Why did you steal my answer?
- Hey.

1307
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,900
JENNIE. Tokyo and Washington, DC.

1308
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,133
- Why did you steal my answer?
- Hey.

1309
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:53,667
Bong-seok.

1310
01:06:53,667 --> 01:06:55,100
Tokyo, Washington, DC.

1311
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,033
Seoul, Pyongyang.

1312
01:06:57,033 --> 01:07:01,300
Daejeon, Daegu. Hold on a second.

1313
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,967
Hold on a second.

1314
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:05,867
What was that?

1315
01:07:05,867 --> 01:07:09,033
Bong-seok. Seoul, North Korea.

1316
01:07:09,033 --> 01:07:10,867
Seoul, North Korea.

1317
01:07:12,867 --> 01:07:14,967
- My goodness.
- North Korea?

1318
01:07:14,967 --> 01:07:17,400
Where did North Korea come from?

1319
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,934
- Hey.
- North Korea?

1320
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,233
- Tae-hyun said it too.
- Pyongyang.

1321
01:07:22,233 --> 01:07:23,867
- Pyongyang.
- Pyongyang.

1322
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,800
Where did North Korea come from?

1323
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,567
We're really bad at this.

1324
01:07:28,567 --> 01:07:30,500
We're bad at games like this.

1325
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,066
Let's begin.

1326
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,266
This is hard.
I can't think of them quickly.

1327
01:07:37,266 --> 01:07:40,066
- Name two female idol groups each.
- Bong-seok.

1328
01:07:40,066 --> 01:07:41,900
Bong-seok.

1329
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,166
Fin.K.L, Girls' Generation.

1330
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:44,934
BLACKPINK, BLACKPINK.

1331
01:07:44,934 --> 01:07:46,266
- What?
- JENNIE.

1332
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:50,900
BLACKPINK, BLACKPINK.

1333
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,700
JENNIE.

1334
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,100
BLACKPINK is the only idol group I know.

1335
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,734
I'll answer.

1336
01:07:57,734 --> 01:08:01,767
JENNIE. BLACKPINK, Girls' Generation.

1337
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:03,133
Red Velvet, TWICE.

1338
01:08:03,133 --> 01:08:04,633
Secret, Apink.

1339
01:08:05,567 --> 01:08:08,767
We're good at this.

1340
01:08:08,767 --> 01:08:11,367
- We're young.
- This is good.

1341
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:14,066
For goodness' sake.
Why are we so bad at this game?

1342
01:08:14,066 --> 01:08:16,233
Hey, Bong-seok.

1343
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,100
Tae-hyun hasn't gotten to open
his mouth once.

1344
01:08:21,433 --> 01:08:22,667
Let's begin.

1345
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:24,967
Name two song titles each
with a color in them.

1346
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,000
Songs with a color in the title?

1347
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,533
- Songs with a color in the title?
- This one is hard.

1348
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,000
Let's wait and steal their answers.

1349
01:08:35,166 --> 01:08:36,734
JENNIE.

1350
01:08:36,734 --> 01:08:38,400
"Yellow Balloon," "Red Balloon."

1351
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,800
"Yellow Balloon," "Red Balloon."

1352
01:08:43,567 --> 01:08:45,567
Those have to be actual songs.

1353
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:47,033
"Yellow Balloon" isn't a song title.

1354
01:08:47,033 --> 01:08:48,567
JENNIE.

1355
01:08:48,567 --> 01:08:50,834
That's not a song?
Then I don't have anything.

1356
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:52,767
Let's begin. Bong-seok.

1357
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:54,867
"Yellow Sky." Hold on.

1358
01:08:54,867 --> 01:08:56,734
Let's begin. Bong-seok.

1359
01:08:56,734 --> 01:09:00,333
-"Yellow Sky." Hold on.
-"Yellow Sky."

1360
01:09:01,734 --> 01:09:03,200
JENNIE.

1361
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,600
"Violet Fragrance," "Blue Land."

1362
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,934
"Red Flavor," "Blue Flavor."

1363
01:09:08,734 --> 01:09:11,166
"Red Flavor," "Blue Flavor."

1364
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:12,767
- I don't know.
- What a rhyme.

1365
01:09:12,767 --> 01:09:13,667
"Red Flavor" works.

1366
01:09:13,667 --> 01:09:16,500
I almost let it pass.
I almost said "Green Flavor."

1367
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,867
"Blue Land."

1368
01:09:17,867 --> 01:09:19,400
- Bong-seok.
- Bong-seok.

1369
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,266
They're done. JENNIE.

1370
01:09:22,266 --> 01:09:23,767
"Pink Venom," "Red Flavor."

1371
01:09:23,767 --> 01:09:25,467
"Violet Fragrance," "Blue Land."

1372
01:09:25,467 --> 01:09:27,734
"Red Sunset Glow," "Red Shoes."

1373
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:28,633
"Red Shoes"?

1374
01:09:28,633 --> 01:09:29,967
-"Red Shoes" by SeeYa.
-"Red Shoes."

1375
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:31,667
- It's an actual song.
- It is.

1376
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,633
- It's an actual song.
- It's incorrect.

1377
01:09:33,633 --> 01:09:36,767
- They were too slow.
- Incorrect.

1378
01:09:36,767 --> 01:09:38,433
-"Red Shoes" by SeeYa.
- Incorrect.

1379
01:09:38,433 --> 01:09:41,033
Isn't it "Red Shoes"? Is it "Shoes"?

1380
01:09:41,033 --> 01:09:42,633
It's "Shoes." Incorrect.

1381
01:09:43,867 --> 01:09:45,667
- All right. Ready, go.
- For goodness' sake.

1382
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:46,867
"Shoes."

1383
01:09:46,867 --> 01:09:48,667
Bong-seok. "Pink Venom," "Red Flavor."

1384
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:50,433
"Violet Fragrance," "White Magnolia."

1385
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:53,133
"Sky Blue Balloon,"
"Man in a Yellow T-Shirt."

1386
01:09:56,367 --> 01:09:58,300
- It's "Man in a Yellow Shirt."
- For goodness' sake.

1387
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,834
- For goodness' sake.
- JENNIE.

1388
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:03,367
JENNIE. "Violet Fragrance," "Blue Land."

1389
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:05,066
"Red Flavor," "Pink Venom."

1390
01:10:05,066 --> 01:10:06,633
"Red Sunset Glow," "Blue."

1391
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,600
-"Blue."
-"Blue."

1392
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,900
-"Blue."
- It counts.

1393
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,367
- My goodness.
- Okay.

1394
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,500
Isn't "Man in a Yellow T-Shirt" a song?

1395
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:18,767
- It's "Shirt."
- It's "Shirt"?

1396
01:10:18,767 --> 01:10:21,333
It's "Shirt"? "A Yellow Shirt"?

1397
01:10:22,066 --> 01:10:23,700
The Dance Club won.

1398
01:10:26,233 --> 01:10:27,567
Oh, no. We needed to win.

1399
01:10:27,567 --> 01:10:29,734
- We fought well.
- We did well.

1400
01:10:29,734 --> 01:10:32,133
- This is for the losing team.
- We get one too.

1401
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:33,567
The losing team gets something.

1402
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,834
- Na-ra is hilarious.
- For goodness' sake.

1403
01:10:39,233 --> 01:10:41,033
Shall I drink a cup of cold water?

1404
01:10:41,033 --> 01:10:42,667
Go ahead, Jung-ha.

1405
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:45,333
Bong-seok.

1406
01:10:46,934 --> 01:10:49,033
Ta-da. How do you want it?

1407
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:51,633
As for me, I like it rich.

1408
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:54,100
It's important to add
the right amount of water.

1409
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,633
- You'll be surprised.
- Why?

1410
01:10:55,633 --> 01:10:58,400
This was developed
by the Entrepreneurship Club.

1411
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,934
- It features a new technology.
- What is it?

1412
01:11:00,066 --> 01:11:01,233
Hi.

1413
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,900
I want 180 ml of water.

1414
01:11:09,467 --> 01:11:12,166
Pouring 180 ml of water.

1415
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:15,000
The machine measures it itself.

1416
01:11:15,633 --> 01:11:17,700
As you can see,
the measurement is precise.

1417
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,567
- It must be great for cooking.
- Very nice.

1418
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:22,467
This would help kids develop math skills.

1419
01:11:22,467 --> 01:11:24,900
What's 120 plus 180?

1420
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,300
- It's 300.
- It's 300.

1421
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:29,567
Cheers.

1422
01:11:34,266 --> 01:11:36,567
Both teams can move freely now.

1423
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:38,700
Se-chan and Jung-ha,
you'll film something first.

1424
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,300
Let me know what you find.
I'll join you afterward.

1425
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:44,400
What is it?

1426
01:11:49,133 --> 01:11:51,767
MEMORIES FROM 2011

1427
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:53,233
WINNING TEAM - LOSING TEAM

1428
01:11:53,233 --> 01:11:55,600
GO TO THE GYM - GO TO THE GYM

1429
01:11:58,667 --> 01:12:00,667
-"Go to the gym."
- The gym.

1430
01:12:00,667 --> 01:12:01,700
Let's go.

1431
01:12:03,934 --> 01:12:05,100
Jae-seok, is it you?

1432
01:12:06,834 --> 01:12:07,934
Jae-seok, is it you?

1433
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,100
- It isn't me.
- It's you.

1434
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,467
Why don't you come clean
since it's just us two here?

1435
01:12:13,467 --> 01:12:16,166
- I'll help you.
- It isn't me.

1436
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,900
- Here it is. Number two.
- Where?

1437
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,967
- We were at number three, so...
- Straight ahead?

1438
01:12:23,233 --> 01:12:24,600
Is this the gym? Yes, it is.

1439
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,367
Where did Jae-seok and JENNIE go?

1440
01:12:29,934 --> 01:12:31,934
Na-ra, let's follow them.

1441
01:12:31,934 --> 01:12:33,500
- Let's go this way.
- The gym.

1442
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,567
Yes.

1443
01:12:34,567 --> 01:12:36,734
The gym looks very sleek.

1444
01:12:36,734 --> 01:12:38,967
What? There's a camcorder.

1445
01:12:46,266 --> 01:12:48,967
- I guess we can use it to watch the tape.
- That's right.

1446
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,200
The gym.

1447
01:12:57,367 --> 01:12:58,500
What?

1448
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,700
What about Jung-ha?

1449
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,600
Who?

1450
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,166
- Jung-ha.
- It's Se-chan.

1451
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:09,400
I promised to relay the information.

1452
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:11,300
It can't be helped.

1453
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,567
Besides, only two people can use
the earphones.

1454
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:14,467
That's right.

1455
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:17,367
Can we check this out without Jung-ha?

1456
01:13:17,934 --> 01:13:19,900
He doesn't have a separate mission,
does he?

1457
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,433
- Let's go, Jung-ha.
- What was that?

1458
01:13:22,433 --> 01:13:23,567
Let's go.

1459
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,333
- It's playing.
- Yes.

1460
01:13:32,734 --> 01:13:35,367
In Songpa-gu, Seoul...

1461
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:37,400
college students involved
in pyramid schemes

1462
01:13:37,967 --> 01:13:39,367
are called...

1463
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:41,867
What are they called?

1464
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,066
The police caught pyramid scheme employees

1465
01:13:45,066 --> 01:13:47,600
who lured college students
with a promise of employment

1466
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,967
only to force purchases and lock them up.

1467
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:53,200
They forced purchases and locked them up.

1468
01:13:55,066 --> 01:13:56,734
Late one night,

1469
01:13:56,734 --> 01:13:59,667
we visited a dormitory in Seoul
used by people running a pyramid scam.

1470
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:02,400
When we entered, a male student

1471
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,700
was washing his hair at the kitchen sink.

1472
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,567
Over ten male and female students

1473
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:09,600
were getting trained in a small room.

1474
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,200
They told us to follow their orders

1475
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,500
if we wanted to make money.

1476
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,667
After the training session ended,

1477
01:14:16,667 --> 01:14:19,400
we ate ramyeon together in a cramped room.

1478
01:14:20,233 --> 01:14:22,900
What are they forcing the students to do?

1479
01:14:24,066 --> 01:14:25,600
They run a pyramid scheme.

1480
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:29,734
These are the items we have to sell.

1481
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:34,000
I had no way to run away.
I didn't have a phone.

1482
01:14:37,834 --> 01:14:40,467
Even when I used the restroom,
two people followed me.

1483
01:14:42,367 --> 01:14:43,734
They went that far?

1484
01:14:43,734 --> 01:14:46,300
That's right. I remember this incident.

1485
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,900
Over 5,000 college students
who signed with the company

1486
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,200
were watched and controlled rigorously.

1487
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,533
They had to live
in a substandard dormitory

1488
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:57,500
where they couldn't even watch TV
or read newspapers.

1489
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,834
The college students
who signed with the company

1490
01:14:59,834 --> 01:15:03,266
even turned to robbery
due to extreme financial hardships.

1491
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:07,033
According to them,
many college students are still locked up

1492
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:10,033
at a secret location.

1493
01:15:11,266 --> 01:15:13,800
In Songpa-gu, Seoul...

1494
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,100
a crime ring that forced
5,000 college students to live in a dorm

1495
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,133
and participate in
an illegal pyramid scheme got caught.

1496
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:22,200
- Where are they?
- That startled me.

1497
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,100
What?

1498
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,233
- Where are they?
- Where?

1499
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:25,900
- Where are they?
- There's no door.

1500
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,300
Where did they go?

1501
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,500
There's no door.

1502
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,500
There's no exit over here.
How did the students leave?

1503
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,266
There's no door.

1504
01:15:33,266 --> 01:15:35,100
- Where did they go?
- What?

1505
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,166
What?

1506
01:15:44,367 --> 01:15:47,500
"Find the students
and members who disappeared."

1507
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,400
Jung-ha and Se-chan disappeared.

1508
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,800
What? Did they stay back on purpose?

1509
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,834
Were they acting?

1510
01:15:58,467 --> 01:16:00,533
A crime ring that forced college students

1511
01:16:00,533 --> 01:16:02,967
to live in a dormitory
and participate in a pyramid scheme...

1512
01:16:03,667 --> 01:16:07,066
Saying that to sell a product
they must use them,

1513
01:16:07,066 --> 01:16:09,400
they forced the students
to buy the products.

1514
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:12,600
Na-ra, the blueberry juice looks good.

1515
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:14,867
- Don't touch it.
- Can't I touch it?

1516
01:16:15,834 --> 01:16:17,533
- Shall we wear a pair each?
- Shall we?

1517
01:16:20,767 --> 01:16:23,033
Even when I used the restroom,
two people followed me.

1518
01:16:23,033 --> 01:16:26,233
Today, I have this feeling.

1519
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:40,066
What? Did they stay back on purpose?

1520
01:16:40,066 --> 01:16:41,433
Were they acting?

1521
01:16:41,433 --> 01:16:42,900
We need to find the members.

1522
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,133
- You're right.
- Yes.

1523
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,333
My goodness.

1524
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:53,300
Are we on the same team?

1525
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,066
Are we on the same team?

1526
01:17:01,066 --> 01:17:02,300
My goodness.

1527
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:04,700
What is it?

1528
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,066
Who is it?

1529
01:17:08,066 --> 01:17:09,266
- Is there something?
- What?

1530
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,533
The ones who got locked up...

1531
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,367
What is it? What?

1532
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,166
What?

1533
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:18,967
This is the place.

1534
01:17:21,734 --> 01:17:23,734
That was why people kept disappearing.

1535
01:17:23,734 --> 01:17:25,867
- My goodness.
- It's so chilling.

1536
01:17:26,367 --> 01:17:28,433
- My goodness.
- It's so chilling.

1537
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,000
What's this?

1538
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:35,266
This company running the pyramid scheme
told the students

1539
01:17:35,266 --> 01:17:37,266
that they could earn ten million won
a month

1540
01:17:37,266 --> 01:17:40,066
and find a job at a big company.

1541
01:17:40,066 --> 01:17:42,633
They lured college students
who were struggling

1542
01:17:42,633 --> 01:17:44,767
due to the low employment rate
and expensive tuition.

1543
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,266
- My goodness.
- It's so chilling.

1544
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:52,500
What's this? I actually have goose bumps.

1545
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,767
- They're the missing students.
- I guess so.

1546
01:17:54,767 --> 01:17:56,800
They're the missing students.

1547
01:18:08,467 --> 01:18:12,667
We need to find these people
as well as the members.

1548
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:16,533
- Gosh.
- Were they a team? Jung-ha and Se-chan?

1549
01:18:16,533 --> 01:18:17,767
Jung-ha and Se-chan?

1550
01:18:17,767 --> 01:18:20,233
I'm sorry. I suspected you.

1551
01:18:20,233 --> 01:18:21,834
Na-ra. For goodness' sake.

1552
01:18:21,834 --> 01:18:24,033
What? What's that?

1553
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,133
What? Why are their photos here?

1554
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:46,200
- I see. They got kidnapped.
- Right.

1555
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,500
- Right.
- They got kidnapped.

1556
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:54,300
- They got kidnapped. We must find them.
- That's right.

1557
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,567
There wasn't a hint
that made someone look suspicious.

1558
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:00,734
What was it?

1559
01:19:00,734 --> 01:19:02,767
Our hint? Pyramid.

1560
01:19:06,233 --> 01:19:08,166
- That's right.
- Was that what you got?

1561
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:10,533
We found out that it was a pyramid scheme.

1562
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,867
Gosh, you startled me. What are you doing?

1563
01:19:14,433 --> 01:19:16,600
Gosh, you startled me. What are you doing?

1564
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,900
Gosh, you startled me.

1565
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:21,734
My goodness.

1566
01:19:21,734 --> 01:19:23,133
Why are you doing this?

1567
01:19:24,367 --> 01:19:26,600
My goodness.

1568
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,967
- It isn't me.
- You startled me.

1569
01:19:29,967 --> 01:19:32,233
Why are you taking me?

1570
01:19:32,233 --> 01:19:34,400
- I don't like this.
- I was so startled.

1571
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,600
Stop it.

1572
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,800
- Jung-ha.
- It isn't me.

1573
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,100
It isn't me. Why...

1574
01:19:43,233 --> 01:19:44,600
- Are you serious?
- A blindfold.

1575
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,967
Are you serious? I can't see anything.

1576
01:19:52,033 --> 01:19:54,266
Where are you taking me? Help!

1577
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,367
This is an announcement.

1578
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:06,700
Se-chan and Jung-ha have been kidnapped...

1579
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,066
...and are locked up somewhere on campus.

1580
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:16,300
The first team to find and rescue
their teammate

1581
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,967
by 4 p.m. today will be today's winners.

1582
01:20:23,233 --> 01:20:25,400
- It isn't me.
- You startled me.

1583
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,900
It isn't me!

1584
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,800
Let's go.

1585
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,667
Let's go outside.

1586
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,900
- Hold on.
- I'm ready.

1587
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,200
- Jae-seok, what does this mean?
-"The back right corner of the structure"?

1588
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:44,967
"The back right corner of the structure"?

1589
01:20:48,667 --> 01:20:49,800
What?

1590
01:20:52,233 --> 01:20:53,867
"The back right..."

1591
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,200
What does this mean?

1592
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:01,500
- I don't think I'll remember it.
- Take a photo.

1593
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:06,266
- Jae-seok, what does this mean?
-"The back right corner of the structure"?

1594
01:21:08,166 --> 01:21:10,100
THE WINNING TEAM'S HINT:
3-2-1-3-4-1

1595
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:14,200
THE BACK RIGHT CORNER
OF THE STRUCTURE

1596
01:21:22,367 --> 01:21:23,834
We don't know anything.

1597
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,900
I found them.

1598
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,867
That isn't it. That's an electric car.

1599
01:21:33,533 --> 01:21:35,934
- Isn't this it?
- It's currently 2011.

1600
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:37,333
Jung-ha.

1601
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,567
Where did they go?

1602
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,367
- Jung-ha!
- Se-chan!

1603
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:57,133
Jae-seok.

1604
01:21:57,133 --> 01:22:01,200
...promotional matrimony on the school.
Captains, take this.

1605
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,867
Make sure you don't loose it.

1606
01:22:10,367 --> 01:22:13,233
"The back right corner of the structure"?

1607
01:22:14,667 --> 01:22:16,266
"The back right corner"?

1608
01:22:16,266 --> 01:22:18,533
I don't understand what it means.

1609
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:19,934
What does it mean?

1610
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,667
- Three, two, one...
- Three, four...

1611
01:22:26,667 --> 01:22:28,433
Three, four, one.

1612
01:22:28,433 --> 01:22:31,400
So the buildings make this shape.

1613
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,567
So the buildings make this shape.

1614
01:22:36,934 --> 01:22:38,800
What's this shape?

1615
01:22:41,867 --> 01:22:43,667
It's a pyramid.

1616
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,667
"The back right corner"?

1617
01:22:48,533 --> 01:22:52,133
It must be the right side
from our perspective. In that case...

1618
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,934
- Then the back right corner...
- The back right corner.

1619
01:22:55,934 --> 01:22:57,467
- Number four.
- Then it's number four.

1620
01:22:58,467 --> 01:23:01,800
"The back right corner of the structure."

1621
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,066
This is the spot.

1622
01:23:10,166 --> 01:23:11,867
We'll save you guys.

1623
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:19,600
Please.

1624
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,834
- Come here.
- Please.

1625
01:23:21,834 --> 01:23:23,100
My goodness.

1626
01:23:24,266 --> 01:23:27,400
- Come here, JENNIE.
- No catching.

1627
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,333
Let's go back to the apartment.

1628
01:23:32,533 --> 01:23:34,066
- Gosh.
- Come here.

1629
01:23:34,834 --> 01:23:36,967
How are we supposed to find them?

1630
01:23:36,967 --> 01:23:38,300
How?

1631
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:41,600
We didn't get any hints.

1632
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,567
Na-ra, why don't we make it simple
by calling them?

1633
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:48,667
- Hello?
- Hey.

1634
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:50,066
- Where are you?
- Where are you?

1635
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:56,934
Tae-hyun, I got kidnapped
and put in a shipping container.

1636
01:23:56,934 --> 01:23:58,934
Many other people are locked up here.

1637
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,467
What are you guys doing?

1638
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,734
My future.

1639
01:24:21,333 --> 01:24:24,734
...a crime ring that forced
5,000 college students to live in a dorm

1640
01:24:24,734 --> 01:24:27,867
and participate in
an illegal pyramid scheme got caught.

1641
01:24:27,867 --> 01:24:31,767
A room measuring ten pyeong
was shared by ten victims.

1642
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:35,200
They were even watched
by the perpetrators.

1643
01:24:38,633 --> 01:24:41,734
Saying that to sell a product
they must use them,

1644
01:24:41,734 --> 01:24:44,300
they forced the students
to buy the products.

1645
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:47,300
Students who had no money
were even forced to take out loans.

1646
01:24:49,066 --> 01:24:51,333
Please save me!

1647
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:53,166
Anyone!

1648
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,800
Which way?

1649
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,734
I couldn't see anything
since I was blindfolded.

1650
01:24:58,734 --> 01:25:00,100
Which way did you go?

1651
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,967
Where is Se-chan? Se-chan.

1652
01:25:04,133 --> 01:25:07,233
- Which way? To the right?
- Tae-hyun, save me.

1653
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,467
On my way here,

1654
01:25:10,467 --> 01:25:14,300
I heard someone say,
"Your kindness can help other people."

1655
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:17,800
I don't like this. Please let me go.

1656
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,000
Where are you taking me? Please save me.

1657
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:25,233
Your kindness can help other people.

1658
01:25:25,233 --> 01:25:27,033
"Your kindness can help other people."

1659
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,367
After that,
I think I heard a violin playing.

1660
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,800
I hear a violin.

1661
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:38,633
I also heard the sound of samulnori.

1662
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:39,867
- Samulnori?
- Samulnori?

1663
01:25:40,567 --> 01:25:41,900
What's that sound? Drums?

1664
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:49,667
- I'm so scared. Please save me.
- Okay.

1665
01:25:51,066 --> 01:25:52,700
Hang in there. I'll find you.

1666
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,633
- What? Hold on.
- There it is.

1667
01:25:54,633 --> 01:25:56,166
He heard that sound.

1668
01:25:57,734 --> 01:26:00,333
Show kindness to your neighbors.

1669
01:26:08,567 --> 01:26:09,734
Jung-ha!

1670
01:26:09,734 --> 01:26:11,266
He went that way.

1671
01:26:11,934 --> 01:26:14,467
This is sudden.

1672
01:26:16,533 --> 01:26:18,867
It's the violin. It's this way.

1673
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:24,300
- That's sudden. Bravo. She's good.
- I mean...

1674
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,934
I'm too full to run.

1675
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:32,633
Samulnori.

1676
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,367
Where is he?

1677
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,734
Na-ra.

1678
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:48,500
- Is he nearby?
- He heard this sound.

1679
01:26:57,533 --> 01:26:58,967
Hey, Se-chan.

1680
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,500
- Number four.
- Back right corner. Number four.

1681
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,867
It's here.

1682
01:27:07,433 --> 01:27:09,133
- Here.
- There?

1683
01:27:09,133 --> 01:27:11,333
- There.
- There.

1684
01:27:11,333 --> 01:27:13,066
- Jae-seok.
- Se-chan.

1685
01:27:13,633 --> 01:27:14,700
Se-chan.

1686
01:27:15,233 --> 01:27:16,734
- Jae-seok.
- There.

1687
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,133
Jae-seok.

1688
01:27:19,633 --> 01:27:20,867
Se-chan.

1689
01:27:21,633 --> 01:27:24,000
- Hurry up and open the door.
- Hey.

1690
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,133
- Se-chan.
- There's a lock.

1691
01:27:27,133 --> 01:27:28,166
- Where?
- Here.

1692
01:27:28,166 --> 01:27:29,834
- There's a lock.
- Where?

1693
01:27:29,834 --> 01:27:30,734
Here.

1694
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:34,333
Don't you know the passcode?

1695
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:36,300
Se-chan.

1696
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,900
How do I open it?

1697
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:39,400
Is the place big or small?

1698
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,700
Is it big?

1699
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:43,900
It's narrow.
It's a single shipping container.

1700
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,700
It's this one. The shipping container.

1701
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:50,400
Hey.

1702
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,867
Jung-ha.

1703
01:27:52,633 --> 01:27:54,900
Jung-ha.

1704
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,433
You're in here, right?

1705
01:27:56,433 --> 01:27:58,467
- Jung-ha, are you inside?
- What?

1706
01:27:58,467 --> 01:28:00,266
- My goodness.
- Is it open?

1707
01:28:01,867 --> 01:28:04,300
- Gosh, this isn't it.
- Come on.

1708
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:05,500
This isn't it.

1709
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:08,000
There must be a shipping container
like this one.

1710
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,667
A shipping container.

1711
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:10,900
Over there.

1712
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:11,967
Na-ra, I'm here.

1713
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,467
- There it is.
- Okay.

1714
01:28:15,467 --> 01:28:18,867
- I'm locked in.
- Jung-ha, I'm coming.

1715
01:28:18,867 --> 01:28:21,133
Tae-hyun, save me.

1716
01:28:22,367 --> 01:28:24,000
Jung-ha, I'll save you.

1717
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:26,867
My junior, Jung-ha.

1718
01:28:26,867 --> 01:28:28,333
Hurry up and open the door.

1719
01:28:31,166 --> 01:28:32,333
Hold on. How do I open this?

1720
01:28:33,367 --> 01:28:36,133
- He's here. Jung-ha.
- Jung-ha.

1721
01:28:36,633 --> 01:28:40,266
- Tae-hyun, there's a passcode.
- He's here.

1722
01:28:40,266 --> 01:28:42,400
What? I don't know the passcode.

1723
01:28:45,033 --> 01:28:46,767
The team that rescues
their teammate first wins.

1724
01:28:50,467 --> 01:28:52,934
- There's nothing inside?
- There's nothing.

1725
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,300
There are socks.

1726
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:57,467
- You're really locked in.
- Yes.

1727
01:28:58,367 --> 01:28:59,600
Blueberry juice.

1728
01:29:02,934 --> 01:29:05,834
Jung-ha, are there any clues
to the passcode inside?

1729
01:29:05,834 --> 01:29:09,700
Tae-hyun, I think I found a clue
to the passcode.

1730
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:12,600
"It starts in Osan and ends in Incheon."

1731
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:19,600
IT STARTS IN OSAN
AND ENDS IN INCHEON

1732
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,800
"It starts in Osan and ends in Incheon."

1733
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,433
-"It starts in Osan and ends in Incheon"?
- Yes. "It starts in Osan."

1734
01:29:26,433 --> 01:29:29,000
What does that mean?

1735
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,500
"It starts in Osan and ends in Incheon."

1736
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,000
Osan. What's the area code?

1737
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,200
- Gyeonggi Province's area code is 031.
- Osan, so...

1738
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,934
You don't know the area code for Osan.

1739
01:29:40,934 --> 01:29:42,233
I don't know it.

1740
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,233
Hey, try 031032.

1741
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,300
It ends in Incheon. It starts in Osan.

1742
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,700
IT STARTS IN OSAN AND ENDS IN INCHEON

1743
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,633
- Tae-hyun, try 5427.
- Osan.

1744
01:30:06,633 --> 01:30:08,934
Incheon. Five, four. Incheon.

1745
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,400
I'll try 5427.

1746
01:30:13,767 --> 01:30:15,900
- It isn't 5427.
- This is driving me crazy.

1747
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,133
Is there anything else? Look for a clue.

1748
01:30:24,133 --> 01:30:27,000
Hurry up. Hurry up and look for a clue.

1749
01:30:29,867 --> 01:30:31,233
There's nothing.

1750
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,433
- There's nothing.
- Everyone is here.

1751
01:30:35,433 --> 01:30:36,667
They're here.

1752
01:30:36,667 --> 01:30:38,000
Look carefully.

1753
01:30:41,467 --> 01:30:43,600
What's that? Hold on. What's this?

1754
01:30:44,166 --> 01:30:45,867
- Hold on.
- Is there a clue?

1755
01:30:45,867 --> 01:30:47,900
- What's this?
- There's a clue.

1756
01:30:49,066 --> 01:30:51,266
Let's see it. Show me the clue you found.

1757
01:30:57,667 --> 01:30:59,467
- What's that?
- A question mark?

1758
01:30:59,467 --> 01:31:02,266
-"Sad Cohabitation of 'Blank' Students."
- What?

1759
01:31:07,367 --> 01:31:08,500
What?

1760
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,567
Hold on. "Reportage."

1761
01:31:11,567 --> 01:31:15,200
"Sad Cohabitation of 'Blank' Students."

1762
01:31:15,767 --> 01:31:16,600
What?

1763
01:31:17,734 --> 01:31:19,200
What's the number?

1764
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,233
Five thousand.

1765
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,200
In Songpa-gu, Seoul...

1766
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:37,633
a crime ring that forced
5,000 college students to live in a dorm

1767
01:31:37,633 --> 01:31:40,900
and participate in
an illegal pyramid scheme got caught.

1768
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:43,500
"It starts in Osan and ends in Incheon."

1769
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:49,133
- It's five thousand.
- Five thousand?

1770
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:05,533
- It opened! Jung-ha!
- It opened!

1771
01:32:06,934 --> 01:32:08,800
I don't know.
We opened it at the same time.

1772
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,100
Come on out.

1773
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:11,100
Okay.

1774
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:13,133
The team that escaped first is...

1775
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,467
The Band Club.

1776
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:24,367
- For goodness' sake.
- How did it happen?

1777
01:32:24,367 --> 01:32:26,233
We got you out first.

1778
01:32:30,734 --> 01:32:33,867
- It's open! Jung-ha!
- Hey!

1779
01:32:33,867 --> 01:32:34,934
It's Jung-ha.

1780
01:32:37,033 --> 01:32:39,400
- Jung-ha!
- Hey!

1781
01:32:40,967 --> 01:32:42,800
Seniors.

1782
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,600
- What's that?
- What? Are you serious?

1783
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,233
The winning team will get a special prize.

1784
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:51,066
I'll eat it for a lifetime.

1785
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:53,133
I'm jealous.

1786
01:32:53,133 --> 01:32:54,867
For goodness' sake.

1787
01:32:54,867 --> 01:32:56,233
Did we escape first?

1788
01:32:57,567 --> 01:32:59,633
- Really? Did we escape first?
- That's right.

1789
01:32:59,633 --> 01:33:03,800
I remember this incident.

1790
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:07,800
In 2010 and 2011,
over 5,000 college students got locked up

1791
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,367
- due to a pyramid scheme.
- Yes.

1792
01:33:09,367 --> 01:33:12,000
- They got locked up?
- So the passcode was 5000.

1793
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,233
Although years have passed,

1794
01:33:15,233 --> 01:33:18,734
- it's still a heartbreaking incident.
- I agree.

1795
01:33:18,734 --> 01:33:21,800
It was a big incident
that shocked society.

1796
01:33:22,934 --> 01:33:25,233
For the pyramid scheme
that amounted to one trillion won,

1797
01:33:25,233 --> 01:33:29,033
the CEO and executives of Husstem Korea
were brought to trial.

1798
01:33:29,033 --> 01:33:32,333
The prosecution estimates
there to be over 100,000 victims.

1799
01:33:32,934 --> 01:33:36,667
In the past five years,
the most common form of fraud involved

1800
01:33:36,667 --> 01:33:39,467
pyramid schemes that encouraged
investments in cryptocurrency.

1801
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:54,000
- We're late.
- We're late.

1802
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,400
- Get down.
- Come on, Mr. Im.

1803
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,767
Gosh.

1804
01:33:57,767 --> 01:33:59,333
We're high schoolers.

1805
01:34:01,934 --> 01:34:03,333
Stop acting out.

1806
01:34:03,333 --> 01:34:04,934
- That's YEONJUN.
- YEONJUN is fighting.

1807
01:34:08,233 --> 01:34:09,400
Is this a school?

1808
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,000
How is this possible in a school?

1809
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,700
Are they students?

1810
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:15,000
- It's a bit scary.
- Is it a laboratory?

1811
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,900
- Hey, lock the door.
- Why?

1812
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,333
- What are you doing? No.
- What's going on?

1813
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:20,600
Bring the teacher.

1814
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,033
- What?
- What's going on?

1815
01:34:22,033 --> 01:34:23,900
Things are quite loud at the school.

1816
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,133
Please find it, Jae-seok.

1817
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,033
Why are so many things happening?

1818
01:34:59,033 --> 01:35:01,100
