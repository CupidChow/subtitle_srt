00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,300
[reporter]
How did you move into this apartment?

2
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:30,700
[tenant] A friend of mine moved in first
and recommended that I come visit.

3
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:33,333
The new apartment was very clean.

4
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,266
There was a school nearby,

5
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,300
so I moved for my children's education.

6
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:41,367
[reporter] I see.

7
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:44,633
[child]
There aren't any kids who transfer out.

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,333
But many kids transfer in.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,867
APARTMENTS ARE RUSHING IN

10
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:53,900
[announcer] While the original plan was
to accept the applications until the 27th,

11
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:57,900
the application period ended today
as the number of applications exceeded

12
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:59,500
the 2,634 available units.

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,867
If you foster property speculation,

14
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:05,967
how are people supposed to live?

15
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,533
[all laughing]

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,667
At the underground parking lot
of an apartment in Seoul this morning,

17
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:23,133
a man in his sixties was found dead.

18
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:25,633
Is this a murder case?

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,834
My gosh.

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,900
Come on! Don't do that!

21
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:32,333
Gosh, you startled me!

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,734
-What?
-What?

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,166
-Why would you go that far?
-Why would you do that?

24
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,266
It's too realistic.

25
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:55,600
Lightning power!

26
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:06,433
[person groans]
I feel like I'm going to die.

27
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,667
[exclaims]

28
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:10,133
What should I do?

[giggles]

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,300
JENNIE, hello.

31
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,633
-Hello.
-Long time no see.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,133
JENNIE, how have you been?

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,500
I really missed you. [laughs]

34
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,133
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,333
-Won't you be cold?
-Hello.

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,600
I wore a T-shirt inside.

37
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:29,967
-Is that so?
-Hello.

38
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,667
-Hello.
-You're so awkward.

39
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,233
-We haven't met before.
-Hey.

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,533
-Don't be awkward.
-I hope

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,734
-we get along.
-Go closer.

42
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,867
-Hi.
-She's JENNIE, a superstar.

43
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:40,333
-She's Na-ra.
-Hello.

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,834
I asked them to disperse
so that you wouldn't feel pressured.

45
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,000
-You'll know when this airs.
-We didn't want to make you nervous.

46
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,166
No, you didn't need to worry.

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,433
JENNIE is the only one who isn't here.

48
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,967
I haven't seen her in a while.

49
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,800
-Right.
-It's my first time meeting her.

50
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,667
If we wait for her like this…

51
00:02:57,734 --> 00:02:59,367
JENNIE will feel pressured.

52
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,834
-Go back into your car.
-Disperse.

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,967
-Don't make her uncomfortable.
-Disperse.

54
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,133
-Seriously.
-Go.

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
-I told you so.
-What are you doing?

56
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:10,133
We didn't want to make you nervous.

57
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,233
-By the way, JENNIE…
-Yes?

58
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,734
…I am very happy that you joined the show,

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,400
but why did you agree to join?

60
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:20,433
-Seriously. Ask her that.
-Come here, JENNIE.

61
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,300
-We go back five years.
-Five years?

62
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:24,900
-Yes.
-With the producer.

63
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:28,266
Even back then, she was a star.

64
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,100
Now, JENNIE is practically
a walking company.

65
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,200
That isn't true.

66
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,834
It's true.

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,033
-Quit after today if you don't like it.
-No.

68
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,266
Today, it feels like relatives
gathered around

69
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,533
to visit the ancestors' graves.

70
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,667
Bong-seok, you look like an idol.

71
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:46,734
-Me?
-He's so skinny.

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,934
I was surprised when Jung-ha joined.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,834
I really wanted to be in this show.

74
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,233
-Really?
-Yes.

75
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,400
MOVING

76
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:00,500
Actor Lee Jung-ha.

77
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,200
Actor Lee Jung-ha.

78
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:06,300
You played an innocent high schooler,
Kim Bong-seok.

79
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:09,333
You look like an idol.

80
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,100
-Me?
-He's so skinny.

81
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,500
-Thanks.
-People don't recognize him as Bong-seok.

82
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:15,867
-I know. I didn't recognize him.
-He lost weight.

83
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:17,433
How much did you gain for the role?

84
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,400
I gained about 30 kg.

85
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,600
For the role?

86
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,633
How did you gain 30 kg?

87
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,767
I ate all sorts of ramyeon.

88
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,367
Since he's young,
he can easily gain and lose weight.

89
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,633
-That's right.
-For me, losing weight is hard.

90
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,367
It's like that when you're old.

91
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:34,300
[laughing]

92
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:35,734
It's true. When you're old…

93
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,633
-Why are you dressed like that?
-It's about age.

94
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,467
-Only I focused on the concept.
-You…

95
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:43,200
Why are you dressed for Comedy Big League?

96
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,667
-Only I…
-You're wearing vinyl pants.

97
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,367
-I'm Seo Tai-ji.
-Seo Tai-ji.

98
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:52,433
What do you think of my style?

99
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,533
You look a bit like a thief.

100
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:57,533
[Na-ra] I'm Ko So-young.

101

-Ko So-yong.
-Ko So-yong.

102
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,767
Yes. You might get sued.

103

Ko So-yong.

104
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,567
Ko So-yong.

105
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:08,000
[Na-ra] Are you dressed like a student?

106
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:09,767
No, I just wore what they gave me.

107
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:12,333
Isn't it too much?

108
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,333
Seriously.

109
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,433
-I brought this item.
-Of course.

110
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,767
-It completes the style.
-Tinted glasses.

111
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,934
You look so lackluster.

112
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,200
Jung-ha is an idol.

113
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:24,467
It's the 1998 style.

114
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,800
It's the SECHSKIES style.

115
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,667
He does look like a teenage star.

116
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,767
-I was born in 1998.
-In 1998.

-In 1998? Are you younger than JENNIE?
-Yes.

In 1998?

There's no place to hide it.

I'm in detective mode.

I'll turn off the engine a few times.

-How?

-Team Actors, Team Entertainers.
-Team Actors.

-Team Entertainers.
-I have

131

released many songs.

132
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,266
That puts you on Team Singers.

133
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,934
I've released a few albums.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,834
You want to team up with JENNIE.

It's that old car smell.

It's incredible.

It's fascinating.

[Na-ra] This is the beginning.

147
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,333
The government decided to request

148
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,734
for a relief loan from the IMF.

149
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,700
Despite showing impressive economic growth
in the past,

150
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,467
Korea has entered a painful phase.

-[horns honking]

Although the nation experienced
the pain of mass unemployment last year,

the issue shows no signs of improvement.

154
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,967
The gold-collecting campaign
continued on with the citizens' support.

155
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,033
Three months into the financial crisis,

156
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,600
public security
is getting shaken to the core.

157
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,400
Theft, assault, and bank robberies
are rampant.

158
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:38,633
Crimes that are tied to livelihood
are skyrocketing.

Thus, the government

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,567
set out to eradicate crimes
that affect livelihood.

161
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,133
[JENNIE] Does that mean we're in 1998?

-Yes.
-That's right.

163

-JENNIE, you were born in 1996.
-That's right.

JENNIE, you've become touchy
about your age.

I really don't know what to do.

I've become a senior to other idols.

-Yes.

[grinding]

176
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,433
It's the sound of the antenna retracting.

177
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,834
-Really?
-The antenna.

178
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,567
For a second, I thought JENNIE farted.

179
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:48,233
I thought, "She's good at variety shows."

180
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:51,000
-It's my first time…
-I guess it's stuck.

181
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:53,133
…seeing a car with an antenna. What?

182
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,834
[both laugh]

183
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,166
-This is fun.
-What a ruckus.

184
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,300
-It's funny.
-What a ruckus.

185
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:03,200
[JENNIE] I'm amazed
that this car is still drivable.

186
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,567
Can you guess who I'm supposed to be?

187
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,600
-You're JENNIE.
-No.

188
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,467
-I'm not JENNIE today.
-Who are you?

189
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:14,100
-Who are you?
-I'm Kim Hee-seon from Tomato.

190
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,934
-Ah.
-Ah.

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,500
I thought you looked familiar.

192
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:19,900
Tomato.

193
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,934
That's right. I see the resemblance.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,367
-That explains the headband.
-Yes, I wore one.

195
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,700
Still, you're just you.

196
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,934
-That's right. You're JENNIE.
-You're JENNIE.

197
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:30,934
Who are you supposed to be?

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,633
I'm just my younger self.
I was around back then.

199
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
-You were an obscure celebrity.
-That's right.

200
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,333
You were poor and lost.

201
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,567
I was a bit lost.

202
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,734
In 1998, you had already debuted.

203
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,934
I had debuted.

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,433
-Garden Balsam School.
-Back then, I was in…

205
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,700
-Grasshopper Husband.
-Grasshopper Husband.

206
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:51,066

210
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Grasshopper Husband soon got canceled.

211
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:03,700
It was a skit about a jobless man.

212
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:07,200
-Times were tough.
-Many people lost their jobs.

213
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:08,734
-It ended up reflecting the era.
-Yes.

214
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,066
-They said it'd be too painful to watch…
-How sad.

215
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,333
-…so the skit got pulled.
-I see.

216
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,700
Why is this year the backdrop?

217
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,533
-The year of 1998.
-I'm curious.

218
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:24,133
[Tae-hyun] Yes, I got it.

221
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:29,300
Yes! The engine isn't turning off now.

222
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,133
-[Na-ra chatters]
-Oh, yes. I got it.

223
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,100
Nice. I have a good feeling about this.

224
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,433
I'm set with the second gear.

225
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,367
Gosh, I have a cramp in my left foot.

227
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,033
It's been a while since

228
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,767
-I used a clutch.
-[Na-ra] Switch gears when you go uphill.

229
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:47,133
Uphill? I hope there won't be a hill.

230
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,000
It would be a disaster.

231
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,433
-[Na-ra] Is this a hill?
-[Tae-hyun] It's a hill.

232
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,934
[Na-ra] Press hard.

233
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:58,700
Will the engine turn off?

234
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,800
Either that or the car will go backward.

235
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,000
-Backward?
-Yes.

236
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,900
This is a crucial moment.

237
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:06,734
-I'm nervous.
-Me too.

238
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,266
Why did we have to stop on a hill?

239
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,700
-It's like a hill from a driving test.
-Yes.

240
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,200
One, two, three.

241
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,233
-Come on!
-My goodness.

242

247
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,767
[Tae-hyun] Isn't it thrilling?

248
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:36,266
I'm a bit bored.
Why don't we listen to music?

249
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,700
-I'll turn on the radio.
-Please turn on the radio.

What is this song?

253
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:50,000
-This song--
-Doesn't it go, "I skipped school"?

254
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:51,033
Yes. "An Amusement Hall."

255
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,233
-Gosh, you like this kind of music?
-You're right.

-[Na-ra] Really? Then sing along.

-Na-ra, what did you do in 1998?
-I made money.

262
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,800
Same here. In 1998,

263
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,867
I had just started--

264
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:19,467
How should I put it?
I had just started getting bigger roles.

265
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:22,900
-That was how it was. I wasn't a kid.
-As for me,

266
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,600
I debuted in 1997.

267
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,200
I debuted in 1995.

268
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:27,900
-You debuted early.
-Yes.

There are hot springs, JENNIE.

345
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,667
-What am I going to do?
-JENNIE.

346
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:40,834
-I think you're jetlagged.
-What are you doing?

347
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,033
-Snap out of it.
-Being global is nice, but stop.

348
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,800
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm going to get out of the car.

349
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,633
So people were shocked.

350
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,800
I think something big happened.

351
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:57,000
Didn't they say that they were scared?

352
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,567
That means it's something bad.

353
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,200
What?

354
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:33,200
[exclaims]

355
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:39,900
[person] Who's there? Who are you?

356
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,734
[shouts]

357
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,266
This is an apartment complex.

358
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,166
People actually live here.

359
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,300
Let's get out.

360
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:07,300
-Thank you for driving.
-Thank you.

361
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:11,233
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

362
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,166
We got here safely.

363
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,767
-I have a cramp in my left leg.
-Why?

364
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,433
Because of the gear stick?

365
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,266
Are you exhausted?

366
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,400
[Na-ra] I was scared.
He drove dangerously.

367
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:26,000
-Did you hear the news?
-What news?

368
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:28,000
-About a case.
-That's right.

369
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,166
-We did.
-We heard it.

370
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,500
We made deductions.

371
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:31,734
-What deductions?
-Yes.

372
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,166
-We can't tell you.
-It's a team competition.

373
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:36,767
-Is it a team competition?
-Of course.

374
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,500
-Of course, it is.
-Is it a team competition?

375
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:44,100
You seem to be unaware,
but we're Team Superpowers.

376
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,500
-What?
-Team Superpowers.

377
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,600
-What's your superpower?
-Looking young for my age.

378
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,000
That isn't a superpower.
You just get treatments.

379
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,300
You saw a dermatologist.

380
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:53,734
-Seriously.
-It's a talent.

381
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,633
-You saw a dermatologist.
-While it is a talent…

382
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,133
Is there security?

383
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,800
-An actual security guard?
-Is he an actor?

384
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,200
There's no way of knowing.

385
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:17,433
-An actual security guard?
-Is he an actor?

386
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,967
There's no way of knowing.

387
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,133
-We…
-My goodness.

388
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
-Woo-il, it's you.
-Woo-il.

389
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:24,734
-No way.
-What brings you here?

390
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,467
-Woo-il, it's you.
-Woo-il.

391
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,633
-No way.
-What brings you here?

392
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,000
Woo-il.

393
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:33,567
Guess what happens at universities.

394
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:35,533
Students get drunk at retreats.

395
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,133
Why are you so ugly?

396
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,333
Ask my mom.

397
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,500
Who are you, you punk?

398
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,700
-I'm just Woo-il, born in 1981.
-Born in 1981.

399
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,066
-What brings you here?
-My goodness.

400
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:47,667
-Woo-il.
-Gosh.

401
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:52,200
I'm not Woo-il. You must be the ones
who moved into apartment 104.

402
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:54,033
Then you should take the keys.

403
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Unbelievable.

404
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,133
How is a security guard's hair so long?

405
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,633
-By the way, sir…
-Yes?

406
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,333
…JENNIE likes you so much.

407
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,367
-I'm a big fan.
-Really?

408
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:06,967
-She's a big fan.
-Have we met before?

409
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,433
-Don't you know JENNIE?
-Don't you?

410
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,934
-Sir.
-Woo-il, you seem to be shaken up.

411
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,467
-Seriously.
-I've seen you often on TV.

412
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:18,734
-Thank you.
-This is yours, Cha Tae-hyun. Unit 406.

413
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,934
The key for unit 407
is for you, Yu Jae-seok.

414
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,800
-Okay.
-Take the key and go upstairs.

415
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:27,200
There are residency guidelines
for the new residents.

416
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,200
Read the guidelines,

417
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:31,066
but do it separately.

418
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,700
-You must not share the information.
-We can't share it?

419
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:35,300
-Keep it to yourself.
-Why?

420
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:38,233
-Why are there two? Hey, come on.
-Don't do that.

421
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,500
-Why are there two? Hey, come on.
-Don't do that.

422
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,333
-That's-- For goodness' sake.
-Hey.

423
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,467
-As for him…
-He plays dirty.

424
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,900
…he should be watched separately.

425
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:52,500
-This is his style.
-He wreaks havoc.

426
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,300
-He startled me.
-He wreaks havoc.

427
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,200
Be careful.

428
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,900
-In any case, be careful.
-Why is he Apple?

429
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:00,867
-Is that what it says?
-Apple? I'm Apple.

430
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,300
JENNIE is Goose.

431
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,700
Se-chan is Bat.

432
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:11,400
She wants to know why she's Pig.

433
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:12,500
Why am I Pig?

434
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:14,600
-Ms. Baby Face wants to know.
-Baby face.

435
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,333
Why do I need to read this alone?

436
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:28,233
WE WELCOME YOU
TO WOOSANG APARTMENT

437
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:32,400
[Na-ra] "Woosang Apartment holds a secret.

"The apartment's secret

00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,066
is based on a true event from 1998."

442
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,133
I guess that was the actual news.

443
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,166
It was news about this apartment.

444
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,300
[reporter]
At an apartment construction site…

445
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:00,266
…was found.

446
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:04,400
Will I be able to do it?
Will I be able to do well?

[voice counts down]

448
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:21,033
If you're done reading it,
return it to me.

449
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,400
-Okay.
-Thank you.

450
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,633
-Na-ra, what are you? Pig?
-Pig.

451
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
You're Pig. JENNIE is…

-Goose.
-I'm Apple.

453
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,200
-I'm Bat.
-Bat.

454
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:31,867
-It suits you.
-You are a bat.

455
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:33,667
-It suits you.
-Only mine suits me.

456
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:34,867
He's a bat.

457
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,233
-What are you?
-Well…

458
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,700
-It's Nutria, right?
-No.

459
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:40,734
-It's Nutria, right?
-Isn't it Octopus?

460
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,266
-Toad.
-I think it said Nutria.

461
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,734
The nicknames make sense.

462
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:48,033
-JENNIE is Goose.
-Shall we go up?

463
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,567
-You can go up and rest.
-Okay.

464
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:51,600
-Can we rest?
-Yes.

465
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:55,100
JENNIE, let's go. Let's go.

00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,900

-Okay.

467

[JENNIE] See you later.

468
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,767
I'll patrol the area, so go up and rest.

-What?
-What's that?

479
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,400
-Don't do that. I'm serious.
-What's going on?

00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,433
-Is this a murder case?
-Hold on a second.

481
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,934
It's a murder case.

482
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,867
You said it wouldn't be serious.
You said it wouldn't be heavy.

483
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:55,533
It's a murder case.

484
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,967
-You said it'd be too heavy.
-Wait.

485
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:59,333
Wait. A murder case in broad daylight?

486
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,033
-Hey, get the car.
-Hey.

487
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:04,533
-Hey.
-Hey, get the car.

488
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,300
He'll leave for real.

489
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:07,967
I can't do this.

490
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,800
-Don't leave.
-It's a murder case.

491
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:12,233
-I got goosebumps.
-I can't do this.

492
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,800
Tae-hyun, the vibe is spooky.
It must be a murder case.

493
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:17,767
-Tae-hyun tried to leave for real.
-I'm sorry, but…

494
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:21,000
-Are there individual quests?
-Of course not.

495
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:25,266
Let me make myself clear.
I can't go down the basement. Okay?

496
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,667
-What a coward.
-I…

497
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:28,433
I might push you.

498
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,767
-Be careful. I'll do it.
-He will…

499
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:32,166
-He'll do it for real.
-Seriously.

500
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,266
-Really?
-Be careful.

501
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,667
Maybe zombies will pour out.

502
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:35,967
Why would there be zombies in 1998?

503
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:36,867
REAL INCIDENT

504
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:38,533
-I was so startled.
-Same here.

505
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,233
They mentioned a construction site.

506
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,700
Construction must be taking place
in the basement.

507
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,333
I bet something happened there.

508
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,266
We heard static, right?
We need to figure out what happened.

509
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,600
Was there a murder or a fall?

510
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:52,433
Did a construction worker
get crushed to death?

511
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,600
You're incredible.

512
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,066
-Why aren't you going in?
-What?

513
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,867
You should go in.

514
00:23:59,934 --> 00:24:02,834
Let's go together. I'm scared.

515
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,433
-You have me.
-Take the lead.

516
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,333
Even ghosts get scared of me.

517
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,233
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

518
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,834
Na-ra is going.

519
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,467
[Na-ra] Old apartments have
a basement like this one.

520
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,033
-It isn't a set.
-It's real.

521
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,767
-It's real.
-It's real.

522
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:27,600
These cobwebs aren't props.

523
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,333
They aren't props. They're real.

524
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,066
[JENNIE]
The surroundings are a bit scary here.

525
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:34,800
What?

526
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:41,367
What?

527
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:45,233
"Nothing should be dug up or buried"?

528
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:50,166
Something got dug up.

529
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,400
"Nothing should be dug up…"

530
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:56,500
"Or buried."

531
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,433
[reporter]
At an apartment construction site…

532
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,533
…was found.

533
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,333
What kind of case is this?

534
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:06,967
[reporter]
…what was found at the construction site…

535
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:09,066
…is being watched with keen interest.

536
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,300
So construction is underway.

537
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,834
What is this?

538
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,233
I can see that they shoveled here.

539
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,800
This is the scene of an incident.

540
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:27,467
Jae-seok, I don't think it's a murder case
since it's too…

541
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:32,633
It doesn't seem like a murder case, right?

542
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,734
I don't think they tried to bury a body.

543
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,400
There are too many shovels
for it to be a murder case.

544
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:46,367
I think there are three culprits.

545
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:47,333
What?

546
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:49,266
[laughing]

547
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,200
For goodness' sake.

548
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:52,233
-I don't think that's it.
-No?

549
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,500
You need to get a grip.

550
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,333
-Get a grip, Jung-ha.
-No?

551
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,867
-Bong-seok, get a grip.
-Okay.

552
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:59,800
If it's a murder scene,
the tapes don't read, "Keep out."

553
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:03,000
-"Police." That's right.
-Yes, it says, "Police line."

554
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:05,600
-This isn't a police line.
-It's a construction site.

555
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,500
[Na-ra] I see. You're right.

556
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,834
-It isn't a murder.
-Treasure?

557
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,100
Treasure.

558
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:15,400
I think treasure is more plausible.

559
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:19,266
Jae-seok, it's based on a true event.
No treasure was found in Korea in 1998.

560
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:20,300
It makes no sense.

561
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,633
I don't know.

562
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,600
It's…

563
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,467
-Gosh, you startled me.
-Mister.

564
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,500
[shouts]

565
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:29,000
My gosh.

566
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,767
-Gosh, you startled me.
-Mister.

567
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:34,467
-What's wrong with you?
-Gosh.

568
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,166
Why are you so into character?

569
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:37,867
Sir, you startled me.

570
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:40,467
-I was so startled.
-Seriously.

571
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,800
You were startled, weren't you?

572
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,734
I told you to go up.
Why did you come here?

573
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,600
-We heard a noise.
-[Woo-il] What?

574
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:47,700
What did you hear?

575
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:51,200
You shouldn't be down here.
Go to your respective unit.

576
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:52,233
Go up.

577
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,867
Go up. You shouldn't be down here.

578
00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:55,800
It's off-limits.

579
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:58,133
-Go to your unit.
-Something happened.

580
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,767
-Something happened here.
-Where?

581
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:03,367
-I don't know anything about that. Go up.
-A security guard would know.

582
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:06,100
-I don't know anything. Go up.
-Come on.

583
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,133
-Na-ra, go up.
-Okay.

584
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,266
I'm Shim Eun-ha.

585
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,367
-Eun-ha, go up.
-[laughing]

586
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:20,433
You look for meaning in every single hint.

587
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,333
That's right.

588
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,600
-We need to figure out what happened.
-We need to make deductions.

589
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:26,500
That's right.

590
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,500
It's scary.

591
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,433
-It's an old elevator.
-An old elevator.

592
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,200
It's scary.

593
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:36,166
-It's an old elevator.
-An old elevator.

594
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,533
It's scary.

595
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,000
-Shall we use the stairs?
-Let's walk.

596
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,934
-Let's walk.
-It's an old apartment.

597
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,934
Which unit is ours? Unit 407?

598
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,133
-I think so.
-Unit 407.

599
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,567
Your unit is here.

600
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,967
Which unit is ours? Unit 407?

601
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,500
-Are we neighbors?
-It seems that way.

602
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:00,500
Why did we get a key? The door is open.

603
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:04,166
Jae-seok, you should've pretended
to unlock the door.

604
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:06,867
Close the door. They need an insert shot.

605
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:11,033
Gosh, you're such an amateur.

606
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,166
This isn't a drama. We don't need that.

607
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,367
What Tae-hyun said seems plausible.

608
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,667
That's it. That's the shot we need.

609
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:20,533
Does it work?

610
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,734
Gosh, I haven't seen this in a while.

611
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,233
It's my first time seeing one.

612
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,600
-A screen door.
-Right.

613
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,367
-Gosh, the living room.
-Whoa. [giggles]

614
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,867
[exclaims, gasps] Wow.

615
00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:36,300
[Jae-seok] Isn't this someone's home?

616
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,367
[Se-chan] It looks that way.

617
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:40,100
-Do you know this? GoldStar?
-No.

618
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,734
Jae-seok, it's a GoldStar.

619
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:54,734
Gosh, the living room.

620
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
"A happy family makes all go well."

621
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,200
Usually…

622
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:09,567
[music playing]

623
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:11,066
It's Seung-hun.

624
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,100
It works.

625
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,400
It's Seung-hun.

626
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,767
This is cool.

627
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,834
-I don't know why I'm scared.
-[JENNIE] I know.

628
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:33,700
JENNIE's mom would know.

629
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,066
It's fascinating.

630
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:43,633
-I've only heard about this.
-What?

631
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,734
-CaptainQ.
-Yes.

632
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,000
CaptainQ.

633
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:48,033
[JENNIE] It's fascinating.

634
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:50,333
-It gives you a headache.
-I heard that

635
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,700
it won't give you a hangover.

636
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:55,467
-But you pass out for three days.
-So I heard.

637
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:58,500
And it blurs your vision.
Those were the rumors.

638
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,200
[JENNIE]
This room seems to have many things.

639
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,233
Is this an actual residence?

640
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,333
The owner of the room is a SECHSKIES fan.

641
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:11,900
[Se-chan gasps] Wow.

642
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:14,900
SECHSKIES. In 1998,
SECHSKIES and H.O.T. were everywhere.

643
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,867
It feels like a drama set.

644
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,633
[Se-chan] It's like Reply 1998, Jae-seok.

645
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,900
[Jae-seok] This is incredible.

646
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:30,734
-These details can't be meaningless.
-That's right.

647
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,100
-I agree, JENNIE.
-Aren't these props for the vibe?

648
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:37,000
I think they're here to create a vibe.

649
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:44,200
-I locked the door.
-The door was open.

650
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,533
My goodness.

651
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,633
-What's this?
-[Na-ra exclaims]

652
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:53,300
It's an exact replica
of an old apartment. Unbelievable.

653
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,767
It's a nice layout.

654
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:59,467
It has a typical old apartment layout.

655
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:01,266
It's nice and big.

656
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:07,133
[Tae-hyun] This apartment is set in 1998.

657
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,867
-[Na-ra] Yes.
-That's the backdrop.

658
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:14,767
-Isn't that Joey Wong?
-[Jung-ha] Where?

659
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,967
-Isn't that Joey Wong?
-[Na-ra] That's Joey Wong.

660
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,734
Is this your room?

661
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,200
I don't know whose room it is.

662
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:22,600
Tae-hyun, did you like Joey Wong?

663
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:32,233
But

664
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:36,800
why is the jewelry out in the open?

665
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,467
Why are expensive items out in the open?

666
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,600
Isn't it strange
that the jewelry is out in the open?

667
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,100
Was a thief here?

668
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:48,600
I don't think a thief was here.

669
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:51,266
But people don't leave jewelry boxes open.

670
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:55,200
Since we can see them,
don't you think they could be a clue?

671
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:57,467
So it isn't about finding something.

672
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:59,033
Wouldn't they be a clue?

673
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,100
[Woo-il] This is an announcement.

674
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:11,533
For a clue on the apartment's secret…

675
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:20,667
the resident gathering will begin.

676
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:22,900
-You must have many questions.
-Yes.

677
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:28,000
I came here to give you a clue

678
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:29,734
-on those matters.
-We…

679
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,633
We don't know what we're supposed to do
in this apartment.

680
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,133
-I'll give you a clue on those matters.
-Okay.

681
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,266
But it wouldn't be fun
without a challenge.

682
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,166
-Okay.
-So you'll play a game…

683
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:41,433
-Okay.
-…and win clues.

684
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,867

00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:31,233
I'm sorry.

860
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,533
[whistle blows]

861
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,467
-Tae-hyun's water is below the red line.
-Out due to the water.

862
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,900
Okay.

863
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,066
It was so hard.

864
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:40,000
Tae-hyun, you kicked him in the groin.

865
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,967
You kicked Jung-ha in the groin.

866
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:46,400
Tae-hyun, why did you grab
the back of Jung-ha's neck?

867
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,834
The Yus won this round
of the Apartment Game.

868
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,266
-Okay.
-Okay.

869
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,166
Yes.

870
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:56,567
Did two members escape?

871
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:58,367
-Two members escaped.
-Gosh.

872
00:40:58,433 --> 00:40:59,533
We did well.

873
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:04,166
-You should dance properly.
-We did well.

874
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:06,667
-You should dance properly.
-Go ahead.

875
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:10,700
-Na-ra is good at variety shows.
-She's good.

876
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,700
[chattering, laughing]

877
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
-Come on.
-What? [shouts]

878
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:26,367
-[shouting]
-[clattering]

879
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:36,066
[Jae-seok] Still, we're quick.

880
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:37,033
[JENNIE] It was fun.

881
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,200
-They spilled water everywhere and left.
-Seriously.

882
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,066
They really did that.

883
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,200
I know. There is water everywhere.

884
00:41:45,266 --> 00:41:47,367
Without a hint,
I don't know what's going on.

885
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:48,834
I know. I'm still lost.

886
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,266
-Right?
-Yes.

887
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,433
Your food is here.

888
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,900
[JENNIE] The security guard is here.

889
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:57,000
-The winning team gets meat.
-It's pork belly.

890
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,834
[Jae-seok] Pork belly?

891
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,367
[JENNIE] It looks delicious.

892
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:03,800
[Woo-il] You can cook your own meal.

893
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:05,500
What is this tofu for?

894
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,800
[JENNIE] Is it for stew? Is it raw tofu?

895
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:10,166
I'm sorry, but is there ramyeon?

896
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:11,633
Ramyeon is for the losing team.

897
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,734
-What? We prefer ramyeon.
-Then…

898
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,000
You prefer ramyeon?

899
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,333
We won, so give us one packet.

900
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,133
Give us two packets.

901
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:19,567
-Really?
-You can do it.

902
00:42:19,633 --> 00:42:23,100
Mister, whose permission do you need?
You're the boss here.

903
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,433
The losing team's food is here.

904
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,600
-Nice.
-Your food is here.

905
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,367
-You can cook it and eat it.
-Okay.

906
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,100
-Jung-ha, will you cook it?
-Of course, Na-ra.

907
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:40,433
You're good at measuring
the right amount of water.

908
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,266
-I eyeball it, Na-ra.
-Really?

909
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:45,100
-Then I'll take out some kimchi.
-That sounds great.

910
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:56,500
What is it?

911
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,533
What is it?

912
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,867
Jung-ha.

913
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:04,767
[Jung-ha gasps] No way.

914
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:10,800
[Na-ra] "Look at unit 406."

915
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,066
What are we supposed to look at?

916
00:43:25,133 --> 00:43:26,367
This is our apartment.

917
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:27,667
"Look at unit 406."

918
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:29,166
Isn't this it?

919
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:30,233
"Look at unit 406."

920
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:33,033
Maybe we're supposed to look inside.

921
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:37,367
I see. We're supposed to look inside.

922
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:38,934
[laughing]

923
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,266
I'm sorry.

924
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,834
We're novices, so…

925
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,433
This is unit 406.

926
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,033
I'm sorry.

927
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,633
I've been on variety shows
for over ten years.

928
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:55,166
Everyone, I made a big mistake.
I'm sorry to disappoint.

929
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,467
-He looked at the door.
-I thought

930
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,600
something was written on the door.

931
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:01,533
"Look at unit 406" is confusing.

932
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,734
Looking inside is the answer.

933
00:44:09,266 --> 00:44:12,867
Maybe there is a hint somewhere.

934
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:14,533
Look around carefully.

935
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:20,500
Apple.

936
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:21,967
[Na-ra] Apple?

937
00:44:22,033 --> 00:44:24,767
-Apple.
-I'm Apple.

938
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:30,967
-Pig.
-Maybe not.

939
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:31,867
[Na-ra] Pig.

940
00:44:33,066 --> 00:44:34,066
Pig. What are you?

941
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:36,133
-I'm Kiwi.
-Where is kiwi?

942
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:38,467
There is no kiwi. Why is there no kiwi?

943
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,133
[Na-ra] Look for anything
that's similar to a kiwi.

944
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,667
[Tae-hyun]
Kiwi. I can't find a kiwi-related item.

945
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,867
[JENNIE] Let's rinse the rice.

946
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:55,667
We need to make the rice.

947
00:44:58,467 --> 00:44:59,367
What?

948
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:02,867
What is it?

949
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,433
[JENNIE] Is there something there?

950
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:07,266
What is it?

951
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,667
-What's that?
-We don't need that.

952
00:45:09,734 --> 00:45:11,033
Hold on.

953
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,166
-What's that?
-We don't need that.

954
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:14,100
Hold on.

955
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:15,633
I was startled.

956
00:45:16,934 --> 00:45:20,100
-There must be a hint inside.
-We played a game for it.

957
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:22,834
-We should watch the video.
-Seriously.

958
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:25,300
This is incredible.

959
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:28,467
JENNIE, isn't this fun?

960
00:45:28,533 --> 00:45:31,000
-Yes, it's so much fun.
-JENNIE is excited.

961
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,767
"Look at unit 406"?

962
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:36,266
"Look at unit 406"? It's the other unit.

963
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,367
It's the other unit.

964
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:40,667
-What's this?
-Thirteen at sign?

965
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:43,834
[chattering, laughing]

966
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,266
That unit holds a secret.

967
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,400
-Shall I play it?
-Play it.

968
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:57,333
-There we go.
-It's playing.

969
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:00,300
[Jae-seok] How on earth did we
use videotapes in the past?

970
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:04,667
[Se-chan]
"Copying is prohibited at all times…"

971
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,500
KVN News? Is this real?

972
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,100
At an apartment reconstruction site
in Mapo-gu, Seoul…

973
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,000
…was found.

974
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,100
-It's Su-kyung.
-Yes.

975
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:21,433
Reporter Lee Seok-ho covered the story.

976
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,867
It's an actual news story.

977
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:25,467
-It's an actual event from 1998.
-That's right.

978
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,467
[reporter]
At a reconstruction site in Seoul,

979
00:46:28,533 --> 00:46:31,266
the members
of the Reconstruction Association

980
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,033
are absorbed in digging the ground.

981
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,767
-[worker] Do you see it?
-[worker 2] There it is. I see it.

982
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:38,633
-What is it?
-What is it?

983
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,000
What could it be?

984
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:43,967
[reporter] The construction workers
couldn't believe their eyes at first.

985
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:47,934
But since the construction
is scheduled to be done by next year,

986
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,867
it can't be delayed.

987
00:46:50,967 --> 00:46:52,600
I was shocked. There was so much…

988
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:55,233
-We heard this.
-The construction might be delayed.

989
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,333
It's a residential area, after all.

990
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,500
[reporter] Kim, an employee
of the construction company,

991
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,800
got caught while trying to steal…

992
00:47:00,867 --> 00:47:02,567
…in the middle of the night.

993
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:04,367
-He tried to steal something.
-Yes.

994
00:47:04,433 --> 00:47:06,600
So it must be something valuable.

995
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:10,433
Kim was handed over to the police,
who came upon receiving a report,

996
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,367
but the retrieved…

997
00:47:11,433 --> 00:47:14,400
…has gone missing again.

998
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:18,433
The police are trying to get
the full story through witness accounts

999
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,934
and are looking for the whereabouts
of the missing…

1000
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:23,433
[Se-chan] Whose whereabouts?

1001
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:29,734
What went missing, a person or an object?

1002
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,700
Both went missing.

1003
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,066
-Listen.
-A person took the object.

1004
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:35,934
-It's the missing "Blank."
-Yes.

1005
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,100
It's a two-syllable word.

1006
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:39,333
JENNIE?

1007
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,633
[both laughing]

1008
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,166
-JENNIE. It's a two-syllable word.
-Don't be absurd.

1009
00:47:43,233 --> 00:47:47,834
-Wouldn't that be the actual silhouette?
-A man?

1010
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:49,533
A man?

1011
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:55,400
Unit 406 holds the clue to what it is.

1012
00:47:55,467 --> 00:47:57,667
-The secret is in unit 406.
-That's right.

1013
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,900
-If we go now, it'll look suspicious.
-Of course.

1014
00:48:00,967 --> 00:48:04,600
We can go with some pork belly.

1015
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,367
-That's a good idea.
-Yes.

1016
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:07,767
I think they'll like it.

1017
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:09,400
JENNIE is so meticulous.

1018
00:48:09,467 --> 00:48:11,200
-Was that good?
-So meticulous.

1019
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:13,500
I see that you've changed a lot.

1020
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,600
"Was that good?"

1021
00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:16,500
That was good.

1022
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:27,400
-I'll try it.
-Okay.

1023
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:29,467
-JENNIE, prepare the rice.
-I'll try it.

1024
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:31,967
-I'll grill the meat.
-Grill the meat.

1025
00:48:32,033 --> 00:48:34,033
When else would I get to eat rice
made by JENNIE?

1026
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:47,700
It's just rice.

1027
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:50,233
-Do you know how to cook rice?
-Yes. I'm rinsing it.

1028
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,800
-Why are you rinsing it like this?
-I…

1029
00:48:52,867 --> 00:48:54,166
-Why squeeze it?
-For rice balls?

1030
00:48:54,233 --> 00:48:55,300
You're squeezing it?

1031
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:57,533
-I think she's making rice balls.
-Is that so?

1032
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,066
Girl, can't you do it right?

1033
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:01,834
Mother, please wait.

1034
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,333
-Rinse the rice properly. Gosh.
-I'm doing it.

1035
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,567
-JENNIE.
-I'm in trouble.

1036
00:49:08,633 --> 00:49:10,934
This won't do.
I'm going into serious mode.

1037
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,467
What's going on? There's no cook button.

1038
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,000
-It's this one.
-This one.

1039
00:49:15,066 --> 00:49:17,300
-Pull it down.
-Pull it down. Yes.

1040
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:21,000
You have to keep your hand on the cooker
for the rice to cook.

1041
00:49:21,066 --> 00:49:23,333
Don't lie, Se-chan.

1042
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,900
-JENNIE was cute just now.
-She was cute.

1043
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,734
"Don't lie."

1044
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,200
"Don't lie."

1045
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,033
"Don't lie."

1046
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,000
Now, the egg.

1047
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,934
-My goodness.
-All right.

1048
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,367
-Enjoy the food.
-We'll eat the meal Bong-seok cooked.

1049
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:11,867
Bong-seok, you added
green onion and kkakdugi.

1050
00:50:11,934 --> 00:50:13,200
I added the available ingredients.

1051
00:50:13,266 --> 00:50:14,700
[Na-ra] It looks delicious.

1052
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:15,767
Thank you for the food.

1053
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:18,767
Na-ra, eat this.

1054
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:20,333
-You can eat it. It's okay.
-It's okay.

1055
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,567
Thank you.

1056
00:50:21,633 --> 00:50:24,200
-Jung-ha is a talented man.
-Shall I get yours?

1057
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,233
Shall I get yours?

1058
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:28,633
Shall I get yours?

1059
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,133
What's this?
You scooped out food for each other.

1060
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,767
Because of you,
she keeps having to wait to eat.

1061
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:35,900
-This is ridiculous.
-Bravo, Tae-hyun.

1062
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:38,533
I'm sorry. I'll be speedy next time.

1063
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,633
-Let's scoop out our own food.
-Let's do that.

1064
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,734
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

1065
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,133
-Thank you for the food.
-Cheers.

1066
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,266
For goodness' sake.

1067
00:50:46,433 --> 00:50:49,133
-You keep delaying your first bite.
-Cheers.

1068
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:52,967
Mmm.

1069
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:58,333
[Na-ra] Mmm.

1070
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,934
-Is it good?
-Yes.

1071
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,000
Do you know what kind of ramyeon is
the most delicious?

1072
00:51:05,066 --> 00:51:06,800
-The one someone else cooked.
-Yes.

1073
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:09,834
Even married couples
should cook ramyeon for each other.

1074
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:12,700
[Jae-seok] JENNIE, is the rice done?

1075
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,567
-I'll open it. I think it's done.
-Let's see.

1076
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:22,934
-Let's close it.
-Why?

1077
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
-Let's close it.
-What's wrong?

1078
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:28,800
-Let's see it.
-It's no good.

1079
00:51:28,867 --> 00:51:30,567
[Se-chan] It turned into porridge.

1080
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:33,567
You can eat this rice after a colonoscopy.

1081
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:39,100
You can eat it after a colonoscopy.

1082
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,767
[Jae-seok]
A colonoscopy or other procedures.

1083
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,734
It smells delicious.

1084
00:51:47,033 --> 00:51:48,433
[JENNIE] It looks tasty.

1085
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,867
-It's so tasty.
-It's tasty.

1086
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,834
Mmm.

1087
00:51:57,734 --> 00:51:58,734
Mmm.

1088
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,967
It's tasty.

1089
00:52:02,567 --> 00:52:05,934
The radio news talked
about people who needed to move in.

1090
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,533
But because something was found,

1091
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,667
-the schedule got delayed.
-That's right.

1092
00:52:10,233 --> 00:52:11,166
[reporter] Breaking news.

1093
00:52:11,233 --> 00:52:13,300
At an apartment construction site…

1094
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:15,100
…was found.

1095
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,300
Something bad or relics.

1096
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:18,500
That's right.

1097
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:20,233
Celadon.

1098
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,533
Am I a genius?

1099
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,000
Judging by the size of the hole,
there must've been one relic.

1100
00:52:29,934 --> 00:52:32,000
How could there be only one relic?

1101
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,300
[laughs]

1102
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:35,166
Don't they usually get discovered in bulk?

1103
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:37,533
You have a point.

1104
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,433
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

1105
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,567
-What's up with this show?
-Hey.

1106
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:44,767
-We're more ignorant than you think.
-Seriously.

1107
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:46,800
It's my first time
being in a show like this.

1108
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:49,667
The year 1998, my foot. Seriously.

1109
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:53,300
The year 1998, my foot. Seriously.

1110
00:52:53,367 --> 00:52:54,900
I don't even remember it.

1111
00:52:58,233 --> 00:53:00,500
Is there something in the house?
Maybe we should look for it.

1112
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:03,333
What are we supposed to look for?

1113
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:05,033
The year 1997.

1114
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,767
[Na-ra]
Mr. Kim Man-bok. Remember the name.

1115
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:09,333
[Tae-hyun] Mr. Kim Man-bok.

1116
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,600
It's so funny.
Are they looking down on us?

1117
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:13,033
Why wasn't "Man-bok" written
in Chinese characters?

1118
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,133
PLAQUE OF APPRECIATION

1119
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,934
Na-ra, we wouldn't be able
to read it if it were in Chinese.

1120
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,233
-They're looking down on us.
-Maybe.

1121
00:53:19,734 --> 00:53:21,834
[laughing]

1122
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,233
We should look more thoroughly.

1123
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,400
October 2nd.

1124
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,633
October 2nd is circled.

1125
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,467
October 2nd is circled on the calendar.

1126
00:53:36,533 --> 00:53:37,567
-October 2nd?
-So let's

1127
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:39,734
check the newspaper and see what happened.

1128
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:42,800
[Tae-hyun] October 2nd?

1129
00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:49,233
[Na-ra] Was the date given at random?

1130
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,533
The Chinese character for gold.

1131
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,600
Gold.

1132
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,133
-Did they find gold?
-What?

1133
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,600
Did they find gold in the basement?

1134
00:54:08,734 --> 00:54:10,800
Maybe they found gold in the basement.

1135
00:54:10,867 --> 00:54:12,600
-Goldfish.
-Goldfish.

1136
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,066
-All the medals are gold too.
-Keep your voice down.

1137
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:18,934
-Kim means gold too.
-Kim Man-bok.

1138
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,166
That's right. Gold.

1139
00:54:21,233 --> 00:54:22,467
-Gold.
-Gold Rice.

1140
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:26,100
Gold.

1141
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:28,400
Na-ra.

1142
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:29,700
-What?
-Golden apples.

1143
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:30,834
[laughing]

1144
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,433
Golden apples.

1145
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
[laughing]

1146
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,934
-Kiwi.
-Gold kiwis.

1147
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:40,166
-Kiwi.
-Gold kiwis.

1148
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:48,767
-We need to keep it down.
-[Jung-ha whispers] Okay.

1149
00:54:48,834 --> 00:54:51,333
What was Jae-seok?

1150
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:53,266
Golden toad.

1151
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,200
Golden toad. Golden goose.

1152
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:56,600
And the bat-- Gold bat?

1153
00:54:56,667 --> 00:54:58,400
Gold bat, silver bat.

1154
00:54:58,467 --> 00:55:00,633
-Gold bat?
-Gold bat, silver bat.

1155
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,266
Golden bat.

1156
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:05,133
Golden bat.

1157
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,300
A VEIN OF GOLD FOUND

1158
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:26,200
[reporter] At an apartment
reconstruction site in Mapo-gu, Seoul,

1159
00:55:26,266 --> 00:55:28,633
a vein of gold was found.

1160
00:55:29,233 --> 00:55:30,700
-Do you see it?
-There it is.

1161
00:55:30,767 --> 00:55:31,700
I see it.

1162
00:55:31,767 --> 00:55:34,433
It's a lump of gold.

1163
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,900
It's my first time seeing gold.

1164
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:41,834
I'm shocked that so much is coming out.

1165
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,133
An extensive analysis revealed
the vein of gold to be profitable.

1166
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,200
But due to the move-in schedule,

1167
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:48,967
they decided to give up on development

1168
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:51,867
and name the apartment Gold Apartment.

1169
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:04,033
Isn't it strange
that the jewelry is out in the open?

1170
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,633
NO SMOKING, GOLD SMOKING

1171
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,100
Golden Week.

1172
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:09,266
GOLD

1173
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:10,867
This is a GoldStar microwave.

1174
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,200
-GoldStar.
-Everything is gold.

1175
00:56:12,266 --> 00:56:13,367
[Na-ra] It's gold.

1176
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,367
[Jae-seok] Go and take a peek.

1177
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:26,100
-[JENNIE] Should I go and see?
-Yes.

1178
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:31,000
-Yes?
-No.

1179
00:56:31,567 --> 00:56:32,400
Knock, knock.

1180
00:56:32,467 --> 00:56:34,100
-[Na-ra] JENNIE, what is it?
-JENNIE.

1181
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:36,767
-I brought some meat.
-Come on in.

1182
00:56:36,834 --> 00:56:38,300
-Thank you.
-Can I come in?

1183
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:39,333
Come on in.

1184
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:44,667
JENNIE, did the older members send you?

1185
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,066
-No, I wanted to share the meat.
-Thank you.

1186
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:48,100
We were going to visit.

1187
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:50,300
-Seriously.
-I wanted to share the meat.

1188
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:51,600
-Are you staying?
-Yes.

1189
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:52,934
Give me some information.

1190
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,834
[Na-ra] What is it?

1191
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,533
Why are you here? Tell us honestly.

1192
00:56:56,133 --> 00:56:57,266
I guess it's human nature.

1193
00:56:58,633 --> 00:56:59,967
Now that JENNIE is here,

1194
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,000
I want to share what I know.

1195
00:57:04,033 --> 00:57:05,166
Hey.

1196
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,467
Is there something you know?

1197
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:09,567
Are you insane?

1198
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:12,800
It's the JENNIE effect.

1199
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:15,734
If the other two had come,
I would've slapped them.

1200
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,333
Maybe he's a spy.

1201
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,500
I'm not a spy.

1202
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:27,200
-JENNIE.
-What?

1203
00:57:27,266 --> 00:57:28,667
-JENNIE.
-What?

1204
00:57:28,734 --> 00:57:29,734
No. That man

1205
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,934
-isn't allowed inside.
-You need to eat.

1206
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,300
Thank you for the food.

1207
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:34,967
-Bye.
-All right.

1208
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:38,000
JENNIE, you looked like their daughter.

1209
00:57:39,433 --> 00:57:40,867
Jae-seok, big news.

1210
00:57:40,934 --> 00:57:42,667
-What?
-I have big news.

1211
00:57:42,734 --> 00:57:44,433
-Hurry up.
-What is it?

1212
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:47,400
-I figured it out. I saw it.
-What is it?

1213
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:48,300
What did you see?

1214
00:57:48,367 --> 00:57:49,734
-Did you find it?
-What?

1215
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,233
On the fridge was a flyer
for the Golden Week sales.

1216
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,000
"Golden" was in a different color.

1217
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:05,633
So I looked around.

1218
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,300
There was a goldfish.

1219
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:08,734
[gasps]

1220
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,834
[JENNIE] And many videotapes
had a homophone for gold.

1221
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:15,734
And there were seeds
for a flower with "gold" in the name.

1222
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,266
-Really?
-Yes.

1223
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:20,333
-Then it's gold.
-Maybe it's a gold bar.

1224
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,934
It's the same thing.

1225
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,467
Go ahead and eat.

1226
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,000
Then where is the gold now?

1227
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:45,600
This is an announcement for the residents.

1228
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:47,867
-Hold on.
-What is it?

1229
00:58:47,934 --> 00:58:51,367
Every single resident

1230
00:58:51,433 --> 00:58:54,533
must gather at the Senior Center.

1231
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,700
The Senior Center?

1232
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:57,867
-It's the security guard.
-The Senior Center.

1233
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:00,500
[Na-ra] I think I can drive.

1234
00:59:01,266 --> 00:59:03,767
-Let me get a feel for it.
-I'll hold this.

1235
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:04,667
Okay.

1236
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,500
[Jae-seok] My goodness, hello.

1237
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:16,834
The elders are excited because of you.

1238
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:21,033
I was eating snacks over there,
but they showed no interest.

1239
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,100
[laughing]

1240
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:26,934
First gear.

1241
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,533
-What? Na-ra is leaving.
-What?

1242
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,900
She's leaving.

1243
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:41,400
-Is she practicing?
-Is she practicing?

1244
00:59:41,967 --> 00:59:43,900
Na-ra, you're so cool.

1245
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:47,233
My goodness.

1246
00:59:47,967 --> 00:59:50,266
So far, it's the same as an automatic.

1247
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:52,333
I'll know when I get on the main road.

1248
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,734
-She's back.
-She's back.

1249
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,066
-I'm sorry. You're scared, right?
-No.

1250
01:00:06,633 --> 01:00:07,500
No, I'm not.

1251
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,400
[Na-ra] There we go.

1252
01:00:10,467 --> 01:00:12,400
There we go.

1253
01:00:12,967 --> 01:00:14,633
[Jung-ha] Driving a stick shift is hard.

1254
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:18,066
-Mm-mmm.
-[exclaims]

1255
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,633
[Na-ra] Gosh, what should I do?

1256
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,233
What should I do? Oh, no.

1257
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,700
Gosh, what should I do?

1258
01:00:26,767 --> 01:00:28,800
What should I do? Oh, no.

1259
01:00:28,867 --> 01:00:30,834
I can't do it.

1260
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,200
[shouting]

1261
01:00:33,266 --> 01:00:34,433
[Na-ra] I can't do it.

1262
01:00:40,233 --> 01:00:42,767
-Oh. Oh.
-Whoa. Whoa.

1263
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:45,000
Gosh, what should I do?

1264
01:00:45,066 --> 01:00:48,567
What should I do? I can't do it.

1265
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:52,133
My goodness. No.

1266
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,300
One, two, three.

1267
01:00:55,367 --> 01:00:57,333
I can't do it. It has been a while.

1268
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,400
Whoa.

1269
01:00:58,967 --> 01:01:01,000
That was so close just now.

1270
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,667
Who's the awesome driver? Na-ra?

1271
01:01:04,233 --> 01:01:05,400
-You should drive.
-Sorry.

1272
01:01:05,467 --> 01:01:07,900
-I can't. I realize that now.
-It's okay.

1273
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,066
Hey, Na-ra!

1274
01:01:11,066 --> 01:01:11,967
Hey, Na-ra!

1275
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:14,066
-I thought we were going to die.
-Just now…

1276
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:16,200
-It was scary, right?
-Yes, it was.

1277
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:29,100
I'm sure the other team figured out
that they need to find gold

1278
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:31,600
just like we did.

1279
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:33,600
-It seems that way.
-Right?

1280
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:36,900
-On what we saw earlier…
-Yes.

1281
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:40,133
-…it said, "13 at sign T-H."
-T-H.

1282
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,734
We found the clues for gold in unit 406.

1283
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,233
The clue to where that 13 thing is.

1284
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,000
What could it mean?

1285
01:01:53,066 --> 01:01:53,900
[JENNIE sighs]

1286
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:57,066
-The next game will give us a clue.
-Will there be a clue?

1287
01:01:57,133 --> 01:02:00,633
It's about time
we get closer to the answer.

1288
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:04,667
So someone hid the gold somewhere and…

1289
01:02:05,233 --> 01:02:06,800
I don't know what's happening.

1290
01:02:06,867 --> 01:02:08,000
Here it is.

1291
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,734
[JENNIE] Hello.

1292
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,100
-Welcome.
-Here you are.

1293
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:17,467
Did you eat something?

1294
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:19,033
Yes, I did.

1295
01:02:20,367 --> 01:02:22,900
Is that so? Why are you so dazed?

1296
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:25,734
-Did you use up your energy?
-You seem exhausted.

1297
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,867
-I guess you got a lot of information.
-I think

1298
01:02:27,934 --> 01:02:29,734
you're memorizing things.

1299
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,800
There are so many things to do.

1300
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:34,200
[Jae-seok] Judging by his pallor,

1301
01:02:34,266 --> 01:02:36,567
I can tell he received
a lot of information.

1302
01:02:36,633 --> 01:02:37,734
-His face is pale.
-Yes.

1303
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,066
-I've been memorizing lines.
-Is that so?

1304
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:40,967
[Woo-il] Yes.

1305
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:44,967
Let's take a seat.
The two teams should alternate.

1306
01:02:45,033 --> 01:02:47,367
[chanting]

1307
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:48,266
Next.

1308
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:49,967
[chanting]

1309
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:55,100
-I want to change seats. [laughs]
-[laughs]

1310
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:58,333
-Please let me change seats. Hold on.
-[Se-chan] I'm in hell.

1311
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,767
-I'm in hell.
-Why?

1312
01:02:59,834 --> 01:03:01,500
Na-ra is really loud.

1313
01:03:01,567 --> 01:03:03,667
She's no joke. This ear will rot.

1314
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:05,800
For goodness' sake.

1315
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:08,066
-The game we'll play this time is--
-What is it?

1316
01:03:08,133 --> 01:03:11,033
Say It Backward, Way to Go.

1317
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,567
What's that?

1318
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:14,633
Come on.

1319
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,767
There used to be this game.

1320
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:19,600
♪ Bitrab tainmoun, bitrab ♪

1321
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:21,400
-Is it from the late Joseon era?
-Joseon.

1322
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:23,333
[chuckles] Is it from the late Joseon era?

1323
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,166
The two of us will play the game
to demonstrate. If I go…

1324
01:03:27,233 --> 01:03:29,266
-I don't know what I'm doing.
-Right.

1325
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:31,367
Mister, don't rush ahead by yourself.

1326
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:32,900
-Mister.
-It's easy.

1327
01:03:32,967 --> 01:03:34,200
[Se-chan] Please communicate.

1328
01:03:34,266 --> 01:03:36,900
-I don't know how to play the game.
-Teach us first.

1329
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:38,467
-Teach us first.
-That's right.

1330
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:41,367
-I was too focused on memorization.
-Okay.

1331
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:42,500
I'll go.

1332
01:03:42,567 --> 01:03:46,433
-♪ Say it backward, way to go ♪
-I see.

1333
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,767
-That's the rhythm.
-♪ Say it backward, way to go ♪

1334
01:03:49,834 --> 01:03:51,700
-That's how it goes.
-Good.

1335
01:03:51,767 --> 01:03:54,567
If I ask for a two-syllable fruit name,
say, "Grapes green."

1336
01:03:54,633 --> 01:03:56,333
-Grapes green.
-Yes.

1337
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:59,133
-Oh.
-That's how you play it. For "Apple…"

1338
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,934
Elephant. Phantele.

1339
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,100
-♪ Say it backward, way to go ♪
-♪ Say it backward, way to go ♪

Two-syllable fruit name.

1341
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,400
Pleap.

1342
01:04:09,467 --> 01:04:11,367
-Two--
-No, it isn't "Pleap."

1343
01:04:11,433 --> 01:04:13,300
Say the fruit name.

1344
01:04:13,367 --> 01:04:15,967
-Apple.
-Yes, that's how you play the game.

1345
01:04:16,033 --> 01:04:20,233
-Then--
-That isn't how you play the game.

1346
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,133
Okay.

1347
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,700
We did it correctly.

1348
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,266
-He did it correctly.
-That's right.

1349
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:27,934
-Then--
-Then why is he here?

1350
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,533
Cheol-min, you should explain the rules.

1351
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,166
-You won't see me next week.
-Don't say that.

1352
01:04:33,233 --> 01:04:34,066
Your character is being developed.

1353
01:04:34,133 --> 01:04:36,700
I don't think I'm cut out for this.

1354
01:04:36,767 --> 01:04:38,333
Won-il is too self-conscious.

1355
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,767
His name is Woo-il.

1356
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,767
Won-il? He isn't Chef Lee Won-il.

1357
01:04:42,834 --> 01:04:44,900
-Woo-il. Im Woo-il.
-Okay.

1358
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:47,333
-Let's say you mess up.
-Okay.

1359
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,200
You'll get a penalty.

1360
01:04:49,266 --> 01:04:50,533
Okay.

1361
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,967
Gestures will be added one at a time.

1362
01:04:54,033 --> 01:04:56,367
-What kinds of gestures?
-For example…

1363
01:04:56,433 --> 01:04:58,400
I'll come up with them.

1364
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:00,734
-Will you improvise? Let's see it.
-Yes.

1365
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,567
Get up and do the crab leg dance.

1366
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:03,934
-How?
-It's simple.

1367
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,200
-Here.
-If you mess up…

1368
01:05:05,266 --> 01:05:07,567
If you mess up, you'll add this move.

1369
01:05:07,633 --> 01:05:08,900
That's stage one.

1370
01:05:08,967 --> 01:05:10,233
I'll mess up in round one.

What was I going to say?

01:06:19,367 --> 01:06:22,500
Since you messed up twice,
you'll advance to stage two.

1400
01:06:22,567 --> 01:06:25,367
Comedian Kim Jeong-ryeol used to do this.

1422
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,433

-do a BLACKPINK dance.

-Yes.

Why are you so stern with me?

You should try doing this. I can't focus.

We don't need to do it just yet.

-Let's watch it again.

1541
01:12:31,133 --> 01:12:33,533
Jae-seok, do you have the first tape?

1542
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,600
Of course.

1543
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,467
[Se-chan] Thirteen at sign?

1544
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:46,900
[JENNIE] The 13th floor?

1545
01:12:47,667 --> 01:12:48,500
[Se-chan] The 13th floor?

1546
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:50,800
But there is no 13th floor.

1547
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:02,266
Five kilograms of gold isn't a lot, is it?

1548
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:03,433
[Jae-seok] Right.

1549
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,834
Do you think it's "Bath"?

1550
01:13:05,567 --> 01:13:06,900
Do you think it's "Bath"?

1551
01:13:08,066 --> 01:13:10,100
[in English] B-A-T-H. Bath.

1552
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,467
B-A-T-H. Bath.

1553
01:13:19,266 --> 01:13:21,300
-[in Korean] It's a B, not the number 13.
-Yes.

1554
01:13:21,367 --> 01:13:24,100
-That's right.
-[in English] Bath.

1555
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,033
Bath. It's "Bath."

1556
01:13:27,633 --> 01:13:28,600
It's "Bath."

1557
01:13:30,066 --> 01:13:32,333
-It's "Bath."
-[in Korean] You don't disappoint.

1558
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,467
-Nice pronunciation.
-You studied in New Zealand.

1559
01:13:34,533 --> 01:13:36,600
-That's a bathhouse too.
-A bathhouse.

1560
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,233
The whereabouts-- You know--

1561
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:44,867
I think it means
the gold is in the bathtub.

1562
01:13:44,934 --> 01:13:45,834
I think so too.

1563
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:48,467
I think it means
the gold is in the bathtub.

1564
01:13:48,533 --> 01:13:49,433
I think so too.

1565
01:13:50,934 --> 01:13:52,033
Our bathroom?

1566
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,433
I mean-- JENNIE. Jae-seok.

1567
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:05,300
It's unit 406, not this one.
We're in unit 407.

1568
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:08,367
Now, we know that the item is gold.

1569
01:14:08,433 --> 01:14:10,333
-We're looking for gold.
-Gold.

1570
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,266
[Tae-hyun]
I think the other team knows that too.

1571
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:13,266
[Na-ra] Really?

1572
01:14:14,066 --> 01:14:16,033
-Bath.
-That's right.

1573
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,533
-We need to go.
-Let's go.

1574
01:14:19,033 --> 01:14:20,133
It was an actual event.

1575
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,433
-That's right.
-In that case…

1576
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,967
If all of us barge in,

1577
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,100
they'll become suspicious.

1578
01:14:27,166 --> 01:14:30,066
Are you saying that you'll go alone?
Jae-seok.

1579
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:33,033
Are you saying that you'll go alone?
Jae-seok.

1580
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,400
-Don't be ridiculous.
-I didn't say that.

1581
01:14:35,467 --> 01:14:38,567
How could you go alone
when JENNIE and I made deductions?

1582
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:40,433
-[Jae-seok] Let's go together.
-[Se-chan laughs]

1583
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,667
-[JENNIE] He's quicker to act now.
-[Se-chan] I know.

1584
01:14:42,734 --> 01:14:43,734
I'm nervous.

1585
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,333
-[Na-ra] What is it?
-What are you guys doing?

1586
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,867
-Nothing.
-What is it?

1587
01:14:52,934 --> 01:14:54,300
Tae-hyun, your unit…

1588
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:55,700
Why are you entering without permission?

1589
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:58,333
Why can't we do that?
You entered our apartment.

1590
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,200
Neighbors should be able
to visit each other.

1591
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:03,834
-That's right.
-I bet the hint led you guys to unit 406.

1592
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,800
The what?

1593
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,200
-The hint.
-So everyone came.

1594
01:15:06,266 --> 01:15:07,100
-No.
-No.

1595
01:15:07,734 --> 01:15:09,900
[Na-ra]
Why else would you come to our apartment?

1596
01:15:09,967 --> 01:15:11,867
To be honest, I don't know.

1597
01:15:12,934 --> 01:15:14,500
I'm frustrated. Tell us what you know.

1598
01:15:14,567 --> 01:15:16,133
-We have info too.
-Let's team up.

1599
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,166
-We have information too.
-Let's team up.

1600
01:15:18,233 --> 01:15:20,133
-Will you share information?
-Yes.

1601
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,066
Let's share. Okay.

1602
01:15:21,133 --> 01:15:23,633
-In that case, spend five minutes…
-Okay.

1603
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:26,233
Spend five minutes in unit 407.

1604
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,467
[Na-ra] Why?

1605
01:15:27,533 --> 01:15:29,000
That's how you share.

1606
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,066
-This unit--
-That's nonsense.

1607
01:15:31,133 --> 01:15:33,333
-This unit--
-That's nonsense.

1608
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,266
No, thank you.

1609
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:36,934
-You want to ransack this unit without us.
-No.

1610
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,800
You've heard of office sharing, right?
It's the same thing.

1611
01:15:39,867 --> 01:15:42,100
-Nonsense.
-Then put a spy in each group.

1612
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:44,633
-What's wrong?
-Yes. One member will remain.

1613
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,000
-One member will remain?
-Just one.

1614
01:15:46,066 --> 01:15:47,133
Just one.

1615
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,600
-Fine.
-Fine.

1616
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:50,033
-Really?
-It's a good idea.

1617
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,734
One member will share the clues
in the other unit,

1618
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,600
so let two members stay here.

1619
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,400
-With one of us?
-Okay.

1620
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:02,533
-Do you guys want to go? I'll stay.
-That sounds good.

1621
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,400
-Stay then. We'll go.
-I'll stay.

1622
01:16:04,467 --> 01:16:06,166
One? Two? Okay.

1623
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:08,000
-Go and share the hints.
-Okay.

1624
01:16:09,867 --> 01:16:11,166
This is good, right?

1625
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,767
-We're grateful.
-Seriously.

1626
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:14,266
Tae-hyun.

1627
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:21,734
-Can we look around the place?
-Of course.

1628
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,734
-We did that.
-Tae-hyun, do well.

1629
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,133
There is nothing to do well.

1630
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,500
-We did that.
-Tae-hyun, do well.

1631
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:30,033
There is nothing to do well.

1632
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,166
[JENNIE yawns, humming]

1633
01:16:38,633 --> 01:16:40,567
What's this for?

1634
01:16:40,633 --> 01:16:42,800
Tae-hyun, it's hard.

1635
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,100
He goes up on the scale.

1636
01:17:22,066 --> 01:17:23,567
Why are they showing a scale?

1637
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:31,800
Is anything there, JENNIE?

1638
01:17:39,834 --> 01:17:43,300
[whispers] There's a dumbbell.
Put it on the scale.

1639
01:17:47,367 --> 01:17:50,500
You know…

1640
01:17:50,567 --> 01:17:52,767
What are you doing? Is something there?

1641
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,133
[Se-chan] We're just looking.

1642
01:17:54,633 --> 01:17:55,633
[Tae-hyun] You know…

1643
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,300
[clacking]

1644
01:18:15,266 --> 01:18:16,700
[Tae-hyun] Did you find something?

1645
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:23,233
-What?
-Did you find something?

1646
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,734
I was just looking.

1647
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,300
-Seriously. We checked the entire place.
-Right.

1648
01:18:27,367 --> 01:18:29,133
I just want to check more thoroughly.

1649
01:18:29,934 --> 01:18:33,400
-Tae-hyun, in that case-- Tae-hyun.
-What?

1650
01:18:33,467 --> 01:18:36,867
-You guys just received the clues.
-Yes.

1651
01:18:36,934 --> 01:18:39,567
You guys received the clues.

1652
01:18:39,633 --> 01:18:42,133
-So--
-We don't know what to do next.

1653
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,066
We want to know what we're supposed to do.

1654
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:51,934
[gasps]

1655
01:18:54,533 --> 01:18:55,533
[gasps]

1656
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:02,400
[reporter] Breaking news.

1657
01:19:02,467 --> 01:19:05,533
At an apartment construction site,
a vein of gold was found.

1658
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,700
-What?
-What was found?

1659
01:19:06,767 --> 01:19:09,433
It's a lump of gold.

1660
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,333
-That's a good idea.
-Yes.

1661
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,233
[whispers]

1662
01:19:18,166 --> 01:19:19,934
I can't believe it.

1663
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:25,200
Where's the gold?

1664
01:19:27,033 --> 01:19:28,834
Where's the gold?

1665
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:37,233
What's the meaning of this?
There's no gold.

1666
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:44,934
Where's the gold?

1667
01:19:51,633 --> 01:19:53,834
"If you escape the apartment
with the briefcase

1668
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:57,233
between 4:30 and 5 p.m.,

1669
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,967
all the gold bars will be yours."

1670
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,300
What does that mean? The gold isn't here.

1671
01:20:11,934 --> 01:20:13,200
Seriously.

1672
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:16,400
-What is she doing?
-It's a reality check.

1673
01:20:16,967 --> 01:20:18,467
-What is she doing?
-It's a reality check.

1674
01:20:18,533 --> 01:20:20,767
What are you doing?

1675
01:20:24,367 --> 01:20:25,367
What are you doing?

1676
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:31,233
What are you doing?

1677
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,133
What are you doing?

1678
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,800
[hums]

1679
01:20:35,867 --> 01:20:37,533
I was thinking.

1680
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:39,900
-Is there something inside?
-No.

1681
01:20:40,533 --> 01:20:42,633
-Is it this room?
-I checked the bathroom.

1682
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,367
I mean…

1683
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:47,600
I checked all the rooms earlier.

1684
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,600
There's nothing here, right?

1685
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:52,200
Right.

1686
01:20:53,233 --> 01:20:54,700
What's in this unit?

1687
01:20:58,033 --> 01:21:01,000
What's in this unit?

1688
01:21:03,166 --> 01:21:04,400
What is he doing?

1689
01:21:04,467 --> 01:21:07,133
-Hey.
-You know, I really think…

1690
01:21:10,266 --> 01:21:12,934
-Hey.
-You know, I really think…

1691
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,834
Hold on. Hey, mister.

1692
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,533
-What?
-There's a leak.

1693
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,367
-There's a leak.
-What?

1694
01:21:20,433 --> 01:21:22,166
-Stop.
-He's washing his face.

1695
01:21:22,233 --> 01:21:23,667
I'm washing my face.

1696
01:21:23,734 --> 01:21:25,000
-Come on out.
-I was hot.

1697
01:21:25,066 --> 01:21:26,333
What's in here?

1698
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,133
Can't I wash my face to cool down?

1699
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,700
-What's in here?
-Nothing.

1700
01:21:30,767 --> 01:21:32,166
I feel refreshed.

1701
01:21:32,867 --> 01:21:34,066
What's in here?

1702
01:21:34,834 --> 01:21:36,200
-Did you open it?
-Yes, I did.

1703
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:38,367
-It's empty.
-It's empty, right?

1704
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:40,500
I guess someone took it already.

1705
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,400
-Their team has it.
-It seems that way.

1706
01:21:45,266 --> 01:21:46,800
[Tae-hyun] Come on. Come into the room.

1707
01:21:46,867 --> 01:21:49,834
Their purpose was crystal clear.

1708
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:50,800
Here's what we saw.

1709
01:21:50,867 --> 01:21:53,700
They dug a hole
to reconstruct an apartment

1710
01:21:53,767 --> 01:21:54,767
and found something.

1711
01:21:54,834 --> 01:21:56,767
-A two-syllable word.
-Two syllables.

1712
01:21:56,834 --> 01:22:00,367
But someone stole it.

1713
01:22:00,433 --> 01:22:02,100
Did you find it?

1714
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:05,266
-That team took it already.
-It was empty.

1715
01:22:05,834 --> 01:22:07,100
They know the secret.

1716
01:22:07,166 --> 01:22:08,600
They already know it.

1717
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:11,800
-Did they search the unit and find it?
-[Se-chan] I think so.

1718
01:22:11,867 --> 01:22:13,900
[JENNIE] But it makes no sense.

1719
01:22:13,967 --> 01:22:15,967
It hasn't been long since we got the clue.

1720
01:22:16,033 --> 01:22:17,567
The clue. Yes.

1721
01:22:17,633 --> 01:22:19,133
-They couldn't have known.
-Right.

1722
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,533
It's pure gold.

1723
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,734
-See? It's gold.
-But…

1724
01:22:44,967 --> 01:22:46,700
Gosh, it could've ended badly.

1725
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,333
"In 1998,

1726
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:01,166
a vein of gold was found
at an apartment construction site.

1727
01:23:01,233 --> 01:23:04,300
The construction company employee
who discovered it

1728
01:23:04,367 --> 01:23:06,600
stole the gold at night,
so the police are after him.

1729
01:23:06,667 --> 01:23:08,700
You're the construction company employee

1730
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:10,600
who knows Woosang Apartment's secret."

1731
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:16,200
You're the construction company employee
who knows Woosang Apartment's secret.

1732
01:23:18,567 --> 01:23:20,667
[reporter] Kim, an employee
of the construction company,

1733
01:23:20,734 --> 01:23:24,000
got caught while trying to steal gold
in the middle of the night.

1734
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:27,834
Kim was handed over to the police
who came upon receiving a report,

1735
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:31,266
but the retrieved gold
has gone missing again.

1736
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:34,734
"Please reenact the event from now on."

1737
01:23:40,834 --> 01:23:42,900
Maybe there is a hint somewhere.

1738
01:23:42,967 --> 01:23:46,867
[Tae-hyun] "When you place a weight
that is between five and ten kilograms

1739
01:23:46,934 --> 01:23:49,533
on the scale, the bathtub will open."

1740
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,567
"Every time you open the bathtub,

1741
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:16,600
you can only move
two gold bars to the briefcase.

1742
01:24:16,667 --> 01:24:19,533
You must fill the briefcase
with all ten gold bars

1743
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,934
in order to take them
outside the apartment bathroom."

1744
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,367
"Look at unit 406."

1745
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:29,100
Kiwi. I can't find a kiwi-related item.

1746
01:24:29,734 --> 01:24:31,867
Maybe there is a clue somewhere.

1747
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:32,867
Unit 406.

1748
01:24:35,233 --> 01:24:37,734
I've been on variety shows
for over ten years.

1749
01:24:39,567 --> 01:24:42,066
Jung-ha, go to the other unit.

1750
01:24:42,133 --> 01:24:43,166
The other unit?

1751
01:24:43,233 --> 01:24:44,066
Keep them from coming here.

1752
01:24:44,133 --> 01:24:47,834
I'll put away the golden pig
and other items.

1753
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,000
Okay.

1754
01:24:51,367 --> 01:24:52,700
Gosh, it's heavy.

1755
01:24:52,767 --> 01:24:54,066
Gold.

1756
01:24:56,934 --> 01:24:58,233
I need to use the bathroom.

1757
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,967
[Na-ra]
Could there be a meaning behind it?

1758
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:05,600
There must be something.

1759
01:25:28,533 --> 01:25:30,033
[reporter] …but the retrieved gold

1760
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,166
has gone missing again.

1761
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,333
Now, we know that the item is gold.

1762
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,100
-We're looking for gold.
-Gold.

1763
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:38,233
I think the other team knows it too.

1764
01:25:39,433 --> 01:25:42,834
[Tae-hyun]
"Please reenact the event from now on."

1765
01:25:44,066 --> 01:25:46,000
According to the note,

1766
01:25:46,066 --> 01:25:48,100
you can take out two gold bars at a time.

1767
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:51,500
You can put in two gold bars at a time.

1768
01:25:51,567 --> 01:25:54,133
-Did they move the gold bars?
-[JENNIE] There were ten.

1769
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,567
[Se-chan] There were ten,
but I don't know where they went.

1770
01:25:56,633 --> 01:25:59,100
Danger Man?

1771
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:01,266
Shall we turn it on?
Maybe the video works.

1772
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:07,500
There was 5 kg. What does it mean?
Is there 5 kg of gold?

1773
01:26:07,567 --> 01:26:08,834
I didn't watch the hint.

1774
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,233
On the tape,

1775
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:14,100
it only said, "Unit 406."
That was why I came back right away.

1776
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,200
EXIT OPEN TIME: 4:30 TO 5 P.M.

1777
01:26:18,767 --> 01:26:21,200
These are the only movies
with "gold" in the title.

1778
01:26:21,767 --> 01:26:23,667
Are there tapes in other rooms?

1779
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Huh?

1780
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,133
Didn't you say something?

1781
01:26:56,834 --> 01:26:59,400
These movies must hold a clue.

1782
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:09,767
[Woo-il] It's an announcement.

1783
01:27:10,734 --> 01:27:12,400
This is an announcement.

1784
01:27:12,467 --> 01:27:16,467
From now on, I'll tell you about
the briefcase that's full of gold bars.

1785
01:27:16,533 --> 01:27:19,934
-We were right. There are gold bars.
-When the exit…

1786
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,667
When the exit opens

1787
01:27:23,734 --> 01:27:25,033
between 4:30 and 5 p.m…

1788
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,400
CONGRATULATIONS
ON FINDING GOLD BARS

1789
01:27:26,467 --> 01:27:28,667
…you must take the briefcase of gold bars

1790
01:27:28,734 --> 01:27:30,867
and escape the apartment.

1791
01:27:32,667 --> 01:27:36,734
Among you there are people who know
about the secret of the gold bars.

1792
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,734
The two construction company employees.

1793
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,734
Two construction company employees.

1794
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,266
Among us?

1795
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:51,567
-Is that so?
-Hey.

1796
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:54,734
-Among us? Hey.
-Is that so?

1797
01:27:56,066 --> 01:27:59,266
-Among us? Hey.
-Is that so?

1798
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:01,700
-Jae-seok.
-Hold on.

1799
01:28:01,767 --> 01:28:03,333
-It isn't me.
-My goodness.

1800
01:28:04,033 --> 01:28:05,100
-Na-ra.
-It isn't me.

1801
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:06,233
There are two.

1802
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,000
-It isn't me. Seriously.
-Tae-hyun.

1803
01:28:08,066 --> 01:28:10,166
-So they've been playing with us?
-Yes.

1804
01:28:10,233 --> 01:28:12,266
-There are two employees.
-It isn't me.

1805
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:13,533
-What? JENNIE.
-No way.

1806
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,967
-It really isn't me.
-Seriously.

1807
01:28:16,033 --> 01:28:17,867
-Does that mean you tricked me?
-It isn't me.

1808
01:28:17,934 --> 01:28:19,000
-It isn't me.
-Jae-seok.

1809
01:28:19,066 --> 01:28:19,900
Seriously.

1810
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,934
[reporter] Breaking news.

1811
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,867
At 3 p.m. today
at an apartment construction site in Seoul

1812
01:28:27,934 --> 01:28:30,333
that recently made the news
due to a vein of gold,

1813
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:34,400
gold bars disappeared
and shocked everyone.

1814
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,900
According to eyewitness accounts,

1815
01:28:36,967 --> 01:28:39,834
two construction employees went missing.

1816
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:43,567
Since one of them ran away secretly
with the gold bars,

1817
01:28:43,633 --> 01:28:45,000
the police began to investigate.

1818
01:28:45,066 --> 01:28:47,166
To find the whereabouts
of the missing gold,

1819
01:28:47,233 --> 01:28:50,600
the police are trying to get
the full story through witness accounts.

1820
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:53,000
This has been Park Ji-man of KVN News.

1821
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,066
[Woo-il] If one of the employees

1822
01:29:01,133 --> 01:29:03,734
escapes with the briefcase of gold bars,

1823
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:07,800
he or she will take all the gold.

1824
01:29:07,867 --> 01:29:09,667
If one of the residents

1825
01:29:09,734 --> 01:29:12,533
finds the briefcase of gold bars
and escapes,

1826
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,467
he or she will take all the gold.

1827
01:29:17,734 --> 01:29:19,667
-I can't believe you.
-It isn't me.

1828
01:29:19,734 --> 01:29:21,567
-It's you.
-Don't suspect me.

1829
01:29:21,633 --> 01:29:22,867
-We--
-I shared information.

1830
01:29:22,934 --> 01:29:23,967
-The three of us worked hard.
-You.

1831
01:29:24,567 --> 01:29:27,300
-I can't believe you.
-I think it's him.

1832
01:29:27,367 --> 01:29:30,700
Can't you believe me? Please believe me.
I really don't know.

1833
01:29:30,767 --> 01:29:32,166
I feel so victimized.

1834
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:34,500
I'm not acting.

1835
01:29:34,567 --> 01:29:37,000
I'm not acting. I'm serious.

1836
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:41,400
Other than the time I came here briefly,
I didn't do anything alone.

1837
01:29:41,467 --> 01:29:42,467
Hey.

1838
01:29:43,266 --> 01:29:46,000
-What is it?
-It isn't me.

1839
01:29:46,066 --> 01:29:48,667
What? He's suspicious.

1840
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,066
It isn't me. Don't look at me.

1841
01:29:52,133 --> 01:29:54,400
The bathroom? It really isn't me.

1842
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,433
-Tae-hyun.
-My microphone. I don't have it on me.

1843
01:30:03,166 --> 01:30:04,500
My microphone.

1844
01:30:04,567 --> 01:30:06,834
A microphone? For goodness' sake.

1845
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,533
I thought he was a professional.

1846
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,266
Unbelievable. While he was pooping…

1847
01:30:12,834 --> 01:30:16,300
If all of us barge in,
they'll become suspicious.

1848
01:30:16,367 --> 01:30:19,266
Are you saying that you'll go alone?
Jae-seok.

1849
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:21,600
-[JENNIE] He's quicker to act now.
-[Se-chan] I know.

1850
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:22,834
I'm nervous.

1851
01:30:25,266 --> 01:30:27,567
-Can I use the bathroom?
-Now?

1852
01:30:27,633 --> 01:30:29,400
-There's a camera.
-I see.

1853
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,400
Where is the briefcase hidden?

1854
01:30:40,467 --> 01:30:42,400
Hold on. Did we hide it?

1855
01:30:42,467 --> 01:30:43,600
-No.
-No?

1856
01:30:43,667 --> 01:30:48,033
The two construction employees
who took the gold

1857
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,133
-hid it somewhere.
-When did they hide…

1858
01:30:51,033 --> 01:30:53,333
-I'm really sorry.
-It isn't me.

1859
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,834
Se-chan, I'm sorry,
but it can't be anyone else.

1860
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,567
-It's you.
-It isn't me.

1861
01:30:57,633 --> 01:31:01,700
-Jae-seok, I really left the microphone.
-The circumstances point to you.

1862
01:31:01,767 --> 01:31:04,800
Se-chan, how many years
have you starred in variety shows?

1863
01:31:04,867 --> 01:31:07,433
-Let me begin the interview.
-You little…

1864
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,133
-How many years has it been?
-About ten years.

1865
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:13,166
Is it common for an expert
to leave a microphone in the bathroom?

1866
01:31:13,233 --> 01:31:16,000
It isn't common, but it does happen.
Right? Think about it.

1867
01:31:16,066 --> 01:31:17,400
-It happens.
-Seriously.

1868
01:31:17,467 --> 01:31:21,400
-Of course, there's a 2% chance.
-You know how it is.

1869
01:31:21,467 --> 01:31:25,000
You only forget a microphone
when you leave it someplace else.

1870
01:31:25,066 --> 01:31:25,900
Isn't that right?

1871
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,300
Does that mean someone hid it already?

1872
01:31:29,367 --> 01:31:31,400
-Or are we--
-Someone hid it already.

1873
01:31:31,467 --> 01:31:32,767
-We're looking for it.
-Yes.

1874
01:31:32,834 --> 01:31:34,734
But that employee knows where it is.

1875
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,367
Of course.

1876
01:31:36,433 --> 01:31:37,567
I think the rice cooker--

1877
01:31:37,633 --> 01:31:39,300
So the gold…

1878
01:31:39,367 --> 01:31:40,400
Come on.

1879
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,734
-…the rice cooker--
-So the gold…

1880
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,400
-Come on.
-Hold on.

1881
01:31:44,467 --> 01:31:46,500
It's one of us three.

1882
01:31:48,633 --> 01:31:50,667
We need to suspect Jae-seok's backpack.

1883
01:31:50,734 --> 01:31:51,867
-But--
-Jae-seok.

1884
01:31:51,934 --> 01:31:54,367
-We can go to the rooftop, right?
-Yes, we can.

1885
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,266
-Se-chan, be honest.
-You're wrong.

1886
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:05,667
What if it isn't me?

1887
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:06,834
Then I…

1888
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:09,300
I can't help but suspect you from now on.

1889
01:32:09,867 --> 01:32:11,500
For goodness' sake.

1890
01:32:11,567 --> 01:32:13,967
I'll be here. Tae-hyun, I'll be here.

1891
01:32:14,033 --> 01:32:17,033
JENNIE is sure it's me.
You might as well go and find Jae-seok.

1892
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,033
-Where is Jae-seok?
-He went to the rooftop.

1893
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,200
-The rooftop?
-Hey, it might be

1894
01:32:20,266 --> 01:32:21,900
-Jae-seok.
-You let him go?

1895
01:32:21,967 --> 01:32:23,367
He went to find the bag.

1896
01:32:23,433 --> 01:32:25,433
You don't know if he plans to run away.

1897
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,433
I can't believe you.

1898
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,700
[Na-ra] It's game over if he escapes.

1899
01:32:33,033 --> 01:32:35,500
-What? Jung-ha disappeared.
-Tae-hyun.

1900
01:32:35,567 --> 01:32:36,767
[Na-ra] It's him.

1901
01:32:44,166 --> 01:32:46,000
It's him.

1902
01:32:46,066 --> 01:32:48,133
He went downstairs. He did, right?

1903
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,100
He went downstairs.

1904
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:53,600
Jae-seok is alone on the rooftop.

1905
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,500
Why is no one watching him?

1906
01:33:00,633 --> 01:33:01,900
Why are you so relaxed?

1907
01:33:01,967 --> 01:33:04,567
-JENNIE, who are you?
-Yes?

1908
01:33:04,633 --> 01:33:06,500
-Who are you?
-I…

1909
01:33:06,567 --> 01:33:08,467
I'm investigating.

1910
01:33:08,533 --> 01:33:11,100
-You're too-- Why are you so relaxed?
-JENNIE.

1911
01:33:11,166 --> 01:33:12,533
-What's up with you?
-Tae-hyun.

1912
01:33:13,033 --> 01:33:15,233
[Na-ra] He didn't go downstairs.
Where is he?

1913
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,900
[Se-chan] Maybe he's upstairs.

1914
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:18,133
[Na-ra] Where is he?

1915
01:33:21,567 --> 01:33:24,233
No one is here, right? I'm scared.

1916
01:33:24,934 --> 01:33:26,533
Hey, what are you doing?

1917
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:27,600
No!

1918
01:33:28,834 --> 01:33:30,300
No one is here, right?

1919
01:33:34,834 --> 01:33:36,300
I'm scared.

1920
01:33:36,367 --> 01:33:38,066
Hey, what are you doing?

1921
01:33:38,133 --> 01:33:40,300
No!

1922
01:33:40,367 --> 01:33:41,867
[Se-chan laughing]

1923
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:47,100
-[Na-ra] No!
-What?

1924
01:33:48,066 --> 01:33:49,834
-What's going on?
-He ran away!

1925
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:52,433
-It isn't you.
-It isn't me.

1926
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,633
[Na-ra] No!

1927
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:57,667
[Jung-ha] Mister.

1928
01:33:57,734 --> 01:33:59,266
[Se-chan shouts]

1929
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:01,967
These gold bars are mine.

1930
01:34:02,533 --> 01:34:04,200
[laughs]

1931
01:34:10,633 --> 01:34:12,800
"We welcome you to Woosang Apartment.

1932
01:34:12,867 --> 01:34:14,834
Woosang Apartment holds a secret."

1933
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:16,834
I'm a construction company employee.

1934
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:18,367
Okay.

1935
01:34:19,667 --> 01:34:21,800
-Apartment.
-Sir.

1936
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,533
-Come on.
-Sir. Hold on.

1937
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,300
It should be enough.

1938
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,767
All done.

1939
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:34,367
All right. Nice.

1940
01:34:34,433 --> 01:34:35,900
My goodness.

1941
01:34:35,967 --> 01:34:36,967
[gasps]

1942
01:34:43,066 --> 01:34:44,700
There's another employee.

1943
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,000
In that case…

1944
01:35:10,533 --> 01:35:13,567
-Is there something there?
-What?

1945
01:35:13,633 --> 01:35:15,600
-What are you doing?
-Searching.

1946
01:35:15,667 --> 01:35:17,633
For what? Something must be in here.

1947
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,600
No.

1948
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:25,800
You know that unit 406 is the key.
Unit 406.

1949
01:35:25,867 --> 01:35:27,867
-Unit 406.
-You know that unit 406 is the key.

1950
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:31,233
-Unit 406.
-Unit 406.

1951
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,600
If I take it in a thermos…

1952
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,266
-Tae-hyun.
-My microphone.

1953
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:40,433
A microphone? For goodness' sake.

1954
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,166
I thought he was a professional.

1955
01:35:42,233 --> 01:35:43,500
Unbelievable.

1956
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,967
Is that it? I don't know what to do.

1957
01:36:13,233 --> 01:36:15,700
-Hey, Yang Se-chan.
-I'm sorry.

1958
01:36:15,767 --> 01:36:17,066
You left it by the toilet.

1959
01:36:17,133 --> 01:36:20,133
Gosh, my microphone.

1960
01:36:22,433 --> 01:36:24,033
[laughs, exclaims]

1961
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,834
-[shouts]
-He went out!

1962
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:31,734
Tell me that it isn't Se-chan.

1963
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,700
Please. I'm going to feel so hurt.

1964
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:39,066
-It's over.
-Seriously, Se-chan.

1965
01:36:39,133 --> 01:36:41,033
Isn't this too much?

1966
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,633
-Seriously.
-It's over, right?

1967
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:45,200
Se-chan.

1968
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:48,600
Seriously. He escaped. It was him.

1969
01:36:48,667 --> 01:36:50,467
He's so mean.

1970
01:36:50,533 --> 01:36:52,033
CONGRATULATIONS
ON FINDING GOLD BARS

1971
01:36:52,667 --> 01:36:53,734
My goodness.

1972
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:56,233
[Se-chan laughs] Tae-hyun.

1973
01:36:58,367 --> 01:36:59,934
[Tae-hyun] You're incredible.

1974
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,533
-What's Jae-seok doing?
-I don't know.

1975
01:37:05,633 --> 01:37:07,100
What's Jae-seok doing?

1976
01:37:07,166 --> 01:37:09,166
He went to the rooftop by himself.

1977
01:37:12,033 --> 01:37:13,734
I don't think it's here.

1978
01:37:14,367 --> 01:37:15,433
It's over.

1979
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,700
Why?

1980
01:37:17,967 --> 01:37:20,166
Who was it? For goodness' sake.

1981
01:37:24,934 --> 01:37:27,033
JENNIE, is it over?

1982
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:28,600
[JENNIE] It was Se-chan.

1983
01:37:29,166 --> 01:37:30,500
That little…

1984
01:37:30,567 --> 01:37:31,934
He behaved strangely, right?

1985
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,467
Seriously. The microphone made no sense.

1986
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
-I'm a resident who found the briefcase.
-What?

1987
01:37:40,066 --> 01:37:42,934
I'm not a construction company employee
but a resident who--

1988
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,066
[laughs]

1989
01:37:44,133 --> 01:37:45,567
A resident who-- [laughs]

1990
01:37:45,633 --> 01:37:47,133
-What?
-You punk.

1991
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,633
-You jerk.
-Hey.

1992
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:51,967
It was so much work
to transfer those bars, you jerk.

1993
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:53,767
-What?
-Was it you?

1994
01:37:53,834 --> 01:37:55,934
-What?
-Was it you?

1995
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,934
-I knew it was the two of them.
-Really?

1996
01:37:59,233 --> 01:38:01,734
He pulled the rug out from under my feet.
I did all the work.

1997
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,834
Really?

1998
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,500
I did all the work.

1999
01:38:05,567 --> 01:38:08,367
He readied the briefcase tastefully.
It was hidden

2000
01:38:08,433 --> 01:38:09,567
under some clothes.

2001
01:38:09,633 --> 01:38:11,533
It was begging to be picked up.

2002
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,800
So I picked it up, hid it someplace quiet

2003
01:38:14,867 --> 01:38:16,033
and carried it out later.

2004
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:18,166
I get it now.

2005
01:38:18,233 --> 01:38:20,066
-Get what?
-Variety shows.

2006
01:38:21,066 --> 01:38:22,233
Variety shows.

2007
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:24,233
What do you know?

2008
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:25,200
I get it now.

2009
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,433
[Na-ra] I'm so shocked.

2010
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,834
Na-ra.

2011
01:38:30,033 --> 01:38:31,934
-"The rooftop isn't it."
-I'll trust you only.

2012
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:34,367
-Trust me only.
-At that moment…

2013
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,734
At an apartment reconstruction site
in Mapo-gu, Seoul,

2014
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:42,066
a vein of gold was found.

2015
01:38:42,133 --> 01:38:44,567
Since the move-in date was near,

2016
01:38:44,633 --> 01:38:46,900
the Reconstruction Association
forwent an analysis

2017
01:38:46,967 --> 01:38:50,667
and named the apartment
Mapo Gold Apartment.

2018
01:39:10,066 --> 01:39:12,233
[Na-ra] My heart dropped.

2019
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:14,033
-We don't know what the topic will be.
-No.

2020
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:16,667
It's about a crime.

2021
01:39:16,734 --> 01:39:19,300
"Increasing penalty levels for poisoning.

2022
01:39:19,367 --> 01:39:20,834
Eradicating antisocial crimes.

2023
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:22,834
String of kidnappings
involving high school girls."

2024
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:25,734
Are we looking for a missing person today?

2025
01:39:26,433 --> 01:39:28,967
[voice] Hello? Is that you, Mi-young?

2026
01:39:29,533 --> 01:39:30,567
Who are you?

2027
01:39:30,633 --> 01:39:31,700
Catch him!

2028
01:39:36,433 --> 01:39:37,266
That startled me.

2029
01:39:37,834 --> 01:39:40,667
"…time to listen to Lee Moon-sae."

2030
01:39:40,734 --> 01:39:42,066
-Gosh.
-What?

2031
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:44,734
I did it.

2032
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
The phone is ringing.

2033
01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:49,667
-Hold on. Hello?
-Hold on.

2034
01:39:50,967 --> 01:39:52,433
-Hello?
-Let me listen as well.

2035
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,033
What was it?

2036
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:56,333
-Why did you hang up?
-Why did you hang up?

2037
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,000
-Come here.
-For goodness' sake.

2038
01:39:58,066 --> 01:39:59,033
Unbelievable.

2039
01:39:59,533 --> 01:40:01,233
Are you a delinquent?

2040
01:40:01,734 --> 01:40:03,700
That isn't how you do it.

2041
01:40:03,767 --> 01:40:05,533
Are they doing it out in the open?

2042
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,333
Na-ra, where are you going?

2043
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:09,300
You jerk, how dare you…

2044
01:40:09,367 --> 01:40:11,033
Gosh, it's getting dirty.

2045
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:13,834
-Let's see.
-You're too much.

2046
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:15,400
Come on. Hey.

2047
