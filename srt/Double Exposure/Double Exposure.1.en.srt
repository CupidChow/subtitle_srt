3
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,040
I walk in the night.

4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,930
It's early summer night.

5
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,840
I'm limping along.

6
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,830
Without destination.

7
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,520
I woke up from dream.

8
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,110
One foot remains in the dream.

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,850
I saw him

10
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,070
in a daze.

11
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,220
He watched me silently.

12
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,660
My eyes are getting used to the darkness.

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,620
I'm starting to

14
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,990
recognize him clearly.

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,820
After staring for a while.

16
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,420
His hands

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,370
began to

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,840
touch me gently.

19
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,590
It begins with lip.

20
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,210
Then the cheek,

21
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,250
the earlobe,

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,280
the tip of the nose,

23
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,410
nape of the neck.

24
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,970
Gently touch my Adam's apple

25
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,220
with his finger tips.

26
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,190
His hands are warm.

27
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,930
Chest, Thighs,

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
and Calfs.

29
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,590
Then he plays

30
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,830
with my nipples.

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,450
Then I made

32
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,050
a sound.

33
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,590
My body was carefully

34
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,890
embraced for a while.

35
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,530
His hand reached there.

36
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,630
Went to the place.

37
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,690
I woke up from dream.

38
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,140
DOUBLE EXPOSURE

39
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,530
It's really short.

40
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,170
Oh it's so hot.

41
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,490
Hot?

42
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,690
Are you ok?

43
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,770
Ms?

44
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,050
Yeah?

45
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,620
Thank you.

46
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,610
Thank you for understanding me.

47
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,450
I'm okay with this because of you.

48
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,260
I'm not so mean.

49
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,910
Thank you.

50
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,290
But my aunt's grandmother was,
I met her once when I was nine?

51
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,930
That is the last time.

52
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,770
Actually, I don't feel much kinship with her.

53
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,840
Mom says if you are a polite child.

54
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,840
You should show up.

55
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,790
So annoying.

56
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,870
I feel like keep working without rest even at home
because I have to prepare for studying aboard.

57
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,450
Day at work, night at preparation.

58
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,800
But mom's intentions should be appreciated
if that's the case.

59
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,230
Have a good trip.

60
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,800
And I hope your mother takes care of herself.

61
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,880
My mom has a strong personality

62
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,880
But.

63
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,010
Ah.

64
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,350
Writer.

65
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,410
The model.

66
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,120
Sonia? She got some weight.

67
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,770
Not Sonia.

68
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,140
Your personal project model.
I want to recommend you one.

69
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,370
He's not a show-off.

70
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,370
That's my boyfriend.

71
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,370
It's been 3 years.

72
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,370
You have a boyfriend?

73
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,450
Yes.

74
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,430
In fact, I'm going to study abroad
with him this time.

75
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,590
I am studying photography and
he is studying management.

76
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,240
Did he say he's going to

77
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,160
Italy to study management?

78
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,190
Ugh...

79
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,750
He just wanna escape.

80
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,250
As I'm out, so he plans to go with me.

81
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,670
That's nice. Your boyfriend.

82
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,000
I was just talking. He heard me.

83
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,010
He is quiet. But sometimes he has another face.

84
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,660
He doesn't think about it.

85
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,410
Do you want to photo that?

86
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,840
Huh?

87
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,860
I will show you the pictures.

88
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,700
He was in my dream.

89
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,020
Yes?

90
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,530
Him.

91
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,530
He was in my dream.

92
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,380
Him?

93
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,920
Yeah. Last night.

94
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,990
Do you know him?

95
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,850
I don't.

96
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,660
But he is in your dream?

97
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,270
Yes.

98
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,270
He is.

99
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,450
It is him.

100
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,020
How come?

101
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,770
Isn't it kind of, like, déjà vu?

102
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,770
No, not that.

103
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,090
It's not.

104
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,290
Oh.

105
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,290
That's magical.

106
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,130
But what did you dream of?

107
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,860
A wet dream.

108
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,650
Ha.

109
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,700
Does that make sense?

110
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,310
You're still doing this at your age?

111
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,310
Nonsense.

112
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,800
But what did he do in your dream?

113
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,460
Ah.

114
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,210
Did he say something?

115
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,290
No.

116
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,790
He said nothing.

117
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,070
Why do I remember it so well?

118
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,470
Is the dream clear?

119
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,260
Yeah.

120
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,460
It's amazing how complete a dream
like that can be.

121
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,590
So what did him do in your dream?

122
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,030
He touched me.

123
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,540
Emm.

124
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,540
Really?

125
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,250
Yeah.

126
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,730
He uses his hand.

127
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,140
I came so quick.

128
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,540
What?

129
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,680
The texture.

130
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,340
It was soft.

131
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,310
I came so quick.

132
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,060
Isn't he cute?

133
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,130
Is it the day after tomorrow?

134
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,470
It's tomorrow.

135
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,930
No, it's not the day I go there.

136
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,170
It is the day you go to the studio.

137
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,240
Do I have to go?

138
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,710
I don't quite like that.

139
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,710
You are being like this again.

140
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,790
He is good at photographing.

141
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,510
Not that.

142
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,510
I'm average.

143
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,050
I've been working my ass off on this.

144
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,050
You know it.

145
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,050
You did so much.

146
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,870
Just so you know. The day after tomorrow?

147
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,360
You know what I'm talking about.

148
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,510
You are pretending you don't.

149
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,510
I don't know.

150
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,690
You will be super cute.

151
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,330
Don't forget that.

152
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,480
Yeah.

153
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,880
Do the homework.

154
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,600
Yeah.

155
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,950
Homework?

156
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,250
Photograph.

157
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,950
Ah, that.

158
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,310
Nothing special.

159
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,470
It's just a camera in the front.

160
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,110
You are in front of the camera.

161
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,790
You can just stand there.

162
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,790
Or you can sit.

163
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:58,790
No.

164
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,290
Just do what he want.

165
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,870
Is that easy?

166
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,870
Yes.

167
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,870
What's difficult?

168
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,870
Maybe it's easy for you.

169
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,960
No.

170
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,190
You said it's easy.

171
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,780
You also think it's difficult?

172
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,660
Whatever is up to the individual.

173
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,170
What are you talking about?

174
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,350
Well.

175
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,390
The first five minutes is difficult to anything.

176
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,680
I don't care about that.

177
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,210
I heard a lot about you from A-ra.

178
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,810
Heard a lot

179
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,930
about me?

180
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,770
Thank you, Ki-jun.

181
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,630
Thank you for participating in the shoot.

182
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,820
Don't be.

183
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,220
It's not usual.

184
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,020
Now your face and your words
are completely different.

185
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,190
Ah.

186
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,900
I'm embarrassed.

187
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,910
A-ra.

188
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,430
She's aggressive right?

189
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,300
Yeah, you know.

190
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,910
Her mom is more aggressive.

191
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,230
I never see that.

192
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,510
That's not important.

193
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,980
Right?

194
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,950
Yeah.

195
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,750
But.

196
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,970
Have we met?

197
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,620
Sorry?

198
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,810
Have we met somewhere?

199
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,230
Me?

200
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,530
Maybe.

201
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,890
Did A-ra ever take you to the studio?

202
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,150
How come.

203
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,290
Why you look so familiar?
(Watch on www.kisskh.do or www.kisskh.ovh to support Admin)

204
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,690
Really?

205
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,030
No.

206
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,260
Instead of looking familiar,

207
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,780
I actually saw someone who looked a lot like you
in a dream the other day.

208
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,510
The more I look at you,
the more I think you look exactly alike.

209
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,890
Maybe A-ra showed you my pictures.

210
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,940
No, never.

211
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,120
It's amazing.

212
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,330
Is it a memory fake?

213
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,750
Yes?

214
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,880
Sometimes that's what happens when you're living.

215
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,190
That make sense.

216
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,420
But.

217
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,870
So?

218
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,370
What was the dream?

219
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,050
It's a little bit... to say the dream.

220
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,180
It's...

221
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,750
Not that important.

222
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,580
Right.

223
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,240
Right?

224
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,370
Tell me next time.

225
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,730
Maybe?

226
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,810
Sure.

227
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,810
Yes.

228
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,850
Let's try it today.

229
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,630
How tall are you?

230
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,570
175cm.

231
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,570
Your weight?

232
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,770
Around 70kg.

233
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,820
Recently I gained some weight.
I eat well.

234
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,390
Ah.

235
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,250
That's nice.

236
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,930
Would it be better if I lost some weight?

237
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,930
No, no.

238
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,790
You look just right.

239
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,870
Really?

240
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,160
But I definitely look better when I'm a little thinner.

241
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,100
A-ra doesn't like you being thinner?

242
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,040
I don't know.

243
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,810
What about you?

244
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,450
Me?

245
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,630
What do you think of A-ra?

246
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,890
I don't know about that...

247
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,410
It's not important.

248
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,670
Right?

249
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,380
What?

250
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,880
Her body doesn't matter.

251
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,350
Ah, yes.

252
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,060
I'd like to talk a little bit. Just a little conversation.

253
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,060
You did well.

254
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,990
Ah, sorry.

255
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,070
No. no.

256
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,070
It's perfect

257
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,070
what you look like now.

258
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,470
Thank you.

259
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,470
Yes?

260
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,550
You have juvenile beauty.

261
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,550
You have a blush on your face.

262
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,410
It's not easy.

263
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,130
You haven't tried? Really?

264
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,770
No.

265
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,910
I'm a very distant person from this.

266
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,200
I didn't even think about it.

267
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,540
A very distant man, but lucky.

268
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,790
Thanks.

269
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,190
Please take care.

270
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,710
Anyway I'll do it.

271
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,810
I am grateful.

272
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,190
See it?

273
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,670
You can do it.

274
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,220
No, it's okay.

275
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,840
It's not bad if you can do it well.

276
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,660
Be my guest.

277
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,470
I'll do my best though I'm not good at it.

278
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,600
Okay, good.

279
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,950
I'll lead Ki-jun well.

280
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,380
I'll follow you carefully.

281
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,730
Yeah, it's gonna be good if you follow me.

282
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,300
I'll lead you, so follow well.

283
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,080
Yes.

284
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,340
I'll do whatever you say.

285
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,820
Whatever?

286
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,830
Yes.

287
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,410
But I don't know why you are satisfied with me.

288
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,880
Maybe, just feeling.

289
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,830
Feels good.

290
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,070
What kind of feeling?

291
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,020
Fresh.

292
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,620
And when I talk with you, I felt...

293
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,760
You are hiding something?

294
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,110
Secretly.

295
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,760
So.

296
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,510
That's complicated.

297
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,910
Am I like that?

298
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,510
A-ra knows me.

299
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,650
We are similar.

300
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,650
We have the same taste.

301
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,650
Ah.

302
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,750
A-ra's taste is good.

303
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,540
And you look soft.

304
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,650
Me?

305
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,650
Especially your hands.

306
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,970
You noticed my hands?

307
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,970
Yeah.

308
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,100
Looks soft.

309
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,610
Like a Leonardo da Vinci painting.

310
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,940
Da Vinci?

311
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,210
Yeah.

312
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,940
Have you ever seen his paintings?

313
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,160
Only in books.

314
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,410
You will see in Italy.

315
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,190
When you see it.

316
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,770
Oh soft hands, you will get it.

317
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:34,850
Yes.

318
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,260
Hands...

319
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,190
Yeah, that's it.

320
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,260
You look good to me.

321
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,190
You are good, Ki-jun.

322
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,710
Rather than you can do it well,

323
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,190
I want to say I can draw you well.

324
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,050
Something like that.

325
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,370
Good.

326
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,370
Wait a minute.

327
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,510
Look at the camera.

328
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,710
Relax.

329
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,230
Can you be more relax?

330
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,290
Head up, look at me.

331
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,690
You?

332
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,940
No, camera, lens, look at lens.

333
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,820
Your right arm...

334
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,730
Like this.

335
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,090
More natural...

336
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,430
Can you take off your shirt?

337
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,250
Sorry?

338
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,510
Shirt.

339
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,510
You want me to take off the clothes?

340
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,660
Yes.

341
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,300
Right now?

342
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,950
Is that hard for you?

343
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,620
No.

344
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,980
Slow down.

345
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,070
Move your hands away.

346
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,030
Look at the camera.

347
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,400
Smile.

348
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,560
Would you also take off your pants?

349
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,560
Pants?

350
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,730
Yes.

351
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,740
OK.

352
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,970
Yes, let's give it a shot.

353
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,520
Relax your arms.

354
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,970
Put your hands behind.

355
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,730
Relax your right arm, yes.

356
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,630
Look at the camera.

357
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,630
Please smile.

358
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,630
That's right.

359
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,250
Move your hand away.

360
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,250
Would you like to take it off?

361
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,250
What?

362
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,710
Yes.

363
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,720
All of it?

364
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,450
Yes.

365
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,710
If you feel it hard, then it's fine.

366
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,100
OK.

367
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,630
Move your hands away.

368
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,010
Come on.

369
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,370
Put your hands behind.

370
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,110
Can you

371
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,490
put your hand on your right?

372
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,490
Right.

373
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,960
You're like an angel.

374
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,220
Look up. That's right.

375
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,010
Can you hold your right arm with your left hand?

376
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,060
Beautiful.

377
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,190
That's right.

378
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,930
Could you lie down?

379
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,320
That's right.

380
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,710
Look at me.

381
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,650
Good.

382
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:52,970
Look at the other side.

383
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,320
That's right.

384
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,590
Would you like to take a rest?
I make you too tired.

385
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,750
OK.

386
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,210
You must be thirsty.

387
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,280
I will make you feel easier.

388
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,280
Thank you.

389
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,220
Cae Won Dang

390
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,130
We made a mistake.

391
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:55,640
Ki-jun tried his best to love me.

392
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,670
I felt grateful so

393
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,120
I decided to try my best to pretend loving him.

394
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,410
I have made up my mind.

395
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,370
But I didn't manage it very well.

396
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,690
Ki-jun was unskilled.

397
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:18,810
I was unethical.

398
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,930
Honestly,

399
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,610
I find Ki-jun doesn't seem to be satisfied.

400
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,600
I knew that Ki-jun was watching me.

401
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,020
I could feel it even when I closed my eyes.

402
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,980
At that time,
I couldn't stop pretending to sleep.

403
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:51,950
It was either I didn't want to disturb his pleasure time

404
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,290
or

405
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,990
I was afraid that

406
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,460
he would find out my anxiety

407
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,020
when I open my eyes

408
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,200
and our eyes meet.

409
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,080
I am thinking about not going to Italy.

410
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,110
I want to stop feeling sorry to A-ra and...

411
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,250
Ki-jun.

412
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,390
You should become
a little bit more cunning, Ki-jun.

413
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,130
I just feel...

414
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,290
You should keep dating A-ra

415
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,530
and go to Italy.

416
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,850
When time goes by

417
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,780
for long or short,
I tell him that I will become a stranger

418
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,170
or

419
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,230
one of the bad guys
who just passed through your life.

420
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,430
He's still unskilled and delicate.

421
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,580
He can't give up on me immediately.

422
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:05,720
Ki-jun's face

423
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,860
gradually became blurring

424
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:10,860
and went further and further,

425
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,000
finally disappeared in my mind.

426
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,280
As planned,
Ki-jun went to Italy with A-ra.

427
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,910
It was Ki-jun who said that
he wanted to stay with me.

428
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,510
But I tried hard to send him away.

429
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:33,050
I stepped back as I pretended to consider his future.

430
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,050
Just like a hypocrite.

431
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,610
Should we begin to take the photos now?

432
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,550
Let's chat first.

433
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:54,890
OK.

434
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,070
What's your height and...

435
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,690
175 cm and 70 kg.

436
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,390
Great.

437
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:01,520
Alright.

438
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,480
I didn't exercise recently
so my body shape isn't that good now.

439
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,100
No.

440
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,460
It's good enough.

441
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,800
If you think so, thanks.

442
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,640
On that day,

443
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,600
why did you fall sleep at that place?

444
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,460
I didn't fall asleep.

445
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,420
I just lied down.

446
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,980
Did that happen a lot?

447
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:31,680
Sometims.

448
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,880
Sometimes it happens.

449
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,740
Especially with the recent weather.

450
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,420
Is that weird?

451
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,760
Well, it is.

452
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,540
But it's not bad.

453
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,660
You will

454
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,680
just take the photo of my body
with any painting, right?

455
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,560
Yes. I don't do the painting.

456
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,380
I am also curious about one thing.
May I ask?

457
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,700
What is that?

458
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,640
Go ahead.

459
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,720
I'm not that weird, right?

460
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,920
Why were you so shocked when we first met?

461
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,700
I thought you were someone I know.

462
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,100
Do we look alike?

463
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,300
Me and the one you know.

464
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:45,400
Yes, kind of.

465
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,200
Should we begin?

466
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,340
Before we start,
I still feel curious about the one you know.

467
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,740
Actually.

468
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,000
It's someone I have met in my dream.

469
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,640
I was in your dream?

470
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,320
It can't be you.

471
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,280
Maybe it's someone look like you.

472
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,800
The one who looks really like you.

473
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,920
We just met now, it doesn't make sense.

474
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,600
Maybe it's like a deja vu.

475
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,180
Well, sometimes it happens.

476
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,320
Sometimes we have deja vu, right?

477
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,500
Yes.

478
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,800
Everyone has been there
before then the word "deja vu" is invented.

479
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,440
Although you know it's fake feeling,

480
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,640
you can't believe that it's fake.

481
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,880
Right.

482
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,940
In that case, maybe we have met before.

483
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,180
Maybe.

484
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,000
Has it been a long time
since we met the first time?

485
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,920
Maybe.

486
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,540
Then nice to meet you again.

487
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,680
Me too.

488
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,800
Should we begin?

489
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:27,780
What?

490
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,220
To take the picture.

491
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,020
What should we begin with?

492
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,500
Should we begin with this?

493
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,180
OK.

494
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,360
So great, yes.

495
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,120
This one, right?

496
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,900
Yes, thank you.

497
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,540
I didn't know you come back.

498
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:07,780
How are you doing?

499
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,940
Fine. Are still doing great?

500
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,140
So-so.

501
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,200
Everyone's life is just similar.

502
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:26,300
This is my favorite but I left here.

503
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,580
I didn't know that.

504
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,560
I must get this back so I come here.

505
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,140
You won't leave again?

506
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,240
I will leave.

507
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,980
How's Milan?

508
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,040
Is it different from here?

509
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,040
Yes and

510
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,220
no.

511
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,620
You look different.

512
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,460
But gelato and coffee are truly different.

513
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:13,820
I am still the same.

514
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,580
Right.

515
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,400
Coffee tastes different there.

516
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:22,440
Yes.

517
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,560
You should know it
because you have been there before.

518
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:31,020
That's Rome.

519
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,240
Not Milan.

520
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,140
And I didn't go to Rome.

521
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:43,940
It's May in 2020.

522
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,620
I see, because of the Covid-19.

523
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:50,960
Whatever.

524
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:56,020
It's good that you are back, A-ra.

525
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,160
-Sir.
-What's wrong, A-ra?

526
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,520
I hate you.

527
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,220
Don't call me A-ra.

528
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,060
You hate me?

529
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,360
Don't ask me why because that's obviously faking.

530
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,020
When did you know?

531
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,120
Why do you ask? You want do it again?

532
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,100
Sir.

533
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,100
Don't cross the line again.

534
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,260
You are not different from other people.

535
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,840
We all keep our heads down for life.

536
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,600
You and me.

537
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,300
OK.

538
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,660
I want to have one more.

539
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,360
Me too.

540
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:03,860
I'm sorry but

541
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:08,600
I can't get in touch with him.

542
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:15,000
-I'm just being curious.
-Just ask.

543
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,670
Is Ki-jun doing fine in Italy?

544
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,420
How's he doing?

545
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,360
He didn't go to Italy.

546
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,320
What?

547
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,760
Didn't he go?

548
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,440
I went alone.

549
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,620
He must have gone.

550
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,660
He had told me that

551
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,500
he had had sex with you before I left.

552
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,200
He told you?

553
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,480
He thought I didn't know.

554
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,140
You had found out before?

555
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,240
Maybe I was really in love with him.

556
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:44,920
A-ra.

557
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:47,640
-I'm sorry.
-Don't say A-ra.

558
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
Oh, sorry.

559
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,020
I won't say that again, sorry.

560
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,720
But I couldn't give up on him, acting like a fool.

561
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,640
But it couldn't work out
even if I didn't want to give up.

562
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,760
So we broke up and it has been a long time.

563
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,040
You broke up?

564
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,000
Yes.

565
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,640
He didn't go to Italy?

566
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,900
He stayed.

567
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,980
I did everything

568
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:53,520
you asked me to do.

569
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,820
Yes.

570
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:01,600
I did everything without asking for your return.

571
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:07,140
You did everything. You are right, Ki-jun.

572
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:12,320
I didn't expect for anything,
no, there's one thing.

573
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:15,580
I just want one thing because I love you.

574
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:20,280
I thought if I did like this, you will keep my company
and like me though you may pretend all

575
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,840
I'm sorry for everything.

576
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:28,140
Why are you so selfish?

577
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:31,460
Do you just care for yourself? Are you trash?

578
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,420
Don't say that.

579
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,780
I will still like you even if you say that.

580
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:39,340
You really know how to act like a nice guy, shit.

581
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:42,540
Just be honest.

582
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:46,480
You don't like to have sex with me, you pit bull.

583
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,120
I say I'm sorry.

584
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,320
You are sorry? You are lying, right?

585
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,280
You have no feeling to me.

586
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,480
You should be angry
and that'll make me happier.

587
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:01,220
You are so calm that it's so cruel to me.

588
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:02,680
You know that?

589
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,780
You don't want to pay any attention to me, right?

590
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:43,680
I know.

591
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:48,160
I know what you're saying.

592
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,400
Please don't do this to me.

593
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,620
You can do the same with me...

594
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,740
That's how much I like you.

595
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,520
You always win.

596
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,480
I always lose.

597
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,140
But you'll see.

598
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,800
Just wait and see.

599
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,220
Sleep here today.

600
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,200
Give me one more chance.

601
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,100

Sorry. Ki-jun.

605
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,240
No, you don't have to.

606
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,180
I'll do better.

607
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,360
I'm so sorry. Brother.

608
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,160
So great.

609
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,740
You like it?

610
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:48,080
I like it.
Good boy

611
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:53,240
I could really do better for you.

612
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,520
Give me some time.

613
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,760
You're too satisfied.

614
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,100
It's fucking awesome!

615
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,000
What are you sorry for?

616
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,900
Don't say that.

617
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,180
I'll screw it up.

618
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,200
Guess who he is.

619
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,600
Ki-jun.

620
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,000
Should we just end this relationship?

621
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,360
Who is he?

622
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:46,820
Um?

623
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,420
He's cute.

624
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,080
Did you say “who is he”?

625
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,680
Oh.

626
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,800
