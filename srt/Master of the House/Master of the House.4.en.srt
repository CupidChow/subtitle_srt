So what? You wanna blame this on me?
You were the one driving drunk!

It'll be just a couple of years in jail

Your life doesn't mean anything anyway.

Can I get one amp of Valium?

77
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,916
I also need a blood gas
and calcium magnesium phosphate.

His condition continues to remain stable.

79
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:09,708
But the concern is that your son
has suffered severe blunt trauma.

His ribs are fractured.

81
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,041
And it's causing bruising
to the heart muscle.

82
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,541

[exhales]

178
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,416
[Kaimook] That video last night…

179
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,583
Were you behind it?

180
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,833
[somber music continues]

181
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,375
They all had it coming.

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,416
And what about Shutter?

183
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,875
I don't know anything about that.

184
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,250
[exhales]

185
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,208

[grunting]

189
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,083
[Mavin] Dad! Dad!

190
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,875
As I was saying,

191
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,708
this is the evidence
to support what I believe.

192
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,666
So why have the police
never mentioned this footage?

193
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,166
[exhales]

194
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,333
So he planned this all along.

195
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,750

199
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,833
-[Tian] I brought you some food.
-[sniffles]

[crying]

201
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,833
Just leave it outside. [sobs]

202
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:42,041
[somber music playing]

203
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,166
[Kaew cries]

204
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,250
[crying]

205
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,041
[Yupin] Chompoo,

206
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:07,041
you'll be filling in for Bee
at Mr. Phupat's house for the time being.

207
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,625
[Chompoo] Yes, of course.

208
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,708
[Yupin] Mm.

209
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,791
[tense music playing]

210
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,083
Yupin.

211
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,458
Why is Bee not here?

212
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,708
Bee is taking a break.

213
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,791
She may not be at work for a while.

214
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,000
This is the security footage
from the night of my father's birthday,

215
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,125
recorded at the moment
he fell from his study.

216
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,166
And it was missing?

217
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,375
Who's the one who came across this?

218
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,166
I did.

219
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,208
The police who worked on the case earlier
concluded that it was an accident.

220
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,750
But after the will was divided,

221
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,416
almost all the inheritance went to Mavin.

222
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,791
So, you're telling me you think
your father was murdered?

223
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,333
-Yeah.
-Well, then I, uh…

224
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,625
I'll need to speak
to everyone who was here that night.

225
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:01,125
I'll do everything I can
to help with the case in any way.

226
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,833
I'll make sure you get
the full cooperation you need.

227
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,458
[intriguing music playing]

228
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,625
[Yupin] The police are going to ask
about the night of the master's birthday.

229
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,000
We're counting on everyone to cooperate.

230
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,583
This way, please.

231
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,333
The master's study is right up here.

232
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,333
[Yupin] After the party ended,

233
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:51,000
the master asked his wife, Kaimook,
to take him back to his room.

234
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,916
But his son, Mr. Mavin,

235
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,125
insisted on taking him up himself.

236
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,166
[Kaew] That night,
I was helping Mr. Mavin with the party.

237
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,541
He then took the master
back to his room after supper.

238
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,958
And not long after that,

239
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,000
he came back downstairs
to continue drinking.

240
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,916
[detective] What kind of mood
was Mr. Mavin in?

241
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,375
He seemed to be quite upset.

242
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,708
I don't know exactly
what happened after that, but…

243
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,833
I heard someone screaming
and it was very loud.

244
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,500
I didn't really know what to do,
but when I finally got there,

245
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,458
I saw the master was dead.

246
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,541
When I think about it,
it still makes my heart stop.

247
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,875
Mrs. Kaimook was the first person
to come across the body.

248
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,041
[detective] And where were you
when it happened?

249
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,208
I finished work at 7:00
after doing the dishes,

250
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,625
and then went straight home for the night.

251
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,416
[detective] Why was Mr. Mavin upset?

252
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:47,250
Well, It had to do
with the master's new wife.

253
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,541
[detective] Can you describe the moment
you found the master's body?

254
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,583
That night…

255
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,500
the master asked me
to move in to his quarters,

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,500
and told me to pack my things.

257
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,666
As I was walking back to the main house,

258
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,583
I looked up at the balcony.

259
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,375
Someone…

260
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,916
was standing up there
in the master's study.

261
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,708
[detective] So you suspected
from the beginning

262
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,666
that this wasn't an accident?

263
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,541
[Kaimook] I tried telling the police
everything I knew.

264
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,583
But they concluded it was an accident.

265
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,250
After that, there was nothing I could do.

266
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,000
-[detective] We appreciate your honesty.
-Thank you.

267
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,416
[music stops]

268
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,416
After speaking with everyone in the house,

269
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,625
I think there's enough evidence
to move forward.

270
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,875
We'll need to bring Mr. Mavin in
for questioning.

271
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,666
Take as much time as you need.

272
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,000
He's on his way now.

273
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,166
[suspenseful music playing]

274
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,916
Yes, hello.

275
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,416
Yes, sir. I understand.

276
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,083
Get the car washed.

The hell's going on?
Why didn't you arrest him?

280
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,291
[detective] We were ordered to call off
the investigation, Mr. Phupat.

MR. MAVIN: COME HERE NOW
ACCEPT

Mr. Mavin is asking for me.

[Mavin] Yes, Deputy?

290
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,708
[police officer] Mr. Mavin,

291
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,875
our team found the person
who attacked Shutter.

292
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,708
Should we take care of him?

293
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,166
Mr. Mavin?

294
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,333
No need.

295
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,166
I'm gonna take care of it.

296
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,583

[Mavin] Are you a loyal dog?

299
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,250
Of course I am.

300
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,791
So what if a dog you raise,

301
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,375
would turn against you?

302
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,583
What would you do?

303
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,333
Where I come from,

304
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,666
we'd make sure that dog knew his place.

Our father loved it in here.

316

Most days, you couldn't get him outta here
no matter how hard you tried.

317
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:56,416
He'd be happy to know
someone was still taking care of it.

318
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:03,958
Thank you for that.

319
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,666
It's nothing.

320
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,416
It's not fair…

321
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,541
that the police
can't do anything to help you.

322
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,958
Being that wealthy

323
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,000
must be nice.

324
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,291
You can change all the rules.

325
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,333
When you have the power,

326
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,291
you can turn wrongs into right.

327
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,708
Not everyone who has money

328
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,458
has that power.

Okay, that's it. Stop, stop, stop!

-Yeah.
-[Tan] Can you make it clearer?

-Yeah, it's still a little blurry.
-Yeah.

-[Fai] Huh?

338
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:55,833
What is this?

339
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,875
Dunno. Mr. Mavin wants us to set it up.

340
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,708
I think he wants to show a movie.

341
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,541
[Tan] I wonder what it's gonna be!

This is great!

Now we don't have to sneak around
when the bosses aren't here.

345
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah. Watching the same thing
over and over was getting boring.

00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,750
I can't wait to see
what move it's gonna be!

[tense music playing]

357
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,875
Hey! What is this?

358
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,250
[employee] This decision comes
straight from the chairman.

359
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:06,500
[customer] I heard you're launching
a new collection soon. Is that right?

360
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,958
-[Mavin] Yes.
-[customer] Could I see a sample?

361
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,875
-[Mavin] Sure. Let me just--
-We need to talk.

362
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:14,708
Come with me.

363
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,250
[Mavin]
Could you give us a minute, please?

364
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,333
What are you up to?

365
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,583
I'm just getting rid
of what's unnecessary.

366
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:29,791
[music fades]

367
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,750
Who the fuck do you think you are?

368
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:36,125
You had no right to get
the police involved in our business.

369
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,791
I've already fired you.

370
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,416
Why don't you save yourself some time
and just get out of here?

371
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:43,875
Son of a bitch.

372
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:46,000
You wanna play this game?

373
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,125
You're the one who started it.

374

376
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,875
When are you arresting Mavin?

377
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:01,166
[detective] I'm sorry,
but I don't have the authority

378
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,041
to investigate this case anymore.

379
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,375
Are you--

380
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,958
What the fuck are you saying?

381
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,208
Mr. Phupat,
my entire team has been reassigned.

382
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,916
Then I want my evidence given back to me.

383
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:21,166
I'm afraid I don't have
the evidence anymore, Mr. Phupat.

384
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:24,458
-Huh?

Bee?

389
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Bee?

390
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,041
[Bam] Hello? Who are you looking for?

391
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,375
I'm a friend of Bee's.

392
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:35,875
Do you know if she's around?

393
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,208
Is everything okay?

394
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,250
Bee hasn't been home in months.

395
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,750
Nothing to worry about.

396
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,666
Just wanted to see if she was okay.

397
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,166
You wanna taste? It's really good.

398
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:58,875
You go ahead.

399
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,875
[Bam] So, how is it working with Bee?

400
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,041
[Mavin] Hey, Joke.

401
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:17,916
Get in the car.

[suspenseful music playing]

403
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:49,416
Shutter is my only child.

404
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:59,625
You two have no idea how it feels
to see someone you love suffering so much.

405
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:06,083
All I asked was for you
to bring back my son.

406
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,041
And this is the mess you leave, Joke?

407
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:16,208
Tell me what should I do with Joke, Tian?

408
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,583
Got any ideas?

409
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:44,458
[suspenseful music continues]

410
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,541
[music fades]

411
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,583
Get out of the car.

412
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,375
Both of you.

413
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,250
Now, Tian.

414
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,458
Get rid of Joke.

415
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,250
-Push him off.
-What?

00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,291
[unsettling music playing]

417
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,708
Mr. Mavin, I didn't do anything wrong.

418
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,416
It was me.

419
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,166
I beat up your son.

420
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,875
-You son of a bitch!
-[Tian grunts]

421
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,791
-[groaning]
-How does that feel, you motherfucker?

422
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:13,083
Why would you do that,
you piece of shit? Huh?

423
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,416
-[Tian groans]
-Stand up!

424
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:18,875
You're gonna tell me why!

425
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,541
You killed my child first.

426
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,208
-Your child with that whore, huh?
-[grunts]

427
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:27,458
Your whore of a girlfriend?

428
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,791
Hey, Joke.

429
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,250
Push your brother off the bridge.

430
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,291
If you don't, you die.

Can't do this yourself, you coward?

434
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,750
-Why don't you act like a man?
-Shut the fuck up.

435
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,000
Sorry, Joke, but Tian's right.

436
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,458
Why should I get my hands dirty?

437
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,375
If you know what's good for you,

438
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:32,541
just do it.

439
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,541
[Tian] Don't worry.

440
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:44,750
I don't blame you.

441
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,583
Take care of Kaew for me.

you have to beat me up too!
