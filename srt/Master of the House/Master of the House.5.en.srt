Did you know what Bee
was planning to do that night?

181
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,000
And did you beg Mavin not to punish her?

182
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,958
Did you ask him not to do that to her?

[mournful music playing]

184
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,041
Don't you feel sorry for her?

185
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,375
You know what happened
to Tian too, don't you?

186
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:22,125
That might happen to someone else
if you don't say something.

187
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,208
Tell me.

188
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,250
Yeah, I knew.

189
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,208
But what could I do?

190
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,000
What the hell could I do?

191
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,625
But did you even try?

I wanna take a picture of you

from the same angle
my dad used to take them.

200
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,166

217
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,041
Do you really think
I wanna fuck you that much?

218
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,916
-[sobs]
-I actually don't.

219
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,375
I was just letting you know that
every single thing in this house

220
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,791
is my property.

221
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,875
Including you, Kaimook.

227
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,416
[Yupin] At the end of the month,

228
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,666
Mr. Mavin has assigned us

229
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,291
to work on an event
that is to be held on a yacht.

230
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,916
There will be important guests of his
coming from abroad that day.

231
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,791
Kaew, you will ask Mr. Mavin
for a list of the beverages he wants

232
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,833
and take care of the guests
at the bar on the yacht.

233
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,583
As for Mr. Mavin's activities
on the cruise,

234
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:40,875
Joke, you will be in charge of them
and oversee the security.

235
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,750
Bee, you'll ensure privacy
for the guests on the cruise.

236
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,875
Make sure no one takes pictures or videos.

237
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,291
Mr. Mavin wants this event
to be very private.

238
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:57,625
Kaimook, Mr. Mavin is insisting
that you take care of all his VIP guests.

239
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,083
As for the details,

240
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,875
he will inform you of them later.

241
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,291
Yes.

242
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:09,625
[Yupin] The rest of you
will be taking care of things onshore.

243
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,416
This event is very important to Mr. Mavin.

244
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,541
Everything must be perfect.

245
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,750
Now get back to work.

246
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,250
Thank you for getting a heart for Shutter.

247
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:33,291
If it weren't for you,
Shutter wouldn't have made it.

All the pertinent documents are in here?

251

Yes.

[music continues]

253
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:18,625
Remind me to thank your dad
for helping me bury Mavin.

254
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,250
Have you ever been happy at all
that I'm with you?

255

[cell phone vibrates]

256
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,208
Hey, what's up?

257
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,708
Oh, you landed already?

258
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,416
[chuckles] Nice.

259
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,333
Oh! [chuckles] I'm…

260
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,416
I'm actually not available today.

261
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,916
Yeah, yeah. I'll definitely see you soon.

262
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:46,916
Alright.

263
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,708
Okay. Bye.

264
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,750
Did you say something?

265
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,416
Just don't forget about
that promise you made me.

266
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,166
Yeah.

267
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,500
I won't forget it.

268
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,250
[Mavin] Hello, Pad.

269
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,041
Thank you so much.

270
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,500
I've gotta thank you too…

271
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,958
for saving Shutter's life.

272
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,250
Why aren't you there for the operation?

273
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,208
Pad took care of everything.

274
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,333
I'm not worried about it.

275
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,583
Well, from here on in you can spend
as much time as you like with him.

276
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,875
I'm running the company now.

277
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,041
You only got an additional
one percent of the shares.

278
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,750
How're you gonna
take over the company with that?

279
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,875
-What're you talking about?
-[dramatic sting]

280
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,500
Your wife gave me all of her shares.

[Mavin continues laughing]

284
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,000
Before my wife
transferred her shares to you,

285
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,166
she'd already given
the bulk of them to me.

286
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,875
I was actually really confused
how could you make a mistake like that.

287
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,916
What are you talking about?

288
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,041
I respect all the effort you made…

289
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,375
in trying to take the presidency from me.

290
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,083
But using my son?

291
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,291
That's hitting below the belt.

[Mavin] For an event
as important as this one,

00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,375
if it were my Dad,

308
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,958
he'd want a certain bottle.

309
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,291
You know which one it is?

310
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,083
Go and see if there are any left.
