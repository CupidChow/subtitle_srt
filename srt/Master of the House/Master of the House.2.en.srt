[mysterious music playing]

2
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,041
[Kaimook] I believe

3
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,833
my master's death was a murder.

4
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,333
[police officer] The case has been closed.
Mr. Roongroj's death…

5
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,666
[screams]

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,250
…was ruled an accident.

7
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,416
I'm very sorry for your loss.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,875

13

MASTER OF THE HOUSE

[mysterious music playing]

15
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,791
[Mavin] Where's Phupat?

16
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,041
Not here for breakfast?

17
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,625
He has an urgent meeting this morning.

18
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,041
[Mavin] Hmm.

19
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,541
Are we having
the polo charity event this year?

20
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,666
[Padcha] Absolutely.

21
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,333
I think this year's event

22
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,416
would be a great opportunity
for us to honor Father's memory.

23
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:09,541
[chuckles] Everyone must be so happy
to have you back from New York.

24
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,833
-I'm really happy to be back as well.
-Mm.

25
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,541
[Mavin] You need to practice
for the polo match.

26
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,208
The team you're playing against
isn't just any team.

27
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,166
They're our company's main rival.

28
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,666
I don't wanna lose to them.

29
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,333
So, has our mother woken up yet?

30
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,083
Our mother?

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,250
[delicate music playing]

32
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,666
[Mavin and Araya laugh]

33
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,125
Decided to have a little sleep-in?

34
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,708
I'm full.

35
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,625
Ugh, Kita…

36
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,291
[Shutter] Yeah, I'm full too.

37
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,208
[Araya] Seems like the kids
don't really like our new mother.

38
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,291
Mm.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,291
You're not offended, are you?

40
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,458
I'm not offended.

41
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,875
Eat up. Don't want it to get cold.

42
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,791

45
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,666
What's wrong?

[gasps]

47
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,416
[Araya] Everyone has become so sloppy.

48
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,916
Our poor father would be appalled.

49
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,833
[breathes shakily]

50
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,416
[unsettling sting]

51
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:41,416
[Araya] How did Father's wife
end up with a hair in her bowl?

52
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,250
Who prepared the meal for Kaimook?

53
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,041
It was me.

54
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,208
[breathes shakily]

55
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,333
[tense music playing]

56
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,125
What would Father do

57
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,833
if he was here to see this today?

58
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,708
He'd pour soup over the head
of whoever did sloppy work, wouldn't he?

59
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,375
[whimpers]

60
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,541
No, Mrs. Araya!

61
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,708
[music fades]

62
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,458
You don't have to do this.

63
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,750
But, why?

64
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,750
We're paying them well to work here.

65
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,333
They should be punished
if they do something wrong.

66
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,416
[Mavin] So, we'd appreciate it
if you could handle this

67
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,916
and find out who's responsible, Mother.

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
[music continues]

69
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,875
-[Padcha] Araya.
-[music fades]

70
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,041
You may have been mistaken.

71
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,333
[music resumes]

72
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,166
Because that hair is long and red.

73
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,166
[music heightens, then stops]

74
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,875
[pensive music playing]

75
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,625
[Phupat] Since my father's passing,

76
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:55,250
the confidence our clients have
in our company has been dwindling.

77
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,750
[beeping]

78
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,500
[Phupat] Part of the reason for this
is one of our executives

79
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,791
has a history of inappropriate behavior.

80
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,791
Let me apologize
on behalf of my younger brother…

81
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,708
FAMOUS HEIR'S MARRIAGE
RUMORED TO BE IN TROUBLE!

82
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,125
…for the damage that has affected
our company's reputation.

83
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,041
I've given it a lot of thought,

84
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,750
and to sustain our company's image,

85
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,750
we must first regain
the trust of our clients

86
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,875
by becoming fully accountable.

87
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,291
Hello, Ms. Prae.

88
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,208
[Prae] Good morning.

89
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,208
-I'll take it from here.
-[man] Yes, of course.

90
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,375
Thanks for coming in today.

91
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,625
So without further delay,
all those in favor

92
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,541
of removing my brother
from his executive position,

93
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,000
please raise your hand.

94
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,708
[Prae] We must leverage our assets
the best we can.

95
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,625
Uh…

96
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,375
Mr. Phupat has organized
a meeting to remove you, sir.

97
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,583
[tense music playing]

98
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,250
What the fuck is going on here?

99
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,750
Are you trying to vote me out?

100
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,125
Don't be shy.
Why'd you put your hands down?

101
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,000
Raise them!

102
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,666
Come on!

103
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,333
Go ahead!

104
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,500
-You fucking cowards!
-[dramatic sting]

105
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,416
Get out!

106
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,125
Get out!

107
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,416
[Phupat] You can't control yourself,
can you?

108
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,458
You still don't see it.
You're acting like you don't even care.

109
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,833
With Dad gone, you want me out of the way.

110
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,541
You don't think I can see
what's really going on here?

111
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,875
I won't let the company
Dad built from scratch

112
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,250
get dragged into the mud.

113
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,333
Do you even hear what you're saying?
You're a joke.

114
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,916
I'm just doing whatever's
in the company's best interest.

115
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,833
It's these stories about you
all over social media.

116
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,583
Is that what this is about?

117
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,125
These stupid stories?

118
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,291
I can have them erased
by the end of the day.

119
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,875
This is all you've got on me?

120
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,625
You will never push me out
of this company.

121
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,000
Over my dead body.

122
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,791
[dramatic sting]

123
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,875
[clattering]

124
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,875
[laughs]

125
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,000
[music fades]

126
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,000
Mrs. Kaimook.

127
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,791
I brought you something to eat.

128
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,000
[Kaimook] Thank you, Bee.

129
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,333
So,

130
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,833
how's Fai doing?

131
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,083
She's handling things.

132
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,833
It's all my fault.

133
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,375
[pensive music playing]

134
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,666
Everyone is in this mess because of me.

135
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,541
[Bee] It's not your fault.

136
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,541
This family…
they're afraid you want their money.

137
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,125
So they're trying
to pressure you into leaving.

138
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,333
And it's only gonna get worse.

139
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,875
There's nothing stopping them
from mistreating you.

140
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,625
[exhales]

141
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,416
You shouldn't stay here.

142
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,500
I appreciate your concern.

143
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,000
But I can't leave yet.

144
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,500
There's no way
to prove the truth if I'm gone.

145
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,916
-Hey…
-[knocking]

146
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,250
[door opens]

147
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:59,041
[Yupin] Mrs. Kaimook,
Mrs. Araya has asked for you.

148
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,250
[singing bowls playing in distance]

149
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,416
[faint ringing]

150
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,583
Mrs. Araya?

151
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,291
You'll come with me
to the charity event this Saturday.

152
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,666
Padcha would like you there
as Father's wife.

153
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,791
It's my responsibility…

154
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,791
to raise your status
to a level that this family expects.

155
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,208
-I don't want you embarrassing us.
-[tense music playing]

156
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,291
So you will do exactly what I tell you.

157
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,458
[Araya chuckles]

158
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,833
Okay.

159
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,125
You may leave now.

160
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,041
[percussive music playing]

161
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,833
[Araya] Pang, you're so good to us
making dresses on such short notice.

162
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,708
[Pang chuckles] It's no problem at all.

163
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:44,458
We're friends. I can handle anything,
especially when it comes to your family.

164
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,458
For you, only the best.

165
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,333
Mrs. Kaimook has a lovely figure.

166
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,125
So, I'm thinking of choosing
Amundsen fabric for her.

167
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,541
And for the color,

168
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,583
I was thinking
of going with something striking,

169
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,583
like a bold ruby red.

170
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:03,333
It'll make Mrs. Kaimook
really stand out at the event.

171
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,500
[music fades]

172
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,916
Maybe a nice dress
will make her appearance more palatable.

173
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,416
[dramatic sting]

174
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,708
[uneasy music playing]

175
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,875
Don't worry, now.

176
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,208
We'll make sure
you're the absolute Belle of the ball.

177
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,458
[woman, on TV]
Moonlight Mansion is mine now!

178
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,083
How dare you think
you have rights to this house!

179
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,083
[Fai] Can this exercise ball
help me lose weight?

180
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,166
[May] Don't think about it too much, Fai.
Have some of these. Here.

181
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,833
[Fai] Mmm!

182
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,833
[May] I got it from the kitchen.
It's a croissant.

183
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,500
-Mm!
-[May hums]

184
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,875
-[Fai] It's cheese flavor.
-[Tan] Mm! It's really delicious.

185
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:15,875
[Fai and Tan] Mmm!

186
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,500
-[door opens]
-[gasping]

187
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,875
Whoa! You scared us, Kaew.

188
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,708
[sighs] Wanna watch a movie?
Mrs. Araya's in it.

189
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,166
-[Tan] She's so full of herself.
-[May] Totally.

190
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,333
[woman, on TV]
Everything in this house belongs to me.

191
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,750
And don't you forget it.

192
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,083
[woman laughs]

193
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,208
[pleasant music playing]

194
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,125
[knocking]

195
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,291
Please leave me alone!

196
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,666
I'm exhausted.

197
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,791
[Tian] If you're not up for it,
then you should quit.

198
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,791
I set up a meeting.

199
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,500
-[Kaew gasps and laughs]
-[Tian chuckles]

200
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,416
[Kaew] Oh, you're the best!

201
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,583
[Tian] Mm.

202
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,958
[gentle music playing]

203
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,500
[car door opens]

204
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,250
This is my sister, Kaew.

205
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:50,541
Hello, hi. My name's Kaew.

206
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,916
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

207
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:12,833
[retches]

208
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,708
[coughs]

209
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,958
[coughs]

210
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,750
[Mavin] You are a difficult man
to get ahold of.

211
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,333
I'm glad you finally picked up.

212
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,000
You must be quite busy.

213
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,500
There's a good deal
I need to take care of.

214
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,666
Please eat. Or it'll get cold.

215
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,291
Thanks very much, but my daughter's
coming to pick me up for supper.

216
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,666
It's her birthday.

217
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,833
Maybe she'd care to join us.
I'll order a little extra.

218
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,583
No, don't bother.

219
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,000
Alright. Just thought I'd offer.

220
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,416
[dramatic sting]

221
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,500
Let's get down to business.

222
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,666
At the funeral,
we were discussing my father's will.

223
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,583
My father was old.

224
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,541
Very forgetful.

225
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,750
So, I have a proposition for you.

226
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,208
Make me the sole beneficiary.

227
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,375
And name me chairman of the board.

228
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,333
If you agree,
here's a small token of my gratitude.

229
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,708
And upon completion,

230
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,625
there's an additional piece
waiting for you.

231
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,875
I promise it'll be enough
to ensure that you and your loved ones

232
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,708
will never ever have to work another day.

233
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,291
[suspenseful music playing]

234
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,333
Do you realize that behaving this way

235
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,625
is disrespectful
to the memory of your father?

236
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,083
[Krit scoffs]

237
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,958
Your father would be turning in his grave
if he knew he had a son like you.

238
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,125
[slams]

239
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,958
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

240
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,583
You're nothing to me!

241
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,416
Even if you don't take
the gift I'm offering,

242
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,958
sooner or later I will get what I want.

243
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,333
[Krit] If this was everything
you needed to discuss with me,

244
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,166
I think our business here is done.

245
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,416
If you'll excuse me.

246
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,250
[grunts]

247
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,250
[music fades]

248
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,541
[line calling]

249
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,291
-[line calling]
-Hey, Tian.

250
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,500
[cell phone vibrates]

251
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,458
Yes?

252
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,250
[Phupat] How's the charity event
coming along?

253
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,291
It's coming along.

254
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,708
Some of the people from Gentle Gems
haven't confirmed yet, though.

255
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,666
They'll confirm eventually.

256
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,458
They're just taking their time.

257
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,916
Anything I should know?

258
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,541
Yeah, I think you should…

259
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,250
give a speech.

260
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:31,041
Talk to the guests at the event
as your father's representative.

261
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,500
I'm in the process
of writing something for you.

262
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,666
Alright.

263
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,750
Send it to me once it's finished.

264
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:43,958
Okay.

265
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,791
Listen. We need to talk
about Kita's studies.

266
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,166
Universities in New York
are accepting applications now.

267
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,833
What do you mean New York?

268
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,250
She…

269
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,958
She told me that she'd rather go there.

270
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,458
She'll study in France
and stop procrastinating.

271
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,000
But-- But I think
it's a good idea because--

272
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,333
Just make sure
you get her paperwork in order.

273
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,500
[line cuts off]

274
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,791
[tense music playing]

275
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,750
[Kaew breathes heavily]

276
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,000
[Mavin grunts]

277
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,625
[grunts]

278
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,166
[gasps] Mr. Mavin!

279
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,583
-[Mavin grunts]
-[Kaew gasps]

280
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:49,875
The fuck is wrong?

281
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,750
[panting]

282
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,250
I'm pregnant.

283
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,375
[dramatic music playing]

284
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,791
-[Kaew whimpers]
-What did you say?

285
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,208
What did you say?

286
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,750
You fucking with me?

287
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,125
-You want what Kaimook has?
-[whimpers]

288
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,583
[gasps]

289
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,750
[whimpers]

290
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,125
Explain it to me.

291
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,666
Take your time

292
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,041
and tell me how this happens
to a whore like you.

293
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,500
[Kaew sobs]

294
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,083
-[sudden sting]
-You think I wanna keep the thing?

295
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,041
[crying] But it's our baby.

296
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,125
-[gasps]
-What was that?

297
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,625
[sobs]

298
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,583
Listen to me. Listen, okay?

299
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,208
I don't care.

300
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,333
[sobs]

301
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:37,666
I'll never be a father to this child,
you hear me?

302
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,166
[gasps]

303
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,250
[sobs]

304
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,666
-[sobs]
-[Mavin zipping up]

305
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,750
-I'll give you money for an abortion.
-No! Please, sir! [sobs]

306
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,916
[sobbing] I'm begging you.

307
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,500
I'm begging you.

308
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,958
Please let me keep my baby.

309
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,250
Please! [sobs]

310
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,125
Get an abortion now
or I'll put you on the street.

311
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:03,333
[Kaew sobs]

312
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,291
-Now, get the fuck out!
-[Kaew gasps]

313
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:09,583
[Kaew cries]

314
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,458
[screams]

315
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,375
[Tian] I can take care
of this child, Kaew.

316
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:24,833
[sniffles]

317
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:28,083
But how do you know if it's even yours?

318
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,333
This child can't grow up without a father.

319
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,625
And we can be good parents
to this baby. I just know it.

320
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,083
[breathes shakily]

321
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,708
[Kaew] I know we can.

322
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:47,875
But there's no way
I can keep it now. [sniffles]

323
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,916
Why does it have to be so hard?

324
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,875
We can leave this place.

325
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,916
-All three of us.
-[Kaew sobs]

326
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
[sniffles]

327
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,625
What would we even do if we left here?

328
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,500
Just go back to the way it was?

329
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,250
You'd go back to being a thug

330
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,458
and I'd go back to being a whore?

331
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,958
That life… I can't live like that anymore.

332
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:32,166
[dramatic music playing]

333
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,625
[Kaew sobs]

334
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,833
[music fades]

335
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,833
[Kaimook] Why is the footage from outside
Master's room and the garden missing?

336
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,916
[security guard]
I just started working here.

337
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,875
And since I've been here,
I haven't seen that footage at all.

338
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,750
[music heightens and stops]

339
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,416

[horses neighing]

343
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:38,708
[woman] This year's event
is the grandest by far.

344
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,833
[sighs] Shame he can't be here
to witness it.

345
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,916
It was important that we make it
as perfect as he would've wanted it.

346
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,125
Can't wait to see you
at the event tonight.

347
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,250
I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

348
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,625
[woman] I'm looking forward to it.

349
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:58,458
This morning, I already made
a ten-million-baht donation.

350
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,208
[music continues]

351
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,875
[chukker horn blasting]

352
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,166
-Yeah! Whoo!
-[applause]

353
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,583
Your son finished studying
in New York yet?

354
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:34,000
-He's on a school break.
-[Pachara] He has some serious skills.

355
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,291
[Mavin] I taught him to hate losing.

356
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:38,000
Wow.

357
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,541
Can't imagine where he gets that from.

358
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,083
At this game,
there's only one way to beat my son.

359
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,375
You'd have to break his horse's legs.

360
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,500
[thud]

361
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:50,000
Well, that's a tad brutal.

362
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,375
Maybe I should inform our team
about this strategy.

363
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:53,500
Seriously?

364
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,416
No need to get uptight.

365
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
It's just a game for charity, so…

366
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:02,000
Hmm.

367
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:02,916
Yup.

368
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:08,291
But I really have to thank you,
Mr. Pachara, Mr. Phetye and Gentle Gems

369
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,708
for making your donations this year.

370
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,500
It's our pleasure.

371
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,916
Because this past year,

372
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,541
the response
from our younger clients was amazing.

373
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:20,333
So it's our prerogative to give back.

374
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:24,208
[horses neigh]

375
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,333
[applause]

376
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:27,583
-[chuckles] Ooh!
-Wow.

377
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,125
Doesn't seem like
they're playing for charity.

378
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,833
[both chuckle]

379
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:35,208
It's evenly matched.

380
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,166
-[thud]
-[exciting music continues]

381
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,708
[Mavin] Your increased profits
over the last couple of years

382
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:44,250
doesn't guarantee that your business

383
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,041
will continue growing
for that much longer.

384
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,375
I think it's wise
to view things in the long term.

385
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,458
[player] Yeah! We tied it up!

386
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,416
-[chukker horn blasting]
-[player] Let's go!

387
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,375
-Whoo! Whoo!
-[applause]

388
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
[music fades]

389
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,500
Hello, Mr. Pachara, Mr. Phetye.

390
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:14,375
-Nice to see you again.
-Hello, Mr. Phupat.

391
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:19,541
I'm very happy to see our two companies
enjoying an afternoon like this.

392
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,875
If this were our father's time,
we wouldn't even be standing here.

393
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:23,958
[chuckles]

394
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,416
Those days are over.

395
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,416
In a market saturated
with global competition,

396
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,958
we should be working together
to advance the industry.

397
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:33,958
Don't you agree?

398
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,375
[exciting music playing]

399
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:39,083
Theva Gems never stops thinking
of how we can steer the Thai gem industry

400
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,083
into the future.

401
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,708
And with that future upon us,

402
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:44,458
both of our companies should be
embracing it with all that we have.

403
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:48,208
Personally, I don't think
it should be up to us.

404
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:51,125
We should leave it up to the public
and let them decide.

405
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:53,833
[scoffs] Public opinion
doesn't even really matter.

406
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,333
They're just sheep waiting to be led.

407
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,500
[tense music playing]

408
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,541
[Pachara] Go.

409
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,791
Fight.

410
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,708
[music continues]

411
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,750
-[ball echoing]
-[chukker horn blasting]

412
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,875
-Bravo! [chuckles]
-[applause]

413
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,833
Whoo!

414
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,500
And no horse's legs got broken.

415
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,666
This was fun.

416
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:49,916
[Shutter] Fuck!

417
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,625
[suspenseful music playing]

418
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:01,333
[Pachara scoffs, then chuckles]

419
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:04,083
Someone's taking this charity game
too seriously.

420
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:07,291
[chuckles] I'd like to go
and congratulate my team now.

421
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:22,625
And the winning team is Gentle Gems!

422
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,083
[cheering]

423
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,166
[music heightens]

424
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,791
[music fades]

425
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:07,708
[sighs]

426
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:11,000
[poignant music playing]

427
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:21,083
[camera shutter clicks]

428
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:54,666
[indistinct chatter]

429
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,791
[music turns tense]

430
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,541
[woman 1, whispering] She's wearing red.

431
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,083
[woman 2] She must be
desperate for attention.

432
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,166
Isn't she supposed to be in mourning?

433
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,083
[woman 3] She seems so out of place.

434
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,791
[woman 2] Ugh. Once a servant,
always a servant.

435
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:28,250
Was she not advised
how to dress for tonight?

436
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,000
Mm. Ruby red.

437
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,333
-Good choice.
-[Araya chuckles]

438
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:54,208
[man] Sir, everything's ready.
Please take your seats.

439
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,958
This way. Let's go.

440
00:32:58,708 --> 00:32:59,875
This way.

441
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:05,541
[dramatic music playing]

442
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,125
[pulsing music playing]

443
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:26,166
[announcer] Next, a very special guest
will say a few words.

444
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,833
Ladies and gentlemen,

445
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:32,791
please give a big round of applause
to Mrs. Kaimook,

446
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,833
the wife of the late Mr. Roongroj.

447
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,166
So, let's give her a warm welcome!

448
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,666
[applause]

449
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,791
I thought it was my turn to speak.

450
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,958
[Padcha] This is not
how I planned the evening.

451
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:03,166
[hushed chatter]

452
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,375
[softly] Hi.

453
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:28,583
I wasn't aware
that I'd be speaking tonight…

454
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,750
Mrs. Kaimook?

455
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:32,083
You have to speak up.

456
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:46,875
I…

457
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,041
I…

458
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,416
Uh…

459
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,708
Uh…

460
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,875
Sorry, I can't.

461
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,958
[tense music playing]

462
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,958
[Araya] I sincerely apologize
for her inadequacy.

463
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:31,958
It seems the newest member
of our family lacks a formal education.

464
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,458
The Theva foundation

465
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,208
was so important

466
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,500
to the late Mr. Roongroj.

467
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,958
Our beloved father

468
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:46,000
dedicated his entire life

469
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,166
to helping underprivileged children.

470
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:53,166
As a tribute to the late Mr. Roongroj,

471
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,375
we would like to honor him

472
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:59,166
by continuing his legacy.

473
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,458
Without your help and support,

474
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,166
we would not be here today.

475
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,500
As the representative
of the Thevasatitpaisarn family,

476
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,916
I truly thank each and every one of you.

477
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,041
I believe that…

478
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,708
Mr. Roongroj…

479
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,416
[voice breaks]
…is looking down and smiling

480
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,166
right now.

481
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:38,166
Please, enjoy the rest of your night.

482
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,916
Thank you.

483
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,208
[applause]

484
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,583
[Mavin] Amy's really coming into her own.

485
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,625
Everyone wants to be around her.

486
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,166
When she has some free time,

487
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,625
maybe she'd promote some jewelry for me?

488
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,833
I was very clear with you the other day.

489
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,250
[suspenseful music playing]

490
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:33,958
How dare you involve my daughter?

491
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:37,958
We've helped your daughter over the years.

492
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:39,958
It'd be a shame if that all dried up.

493
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,416
Anyway, maybe taking another look
at the will would be a good idea.

494
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,666
[music stops]

495
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,500

[woman 1] She must be
desperate for attention.

-[woman 2] She seems so out of place.
-[door opens]

500

[woman 1] Ugh.
Once a servant, always a servant.

00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,416
[door closes]

502
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,416
[Araya] You still wanna be
part of our family?

503
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,208
[dramatic music playing]

504
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,333
[photographer] This way, please.

505
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,458
Just a little closer.

00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,208
[Kaimook] I…

511
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:58,208
don't think I want to be
part of your family after all.

512
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:06,583
[song fades]

513
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:08,458
Finally getting the hint, are we?

514
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:16,416
But…

515
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:21,750
If it's alright with you,
I'd still like to stay in the house.

516
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,500
As a servant.

517
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,625
It would mean a great deal.
