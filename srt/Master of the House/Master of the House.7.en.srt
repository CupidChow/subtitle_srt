00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,375
[Phupat] This was all
part of your plan, wasn't it?

6
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,375
You killed my father.

MASTER OF THE HOUSE

10
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:44,458
[Yupin] The Thevasatitpaisarn family
owns the company Theva Gems.

11
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:48,333
They must look their best at all times.
Whatever they do.

12
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:51,541
That means that every person
who works here as a servant

13
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:55,333
must look presentable
and be clean, pure, and unsullied.

[somber music playing]

15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,958

[somber music continues]

18
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,041

[music turns melancholic]

20
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,791
[Yupin] Go.

21
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,333
[Padcha] We're all family here.

22
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,958
We help each other out.

23
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,500
We'd like you to think of this house
as your own.

24
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,791
How many hours a day do we work here?

25
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,291
It's in the contract
that you must always be ready to work.

26
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,791
70,000 a month.

27
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,833
You're not gonna get that anywhere else.

28
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,166
[Yupin] You're new here.

29
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,958
So, your job will be

30
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:47,458
to clean and tidy up
all the master's bedrooms in this house.

31
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,958
Do not make any mistakes, understood?

32
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,166
Yes.

33
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,333
And stay out of sight of the masters
when they don't need you.

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,083
The masters give us orders
through this device here.

35
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,875
You must wear it and be ready
to receive orders at any time.

36
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,000
This is your room.

37
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,708
And here's your key.

38
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,458

It's 5:32 a.m.

44
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,375
You're two minutes late.

45
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,583
So, 2,000 will be deducted from your pay.

[maid 2, whispering] 2,000?

48
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,916
[Yupin] Punctuality is very important
in this house. You must be on time.

You're right on time.

52
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,500
Must we always be this precise?

53
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,708
Well, it's my duty to make sure
you're doing your work

54
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,791
according to the master's orders.

Yes, it is.

76
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,458
Keep it. It's yours.

77
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,541
What's your name?

78
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,541
Oh. It's Kaimook, sir.

79
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:22,416
Thank you very much

[Fai] Hey, look. That's the new maid.

82
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,666
Let's go talk to her.

83
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,708
Hey. I'm Fai and this is Tan.

84
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,833
[Kaimook] Hmm.

85
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:06,916
I'm Kaimook.

86
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,666
So how do you like working here?

87
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,291
Well…

88
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,875
I find it kind of stressful.

89
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,791
We have to be so punctual.

90
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,000
-[Fai] Mm-hmm.
-I'm really not used to that at all.

91
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,625

[Tan] Hmm?

94
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,208
Did you actually get to talk to him?

95
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,416
Did you?

[uneasy music playing]

97
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,041
[Kaimook] Yes. He thanked me
for cleaning up his room.

-[Fai] Wow.
-[Tan] That's amazing.

99

He doesn't usually talk to servants.

100
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,875
[Fai] Yeah, that's right.

101
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,583
Don't mind her.
That's just the way she is.

[Kaimook] Yes?

00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,083
Come and get the master's dessert
in ten minutes, okay?

131
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,083
Yes, of course.

You know, usually no one comes in here.

No one at all?

142
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,583
That's right.

143
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,875
I'm the only one who comes in here
and takes care of them.

144
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,041
Why is that?

145
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,458
It really is such a shame.

146
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,125
You've built
such an incredible greenhouse here…

Excuse me, sir.

Would you like to see the moths?

Come back tonight.

153
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,916
I guarantee you

154
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,166
they're as beautiful as
the ones you see now.

155
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,875
Consider that an order.

156
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:43,958

I came as you asked, sir.

162
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,041
How's life treating you here?

163
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,083
Well…

164
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,208
it's taken some adjusting, sir.

165
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,291
Well, you know,

166
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:05,125
I want everyone living in this house
to be happy.

167
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,541
If you need anything, let me know.

168
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,541
I'll get it for you.

169
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,333
Thank you, sir.

00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,625
Come over here.

[gasps softly]

173
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,625
Did you know

174
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,916
that the number of moths

175
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,625
is a dozen times greater
than the number of butterflies?

176
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,041
The reason is…

177
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,666
they prefer dark places

178
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,958
and hide from humans.

that I like butterflies?

[exhales shakily]

183
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,250
It's because…

184
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,625
butterflies…

185
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,875

They're perfect creatures.

You know what?

189
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,083
The first time I laid eyes on you,

190
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,625
I knew right away

191
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,708
you were special.

The others are

195
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,125
just worms and insects.

196
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:18,791
But you…

[Kaimook breathes shakily]

198
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,833
…you are a butterfly

199
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,291
that can spread its wings and fly.

200
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,041
Close your eyes.

201
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,458
Close them.

202
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,208
Wait for me here.

[Kaimook] I wanna keep it.

249

It's so beautiful.

250
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:35,708
It would be a horrible waste
to just let it die, wouldn't it?

251
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:40,041
Could you preserve it for me, please?

252
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:44,625
Come.

[tense music playing]

254

Take your time putting the pins in.

255
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,500
We're going to need
to pin the antennae as well.

256
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:09,083
Most people have little interest in moths.

257
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:13,458
They usually prefer butterflies
because, obviously,

258
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,583
they come in more beautiful colors.

259
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,333
Once butterflies are dead,

260
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,916
you can pin them in any position you want.

[slide changer clicks]

262
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,458
[Roongroj] Or you can even
decorate their wings however you like.

263
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,541
You'll own your own perfect butterfly.

[Roongroj] You know, Kaimook,

267
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,000
growing up,

268
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,791
I always taught my sons
to compete against each other

269
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,125
so that one day they could succeed me.

270
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:24,500
But now…

271
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:28,583
they can't wait for me to die.

272
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,958
So I'll be out of the way
and they can have my fortune.

273
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,625
Don't give up hope just yet.

274
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,166
[sighs]

275
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,875
I can give you another son, sir.

[tense music playing]

277
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:57,041
And he will be a deserving heir.

278
00:33:58,666 --> 00:34:00,166
One who obeys you

279
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,333
and does everything you tell him.

280
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,125
Just like I do.

281
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,375
He'll be a son you can be proud of.

[Yupin] Kaimook, from now on,

285
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:34,041
you will be the master's personal servant
and you will only take orders from him.

286
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,333
Yes.

287
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,666

00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:19,166
[Mavin] I hope you die soon,
so I can get my hands on your money.

291
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,666
[Roongroj] Well, you'll just have to wait.

292
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,541
I'd rather have a servant
take care of the company.

293
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,833
[Phupat] I never said a word
when you married a servant.

294
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,000
But why did you have to give her
Mom's necklace?

295
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,250
[Roongroj] It's mine!
I can do whatever I want with it!

[Mavin] Dad! Come out here and talk to me!

300
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:41,208
How could you fire me? Dad!

301
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:44,041
What the hell are you thinking, huh?
Open the door!

302
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,708
[Roongroj] If I die,

303
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:48,166
you two will get nothing!

304
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,958
[Phupat] This was all
part of your plan, wasn't it?

305
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,666
You killed my father!

306
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,166
[Kaimook] I didn't kill him.

307
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,333
You did.

308
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:12,791
Yeah.

309
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:18,833
That night,

310
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:25,416
you were so mad at your father
for marrying me, a servant.

311
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,166
So you drugged his tea.

312
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,000
And your brother,

313
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:34,458
when he heard
he was getting fired from the company,

314
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:36,666
he went crazy.

When your father started to get high
from the drugs and hallucinate,

319
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,833
your brother killed him.

[intense music playing]

321
00:36:57,666 --> 00:37:01,000
[Mavin] Dad! Come out here and talk to me!
How could you fire me?

322
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,125

[tense music playing]

330
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:24,250
Together, you both helped each other
kill your father.

331
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:28,458
But your brother
had the will changed because

332
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:31,208
he wanted
your dad's fortune all to himself.

333
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:35,333
Boy, were you ever mad at him.

334
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:36,916
So you put the same drug

335
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,250
you used to kill your father
into your brother's wine.

336
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:45,625
You set the whole thing up.
How to kill him and get rid of the body.

337
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:48,041
You made it look
like he died from an accident.

338
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:51,875
And then you took what you inherited
and sold all of your family's properties.

339
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:53,291
Stop talking!

You wanna kill me now?

343
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,666
You killed your father,

344
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,083
your only brother,

345
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,708
and now you want to kill
your poor father's widow?

346
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:09,666
Did you do all of this
so you could steal my family's property?

347
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,083
I'm just taking back

348
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,666
what all of us deserve to have!

349
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:19,500
You were all so fucking cruel to us!

350
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,666
And you're so pathetic.

351
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,333
You're the firstborn son,

352
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,750
but your father left you nothing.

353
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,458
You can say whatever you want,

354
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:40,333
but in the end,
you'll always be just a lowly servant.

355
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,500

[laughs]

376
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,583
Tell you what,
I'll give you two choices, Phupat.

377
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:15,083
One, confess to everything
and pay for it while you rot in jail.

378
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:17,666
You may even get a reduced sentence.

379
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,083
And the second choice…

380
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:24,875
try to deny it and take your chances.

381
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,666
No matter what choice you make,

382
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:30,708

If that's the way it's gonna be,

386
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
then I might as well kill you!

387
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,125

do you believe what the police say

420
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,000
that Mr. Phupat murdered
his own father and brother

421
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,583
so he could have the fortune
all to himself?

422
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:57,833
[Padcha] Well, I never thought
he could be…
