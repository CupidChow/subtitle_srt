[man 2] Stay away from me.

12
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,208
What the fuck are you doing?
Get outta here!

13
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,500

[dramatic music playing]

25
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,291
Tonight is the last night
of the funeral vigil

26
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,375
for diamond tycoon,
Roongroj Thevasatitpaisarn.

27
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:28,125
He was the president of Theva Gems,
a ten billion baht jewelry company.

28
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,416
This way, sir.

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,583
[reporter] The police have ruled
the tycoon's death an accident.

30
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,583
[man] Excuse me.

31
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,625
[reporter] The heir to the late tycoon's
ten-billion-baht empire

32
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,416
has yet to be revealed,

33
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,041
but it is said to be
between his eldest son, Phupat,

34
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,833
who helped his father expand
the business overseas, a huge achievement,

35
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,125
and his second son, Mavin,

36
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,750
who has connections
with many different industries,

37
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,708
which could help
the Theva Gems brand grow even faster.

38
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,750
Good evening, Minister.
Thank you so much for coming.

39
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,875
My condolences.

40
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,333
-[Mavin] Thank you.
-Hmm. There's quite a crowd.

41
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,625
-Please come inside.
-Thank you.

42
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,000
[dramatic music continues]

43
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,166
This way.

44
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,708
[mouthing] Here it is.

45
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,125
This area is for family members only.

46
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,416
[music ends]

47
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,791
[man] Honorable guests,
ladies and gentlemen,

48
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:28,416
tonight is the last night
of the funeral vigil for Mr. Roongroj.

49
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:33,416
Now, as per custom,
a eulogy will be given for Mr. Roongroj,

50
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,625
who was much beloved by us all.

51
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:41,791
So I would like to invite Mr. Phupat
to come to the podium to give the eulogy.

52
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,375
[pensive music playing]

53
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,125
Good evening, everyone.

54
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,625
I'd like to thank all of you

55
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,916
for joining us in sending my father
to Heaven on this day.

56
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,625
On behalf of the whole
Thevasatitpaisarn family,

57
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,250
I would like

58
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:25,708
to deliver to you all this eulogy
commemorating our beloved father.

59
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,000
Since I was a child,

60
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:32,250
I used to see my father
sitting at his desk all day long.

61
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,708
He devoted his entire life
to working on jewelry.

62
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,625
And I used to ask myself why.

63
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,750
Why did he always have to work that hard?

64
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,416
Until one day, I discovered

65
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,250
that he did everything for us.

66
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,791
And now that he's no longer here with us,

67
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,708
I just want to tell him that…

68
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,041
There's no need to worry, Dad.

69
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,458
I'll take care of everything
from here on in.

70
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,500
Rest in peace, Dad.

71
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,958
[uneasy music playing]

72
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,916
[footsteps echoing]

73
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,583
Yupin, can you go through
today's schedule for me again, please?

74
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,333
We'll be ready to welcome guests at 5:00.
The band starts playing at 6:00,

75
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,375
and food will be ready
to serve at 7:00, ma'am.

76
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,500
That's excellent.

77
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:11,291
Now, tell everyone to get ready
an hour before the party starts.

78
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,666
[Yupin] Yes, ma'am.

79
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,500
Kaimook, you know today's schedule, right?

80
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,208
Make sure you bring
the master over on time.

81
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,833
Yes.

82
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,875
-[girl] Ms. Cartier. Ms. Cartier, no.
-Bee!

83
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,291
How could you let her come out here?

84
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,458
-Take her in and wash her paws now!
-[Bee] I'm sorry!

85
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,500
Go on! Move it!

86
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,291
Kita! Why are you talking to her
like that, honey?

87
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,083
[woman] Kaew!

88
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,666
[expressive music playing]

89
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,958
Kaew!

90
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,208
I'm coming, Mrs. Araya.

91
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,166
What took you so long?

92
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,333
The party's tonight.

93
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,958
Why don't you just give it to me tomorrow?

94
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,708
Hey, Mama!

95
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,458
[Araya] Shutter!

96
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,375
-Long time no see!
-Mmm!

97
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,500
[both chuckle]

98
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,083
I missed you so much.

99
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,500
Mwah! Mwah!

100
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,958
-I missed you even more.
-Same, Mom.

101
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,958
[Araya] How are you?

102
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,458
[Shutter] Great.
I'm doing great. How about you?

103
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,791
[Araya] Really good.

104
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,875
[music continues]

105
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,125
[music fades]

106
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,958
[woman] Alright, chef.
Tonight, we will be serving 19 guests.

107
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,208
We have nine seats on each side,

108
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,833
and the master will be
at the head of the table.

109
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,125
[chef] Alright.

110
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,333
[Kaimook] Mesa?

111
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,041
Instead of beef,
could you prepare the master white fish?

112
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,750
[Mesa] No problem. Chef,
change the beef tenderloin to the cod.

113
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,583
[chef] Fai, prepare the desserts
for Kaimook.

114
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,833
Oh, okay. Sure.

115
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,375
It's an assortment
of nine Thai desserts today.

116
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,500
I made them for you.

117
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,666
-Here you go.
-Thanks a lot.

118
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,041
Careful now.

119
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,500
[Phupat] The sea
in the coastal area over there,

120
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,333
that's where the meteorites fell.

121
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,041
They're teeming with rare minerals,

122
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,291
and my friend has rights
to the entire area.

123
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,958
Dad,

124
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:47,291
I think we need to make a decision about
buying that diamond mine in Merida now.

125
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,291
[Mavin] Why do you believe
what that guy says?

126
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,666
Can you even trust him?

127
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,750
Please trust me.

128
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,916
I've got a great relationship
with the mine owner.

129
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,416
[Mavin] Are you getting something
out of this or what?

130
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,708
Why the big rush to seal the deal?

131
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,041
[Phupat] If we take too long,

132
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,708
competitors like Gentle Gems
will snatch it, Dad.

133
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,291
[Mavin] Dad,

134
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:14,500
it's a ridiculously overpriced mine.
Just let Gentle Gems have it.

135
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,458
You should invest in Pride,
the company I suggested before.

136
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,250
They have the goods.
They just need our investment.

137
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,458
[sighs] If it's so great,
why is it going bankrupt? Huh?

138
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,958
Well, we'll take them over.

139
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,333
[Phupat] What will we get out of that?
It's going bankrupt.

140
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,083
[Mavin] It's cheaper and worthwhile.
The white guy's mine's expensive.

141
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,500
[Phupat] I know him really well.
He's a friend of mine, Dad.

142
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,833
-[Mavin] Were we in the friend business?
-You're both convinced you're right?

143
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,750
What do you think, Kaimook?

144
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,000
Sir?

145
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,666
Just tell us.

146
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,708
What do you think?

147
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:58,958
Well…

148
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,708
if we're still unsure about it,

149
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,250
there's no need to rush into anything.

150
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:08,750
Hmm.

151
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,208
No need to rush.

152
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,208
It's such a simple answer.

153
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,833
Even Kaimook knows better
than you two executives.

154
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,291
-Dad!
-[Roongroj] Enough.

155
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,333
Just go now.

156
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,541
Before I get upset.

157
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,375
[door opens]

158
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,416
[door closes]

159
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
[door opens and closes]

160
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,500
[Roongroj sighs]

161
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,125
Would you like some tea now?

162
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,083
From now on,

163
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,375
I may not be as frustrated
with those two anymore, right, Kaimook?

164
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,833
[Phupat] Hey, Carlos!

165
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:25,541
Yeah. I'm gonna need a bit more time
on this deal, okay?

166
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,833
Yeah, my father needs
just a little bit more convincing.

167
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,875
[Carlos] Well,
get him to hurry up already.

168
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,541
This deal isn't going
to stick around forever.

169
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,541
You got it?

170
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:39,041
Get it done,
so we can drink and celebrate!

171
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,958
-[Carlos laughs]
-[laughs] Yeah. Definitely.

172
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,875
-Yeah. I'll see you soon, okay?
-Okay, man.

173
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,291
-Bye.
-Cheers.

174
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,958
[uneasy music playing]

175
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,416
[sighs]

176
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,958
[Araya] Did you lose weight?
You've been studying hard?

177
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,083
I've been living in New York,
and without you there…

178
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,458
Well, the food doesn't taste as good, Mom.

179
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,083
Mm-hm? What do you want?

180
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,416
[Shutter] It'd be great
if you could give me two more cars.

181
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,333
[Araya] Cars?

182
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,416
-[Shutter] Yeah.
-Shutter!

183
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,541
You just got back
and you're asking for cars?

184
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,958
Quit spoiling the kid, Araya.

185
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,875
Kaew, wine.

186
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,333
[Araya] Is it your dad again?

187
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,583
[sighs]

188
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,333
Talking to him always makes me nauseous.

189
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,708
Everything's about Kaimook.

190
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,125
[Araya exhales softly]

191
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,833
[Araya] Don't worry about her.

192
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,125
She's just a servant.

193
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,500
Hm.

194
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,083
[tense music playing]

195
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,333
[knocking]

196
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,208
[door opens]

197
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,625
[door closes]

198
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,250
[Bee] Mr. Phupat.

199
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,208
Mrs. Padcha…

200
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,458
sent me to tell you
to go down to the party now.

201
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,666
[pensive music playing]

202
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,833
[Yupin] This way, please. Follow me.

203
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,125
-[photographer] Smile.
-[camera shutter clicks]

204
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,916
-Congrats on getting the supporting lead.
-Thank you.

205
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,458
You haven't said hi to me
since you got back.

206
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,541
Has Dad not come down?

207
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,083
Not yet.

208
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,416
[indistinct chatter]

209
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,458
It's time, sir.

210
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,708
[door opens]

211
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,458
[music ends]

212
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,750
[refined string music playing]

213
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,208
[Mavin] I'll do it.

214
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,250
There you go, Dad.

215
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,125
It's okay. Sit down.

216
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,666
Go ahead.

217
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,375
How do you like the food, Dad?

218
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,708
I had to book this chef
several months in advance.

219
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,666
It's alright.

220
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,708
Kita, put your phone away.

221
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,250
Shutter.

222
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,208
Are you graduating this year?

223
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,375
He's almost done, Dad.
He's got one year left.

224
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,083
I'm asking my grandson.
I'm not asking you.

225
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,833
I'm finishing this year, sir.

226
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,416
Hm. Good.

227
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,500
Why don't we give Dad our gifts now?

228
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,041
[Shutter sniffles]

229
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,083
[Mavin] My gift may look like a small one,

230
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,500
but I'm pretty sure that you'll like it.

231
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,458
The Rolex President.

232
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,583
You've wanted that one
for a long time, right?

233
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,666
[Roongroj chuckles]

234
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,000
I also have a present for you, Dad.

235
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,875
It took me quite a while
to find this bonsai tree.

236
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,958
It's 111 years old.

237
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:36,000
I wish you a peaceful long life.

238
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,791
So you can be our source
of peace and security for a long time,

239
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,541
just like this bonsai tree.

240
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,791
Hmm.

241
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,166
Actually,

242
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,791
I don't want birthday presents
from you two at all.

243
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:58,541
All I really want is for you both
to act like men. That's it.

244
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,416
[chuckles]

245
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,166
[tinkling]

246
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,083
Well, uh…

247
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,375
I'd like to thank you both

248
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,000
for your very generous presents,

249
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,875
and thank all of you
for joining me in tonight's celebration.

250
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,541
I actually received
the best present I could ask for today.

251
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,958
And I'd like to take this opportunity

252
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,458
to let all of my family and close friends

253
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,791
witness this incredibly special event.

254
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,375
Kaimook.

255
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,083
[fragile music playing]

256
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,166
[breathes deeply]

257
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,458
Kaimook is going to become my wife.

258
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,125
[music turns dramatic]

259
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,708
[Roongroj] And to show my sincerity,

260
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:08,875
Kaimook will legally become my wife
from this day forward.

261
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,666
[music continues]

262
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:23,125
SIGNED MARRYING MALE PARTY
SIGNED MARRYING FEMALE PARTY

263
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:33,250
[Roongroj] Please make yourself at home.
If you'll excuse me, I must get some rest.

264
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:34,875
Let's go.

265
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,625
[Mavin] Dad!

266
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,916
Um…

267
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,541
Congratulations.
Now you've got someone to look after you.

268
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,875
Would you like to go on a honeymoon
and take a few months off?

269
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,166
If I go for that long,

270
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,541
who'll take care of the business?

271
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,750
I'll take care of it.

272
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,458
[chuckles]

273
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,291
I know the way you work, Mavin.

274
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,000
I'd rather have a servant take care of it.

275
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,583
[dramatic sting]

276
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,166
[dramatic sting]

277
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,083
Hi, Krit.

278
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,750
I'd like to ask you about my dad's will.

279
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,458
When exactly did he write it?

280
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:16,375
I think it would be more appropriate
for you to learn about it together

281
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,208
with everyone else,
on the day of the reading.

282
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,125
Why is that?

283
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,875
Besides his two sons,

284
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,250
who else is in it?

285
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,958
[tense music builds]

286
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,458
[footsteps approaching]

287
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,208
Hey.

288
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,291
Are you okay?

289
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:06,750
Mm-hm.

290
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,166
[Bee exhales]

291
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:14,791
Well then,

292
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,333
I'll stay and keep you company.

293
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,458
[exhales]

294
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,916
Mr. Mavin wants to see you.

295
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,791
[tense music playing]

296
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,625
[thunder rumbling]

297
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,166
[music fades]

298
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:59,041
[Mavin] Feels great, huh?
Having someone drive for you?

299
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,750
How many years have you worked here?

300
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,833
Four years, sir.

301
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,250
[Mavin scoffs]

302
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,083
It was worth it, wasn't it?

303
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,666
You suddenly turned from a servant

304
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,083
into a billionaire's wife.

305
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,000
[gasps]

306
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:30,625
I know you talked to the police.

307
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,833
But this is my family's business.

308
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:37,833
Stay the fuck out.

309
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,791
There's ten million baht in this bag.

310
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,041
Leave the house tonight.

311
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,041
And don't sign the inheritance.

312
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,541
I can't accept it.

313
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:56,791
[Mavin exhales]

314
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,583
Tian.

315
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,958
Take the next turn and pull over.

316
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:16,416
[thunder rumbling]

317
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,250
Get out.

318
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
[dramatic music playing]

319
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
[gasps]

320
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,458
[Roongroj] And to show my sincerity,

321
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:06,625
Kaimook will legally become my wife
from this day forward.

322
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,208
[music fades]

323
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
[poignant music playing]

324
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,791
Isn't that your mother's necklace?

325
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,166
[exhales sharply]

326
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,416
[inaudible]

327
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,541
[applause]

328
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:18,208
Please make yourself at home.
If you'll excuse me, I must get some rest.

329
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:19,791
Let's go.

330
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,583
[cicadas buzzing]

331
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:42,833
[Yupin] Are you angry with the master?

332
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,000
Go back inside.

333
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,000
The necklace was Madam's.

334
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,583
-The master must've had his reasons for--
-His reasons?

335
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:06,791
Why don't you just
go and talk to him about it?

336
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:12,708
Sure.

337
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,833
I'll just go talk to him then.

338
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,958
[music heightens]

339
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,416
[music fades]

340
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:58,000
What's the matter?

341
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,416
Come on, tell me. What is it?

342
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,833
I feel a bit awkward.

343
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:07,625
About what?

344
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:14,708
About your sons, sir.

345
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,625
[poignant music playing]

346
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,916
Ignore them, Kaimook.

347
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,500
No one can do anything to you.

348
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,416
You have my name now.

349
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:34,750
It'll protect you from everything.

350
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,791
From now on, I'll take care of you.

351
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:45,250
You don't have to stay
in the servant's quarters anymore.

352
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,791
You can move your things up here
and stay with me.

353
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,541
Alright then?

354
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:03,958
[music fades]

355
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:06,875
[sighs] I told you

356
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,333
to knock before you enter, didn't I?

357
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:18,500
