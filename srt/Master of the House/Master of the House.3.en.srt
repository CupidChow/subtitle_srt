00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,166
[shutter camera clicks]

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,791
[Dom] Tighten the bottom right side
and make it puff out more.

3
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,708
[Kita] I think it still looks weird.
Bee, check the left side for me.

4
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:13,666
The upper left.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,916
Do whatever it takes
to give it more shape.

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,625
That's better.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,416
-What do you think?
-Hey, what's the idea?

8
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,125
-I don't get this piece.
-[Dom] Needs to be tighter.

9
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,708
[Abel] I'm pretty sure the dress
will sell out really quickly. It's pretty.

10
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,250
But what's the…

11
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,458
the inspiration and concept behind it?

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,458
You don't know yet?

13
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,791
I attended Fashion Week,

14
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,250
but it wasn't just to sit there
and look hot.

15
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,125
I got some great inspiration there.

16
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,500
If you weren't Ms. Kita,

17
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,291
you wouldn't have been invited
to Fashion Week. [chuckles]

18
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,541
[camera beeps]

19
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,125
Let me tell you something.

20
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:50,916
When I first started working with you,
I was sure your brand would fail, Kita.

21
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,875
This dress right here,

22
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,833
it definitely has life and nice movement,

23
00:00:56,916 --> 00:01:00,166
but why is it pinned up
like some animal's hide

24
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,833
you're stretching to use
as a carpet or wall hanging?

25
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,250
Why are you being a jerk?

26
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,333
Oh, okay, guys. Chill.
Let's not lose it here.

27
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,791
I think the dress is made
of lovely material.

28
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,541
Great attention to detail.
But I think it lacks character.

29
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,166
Take the composition, for instance.
I think it's flat.

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,125
-It is flat.
-It's just my insight, though.

31
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,500
-Abel, what do you think?
-[Abel] It still needs more movement.

32
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,333
-[Dom] Good point.
-It needs a shape, life.

33
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,583
Should we get a model?

34
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,833
Yo, that's an amazing idea, man.
That's genius.

35
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,041
-[Abel] Right?
-Hey!

36
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,625
I'm the designer.
Shouldn't I get a say in this?

37
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,250
[Abel] You're not used to people
telling you what they think.

38
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,541
[Dom] Okay, okay, okay.
We need to get a model today.

39
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,458
You know what?

40
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,083
How about the girl?
It's not like her face is gonna matter.

41
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,666
Turn around so I can see you.

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,541
Look straight at me. What do you think?

43
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,541
[Abel] I think she's cute.
That body's great.

44
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,291
[Dom] She looks fine.
And we'll save money. She's a cheap fix.

45
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,000
-[Abel] Hm. I think it's gonna work.
-[Dom] Yeah, definitely.

46
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,375
[camera shutters clicking]

47
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,583
[Dom] Okay. Hey, you're doing great.

48
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,333
[Abel] Yeah, no. She's making it good.
She gives the dress a story.

49
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,416
-[Dom] Yeah, totally.
-[Abel] Do you like this, Kita?

50
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,541
-[tense music playing]
-[Abel] She's speechless.

51
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:05,583
Alright. So, I want you to act
like a caterpillar inside a cocoon.

52
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,833
-Kinda like a larva in a fetal state.
-[Dom] Yeah.

53
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,833
And slowly and gracefully
you will transform into a butterfly.

54
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:11,958
You get it? Okay.

55
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,333
[Dom] She knows what to do.
Your talent's rubbing off on her.

56
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,750
You taught her well.
Let's do this. You're ready, girl?

57
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,916
Okay, go.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,750
-[techno music playing]
-[Dom] Sexy, yes!

59
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,208
-[Abel] Look down.
-[Dom] That's it.

60
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,666
-[Abel] Rise slowly.
-[Dom] Hot.

61
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,958
Sexy, yeah!

62
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,041
-[Abel] Hell yes!
-[Dom] Yeah, baby! Yeah!

63
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,333
-[Dom] You got it?
-[Abel] Yeah.

64
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,375
-Let's get her into another outfit.
-[Dom] Okay.

65
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,208
Hey, sweetie, put this dress on.
Change in the back there.

66
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:36,583
[music heightens, then stops]

67
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,708
-Change here.
-[Abel] What?

68
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,833
[tense music playing]

69
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,291
[Abel] There's a room, Kita.

70
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,291
Professionals don't mind changing on set.

71
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:56,083
[Dom] So, like,
we don't have all day here, by the way.

72
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,916
Can I please change in the bathroom?

73
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,000
[breathes shakily]

74
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,750
-[Abel] Um…
-[Bee breathes shakily]

75
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,416
[Abel] Come on. Just let her change
in the back room, Kita.

76
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,041
[Dom] Is this how it is in New York?

77
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,166
-[Abel] Dom, shut up. Turn around.
-Okay, okay, okay.

78
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,416
[Bee moans and whimpers]

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,291
[Dom] Tell me when you're done.

80
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,416
Dom, look at her.

81
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,666
[Dom] Yeah, looks pretty good.

82
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,458
[Bee breathes shakily]

83
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,375
[Dom] You want me to shoot this?

84
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,833
You guys are insane.

85
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,375
[Bee breathes shakily]

86

-[camera beeps]
-[Abel] Shit, Dom.

87
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,625
-What are you doing?
-[Dom] What's the problem?

88
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,375
[Abel] Here, take this.

89
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,208
-Here, put this on.

Is Mom okay?

99
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,916
[Bam] The doctor said
she still needs dialysis.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,750
He says it's going to take
two to three sessions a week.

103
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,208
Mm. Alright.

104
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,541
I'll just… send you more money.

105
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,625
Bee, should I quit college
to help you pay for all of this?

106
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,333
No, Bam. [exhales]

107
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,750
Don't be silly.

108
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,291
You need to stay in school,
it's important.

109
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,666
As for money,

110
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,791
don't worry about it.

111
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,333
I'm taking care of it.

112
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah. I-- I get that,
but why can't I help?

113
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,041
I can't stand the fact
that it's all on your shoulders.

114
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,875
-[Kita] I said no phones at work.
-[gasps]

115
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,416
You stupid or what?

116
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,166
I'm sorry, Ms. Kita.

117
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,083
[Kita] Go on. Get her dressed.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,250
And about my collection,
did you finish the rest?

119
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,458
I'm working on the patterns right now.

120
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,958
Well, finish them already.
I wanna show them off to my friends.

121
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,333
I will.

How was your day, little cutie? Hm?
[blows kisses]

127
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,083
Here, I'll put this on you, okay?

128
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,833
Don't forget to back up
the camera footage.

129
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,625
-Or my vlog post will be late.
-Yeah.

130
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,333
Yeah? What is it? Tell me! Tell me!

131
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,916
[Fai] I feel so bad for Kaimook.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,791
She could've been
the wife of a billionaire.

133

[Yupin] Kaimook.

136
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,708
You're going to be taking care
of our masters again, all right?

137
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,833
You're going to have to clean
the storage room tonight.

138
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,791
Mrs. Araya's orders.

139
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,708
Of course.

THEVA CHARITY EVENT

141
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,791
[Araya] Turns out the charity event
was a huge success.

142
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,208
There was quite the buzz
about it in the media.

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,208
The problem is, you changed
the agenda without our consent.

144
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,250
Ah!

145
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,458
Boo-hoo.

146
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,625
You are overreacting.

147
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,541
Besides, it's done, and it was a hit.

148
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,250
But manners count.

149
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,541
Showing some class
is a good thing, isn't it?

150
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,625
Yes, Padcha.

00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,125

is going to read the will tomorrow.

[chuckles softly]

163
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,625
[Kaimook] I'm sure it would love
to go outside sometimes.

164
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,583
And it would give people
a chance to admire its beauty.

165
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,708
[Roongroj] Have you ever had the chance
to admire one this close?

166
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,375
I wish to keep
this beautiful creature forever.

167

It's mine, all mine.

With me for eternity.

169
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,541
Just like you.

170
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,833
I'd like to keep you here with me forever.

Kaimook, you're not like any woman
I've ever been with.

00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,375
Kaimook asked to speak with us.

343
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,875
I would like to return the necklace

344
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:30,791
the master gave me.

345
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:35,500
It belongs to your mother, Mr. Phupat.

346
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,541
It doesn't feel right keeping it.

347
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,541
If you really had that intention,

348
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,583
you would have done it a long time ago.

349
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,666
So why don't you just tell me
exactly what you want.

350
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,666
I'm worried about something, sir.

351
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,958
I have come to seek advice
from you and your wife.

352
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:57,916
What is it?

353
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,458
It's concerning the master's death.

354
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,041
[tense music playing]

355
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,666
That night…

356
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,166
I noticed Mr. Mavin

357
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:18,291
as he was leaving the master's room.
He saw him last.

358
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,083
He was the last to see him alive.

359
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:26,666
Are you sure?

360
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,500
Why would you tell us only now?

361
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,500
I'm scared, sir.

362
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,541
He's threatened to kill me once before.

363
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,416
And I guess you thought
I'd want to protect you, huh?

364
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,083
If you returned that necklace?

365
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,458
Yes.

366
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,416
It was to prove to you how sincere I am.

367
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,875
I never ever asked master
to give me anything, I assure you.

368
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:59,666
If his death wasn't really an accident,
if someone killed him,

369
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,041
I want the culprit
to be punished for their crime.

370
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,000
Got any evidence, do you?

371
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:08,875
Not yet, I'm afraid.

372
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,250
It's nonsense.

373
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,583
Come on. Get the hell out of here.

374
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,916
I swear I'll find the evidence, sir.

Do you think she's telling the truth?

Hey, Bee.

380
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:54,625
Hey, what's up?

381
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,208
Tired?

382
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,250
Are you okay?

383
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:03,958
Yeah.

384
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:15,250
Hey, is the reason you're staying here

385
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,250
because…

386
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:22,166
you wanna find out
what happened to the master?

387
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:34,416
Hm.

Damn, girl.

390
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,250
Your strength's inspiring.

391
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,458
You always follow your convictions.

392
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:53,958
When I look at how you live your life,

393
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,958
it inspires me to not give up.

394
00:26:58,541 --> 00:26:59,708
I…

395
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,958
want to have the courage you have.

396
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:08,458
Thanks.

397
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,541
Hey, Kaimook.

398
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:17,083
You feel like having a sleepover?

399
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I have beer.

-Bee.
-[Bee] Here, a nice cold beer.

404
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:31,625
Take it.

405
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,208
The master was mean.

406
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,750
I think it's terrible.

407
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,625
He left you nothing.

408
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,250
Drop it.

409
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,666
That's the new collection?

410
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,375
[Bee] Yup. Almost done.

411
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,375
It's pretty.
You could have your own line one day.

412
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,000
Hm. Wouldn't that be nice?

413
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,625
I'll be your first client.

You're so sweet.

you get everything for free.

-Hm?
-That.

425
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,208
[Bee] Hmm.

426
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,708
It's just footage.
There's a camera on Cartier's collar.

427
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,416
Ms. Kita's idea.

428
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,041
Footage of what?

429
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,208
[Bee] Mm, look.

430
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,708
Hey, Bee. Could you rewind that a bit?

431
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:27,541
Why? What's up?

[music fades]

437
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:09,208
Mr. Phupat,
you aren't authorized here at this time.

438
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:10,916
It's because Mr. Mavin

439
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,541
ordered new access restrictions
throughout the building.

440
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,791
[tense music playing]

441
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:24,583
[Mavin] Just get those out of here.
I don't want them anymore.

442
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,916
[Phupat] What do you think you're doing?

443
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,916
Why was my access denied without warning?

444
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,500
[Mavin] Let me call you back.

445
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,625
Must've forgotten to tell you.

446
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:43,875
I've had your office moved downstairs.
It's in the management department now.

447
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:45,875
You see, this floor…

448
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,041
it's for execs.

449
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,666
Are you telling me
I'm not on the board anymore?

450
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,666
-You're making a big fucking mistake!
-[scoffs]

451
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,875
Listen.
I'm still giving you the same salary.

452
00:30:56,958 --> 00:31:00,250
You're just gonna have less work
and way less pressure.

453
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,625
Hey, I'm even envious of you
for having a great boss like me.

Oh! Remember there's a party in honor
of my new presidency tomorrow.

00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:22,875
And if you want those flowers I got,
go ahead. For your new office.

00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,208
haven't spent much time with you, son.

523
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:15,875
I've… put a lot of pressure on you.

524
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,125
But I hope you know that

525
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:20,833
I did it to help you grow
into a strong man.

526
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:25,708
Yeah.

527
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:27,791
[sad music playing]

528
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:33,250
I won't be around forever, you know?

529
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:39,375
This mansion
is gonna be all yours some day.

530
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:40,958
As well as Theva Gems.

531
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,666
You'll be ready, right?

532
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,041
You up for it?

533
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,583
I think I am…

534
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:01,875
I'll try not to fuck it up.

535
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,041
You're my only son.

536
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:15,833
And I know you've got this.

537
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,583
Dad?

538
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,333
Okay if I give you a hug?

539
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,208
[chuckles]

540
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,416
Sorry, I just…

544
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,166
WHERE ARE YOU?
AT THE PARTY.

545
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,916
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
CHILLING BY THE POOL.

546
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,208
I'M AT THE STUDIO.
COME SEE ME.

547
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,291
[cheerful music playing in distance]

548
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,375
[Araya] Thank you.

549
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:34,916
-Want some?
-Yeah.

550
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,500
[Araya] Good evening.

551
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:43,958
[footsteps approaching]

552
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:49,958
Hi, Mrs. Kaimook.

553
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,833
Why are you wearing that uniform?

554
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,458
She's not used to attending social events.

555
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:02,291
She asked us if she could go back
to her comfort zone. We said yes.

556
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:04,250
[guest] Oh, I had no idea.

557
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:07,041
-Uh, that makes perfect sense. Excuse me.
-Sure.

558
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,083
Work hard now, alright?

559
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:21,375
A lot of influential people are here.

560
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,750
You may just find your future husband.

561
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,208

562
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:35,125
-[Araya] Good evening.
-[male guest] Evening.

563
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,541
[Araya] Thanks for coming.

564

[dramatic music playing]

578
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,375
[Mavin] That's the surprise I had in store
for all of you tonight.

579
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,541
I hope you're enjoying yourselves so far.

580
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:07,208
I'd like to begin
by thanking my dear late father

581
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:09,500
for his faith in me.

582
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:15,041
He decided
that I would carry out his legacy.

583
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:20,333
As the new president
of Theva Gems Corporation,

584
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:24,375
it will be my honor
to ensure that Theva Gems

585
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,000
remains successful in the future.

586
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:30,000
[applause]

587
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,541
I'd like to say something as well.

588
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:38,416
[tense music playing]

589
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:41,416
[music fades]

590
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,625
Be with me here tonight.

591
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:27,666
I think maybe we should go back out there.

592
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:34,583
Why should we go back out there?

593
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,083
It's boring as fuck.

594
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,708
It's just a bunch of pretentious assholes.

595
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:43,833
Come on. Don't talk like that. All right?

596
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,208
You don't agree?

597
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,958
Our parents are just using us
to look good.

598
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:58,041
[uneasy music playing]

599
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:09,958
We can't do this today, alright?

600
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:13,791
Why's that?

601
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,208
You're usually all over me.

602
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:18,541
We have to be at the event.

603
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:33,791
You still think it's better out there? Hm?

604
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,875
[music turns intriguing]

605
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:12,333
[Phupat] If you were to ask me
who I think is the best person

606
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:16,083
to take over the presidency
of the company after my father,

607
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:19,291
I would undoubtedly say my little brother.

608
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:20,583
He is the best fit.

609
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:28,333
But ultimately,
the title and even the presidency,

610
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:29,541
they don't matter.

611
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:34,416
What really matters more are results.

612
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,833
I invite you all tonight

613
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:42,208
to wait and see what our leader

614
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:46,333
has in store
for our prestigious company's future.

615
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,625
Thank you, brother.

616
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,250
I'll take it from here.

617
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:30,458
[Mavin] If you wish to see
what the future will look like

618
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,791
at Theva Gems under my watch…

619
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,625
[music fades]

620
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:38,041
…take a look
at the following presentation.

621
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:40,083
You'll love it.

[lively music playing]

625
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,958
[Mavin] To the people of Thailand,

626
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:03,916
Theva Gems' jewelry has been an emblem
of beauty and elegance for over 40 years.

627
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,958
The time has now come for us to become
the top jewelry brand throughout Asia.

628
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:13,250
Theva Gems, crafted with love.

What the hell?

636
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,625
I said turn it off! Turn it off!

637

Hey! Turn it off!

-Let go!

You lost your mind?

[Padcha] Please stop it! No! Don't!

-Phu, don't.
-Do you think I chose this?

You think you're so fucking great?

On the day Grandpa died,

685

I know where you fucking were!

686
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:06,416
You should be thanking me.

Without me,
things never would've gone your way!

What are you talking about?

689
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:16,458
What are you talking about?!

Fuck you!

I'm a disgrace, am I?

That's fine!

693
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:24,875
But I can tell everyone
what the fuck you did!

00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:32,083
