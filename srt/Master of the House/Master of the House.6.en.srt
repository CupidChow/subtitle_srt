What happened?

8
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,083
It was my fault.

-[young Yupin] Phupat.
-[sobbing]

16
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:58,208
You should stop destroying the things
your father cares about so much.

[tense music playing]

18
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,625

19
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,916
I want to destroy everything.

[tense music playing]

27
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,291
Why did you follow me out here?

28
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,958
I was just curious to see
how far you'd take all this.

29
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,791
You're dead set on trying to ruin me,
aren't you, bro?

30
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,250
[Phupat] What's the matter?

31
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,166
Are you scared?

32
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,166
Maybe you should be.

33
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,291
Because I'm not getting out of your way.

34
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,125
You should just accept it.

35
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,291
Dad wanted me to have everything.

36
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,708
Well, Dad's not here to say what he wants.

37
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,666
[Mavin] Let me tell you myself, then.

38
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,000
You're a selfish prick.

39
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,000
And you have no idea
because you live up your own ass.

40
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,708
But Dad always knew.

41
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,625
He knew you were out
to destroy his empire.

42
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,375
Do you remember what he used to say?

43
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,625
You take a tiny piece of coal.

44
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:52,708
You heat it up hot.
And in time, you get a diamond.

45
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,291
But Dad said
you'd never be anything but the coal.

46
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,708
Fuel for the fire.

47
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,833
All you ever do is destroy things.

What do we do now?

136
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,291
You couldn't kill him
before throwing him in the water?

137
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,708
Or was that job too hard?

138
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,166
You think it's easy?

Mr. Phupat, what did you say?

148
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,875
He's caused me nothing
but shame and misery.

I think it's time we put an end to it all.

Mr. Mavin is still alive.

156
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,916
And if he survives, you'll go to jail
and be blamed for this whole thing.

To a clinic close by.

You crazy?

162
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,291
You will drive my brother
to a proper hospital.

163
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,750
But that's too far.

164
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,750
I don't care!
He needs the best care possible!

165
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,708

on the way there, sir!

00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:25,333
robbed our family
of its youngest beloved son.

185
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,583
He lived life to the fullest.

186
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,791
And worked hard for this family
until his very last breath.

187
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,833
In his time with us,

188
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,666
my brother

189
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,833
was always so kind to everyone.

190
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,416
Anyone who had the chance
to truly know him…

191
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,458
could see he had a very good heart.

192
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,208
I believe that everyone
who knew Mavin well…

193
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,041
[sobs]

194
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,125
…will be deeply saddened by his passing.

195
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,166
With him gone,

196
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,125
I'll be taking over Theva Gems…

197
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,291
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

198
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,125
…and carry forward our family's legacy,

199
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,208
making sure our company
has a strong hold on the future.

200
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,833
[applause]

201
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,458
What I want Mavin to know,

202
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,916
is that his grace and humility
will continue to inspire us.

203
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,291
[music stops]

204
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,375
[suspenseful music playing]

205
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,916
[Phupat] With Mavin gone,

206
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,958
I'll be the one taking over Theva Gems.

207
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,250
[music fades]

208
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,875
[breathing deeply]

209
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,833
[Phupat] With Mavin gone,
I'll be taking over Theva Gems.

210
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,166
[changing tone] With Mavin gone,
I'll be taking over Theva Gems,

211
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,583
and carry forward to…

212
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,916
[plaintive music playing]

213
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,500
[clatters]

214
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,333
[music continues]

215
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:28,958
[music fades]

216
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,375
[Yupin] Mr. Phupat knows that some of you

217
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,833
may have been upset
about what has happened recently.

218
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:39,375
This money is compensation
that Mr. Phupat is giving to all of you.

219
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,333
But he wants to make it clear

220
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,208
that if anyone asks
about what happened on the boat,

221
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,333
please just act
as if you don't know anything about it.

222
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,291
Is that understood, everyone?

223
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,375
[line calling]

224
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:19,583
ATTORNEY KRIT

225
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,666
[knocking]

226
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,208
Sir, I can't accept this.

227
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,416
Why?

228
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,541
Not enough?

229
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,916
[grave music playing]

230
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,833
Mr. Phupat,

231
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,000
it's been almost 100 days
since the death of the master.

232
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,125
Should we not start planning
an event in his honor?

233
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,541
You saying you actually loved him?

234
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,291
Go ahead. Do what you want.

235
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:25,916
[Kaimook] Thank you, sir.

236
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,833
TO ATTORNEY KRIT: I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU
ABOUT THE INHERITANCE

237
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,875
Yeah. Krit, you're a hard man to find.

238
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:52,125
[Krit] Well, I've been staying abroad
on Mr. Mavin's orders.

239
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,166
Why's that?

240
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,916
Why did Mavin send you abroad?

241
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,791
Uh, well, here's the thing, Mr. Phupat.

242
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,375
It's alright.

243
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,000
Mavin's out of the picture.

244
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,916
I wanted to ask you
about my father's will.

245
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,458
Now that he's dead,

246
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:16,000
can all of Mavin's shares
be transferred to me?

247
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,583
The truth of the matter, Mr. Phupat,

248
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,875
is, uh…

249
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,083
that the will I read to the family,

250
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,750
It's a fake.

251
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,250
What are you saying?

252
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,708
Uh…

253
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:39,041
Mavin forced me to change the will
so everything would be left to him.

254
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,125
[tense music playing]

255
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,208
I fucking knew it!

256
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:47,041
[glass shattering]

257
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,208
[loud crash]

258
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,666
[intense music playing]

259
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,666
Do you know what a piece of shit
your husband was?

260
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,208
Huh?

261
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,791
He changed our father's will!

262
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,541
Why the fuck are you crying over him, huh?

263
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,625
Phu!

264
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,333
-You knew about this, didn't you?
-[Yupin] Phu! Phu, stop it! Please!

265
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,333
Ah!

266
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,291
You've always hated me!

267
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,666
You're nothing but a whore!

268
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,291
Neither of you has the right
to live in this house!

269
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,333
-I want you out! Get outta my house!
-[Araya cries]

270
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:37,708
-No!
-[Phupat] Get out!

271
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,375
-Leave me alone!
-[Phupat] Here!

272
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,291
-Come see this. Come here!
-[Araya cries]

273
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,875
-[Phupat] Look at this!
-Phu!

274
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:43,916
[sobbing]

275
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,875
[Yupin] Mrs. Araya! Mrs. Araya!

276
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,333
[Araya cries]

277
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,125
[screaming]

278
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,958
[Phupat] You're both trash!

279
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,458
Trash!

280
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,291
[Araya cries]

281
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,000
[Araya wailing]

282
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,916
[dramatic music playing]

283
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,458
[Araya screams]

284
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,333
[sobbing]

285
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,625
[Araya cries]

286
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,916
[sobbing]

287
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,125
[music fades]

288
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,041
Why is the food so bland today?

289
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:41,041
[tense music playing]

290
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,125
I'll have that fixed for you right away.

291
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,291
No, don't.

292
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,375
Yupin.

293
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,083
Fire everyone in the kitchen.

294
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:00,541
[Yupin] What?

295
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,583
Is it because
I've always been so kind to you

296
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:06,833
that you think you can treat me this way?

297
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,583
Was it just Mavin and my father
that you were afraid of?

298
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,041
-Tell me!
-[dramatic sting]

299
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,250
Let me take that back.

300
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,791
-Fuck off!
-[dramatic sting]

301
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,250
[music fades]

302
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,625
[Phetye] You gotta make this shot.
Otherwise, game over.

303
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,708
[Pachara] Not a problem. Watch this.

304
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,583
-Ah, damn it. I lifted my head.
-[Phetye] I guess that's the match.

305
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,250
You said there was a break.
The ball never broke.

306
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,000
-[Pachara sighs]
-[Phetye] Hey.

307
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,541
Look who's here.

308
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,791
[apprehensive music playing]

309
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,916
[Pachara] We really appreciate you
coming here today, Mr. Phupat.

310
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,541
And taking time out of your busy schedule.

311
00:26:57,041 --> 00:27:00,333
And you have my deepest sympathies
for the loss of your brother.

312
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,375
Thanks.

313
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:07,083
It seems to me that our companies

314
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:09,916
have been competing for way too long.

315
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,750
Recent revelations have led me to believe

316
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:16,541
maybe it's better to find common ground.

317
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:17,791
Hmm.

318
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:21,083
That deal you signed with Carlos, Phupat,

319
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,916
how is that supposed
to strengthen our friendship?

320
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,916
Here's the thing.

321
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:30,958
Today I'm here as the chairman,
and majority shareholder of Theva Gems.

322
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:34,500
As you are well aware, our company

323
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,125
has the lion share of the diamond market,

324
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,958
and is clearly the top company in Asia.

325
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,541
[sighs]

326
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:44,791
[Phupat] Now,

327
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,291
if our two companies were to merge,

328
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,458
just imagine the success we could attain.

329
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,041
Are you trying to take us over?

330
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:04,666
What I'm trying to do
is sell Theva Gems to you.

331
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,375
Is that something you'd find interesting?

332
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,500
Listen. It's not like I'm asking you
to make a decision right now.

333
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:15,916
But I have an idea.

334
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,666
How about we get
to know each other a little better?

335
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,458
I'd like you both to come over
for dinner tonight. What do you say?

336
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,625
[music fades]

337
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,708
Your relationship to the deceased?

338
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:38,791
We were husband and wife.

339
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,250
This case was closed a while ago now.

340
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,583
Why are you requesting another autopsy?

341
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,625
[mournful music playing]

342
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:51,000
Because I truly believe
his death wasn't an accident.

343
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:58,291
[officer] This is the autopsy report
for Mr. Mavin.

344
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:04,541
It shows that he died
from fluid in his lungs due to drowning.

345
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:10,333
Blood tests also found high levels
of alcohol and drugs in his system.

346
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,291
[breathes shakily]

347
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,458
[music fades]

348
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,541
[exhales]

349
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:45,083
Whatever it is, spit it out.

350
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:48,291
Now that you finally have
everything you ever wanted,

351
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,916
I was thinking that…

352
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,041
we should get divorced.

353
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,833
[intriguing music playing]

354
00:29:56,916 --> 00:30:01,166
[Padcha] As for sharing the assets,
just give me my share as we agreed.

355
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,416
That's fine.

356
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,125
But you're not leaving here with anything.

357
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,458
That was not what we agreed on
and you know it.

358
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,916
If my father hadn't forced me
into marrying you,

359
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,416
you wouldn't be living
as comfortably as you are now.

360
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,333
[Padcha] You think this is comfort?

361
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,083
Everything I've had to put up with?

362
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:38,041
You're not sane
if that's what you call this.

363
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:44,083
All this time, I've done nothing but give
loving support to you and our child

364
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:47,791
when all I truly wanted
was to have a life of my own.

365
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,833
I hate to tell you no one gets
everything they want in life.

366
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:56,625
It doesn't work like that.

367
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,583
[sniffles]

368
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:15,458
[haunting piano music playing]

369
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,041
[Phupat] Welcome to my home.

370
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:19,875
Come on in.

371
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,250
Beautiful place.

372
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,666
The dining room is this way.

373
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,875
The chef informs me
that the food is ready.

374
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,416
Enjoy.

375
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,708
Everything to your liking?

376
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,750
[chuckles] Delicious.

377
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,583
It tastes like a Michelin restaurant.

378
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,291
Your staff are very professional.

379
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,000
They seem well-trained.

380
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,416
[Phupat] They are.

381
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,708
Here, in our home,
we pay close attention to detail.

382
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,541
[Pachara] Is that it?

383
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,958
The secret to success at Theva Gems?

384
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,833
I suppose you could say that.

385
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,583
I have a question.

386
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:28,000
Why in the world would you
ever want to sell Theva Gems to us?

387
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,458
Because Theva Gems

388
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,833
was my father's dream.

389
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,375
It's not mine.

390
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,500
Believe it or not, I've never been
interested in the diamond business.

391
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,250
So, Mr. Phupat, what is your dream?

392
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,583
Living life on my own terms.

393
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:58,666
[intriguing music playing]

394
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,291
I'm tired.

395
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,208
I'm tired of meeting
everyone else's expectations.

396
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,375
[Pachara chuckles]

397
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,500
I feel the same way sometimes.

398
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,666
I guess only the extremely wealthy

399
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,875
can ever really understand these things.

400
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,791
But this is, um…

401
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:25,291
entirely unexpected.

402
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,833
[dissonant music playing]

403
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:50,208
[Pachara] Thank you so much
for having us for dinner.

404
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,875
So, are you interested
in buying Theva Gems?

405
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,166
To be honest, um…

406
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:02,375
we're gonna need some time
to think about this.

407
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,666
I think, and your father would agree,

408
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,958
that both of our companies
have been rivals for far too long.

409
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,416
How many decades now?

410
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:15,541
If you were to buy Theva Gems right now,

411
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,333
there will be no competition left.

412
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,958
Your father would be proud of you
for making this happen.

413
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,541
How about this?

414
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,791
Take the house along with it.

415
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,791
It might make
your final decision a bit easier.

416
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,000
[music fades]

417
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,500
Appreciate you coming tonight, gentlemen.

418
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,291
Thank you.

419
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:00,625
Thanks for dinner.

420
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:05,333
[somber music playing]

421
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:15,250
What the hell was that all about?

422
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,625
It's almost embarrassing.

423
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,958
The company? With the house included?

424
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:22,041
[Pachara scoffs]

425
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,750
I blame it all on his dad.

426
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,625
Must've really fucked him up.

427
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,916
[chuckles]

428
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,916
[music stops]

429
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:31,916
Phu?

430
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,750
What have you done?

431
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,666
You all heard everything.

432
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,291
Please think about this, Phu.

433
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:45,208
The master built this house for us.

434
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:47,208
For his family to live in together.

435
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:51,125
I'm not aware
of any family who lived here.

436
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,583
So, what's the point of this place?

437
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,166
Phu, you cannot sell this house!

438
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,083
[Yupin gasps]

439
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:00,708
Is that an order?

440
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,333
Who do you think you are?

441
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:05,083
Have you been here so long
that you've forgotten your place?

442
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,666
[dramatic music playing]

443
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,708
And that goes for all of you!
Each and every one of you!

444
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:13,791
Why are you here day after day?

445
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,458
It's about the money, isn't it?

446
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,750
If you weren't being paid,
would you still be here?

447
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,458
So, tell me.

448
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,708
Where's the family?

449
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:33,458
[music heightens]

[music turns tense]

452
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:01,875
[Yupin] I always believed

453
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,333
that following the master's orders

454
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,291
would keep servants like us safe.

455
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,625
But by protecting him,

456
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:15,416
I let his hatred grow.

457
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,625
I'm the one who turned him
into what he is.

458
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,875
Ma'am…

459
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,416
this is not your fault.

460
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:35,708
You served this house the best you could.

462
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,125
[Kaimook] Mrs. Padcha,

463
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,416
I'm at a loss.

464

[Padcha] Kaimook,

465
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:25,958
I'm so sorry.

466
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,541
I couldn't help you the way I intended.

467
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,250
There's no need for you to worry.

468
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:36,291
I'll take care of everything.

[Krit] Is there no one else here?

478
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,250
Where is everyone?

479
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:12,958
They're all gone.

480
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:17,625
Go ahead.

My entire inheritance,

I leave to my beloved Kaimook,
my new bride,

485
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:55,125
and to any heir born of Kaimook only.
