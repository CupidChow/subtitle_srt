1
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,480
I cleared things up with Aoey.

2
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,640
Hey!

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,520
I'm so happy for you!

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,520
But ...

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
I have to say sorry for you

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,160
for asking you to help me lie,

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,480
knowing that you didn't want to do it.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,920
It's okay, Gen.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,080
If you're happy,

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,880
I'm happy, too.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,240
Thank you.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,280
- So,
- Huh?

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,680
Even though you two have cleared things up,

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,680
but ...

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Have you really gotten over it?

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,160
Not really,

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,640
but ...

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,440
I will soon.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,640
I don't think anything's more important

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,640
than seeing our loved one happy.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,120
Isn't that right?

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,960
Oh.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,920
I'm sorry.
Did you wait long?

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,280
Hi, Gen.

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,440
You're meeting Singh here, too?

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,400
We just cleared things up, too.

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,280
That's great!

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,840
After Aoey's wedding,

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,040
I think I'll take Singh to my mom
one more time.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,840
I hope you two find a happy conclusion to this.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,640
Thank you.

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,120
I need to go.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,160
I'd hate to be a third wheel.

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,960
Bye.

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,400
Have a safe trip home.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,560
Thot,

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,000
I have something to tell you.

38
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,800
What is it?

39
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,280
Oh, Aoey?

40
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,760
Hi, Gen.

41
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,800
- We're meeting today?
- No.

42
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,520
Today,

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,160
I'm meeting someone,

44
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,920
and I want you to come with me.

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,040
- Excuse me, Doctor.
- Yes.

46
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,160
- Hi, Doctor Der.
- Oh, Aoey!

47
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
How did you come here?

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,600
Have a seat.

49
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,760
I just want to see you before my wedding.

50
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,760
I want to introduce someone to you as well.

51
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,680
This is Genlong.

52
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,040
She's my best friend.

54
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,040
- Hm.
- Gen.

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,600
This is Doctor Der.
She's Ten's older sister.

56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,040
She's also my psychiatrist.

57
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,840
Are you that Genlong ...

58
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,280
She is.

59
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,640
Gen and I ...

60
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,800
have cleared things up already.

61
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,240
We're back together as best friends as well.

62
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,680
I truly thank you

63
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,840
for taking care of her and getting her back.

64
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,640
She's a fighter herself, too.

65
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,840
Treating this isn't easy
if a patient doesn't cooperate.

66
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm so happy.

67
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,240
It's great to hear
you've been fighting strongly all this time.

68
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,760
She barely needs to take
any medication now.

69
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,600
During that time,

70
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,240
did her condition get worse
because of me?

71
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
The past is the past.

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,680
Did you know that
she's now much better than before?

73
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,400
The fact that you two are back as friends

74
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,160
and she has reached the point
where she can bring you to see me

75
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,280
is quite a feat in itself.

76
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,880
Aoey,

77
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,520
I'm sorry for everything.

78
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,920
You don't have to be.

79
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,000
I forgave you.

80
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,920
This is so nice.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,760
After this, I hope you live a happy life

82
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,480
and know how to manage your stress well.

83
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,720
I wish to see you as a good friend,

84
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,360
not my patient.

85
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,480
Of course, Doctor Der.

86
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,520
See that, Thot?

87
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,440
Yeah.

88
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,440
Doctor.

89
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,040
- Hi.
- Hi, Great.

90
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,280
- Hello, Mr. Somkit.
- Hello.

91
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,120
This is from Ms. Ning.

92
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,960
Please give this to Ms. Tubtim.

93
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,120
Thank you.

94
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,480
Why didn't you have me bring this
to your home?

95
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,920
Well, this might affect Singh's job
in a bad way.

96
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,600
So, I have to ask you for a favour.

97
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,960
I think I saw Ten with another woman.

98
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,040
If we don't have any evidence,

99
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,240
we shouldn't let anyone hear this.

100
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,440
If you're free today,

101
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,360
how about we follow Ten?

102
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,400
If so, I think I have a plane.

103
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,360
- That's where I come in?
- Please help me.

104
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,200
Sure thing.

105
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,680
Causing chaos is my thing.

106
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,040
How about we get some dessert?

107
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,120
- That's Ten!
- Huh?

108
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,720
- He's over there.
- Hey!

109
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,480
You're about to get married,
and here you are with another woman?

110
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,320
- Great!
- Great! Wait!

111
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
Wait.

112
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,680
I saw him with this woman twice already.

113
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,080
Though, I'm not sure about their relationship.

114
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,640
I'm afraid to tell Aoey.
I didn't want to cause a problem.

115
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,920
Let's just ask her!

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,760
- Go!
- Mr. Somkit, let's go!

117
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,920
You will go home yourself, right?

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,240
- Yes.
- Then I guess I'm going to work now.

119
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,520
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

120
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,240
Hey.

121
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,040
Excuse us.

122
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Who are you?

123
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,200
And just put this bow here.

124
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,240
I knew that a wedding might get me busy,

125
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,280
but I didn't think it would be this busy.

126
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,400
But everything's much smoother
because of you.

127
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Thank you.

128
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,520
And thank you

129
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,240
for being my bridesmaid.

130
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,680
Of course.

131
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,400
You're my best friend.

132
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,680
Time sure flies.

133
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,160
I still remember the first day I met you.

134
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,120
The day when you introduced yourself
in front of our class.

135
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,160
Hello, my name is Genlong.

136
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,640
You can just call me Gen.

137
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,320
I'm from Bangkok.

138
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,720
My family is extremely rich.

139
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,920
And I had you do my homework
in exchange for snacks.

140
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,080
I kept that bag for so many years.

141
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,360
Had I not lost it,

142
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,440
I'd probably put it in a frame
and hang it on the wall.

143
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,760
You're overly dramatic!

144
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,280
And now,

145
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,040
that girl with lice

146
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,840
is about to become a bride.

147
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Let's go.

148
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,240
You need to take a shower.

149
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,240
You have to go to bed early.

150
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,560
You need to be up at three
for your makeup tomorrow.

151
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,280
Let's go!

152
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,600
Get up now.

153
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,400
No, I don't want to.

154
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,640
Go.

155
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,920
Hurry!

156
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,440
Let's go!

157
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,920
Get up!

158
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
Fine.

159
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,800
I'd hate to be a filthy bride.

160
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,560
Then you have to hurry.

161
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,320
Aoey,

162
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,600
you look very beautiful today.

163
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,800
Are you ready?

164
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,000
Ms. Sali, you look so beautiful today.

165
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,840
- Thank you.
- You do, too, Doctor.

166
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,960
Thank you!

167
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,960
- Here's our bride.
- Wow.

168
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,920
Whoa!

169
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,200
- Aoey.
- Hello.

170
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,080
You are so beautiful, my child.

171
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Thank you.

172
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,840
I completely agree.
Our bride is the most beautiful tonight.

173
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,280
Aoey,

174
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,600
let's take photos with Ten over there.

175
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,040
Let me take you there.

176
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,160
Let me take our bride to the groom.

177
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,000
- Ms. Sali, we should go, too.
- Sure.

178
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,800
Okay.

179
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,120
Be careful.

180
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,320
- Be careful.
- Why are you so beautiful?

181
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,400
Hello, Ms. Sali.

182
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,200
- Hello.
- Hi.

183
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,520
- You're late.
- I'm her first girlfriend.

184
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,720
How's our bridesmaid?

185
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,200
Tired?

186
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,960
I am,

187
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,200
but it's worth it.

188
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,520
Look at her.

189
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,360
Smile!

190
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,720
- I'm so happy.
- One, two, three. Smile and look at the camera.

191
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,400
NEW CAPTION

192
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,920
One, two ...

193
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,360
Hello.

194
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,840
Welcome all honoured guests tonight.

195
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,400
My name is Nut I'm honoured to be
your host for tonight's very special wedding.

196
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,040
Please give a round of applause.

197
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,200
Okay, everyone.

198
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,160
As you all know that, tonight's wedding

199
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,440
is surrounded by love.

200
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,320
Both from our groom's and bride's families.

201
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,440
I'm sure you all have been waiting
to see our groom and bride.

202
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,680
Ten and Aoey, please come up to our stage!

203
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,160
She's so beautiful!

204
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,040
They're looking great tonight.

205
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,440
Hello.
Hi.

206
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,280
Let's ask the two

207
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,160
about how they first met.

208
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,680
Hello to all the guests tonight.

209
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,680
Let's give you a brief story of how we met.

210
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,440
I met Aoey for the first time at a hospital.

211
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,720
That day, I went to give some novels to my sister.

212
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
I made eye contact with her that day.

213
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,880
It was such a great first impression for me.

214
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,800
After that, we talked with each other
more and more.

215
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,880
How about we let the adults
say something about the two?

216
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,640
Let's start with the bride's family.

217
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,800
Ms. Sali, please.

218
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,840
Say something for our bride and groom.

219
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,720
As a mother,

220
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,440
I wish that you two

221
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,120
will live a happy life like this forever.

222
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,120
Wow!
That's very adorable.

223
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,640
I hope that my two beloved brother and sister

224
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,240
grow old together happily.

225
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,400
Okay.
That's so nice.

226
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,840
Everyone's truly here for
the bride and groom tonight.

227
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,080
And now, let's watch a VTR.

228
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,400
I don't think the groom should be happy just yet.

229
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,040
I mean, it has been going on for too long.

230
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,880
How about you talk to Ten about this?

231
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,080
But ...

232
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,120
But I'm so confused.

233
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,120
I don't know what to do.

234
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,920
Can I please have some time?

235
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,320
I just want you to be at the wedding,

236
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,000
so that Aoey knows Ten is having an affair.

237
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,920
Can you please do that, Dao?

238
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,800
How about this?

239
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,640
Whenever you're ready,

240
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,560
call me at this number.

241
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,280
We're so sorry.

242
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,120
In fact,

243
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,040
we never wanted to ruin your love,

244
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,520
but I think of Aoey as my sister, too.

245
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,120
Hello, Aoey.

246
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,200
I must apologize for causing a scene
in your wedding.

247
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,680
That man next to you
doesn't deserve to spend life with you.

248
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,640
You're not the only one he's dating.

249
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,960
I'm thankful for everything
that got me out of it

250
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,800
and learned the truth that
the man I'm dating

251
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,560
is about to get married.

252
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,960
Ten,

253
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,240
you were telling me you love me yesterday.

254
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,560
You said I'm the only one for you.

255
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,400
And you're getting married today.

256
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
Now that it's so clear,

257
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,920
this is where our relationship ends.

258
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,240
Aoey, it's not what it looks like.

259
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,960
- Aoey.
- What?

260
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,320
- Aoey.
- Aoey.

261
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,600
Aoey, are you okay?

262
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,400
I don't even know what to feel anymore.

263
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,920
Calm down.

264
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,400
All this time,

265
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,320
Ten has always been so nice to me.

266
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,440
He took care of me.

267
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,920
Why ...

268
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,560
Why did this happen?

269
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,480
Do you want to go to your room?

270
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
No.

271
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,800
I ...

272
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,680
I don't know.

273
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,160
I feel betrayed.

274
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,680
I'm so angry inside.

275
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,080
In my story of a novel I wrote,

276
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,120
my character was in so much pain.

277
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,960
It cried its eyes out.

278
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,040
But now that it's actually happening to me,

279
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,720
why am I not in that much pain?

280
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,640
I somehow feel relieved.

281
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,040
All this time,

282
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,960
I tried to love Ten.

283
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,000
I thought I could love him.

284
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,880
Now that it turned out this way,

285
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,280
I realized

286
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,720
it's a good thing.

287
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,360
That way, I ...

288
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,520
don't have to force myself anymore.

289
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,080
I don't know what to say,

290
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,520
but no matter what happens,

291
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,600
I'm right next to you.

292
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,840
Can I stay here a bit longer?

293
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,760
What is all this?

294
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,400
Who is that woman?

295
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,080
Do you know her?

296
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,800
- Aoey, listen to me.
- Don't touch me.

297
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,720
I wasn't serious with Dao.

298
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,000
I really want to marry you.

299
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,760
Give me another chance.

300
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,480
Sorry, Ten.

301
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,160
I can't do that.

302
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,480
I can't love you.

303
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,920
And ...

304
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,520
what about our wedding?

305
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,080
It's yours.

306
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,440
I'm not getting married.

307
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,240
Try to find another bride.

308
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,440
- Aoey!
- Stop!

309
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,840
That's for fooling my daughter!

310
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,600
I must thank you for coming today, Dao.

311
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,600
It's okay.

312
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,120
Don't worry about what happened.

313
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,160
Yes.

314
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,200
Dao.

315
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,920
Aoey,

316
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,400
I'm sorry for what happened today.

317
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,640
- I ...
- Don't be.

318
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,960
It's me who needs to thank you

319
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,560
for telling me everything.

320
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,280
After this,

321
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,280
I hope you find a good person

322
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,000
that really loves you.

323
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,720
Thank you.

324
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,080
I need to go now.

325
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,040
So, what's really happening here?

326
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,680
Uh.

327
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,000
Ask Mr. Somkit!

328
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,520
You're lucky to be surrounded
by good people.

329
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,240
That made me lucky to be with you as well.

330
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,480
At least,

331
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,000
I don't have to marry someone terrible.

332
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,040
You dodged a bullet there.

333
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,120
The wedding's ruined.

334
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,960
Am I still a bride

335
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,880
or am I a widow now?

336
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,440
After all this, you're still joking?

337
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,360
You're very strong for that.

338
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,800
Nothing stressed me out
more than you leaving me.

339
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,000
Should I feel happy, sad,

340
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,440
or guilty for that?

341
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,600
I was just joking.

342
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,720
Too bad.

343
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,080
I don't know when I will get to wear
a bridal dress again.

344
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,440
There is

345
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,440
Here's your favourite.

346
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,160
Thank you.

347
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,600
I'm happy to see you both
now understand each other.

348
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,960
I guess I don't have to do anything
about the copyright infringement?

349
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,560
Well, why would I sue my best friend?

350
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,440
You two surely have become a great pair
once everything's passed.

351
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,320
Of course.
What about the story of you two?

352
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,240
How has it been?

353
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Singh hasn't saved up enough money yet.

354
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,920
But I can prove myself again
as many times as she wants.

355
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,960
I'll never give up if it's you.

356
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,160
We wish you the best.

357
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,440
Yes, we wish you the best.

358
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,680
- One more bite.
- Again?

359
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,280
I know you love it.

360
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,560
One more.

361
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,480
Mom,

362
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,360
can you please lift
the money condition for Singh?

363
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,880
Have you saved up enough money
per our agreement?

364
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,120
Huh?

365
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,920
No.

366
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,040
I still need 700,000 more.

367
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,920
Ms. Tubtim,

368
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,400
I know that my time was up
a long time ago.

369
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,280
I intended to earn enough money
before coming back.

370
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,400
However,

371
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,760
I just want to tell you that ...

372
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
I really want to take care of him.

373
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,880
These past three years,
I only thought about earning money.

374
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,440
I lost track of the three years that I had lost.

375
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,920
The time we weren't together,

376
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,240
I regret that it had to be that way.

377
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,280
I was selfish.

378
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,840
I really want to stay by his side.

379
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,640
Here's the rest of the money you need.

380
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,920
From now on,
I ask that you take care of Thot well.

381
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,000
In fact, I didn't have any disdain against Singh.

382
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
I just want to be sure that ...

383
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,560
you're dedicated to this relationship

384
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,720
and that you can live
in the society that Thot is in.

385
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,880
I didn't think you would just disappear.

386
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,880
Thot and Singh, I'm sorry.

387
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:45,200
I never intended to make you suffer.

388
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,360
Yes, mom.

389
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,360
This money that I gave you

390
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
and the money Singh saved up,

391
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,720
use it to start your lives together.

392
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,040
Thank you, Mom.

393
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,920
Come here, Singh.

394
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,760
Please take care of each other.

395
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,800
Thank you, Mom.

396
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,680
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

397
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,000
Just you accepting me

398
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,280
makes me happy already.

399
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,360
I love you, Mom.

400
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,080
I love you, too.

401
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,880
I remember

402
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:54,040
how I had to grab a lost kid
from this temple twice.

403
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,200
It's unbelievable.
I ran away,

404
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,760
and you knew exactly where I was.

405
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,160
That's because I care.

406
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,920
I've done so many terrible things to you.

407
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,280
Leaving you was the worst.

408
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,960
Would you mind if I ...

409
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,720
want to flirt with you again?

410
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,640
Are you sure it's going to work this time?

411
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,080
I already did it once.

412
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,720
Last time, it was me who approached you first.

413
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,160
I'm pretty confident I'll succeed.

414
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,080
You'll have to try.

415
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,240
Don't be too confident.

416
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,680
Okay, I'll start by ...

417
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,480
giving my writer a good massage.

418
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,120
Hey,

419
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,280
you're just starting,
and you're being handsy already?

420
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,680
No, I'm not.

421
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,360
It's so relaxing.
Don't stop.

422
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,320
I know you like it.

423
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,120
Gen, tell me if you're not wearing
any of these.

424
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,960
I'm going to donate them.

425
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,120
You still ...

426
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,360
keep this?

427
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,440
I wanted to return it to you.

428
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,800
You don't have to.

429
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,360
We're living together now.

430
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,720
Gen,

431
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,760
can I ask you something?

432
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,760
You are being nice to me.

433
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,800
Is it because you feel guilty

434
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,360
or is it because you really love me?

435
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,080
I love you.

436
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,280
I really love you.

437
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,200
I love you.
I always do.

438
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,040
And you?

439
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,200
Doesn't the fact that
I'm here make it clear enough

440
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,520
that I love you?

441
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,240
I always do.

442
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,880
That monkey doll,

443
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,040
I had it fixed earlier.

444
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,520
I also recorded a line into it.

445
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,080
Do you want to know what I said?

446
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,760
Will you marry me?

447
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,840
Will you marry me?

448
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,160
Will you marry me?

449
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,880
The two of us

450
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,080
have been through so much.

451
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,000
For both you and me,

452
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,160
there were times
when we were confused

453
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,120
what relationship were we in.

454
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,520
When you were going to get married,

455
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:00,640
I fully intend to have you as my best friend forever.

456
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,440
Just like that Mate T-shirt.

457
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,440
Now that everything happened,

458
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,800
I figured ...

459
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,200
that being just a mate ...

460
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,160
isn't enough.

461
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,680
What would be?

462
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,000
Open and take a look.

463
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,960
How about a soulmate?

464
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,600
So,

465
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,800
what do you say?

466
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,360
Give me your hand.

467
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Mom gave us 700,000.

468
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,040
What do you think we should do with it?

469
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,080
She gave it to me, though.

470
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,280
Isn't that for taking care of me?

471
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,320
How about we have a trip abroad?

472
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,360
Thot,

473
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,880
we should save this for our future.

474
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,000
Think of it as a compensation
for the three lost years.

475
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,040
So,

476
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,920
how would you like me to compensate you?

477
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,400
Actually, did you know that ...

478
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,640
I don't feel bad at all for not getting married?

479
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,960
Really?

480
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,800
I didn't want to marry a groom,

481
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,240
but rather a bride.

482
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,080
If I look better than you in a bridal dress,

483
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,560
you wouldn't mind?

484
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,640
I wouldn't mind.

485
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,320
It doesn't matter what outfit you're in

486
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,000
or how prettier you are than me.

487
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,520
In the end,

488
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,960
you will always be mine.

489
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,640
Save some sweetness for the rest of us, too!

490
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,840
How was your Japan trip?

491
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,400
We had so much fun, Gen.

492
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,800
Let me just say that right now,

493
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,560
I don't want to stay away
from Singh for even a second.

494
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,360
But you two wanted to see me here.
What is this about?

495
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,520
Aoey and I ...

496
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,760
want Singh to help organize our wedding.

497
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,400
Hey!
Really?

498
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,080
Of course!

499
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,800
It would be my pleasure to help organize
a wedding for you two.

500
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,520
I hope there's no special guest this time.

501
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,120
Of course.
I'll organize it as best as I can.

502
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,120
Let me help, too.

503
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,320
I am so happy.

504
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,360
You two finally got together.

505
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,920
I'm sorry.
We're having a technical problem
with the bank.

506
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,720
It's okay.

507
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,960
Singh, look!

508
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,360
- Someone drew a heart on this note.
- Hey!

509
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,000
That's so cute.

510
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,120
Who drew this?

511
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,840
Singh, are you done?

512
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,560
Sure.

513
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,440
I'll wait outside.

514
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,320
- Let me treat you.
- Where are you going next?

515
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,480
The same old place.

516
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,800
That's where we are!

517
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,760
I told you.
In a formal dress, I look really pretty!

518
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,120
You're so beautiful
my whole world freezes in time.

519
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,000
Will you be jealous
if everyone looks at me?

520
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,800
They can only look.

521
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,040
I can do way more than that.

522
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,200
Tell me if any of you have changed.

523
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,800
I'll take you to shoot a video.

524
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,840
Uh-huh.

525
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,120
You go first.

526
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,760
I'll wait.

527
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,280
I still keep your video from Ten's wedding.

528
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,120
Too bad we don't get to show it.

529
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,320
- Singh.
- Huh?

530
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,960
I have an idea.

531
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,720
This is your wedding souvenir.

532
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,440
- Wow!
- So cute!

533
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,440
It's so cute.
Exactly how I wanted it.

534
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,000
You like it?

535
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,440
I like it, too.

536
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,600
We want this, Singh.

537
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,720
Sure thing.

538
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,520
Now that you've decided,

539
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,800
I'll finalize the design
and order the production immediately.

540
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,600
This looks like you.

541
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,640
Why are you looking at it like that?

542
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,000
Hello, everyone!

543
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,680
I’m Thotsapit Thananitchakul

544
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,360
or Doctor Thot.

545
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,240
I'm your host for this very special wedding
of the two beloved sisters of mine.

546
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:52,360
I'm thankful for everyone's time
and for coming here today.

547
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,280
Without any further ado,

548
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,760
let's meet ...

549
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,400
Genlong and Aoey!

550
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,800
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

551
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,480
They're stunning today.

552
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,360
Thank you.

553
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,840
Now, it's about time
for something you've been waiting for.

554
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,160
We have a surprise for every guest today.

555
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,600
Let's watch a VTR together!

556
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,880
What's in the other
that impresses you the most?"

557
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,440
From when we were young until now,

558
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,600
a friend of mine, Genlong,
is always on my mind.

559
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,400
Though she can be harsh sometimes

560
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,480
or too self-centred sometimes,

561
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,720
after all we've been through together,

562
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,560
something like lice

563
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,760
or me running away to Bangkok,

564
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,600
Gen has always been nice and cute to me.

565
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,520
She even let me stay at her condo.

566
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,440
We lived together for months!

567
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,720
She seems ...

568
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,720
mean, but she's actually so sweet.

569
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,280
She's an inspiration

570
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,000
for a character I wrote about in my novel

571
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,800
that was so successful.

572
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,040
It wouldn't be without her.

573
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,160
I remember a friend named Aoey very well.

574
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,880
I thought ...

575
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,120
she would give me lice, then.

576
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,960
My memory of our childhood is clear as days.

577
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,120
Time passed,

578
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,640
and I never thought she would call.

579
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,280
Hello.

580
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,720
This is Aoey, a friend who had lice

581
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,920
and gave them to you.

582
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,880
Today,

583
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,880
I learned that

584
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,400
she's about to start a new life.

585
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,920
I hope you're happy
with the decisions you make.

586
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,640
Even though

587
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,760
I can only look at you from the sideline,

588
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,960
I ...

589
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,400
really want you to be happy.

590
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,640
I love you.

591
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,280
And that's how adorable my two sisters are.

592
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,480
Right now, it seems that
Gen has something to tell Aoey.

593
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,000
Let's give her a mic.

594
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,400
Thank you.

595
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,760
That video you just saw

596
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,440
was ...

597
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,040
recorded when I was to become Aoey's bridesmaid.

598
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,640
I intended to show it to you all today

599
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,520
to emphasize that,

600
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,160
no matter what happens,

601
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,360
I will always want Aoey to be happy

602
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,360
no matter who I am to her.

603
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,320
But as an extra, I want to become
someone to share a life with her.

604
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,760
Please?

605
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,160
These rings

606
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,920
represent my promise

607
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,720
that I will be with you forever.

608
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,720
I truly thank everyone

609
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,760
for coming to our wedding today.

610
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,800
And thank you, Aoey,

611
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,640
for loving someone mean like me.

612
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,480
They're blushing.

613
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,520
You are the only one

614
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,360
that instils confidence within me.

615
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,560
Without you,

616
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,040
there wouldn't be me today.

617
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,320
For me,

618
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,720
you are my angel.

619
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,440
Whoo!

620
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,080
How lovely!

621
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:11,320
And that's what they've always wanted
to tell each other.

622
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,480
For now,

623
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,480
bring me some champagne, please.

624
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:24,720
Let's have a toast to celebrate
our pair of newlyweds.

625
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,760
- Everyone, cheers!
- Cheers!

626
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,440
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

627
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,200
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

628
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,480
Let's drink.

629
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,000
Whoo!

630
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,960
I built a cage to trap my love,

631
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,200
so that it doesn't stray
from the image of love I set for myself.

632
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,560
I waited and hoped that such love would flourish.

633
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,760
In the end, it didn't.

634
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,840
That cage only caused my heart pain.

635
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,800
When I left that cage,

636
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,840
let my heart guide me,

637
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,440
and set my idea of love free,

638
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,080
I discovered what love really is.

639
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,480
And it's now time all the ladies
have been waiting for.

640
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,840
We're tossing a bouquet.
Please come on up!

641
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,920
Okay, move closer!

642
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Be ready to become the next bride!

643
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,840
Genlong and Aoey, if you're ready,

644
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,120
throw it!

645
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,480
Two and three!

646
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,800
Whoo!

647
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,040
And our young man
who's about to not be single anymore

648
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,880
is Great!

649
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,720
Last time we came here,

650
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,960
we found a mistletoe.

651
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,480
Someone probably deliberately put it there.

652
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,040
Maybe they wanted to forward love
to the next couple here.

653
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,960
Just like us?

654
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,680
Aoey,

655
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,280
have you heard about
that one mistletoe tradition?

656
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,840
Of course.

657
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,600
I'm a writer;
I have obviously read about it.

658
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,680
They said that,

659
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:31,000
a couple that kissed under the mistletoe

660
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,120
will have their love last forever.

661
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,800
So...

662
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:02,680
[The end]
