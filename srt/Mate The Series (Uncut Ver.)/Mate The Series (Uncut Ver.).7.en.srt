1
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,040
- Phon, Phon.
- Huh?

2
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,920
Heard anything about Chit?

3
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,600
It's been weeks!
He hasn't come back?

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,200
If he has, I wouldn't be asking you!

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,720
If he isn't at his usual gambling den,

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,320
he's probably gambling somewhere else.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,200
You're sure he didn't upset someone?

8
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,640
Working on a new novel?

9
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,400
Yeah.

10
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,080
I just got this idea last night.

11
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,960
I'm trying to write a Yuri novel.

12
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,040
Yuri?
What is that?

13
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,720
It's girls' love.

14
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,120
I used you as a reference
for my main character.

15
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,920
Really?

16
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,760
Can I take a look?

17
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,320
A girl with beautiful eyes,

18
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
who's very gorgeous,

19
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,440
rich, smart,

20
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,320
authoritative, foul-mouthed,

21
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,720
headstrong,

22
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,560
and self-centred.

23
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,480
Anyone's not to displease her.

24
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,920
What do you think?
Isn't she interesting?

25
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,520
Are you trying to tell me something?

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,160
Readers love a main character like that.

27
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,600
A foul-mouthed yet kind character.

28
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,920
Without you,

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,400
I wouldn't have been able to write this.

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,000
It's not because of me.

31
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,680
I didn't do anything.

32
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,400
Gen, did you know this novel has
more favourites and views than the last one?

33
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,560
If it's not you, who is it then?

34
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,040
It's because of ...

35
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,800
a good writer.

36
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,960
It's you.

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,000
I love you.

38
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,880
Ever since I have you,
life has been so good.

39
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,680
Not picking it up?

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,960
It's a strange number.

41
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,920
What if it's important?

42
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,520
No one and nothing are more important to me

43
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
than you.

44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,120
You are my everything.

45
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,600
I don’t think you deserve Thot.

46
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,000
What should I do

47
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,920
to be accepted?

48
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,120
How about this?
I’ll give you a million baht.

49
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,760
If, within three years,

50
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,800
you can turn it into five million,

51
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,280
I’ll accept your dedication.

52
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,040
I see.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,120
But you don’t need to give me a million.

54
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,640
I’ll earn it all myself.

55
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,560
Within three years,

56
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,000
I’ll return with five million.

57
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,080
This is Aoey. Does 11 a.m. tomorrow work for you?
I'll send you the location.

58
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,920
Sure.

59
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,720
Hello, Mrs. Sali.

60
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,720
Remember me?
Genlong.

61
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,440
Genlong.

62
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,000
Are you Aoey's childhood friend?

63
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,080
Yes.

64
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,280
What a coincidence.

65
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm meeting Aoey here today, too.

66
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,560
If you're waiting for her,

67
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,600
don't.

68
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm the one that brought you out here.

69
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,640
What?

70
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,520
Where's Aoey?

71
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,640
It seems that she wants nothing to do
with you.

72
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,840
That's why I'm here instead.

73
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,560
Does this mean Aoey's living with you?

74
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,000
That's great.

75
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,560
I need your help.

76
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,760
What is it?

77
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,680
My husband has been missing for days.

78
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,520
I also remember that your dad
is very well-known.

79
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,120
I'd like to ask you to ask your dad

80
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,080
to help find my husband.

81
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,200
This is for Aoey.

82
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,760
Do you think her wanting to meet Aoey
has anything to do with Anuchit?

83
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,160
It's possible.

84
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,440
Do you want me to do the talking?

85
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,040
I'll do it.

86
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,920
I'm worried about her.

87
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,680
Maybe she just wants to find Aoey
after a long time.

88
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,280
A missing person?

89
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,160
Why didn't you report to the police?

90
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,920
I don't want this to go out of hand,

91
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,840
and I must admit that my husband

92
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,960
isn't really a good person
for a lot of people.

93
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,120
Despite that, he takes good care of me
and our family.

94
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
Okay.

95
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,720
And your missing daughter?

96
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
Are you going to find her?

97
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,880
That's not the point!

98
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,440
Do you think your dad can help me
find my husband?

99
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,440
You don't care about your kid,

100
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,760
only your husband.
Wow.

101
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,120
I beg your pardon.

102
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,080
If you don't know anything, just shut it.

103
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,920
You're the one who knows nothing.

104
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,120
Maybe you do; you just don't care.

105
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Hey!
Where are you going?

106
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,840
We need to talk!

107
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,400
Thank you.

108
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,360
Just leave it here.

109
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,000
Do you want me to feed you?

110
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,360
But ...

111
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,920
I'll use my mouth.

112
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,040
Work's still not done.

113
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,400
When it's done,

114
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
just go wild.

115
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
Gen.

116
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,280
The favourites count is going up a lot.

117
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm planning to save a chunk of money

118
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,520
to buy a house for us in the future.

119
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,920
Where would it be?

120
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,880
I want to live in an upcountry province.

121
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,440
I love the vibe.
The weather's good.

122
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,400
Nature, too.

123
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,240
When you buy a house,

124
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,400
will you bring in your mom?

125
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,040
Aw,

126
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360
I was in such a good mood.

127
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,600
Please don't mention her
to kill my mood again.

128
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay, I won't say it.

129
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,400
Why don't you seem happy

130
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,080
about me saving for our future house?

131
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,080
I do.

132
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,560
I just ...

133
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Just what?

134
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,040
I just think that if there's a man
that loves and takes care of you,

135
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,320
No, that day will never come.

136
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,720
If it's not you,

137
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,600
I'm not taking anyone else.

138
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,800
But ...

139
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,400
you're not coming for lunch
at my home tomorrow?

140
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,240
I really can't.

141
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,880
Maybe next time.

142
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,240
Whoa!

143
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,800
You must be tired.

144
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,360
Something's on your mouth.

145
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,720
Let me wipe it off.

146
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,560
Milky kiss.

147
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,680
You like it?

148
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,600
Try it for yourself.

149
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,120
It tastes nice.

150
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,640
Done with your work?

151
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,960
Gen, not yet!

152
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,120
Close the windows!

153
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,560
- Looking good, huh?
- Of course!

154
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,160
Here's stir-fried vegetables.
Eat more vegetables.

155
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,080
Looks so good.

156
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,280
Of course.

157
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,480
Shrimps.

158
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,280
I bought you a cake.

159
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,440
I'll leave it here.

160
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,520
Is saying sorry too hard for you?

161
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,440
I am sorry

162
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,800
for keeping things secret and upsetting you.

163
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,760
Peel them for me, too.

164
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,800
You're picky.

165
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,520
- Quickly!
- Gen.

166
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,960
Why didn't you invite Aoey over?

167
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,200
I did, but she's busy.

168
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,400
Good thing she didn't come.

169
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,680
- Why?
- I'd lose my appetite.

170
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,120
- Because you're heartbroken.
- Because you stole her.

171
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,800
What are you joking about?

172
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:36,080
It seems you are having a great conversation!

173
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,960
About you.

174
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,640
What will you do once you graduate?

175
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,520
I want to open a café with a gallery.

176
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,440
Wow.
If it floats your boat.

177
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,080
As for my business,

178
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,840
Great will run it for me.

179
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,600
Come on, Dad.

180
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,600
You can have it all to yourself.

181
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,640
I haven't even lived my life enough!

182
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,360
Live your university life as much as you want

183
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,120
because when you graduate,
you're going to help your dad.

184
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,440
I can't hear you.
Nope, nope.

185
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,920
Nope.

186
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,920
Honey, our family last had a meal together
a long time ago.

187
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,680
How about taking a photo?

188
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,320
A selfie, you mean?

189
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,000
- I'll do it.
- Let's do it!

190
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,200
Let's go.

191
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,840
- One,
- Honey, come closer.

192
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,600
- Yes.
- two, three.

193
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,840
- Smile!
- Smile!

194
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,240
At 11:30 p.m. last night,

195
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,520
police raided an illegal ship.

196
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,600
There are reports of several dead bodies
in the ship's cargo.

197
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,640
Sombat, a ship worker,

198
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,960
confessed to the destruction of evidence
by throwing the bodies into the water.

199
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,440
- Isn't that Wut's ship?
- Honey.

200
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,880
The one that called you?

201
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
He didn't.

202
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,240
With people dead,
the police will be on alert.

203
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,360
Here's the list of the deceased.

204
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,640
Anuthit Chitglai.

205
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Ekkachai Songsoong.

206
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Samad Kasor.

207
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,800
I need to go now.
It's urgent.

208
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,560
Gen, why don't you finish this meal first?

209
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,600
It's really urgent.

210
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,400
Sure.
Sa!

211
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,200
- Please pack some food for Gen.
- Yes.

212
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,600
Sa, please take this to my car.

213
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,160
Yes.

214
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,640
Somkit

215
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,120
This is bad.

216
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,360
Gen.

217
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Is everything okay?

218
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,800
Huh?

219
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
No.

220
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,040
I just miss you.

221
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,720
We had been away for just two hours.

222
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,800
My mom gave me lots of food.
Are you hungry?

223
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,960
If you don't want to say it, it's okay.

224
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,040
No matter what happens to you,

225
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,360
I'll always be here for you.

226
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,480
I'm hungry!
Let's take a look

227
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,800
what your mom has for us.

228
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,520
Let's go.

229
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,120
Let's see!
Take me there.

230
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,080
Whoa!
Grilled shrimps.

231
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,080
They're so big.
Can we finish these?

232
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,440
The number you called cannot be reached.

233
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,520
- Oh, you're leaving?
- Yes.

234
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,840
Here are the keys.

235
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,080
- I wish you luck.
- Thank you, Jom.

236
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,520
- Jom, hi.
- Hi, Doctor.

237
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,600
- So,
- Did Singh forget something?

238
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,040
Come again?

239
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,040
Well, he moved out.

240
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
He just left.

241
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,920
I thought he headed out with you.

242
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,640
Thank you.

243
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,480
Gus, did you see Singh?

244
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,120
I saw him doing paperwork on his internship.

245
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Where will he do his internship?

246
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,440
I don't know.

247
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,240
- Thank you.
- Sure.

248
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,760
Singh?
Where are you?

249
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,080
I've been looking everywhere.

250
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,880
I know.

251
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,640
You don't need to find me anymore.

252
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,320
What?

253
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,040
Where are you going?

254
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,800
This will be the last contact

255
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,040
between us.

256
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,360
Singh, where are you?

257
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,760
I found you.

258
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,360
Wait for me there.

259
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,720
I won't let it end like this.

260
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,520
Singh!

261
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,000
Singh?

262
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,280
Sorry.

263
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,880
This will be the last contact

264
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,000
between us.

265
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,240
What happened, Singh?

266
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,520
- Stop!
- Stop following me!

267
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,000
Stop!

268
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,040
Hey!
Where are you going?

269
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,520
We need to talk!

270
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,200
My husband had no enemies.

271
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,040
Looking at the footage,

272
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,880
I think that this person

273
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,440
probably assaulted him.

274
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,520
Have you seen this individual?

275
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,480
I have.

276
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,120
He's probably with my old student.

277
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
Where did you see him?

278
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,360
And what's the name of your student?

279
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,960
Genlong.

280
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,480
Genlong Thanasubanan.

281
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,560
Here.

282
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,760
Thank you.

283
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,560
- This is big news.
- Why hasn't she come out yet?

284
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,280
- She's coming out!
- There she is!

285
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,120
We heard that you're now suspecting someone.

286
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,160
Yes, and I'm confident about it, too.

287
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,800
Can you tell us who it is?

288
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,160
- I can only say that ...
- Will Gen be alright?

289
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,640
Yeah.

290
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,800
of the top importing and exporting firms
in Thailand.

291
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,360
That made it very clear, Jitsai.

292
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,640
- Yes.
- This footage was sent to us by a good citizen.

293
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,280
Can our team please bring it up?

294
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,680
It's the man in black there.

295
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,640
Please help us check if it's the same person
as in the footage.

296
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,200
If it is, this will shake the whole industry.

297
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,480
Somkit, follow me.

298
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,040
Yes.

299
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,920
What is my mom doing there?

300
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,280
Is there anything else?

301
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,000
Aoey,

302
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,640
Anuchit is dead.

303
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,040
What happened?

304
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,040
Someone found his body in an illegal ship.

305
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,000
It was on the news yesterday.

306
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,560
- Yes, Uncle Somkit?
- Miss Gen,

307
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,720
Your father wants to see you.

308
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,560
Of course.
I'll rush there.

309
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,960
Aoey,

310
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,400
I'll be back soon.

311
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,000
What's all this?

312
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,480
Please don't scold her, Boss.
It's all on me.

313
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,160
I'm talking to my kid.

314
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,560
I need to know everything about this.

315
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,120
- Gen told Uncle Somkit to ...
- These are leaked photos and videos of Aoey.

316
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,320
Bastard.

317
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,720
Anuchit: I'll meet you in Bangkok.
If I don't see you, I'll leak the photos.

318
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,160
Did you send him to that ship?

319
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,920
No, Boss.

320
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
However,

321
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,240
Anything to say about the 500,000 you owe?

322
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,360
- When will you pay us back?
- Please calm down.

323
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,040
- I don't have money; I need time.
- Hey!

324
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,760
You're not getting any time.

325
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,480
I want it now!

326
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,360
Please.
I don't have money.

327
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,760
- I need time.
- No money, huh?

328
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,640
Doesn't matter.
You'll pay us back somehow!

329
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,760
Hey.

330
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,880
Get up!

331
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,320
Where will you take me?

332
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,920
Hey!

333
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,080
- Where will you take me!

334
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,360
Come here.

335
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,520
Take him.

336
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,200
If he hasn't worked until his debt
is paid off,

337
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,440
- don't ever let him get out of it.
- Don't forget our agreement.

338
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,440
Yeah.

339
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,400
Uncle Somkit: It's done.

340
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,720
It doesn't have anything to do with us.

341
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Why can't we just tell the police?

342
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,480
It's not that easy.

343
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,400
If Wut wants it to be your fault, it is.

344
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,280
Wut is the only one I don't want anything
to do with.

345
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,800
And we'll have to take it?

346
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,880
But he wants me to be the scapegoat.

347
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,320
It is my incompetence, Boss.

348
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
I'll hand myself to the police.

349
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,200
You think I'll let you do that?

350
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,320
I won't let you do that, too.

351
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,920
Had I not asked you to do it,

352
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,640
this wouldn't happen.

353
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,200
What's done is done.

354
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,240
Right now, we need to stop that teacher
from going to the press.

355
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,000
I will deal with all this.

356
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,600
If you need help, come to me.

357
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:19,200
[Incoming call: Wut]

358
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,640
Yes, Boss.

359
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,120
I'm here for your answer!

360
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,880
I can't do what you asked.

361
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,280
You have to.

362
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,280
(A consolation gift from Dad)

363
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,280
- Hi.
- Dad,

364
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,600
Did you get me a surprise gift?

365
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,960
I found a gift in my car.

366
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,720
Gen, don't open it!

367
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,560
Ah!

368
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,520
Gen?
Gen?

369
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,880
I'm fine.
Someone played a prank.

370
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,080
There's a card, too.

371
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,680
What does it say?

372
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,880
This is just a warning.
The next one won't be so nice.

373
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,800
Dad, I see someone looking very suspicious.

374
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,400
Gen,

375
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
- rush home quickly!
- Yes.

376
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,600
Great, you received it, too?

377
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,920
Yes.

378
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,960
- Hi, Tubtim.
- Ning.

379
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,880
See this news.
I sent you a link.

380
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,600
Yes.
Honey, check the news.

381
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,600
Tubtim sent us a link.

382
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,360
Give us a second.

383
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,040
The police have coordinated with
the Anti-Money Laundering Office

384
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,960
to trace the movement of funds
of Bawornchai.

385
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,680
Several illegal businesses and
money laundering schemes were discovered.

386
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,080
If there's anything I can help, call me.

387
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,400
Thank you so much.

388
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,360
You're running illegal businesses?

389
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,040
We can talk about that later.

390
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,320
He has a lot on him right now.

391
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,280
Grab everything necessary.

392
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
We’ll need to go to Macao soon.

393
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,920
Is it that bad?

394
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,680
And if not necessary,

395
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,360
don't go outside.

396
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,640
If you do, have Somkit go with you.

397
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,160
The two of you go to your room now.

398
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,520
Big Sister!

399
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,080
Big Sister!

400
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,320
- Can you break up with Aoey?
- What does she have to do with this?

401
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,800
How does she not?

402
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,080
Ever since she came,
it's been trouble after trouble.

403
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
Well, whose fault was it?

404
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,120
She doesn't have to care
while we have to clean everything up.

405
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,920
Since when did she become
such a horrible person?

406
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,240
Great, Aoey has nothing to do with this.

407
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,840
It's all because of me.

408
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,840
Our family is in shambles.

409
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,720
Open your eyes,

410
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,080
- not your legs!
- Great!

411
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,480
Mark my words!

412
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,560
Our family is screwed because of her!

413
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,680
Is everything alright?

414
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,320
Nothing.

415
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,880
Gen.

416
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,800
What?
You don't like it when I hug you?

417
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,200
I don't know what's going on,

418
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,920
but I'm always here for you.

419
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,120
Don't overthink.

420
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,040
I'll help you relax tonight.

421
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,760
(Mom: Gen, withdraw money from
all your accounts and prepare your passports.)

422
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,280
Mark my words!

423
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,360
Our family is screwed because of her!

424
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,640
The food here is great.

425
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,600
You'll like it.

426
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,960
I love anywhere you take me to.

427
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,440
But coming here,

428
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,880
you aren't going to break up
like they do in a movie?

429
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,480
You watched too many movies.

430
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,080
Just kidding.

431
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,560
You seem strangely stressed lately.

432
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,560
How?

433
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,720
How can I not see it?

434
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,920
I live with you.

435
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,600
I obviously noticed.

436
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,560
It's nothing.
You're overthinking it.

437
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,120
Let's go.

438
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,440
Yes, come in.

439
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,760
Aoey, don't go.

440
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,960
Please.

441
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,320
Gen.

442
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,440
Why did you do this?

443
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,360
Please stay and talk.

444
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,720
I'll be by your side.

445
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,520
The reason you took her phone

446
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,640
was because you didn’t want
the photos to be leaked.

447
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,760
Do you have anything to do
with that illegal fishing ship?

448
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,040
I told you the truth.

449
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,960
We have nothing to do with that.

450
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,600
Though, Wut wants our family
to be the scapegoat.

451
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,240
I'll take what you said as the truth.

452
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,520
If I wanted to deal with Anuchit,

453
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,560
why would I throw him into
someone else's ship like that?

454
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,000
I ask that you stop telling this the press

455
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,640
and let my dad deal with this.

456
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,840
Can you do that?

457
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,680
Can I see Aoey before I decide?

458
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,880
What do you want?

459
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,040
Do you know that your father is dead?

460
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,960
Why didn't you even try to contact me

461
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,640
or trying to find out what happened?

462
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,600
He's not my father.

463
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,480
Do you even know how terrible he is?

464
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,080
I thought you were seducing him.

465
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,160
I never did that!

466
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,520
She doesn't like being touched.

467
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,960
What your husband did

468
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
scarred her.

469
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,720
He did take good care of me.
I don’t think he could hurt anyone.

470
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,880
She's this way

471
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,320
probably because of something else?

472
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,600
- He's dead. When will you quit obsessing with him?
- Hey!

473
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,640
Watch your mouth.
Have some respect.

474
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,080
Gen.

475
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,160
I don't want to be here anymore.

476
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,600
Can you get me out of here?
Please.

477
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,320
Stop, Genlong.

478
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,840
What about what we discussed?

479
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,800
I can't have her return home with you.

480
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,160
Fine.

481
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,240
Then, I won't withdraw my case.

482
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,000
If you insist on hurting someone innocent,

483
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,600
be my guest.

484
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,720
Gen.

485
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,440
Why did you do this?

486
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,480
Why brought her here?

487
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,400
This has something to do with her
being on the news, does it?

488
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,360
Yes.

489
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:12,280
So, my family has to take the fall
of what happened.

490
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,880
I'm sorry

491
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,480
for troubling everyone.

492
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,280
It’s never your fault.

493
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,560
Listen.

494
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,800
You’re the victim.

495
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,560
It’s not your fault.

496
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,240
The person at fault is me,

497
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,040
who didn’t think it through.

498
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,360
That’s why you wanted me to go back
to my mom?

499
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,560
It’s the only way I can protect you.

500
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,960
No, I won’t go.

501
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,000
I want to be with you.

502
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,840
This is more serious than you think it is.

503
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,560
Staying with me

504
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,720
will only get you in trouble.

505
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,200
I don’t want you to get pulled into this.

506
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,760
How am I not a part of this?

507
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,280
No means no.

508
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,600
Right now,

509
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,360
we need to find another way out.

510
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,240
Gen,

511
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,240
can you please don't push me away
like that again?

512
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,920
Do you know,

513
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,640
if something happens to you,

514
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,440
what would happen to me?

515
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,080
I've told you before.

516
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,320
No matter what happens to me,

517
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,200
it's okay.

518
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,800
Why are you so stubborn?

519
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,840
I just want to take care of you.

520
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,600
Even if I can't do as much as your family does,

521
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,200
I'll do my best.

522
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,400
Give me a chance.

523
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,720
I understand how you feel.

524
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,240
Can you promise to never leave me?

525
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,080
I promise.

526
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,520
Hey, Aoey.

527
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,000
When did you start to like me?

528
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,120
A long time ago.

529
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,560
But when I wanted to flirt with you

530
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,640
was when we met at the mall.

531
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,040
When we reunited.

532
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,600
You were so beautiful.

533
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,000
It juts ...

534
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,760
My whole world stopped.

535
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,400
- You're overreacting.
- I meant it!

536
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,440
My heart told me you need to be mine.

537
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,160
I won't lose you to anyone.

538
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,720
And I just approached you.

539
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,520
Wait,

540
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,040
you said you've liked me for a long time.

541
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,160
Didn't we just meet not long ago?

542
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,720
Don't tell me this goes far, far back.

543
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,160
I'm thirsty.

544
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,240
I'm hot.

545
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,400
Faster!

546
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,680
Gen, I want to take care of you.

547
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,840
Can I take care of you?

548
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,800
Ew, you're not my housemaid.

549
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,560
Not even my family.

550
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,040
So, you will let me if I'm yours?

551
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:44,720
For a pretty girl like me, aside from
my mom, dad, and Uncle Somkit,

552
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,040
- the person who can take care of me has to be ...
- Who?

553
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,800
my loved one!

554
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,040
When we grow up,
I'll ask you to be mine!

555
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,440
I want to be with you.

556
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,240
If you can make me love you,

557
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,280
I'll let you take care of me forever.

558
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,840
- Promise?
- Promise.

559
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,720
Gen.

560
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,920
Huh?

561
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,120
Don't ever look at anyone else
like this again.

562
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,640
You're mine only.

563
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,840
Of course, my kitty.

564
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,040
This monkey will always be
by the kitty's side.

565
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,840
You're so lovely.

566
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,040
And what about loving me?

567
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,280
I love you the most!

568
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,240
My little monkey.

569
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,160
Dad, how are you?

570
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,080
I bought you your favourite
Hainanese chicken rice.

571
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,560
I'll leave this to the nurse.

572
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,120
So,

573
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,400
you get some rest.
I'll visit you again tomorrow.

574
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,800
Oh, are you not visiting the patient?

575
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,920
We actually just left.

576
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:54,960
We actually just left.

577
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,320
It seems that he's still angry at me.

578
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,960
Angry?

579
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,480
I don't think so.

580
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,640
Huh?

581
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,560
From what I've seen ...

582
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,560
Here's medication before your meal.

583
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,400
My daughter has a girlfriend, too.

584
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:35,640
I used to think it was because of
a sin she had committed.

585
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,520
Now, I think it is a blessing

586
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,200
for her to have someone loving her
and taking care of her.

587
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,880
I'm a girl, and I want a girlfriend like this!

588
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,640
Ah! I love you both!

589
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,600
This couple is adorable.

590
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,520
Doctor Mean takes really good care of
and loves Fai a lot.

591
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,400
Yes, she's my daughter.

592
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,960
Really?

593
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,200
I'm their fan.

594
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,840
Seniors are tight-lipped like that,

595
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,000
but I can confirm that I see him
watching your videos very often.

596
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,880
Can you please prepare this for him?

597
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,320
Of course.

598
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,440
Thank you.

599
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,400
See?
He's not mad at you.
