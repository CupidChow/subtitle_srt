1
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,840
Guys, do you know what’s important
in keeping a good relationship?

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,120
What is it?

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,840
It’s reconciliation.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,840
That’s right.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,360
Reconciling is signalling that we want to stop fighting.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,000
The person who initiates it
needs a lot of effort

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,280
and a lot of willpower.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,560
That’s right.
It is to show the other
that we still love

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,040
and care about them.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,600
If you’re angry
at your significant other,

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,040
be the one to take action
if you two are still in love.

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,640
I thought you’d understand me.

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,440
I thought you’d see how much
I’ve done for you.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,480
I did see it.

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,200
You did it to have a place to stay.

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,080
I’m moving out.

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,320
No.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,720
You stay;

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,280
I’ll return home.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,280
Think of it as support for a friend.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,920
You might think you’re weak
in initiating the reconciliation.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,320
- However ...
- Big Sister!

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,080
Aoey is still waiting for you!

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,720
Tell her to go home!

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,120
Aoey.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,560
I brought you this mosquito coil.

27
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,880
There are lots of mosquitos here.

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,880
Let me spray this, too.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,600
Give me your arm.

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,000
Let me help.

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,240
That arm, too.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
And your legs.

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,800
My legs.

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,560
Thank you, Great.

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,280
- Aoey.
- Hm?

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,520
If not because of me,

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,520
you two won’t be so angry
at each other like this.

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,720
I’m so sorry.

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,680
Aoey, I’m really sorry.

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,920
Stop apologizing.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,400
I’m not mad about you anymore.

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,200
Seriously?

43
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,040
Yeah.

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,240
You are not?

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,320
Yeah.

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,120
I think you should wait inside.

47
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,560
There’s a bunch of mosquitos here.

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,160
Like I said,

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,320
if I wait inside,

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,360
Gen won’t see my dedication.

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,040
Sure.

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,080
Great, you should go inside.

53
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,560
There are mosquitos out here.

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,520
- Aoey, but ...
- If Gen sees you here,

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,680
that would worsen this.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
Please?

57
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,920
Please work with me.

58
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,160
Okay, fine.

59
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,120
- I’ll wait over there.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,840
If you need something, call me.
Okay?

61
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,440
Okay?

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,000
- And stand close to the coil. Mosquitos are everywhere.
- Sure.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,240
- I’ll stay close.
- Okay.

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,800
- Okay, I’ll wait here.
- Yeah.

65
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,280
Thank you.

66
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,680
Big Sister!

67
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,720
Please!

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,760
Come out and talk to Aoey.

69
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,600
Please!

70
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,240
Make this quick

71
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,800
and just go to the condo.

72
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,440
I want to say sorry.

73
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,600
For what?

74
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,720
Aoey,

75
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,920
can I talk to you for a second?

76
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,080
I’m really sorry
for causing a scene like that.

77
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,040
I regret doing that.

78
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,840
You can think of it however you want,

79
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,600
but I’m truly sorry.

80
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,360
I’m over it now.

81
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,800
Did you mean it?

82
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,480
Did you really mean it?

83
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,600
And ...

84
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,960
how did you know I was there?

85
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,560
Did Gen call and tell you?

86
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,040
No!

87
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,640
I was just saying goodbye to my friends
and walked past that restaurant.

88
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,200
I saw you in there.

89
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,400
I didn’t even know
Gen was there, too.

90
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,120
Why did you ask?

91
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I just blamed Gen on this.

92
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,200
I thought she wanted to ruin my day.

93
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,960
She will never do that.

94
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,920
She only cares about you.

95
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,640
During the orientation,
she went to see you every day.

96
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Gen did that?

97
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Yeah, Gen did that.

98
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,240
She even asked lots of people
to look after you.

99
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,760
Most importantly, she paid in pizzas.

100
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,840
Great,

101
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,240
can you please do me a favour?

102
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,560
I just want to say sorry
for mistaking you.

103
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,840
But I won’t be sorry

104
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,400
for having a detective
investigate your stepfather.

105
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,040
Yeah, I understand.

106
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,600
Now that I think about it,

107
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,520
it’s my fault

108
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,760
for never telling you about it.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,400
And you did it

110
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,840
because you care about me.

111
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,800
Wait, so you’re not angry at all?

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,080
Yeah, I understand you.

113
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,360
I just wanted you to hear it from me.

114
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,800
Someone like you?

115
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Can I even believe anything you say?

116
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
I’m just afraid that,

117
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,120
if you know the truth,

118
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,960
you’ll hate me.

119
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,120
Aoey,

120
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,280
I never hate you.

121
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,640
But ...

122
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,680
I said lots of bad things

123
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,320
and did lots of bad things to you.

124
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,240
And you’re not angry at me?

125
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,560
No.

126
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,880
I’m not mad at you at all.

127
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,000
I understand you.

128
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,080
Because of love,
you can never do wrong,

129
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,160
and I’ll always forgive you.

130
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,120
Aoey, isn’t this ...

131
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,160
too close?

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,240
I’m not even that close,

133
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,560
and you’re this cute already.

134
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,560
And you insist that you don’t like me?

135
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,320
No, I just ...

136
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,760
took a warm shower,
and it’s hot out here.

137
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,760
I love you.

138
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,720
I really want to eat you up.

139
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,960
When will you realize

140
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,520
that I can’t resist loving you anymore?

141
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,040
Your heart’s beating heavily.

142
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,560
Have you realized it?

143
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,040
Fine.

144
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,600
Fight it however you want.

145
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,880
I’ll make you accept

146
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,560
that you love me.

147
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,840
From now on,

148
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,360
prepare your heart and soul

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,840
because I ...

150
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,880
won’t hold back anymore.

151
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,640
Hey!

152
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,320
You ...

153
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,840
should go home.

154
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,560
I’m going to bed!

155
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Aoey!

156
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,480
Why did you come here so early?

157
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
She didn’t come here early;

158
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,960
she spent the previous night here.

159
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,360
Why didn’t anyone tell me?

160
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,920
Why haven’t you introduced me
to such a cute friend like this?

161
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,960
Don’t you remember Aoey?

162
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,760
She’s a friend from Korat.

163
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,560
Oh.

164
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,920
Aoey from Korat.

165
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,240
I remember you now.

166
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,360
When we moved,

167
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,320
you cried your eyes out
because you missed her so badly.

168
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,000
You girls wait for me here.

169
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,080
I’ll be in the kitchen.

170
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,520
- Of course.
- Make yourself at home.

171
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,120
Here.

172
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,920
My heart for you.

173
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,480
Uh, I’m so hungry!

174
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,680
Aoey?
You’re here?

175
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,640
Hello.

176
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,520
Does this mean you two
are on good terms now?

177
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,160
Hey.

178
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,960
- Aoey drew this for you.
- Oh.

179
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,440
Aw, thank you, Aoey.

180
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,400
What a beautiful work.

181
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
I’ll keep this heart of yours
safe and sound.

182
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,840
Great!

183
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,600
Come help me in the kitchen!

184
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,120
I’ll need to go now.
See you in a bit.

185
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,240
I’m taking your heart with me, too.

186
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,240
Yes, Mom!

187
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,640
No matter how much you reject me,

188
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,120
my heart

189
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,880
is always for you.

190
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,680
Tada!

191
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,800
Whoa.

192
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,080
What’s all this?

193
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,200
Welcome back, Gen.

194
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,880
You’re acting like
I’ve been away for years.

195
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,480
You like cats?

196
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,240
Yeah.

197
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,720
Why?

198
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,720
They’re cute and clingy, too.

199
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,120
I used to have one,

200
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,200
but it crossed the rainbow bridge long ago.

201
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,720
Then, shouldn’t you like me, too?

202
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,160
Why?

203
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,840
Because I’m cute like a cat.

204
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,080
Meow.

205
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,160
And I’m clingy like a cat.

206
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,080
Meow.

207
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,600
if you’re a cat,

208
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,800
what am I?

209
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,680
A little monkey!

210
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,440
Why am I a monkey?

211
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,680
Because your eyes are as big
as a monkey’s.

212
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,840
You’re as naughty as one, too.

213
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,000
That’s not true.

214
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,400
It is.

215
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,400
My little monkey!

216
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,960
I am not.

217
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,200
Or do you want to be a cat?

218
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,560
- Meow.
- You can have that.

219
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,280
And after you’re back on good terms,

220
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,560
what’s the next most important thing?

221
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,480
It’s to have a heart-to-heart talk.

222
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,280
Many couples that experience
the same problems again and again,

223
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,880
causing them to always be reconciling,

224
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,760
will often find the same problem
returning times and times again.

225
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,440
This is because they never have
a heart-to-heart conversation to find out the true culprit.

226
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,800
That’s right.

227
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,800
The right way to approach this

228
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,400
is to find the cause of it.

229
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,040
Turn to each other,
have a heart-to-heart conversation,

230
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,240
and slowly fine-tune yourself
for each other.

231
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,360
This will make you
understand the other more.

232
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,520
- This way, you don’t have to fight over the same problems.
- What are you up to?

233
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,160
Why aren’t you sleeping yet?

234
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,320
- I’m about to.
- No matter what the fortune teller says,

235
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,640
A heart-to-heart conversation
will always be a better option.

236
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,640
Morning, Gen!

237
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
What are you up to?

238
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,320
Hello?

239
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,880
Where are you?

240
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,520
You think you can escape from me?

241
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,640
- If you don’t meet me,
- Don’t call me again!

242
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,680
- I’ll release your photos!
- Aoey?

243
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,200
- And the whole world will shame you!
- What’s wrong?

244
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,520
Aoey!

245
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,680
Don’t touch me!

246
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
Aoey, it’s me.

247
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,000
Calm down.

248
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
Calm down.

249
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,800
Aoey!

250
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,440
Aoey, tell me what’s going on.

251
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
You’re bleeding.

252
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,880
Calm down.

253
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,680
Singh, what are you doing today?

254
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,480
Please answer me.

255
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,080
Why didn’t you answer my call?
Are you busy?

256
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,120
It’s done.

257
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,000
Aoey, about that.

258
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,120
Aoey?

259
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,840
I need a shower.

260
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,400
Singh.

261
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,160
Yes?

262
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,200
I called you many times.
Why didn’t you pick up?

263
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,600
Well,

264
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,080
I’ve been very busy lately.

265
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,600
I haven’t touched my phone.

266
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,080
Singh,

267
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,280
be honest.

268
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,640
What’s going on?

269
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,600
Well,

270
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,400
I’m seeing someone else.

271
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,360
What are you talking about?

272
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,480
Aren’t we a couple?

273
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,040
Yeah,

274
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,000
but no one knows that.

275
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,480
I don’t think I’m as perfect for you as Gen.

276
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,960
Is this why you’ve been avoiding me?

277
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,560
You know that that is impossible, right?

278
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,240
But she has everything,

279
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,680
while I have nothing.

280
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
I don’t want people to think
I’m leeching off of you.

281
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,480
I don’t want people to think
I’m leeching off of you.

282
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,080
Sorry.

283
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,600
Singh, wait.

284
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,000
Hello?

285
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,720
What?
An emergency?

286
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,520
Sure.
I’ll rush there.

287
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,320
- Did you see this news this morning?
- What?

288
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,640
- This.
- Hm!

289
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,400
Don’t people these days
need to work and earn for themselves?

290
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,040
They only think of being a leech
and ending up on the news.

291
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,040
Look at us working days and nights.

292
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,840
When will we ever be
financially stable?

293
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,480
If I ever get a rich partner
like in this video,

294
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,200
that’d be incredible.

295
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,920
- Wake up and keep working.
- Aw.

296
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,440
Can I not daydream?

297
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,520
Keep working until you can’t anymore.

298
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,000
I’d like to have this phone fixed.

299
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,440
It can’t be turned on.

300
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,160
Of course.

301
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,520
And when it’s done,

302
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,640
I kindly ask that
you recover its data, too.

303
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,360
I’d like to know the owner
of the latest number that called.

304
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,600
Of course, Miss Gen.

305
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,160
About what I asked you to buy for me,
did you get it?

306
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,760
Yes.

307
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,920
Aoey.

308
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,280
Gen, you’re back?

309
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,000
What is this?

310
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,560
Are you feeling alright now?

311
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,160
I am.

312
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,640
It’s nothing severe.

313
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,800
What about you?
Where have you been?

314
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,760
I bought this for you.
Open it.

315
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,360
That’s so cute!

316
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,000
- It looks just like you.
- I bought this to be your friend when you’re alone.

317
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,920
Touch its heart,
and you can record your voice.

318
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,360
Thank you.

319
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,840
My Gen is the most adorable person ever.

320
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,560
I’ll take you to get
a new phone as well.

321
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,600
It’s okay.

322
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,400
I don’t need it that badly.

323
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,160
I think I’ll just wait for my novel’s payout.

324
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,720
Don’t you need it to stay in touch
with people?

325
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,880
I have this.

326
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,200
I have this little monkey
to replace my phone.

327
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,440
Isn’t that right?
Yep.

328
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,680
Hello?

329
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,840
Why doesn’t it make any sound?

330
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,640
Do I need to pull its tail?

331
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,080
Hello?

332
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,160
Hello.
This is a test.

333
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,080
I can’t record my voice.

334
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,120
I can’t hear anything.
Do I do something with its butt?

335
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,440
Let me see.

336
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,840
It’s broken already?

337
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,960
I’ll have this replaced.

338
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,120
No!
I like this one.

339
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,040
This one is fine.
Right?

340
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,160
It is perfect.

341
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,240
If you can record your voice,

342
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,520
what would you say?

343
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,320
I’ll say ...

344
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,160
Aoey loves Gen.

345
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,120
Aoey loves Gen.

346
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,360
Aoey loves Gen.

347
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,640
Like that!

348
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,920
This is too cute!

349
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,320
It looks just like you.

350
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,840
Somkit.

351
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,360
Who was it, Gen?

352
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,880
Doctor Thot.

353
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,840
Why did he call?

354
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,000
We’re a couple.
We call each other before going to bed.

355
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,120
Too bad he can only call you.

356
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,320
I can do way more than that.

357
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,600
About what we discussed last night.
How’s it going?

358
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,920
So, who called Aoey?

359
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,920
It’s Anuchit’s number.

360
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,640
Anuchit?

361
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,800
Who?

362
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,120
Aoey’s stepfather.

363
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,560
Why was Aoey so furious about it?

364
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,920
Please tell me.

365
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,040
The truth cannot be hidden.

366
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,200
If we know it,
we can work on solving the issue.

367
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,400
What is this about?

368
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,000
The latest messages Anuchit sent ...

369
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,760
contain ...

370
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,080
inappropriate images of Aoey.

371
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,760
Bastard.

372
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
Anuchit: If you don’t respond,
I’ll leak all your images and videos.

373
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,520
I think the police should handle this.

374
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,600
If we do that,

375
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,600
the police will get Aoey involved,

376
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,600
and made her even more scared
and ashamed.

377
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:32,600
Trust me.
My plan is the only way to reveal the whole truth

378
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,960
and stop this.

379
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,160
Of course, Miss Gen.

380
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,920
Consider it done.

381
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,120
Thank you.

382
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,800
Anuchit: Where are you?

383
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,520
Aoey (Gen): What?

384
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,440
Anuchit: Tell me where you are.
I’ll find you right now.

385
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,440
Aoey (Gen): I’m in Bangkok.
Why would you come to find me?

386
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,560
Anuchit: I’ll meet you in Bangkok.
If I don’t see you, I’ll leak the photos.

387
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,880
Gen, where have you been
this whole day?

388
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,720
I had to run some errands.

389
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,040
Whose phone is ringing?

390
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,800
It’s mine.
I have two phones.

391
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,920
Since when?

392
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,200
Aoey, I’m rich.

393
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,120
I can have as many as I want.

394
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,440
I’m going home today.

395
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,040
Bye.

396
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,360
Aoey (Gen): Come see me at the hotel.

397
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,400
Bis Sister!

398
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,480
Why aren’t you at your condo?

399
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,920
Well,

400
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,360
I just want to be home.
Do you have a problem?

401
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Oh, does this mean Aoey is alone?

402
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,240
I should go see her.

403
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,600
- Quit that thought!
- Aw, aw!

404
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,360
You’re so protective!

405
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
Is our target at the hotel?

406
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,920
Exactly as planned.

407
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,320
Good, I’ll be there.

408
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,840
I think you shouldn’t go.

409
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,720
- Just stay put for me.
- But ...

410
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,880
Trust me.
I will deal with this.

411
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,200
I’ll report you when it’s done.

412
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,400
Yes.

413
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,880
Who the hell are you?

414
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,240
- Who are you?
- Stay down!

415
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,600
Get off of me.
Who are you?

416
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,560
Get off of me!

417
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
Who the hell are you?

418
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,320
Aoey.

419
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,960
Gen!

420
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,600
Where have you been for days?

421
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,320
I just stayed home.

422
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
I know,

423
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,480
but why haven’t you visited me?

424
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,120
I had to work on my project.

425
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,840
I need to take a shower.

426
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,320
Get off of me!

427
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,760
Whose photos are these?

428
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,840
- Tell me!
- I don’t know.

429
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
Can’t you see it for yourself?

430
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,800
Not going to talk, huh?

431
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,720
Are you not going to talk?

432
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,680
I said I don’t know!

433
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,640
Aoey (Gen): Come see me at the hotel.

434
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,680
Talk!

435
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,960
I don’t remember
whom I’ve taken these photos of!

436
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
- Talk!
- I don’t know.

437
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,960
Just figure them out yourself!

438
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,560
Look at them!

439
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,320
How did my phone end up with you?

440
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,240
Aoey, I ...

441
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,160
Don’t touch me!

442
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,320
I don’t care who sees those photos,
but it shouldn’t be you!

443
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,200
Not you!

444
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,040
Get off!
Why you?

445
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,760
I took a lot of photos.

446
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,200
Stop!

447
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,520
I don’t care who sees them,
but it shouldn’t be you!

448
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,320
Aoey!
Aoey!

449
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Don’t touch me!
I’m tainted!

450
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,000
- Get off of me!
- You are not.

451
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,560
Get off!

452
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,320
Gen, get off of me!

453
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,840
- No.
- I’ll never think of you that way.

454
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,400
How can you not be disgusted by me?

455
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,280
You’ve seen everything!

456
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,840
Stop!

457
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,560
Aoey, stop!

458
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,600
Is this why you hate me?

459
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,760
This is why you don’t love me.

460
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,520
I will never hate you.
Never.

461
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,240
I mean it.

462
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,000
- I say this with my heart.
- But I’m tainted.

463
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,000
I’m afraid that if you know the truth,

464
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,600
you’ll hate me.

465
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,920
I’m sorry

466
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,880
for never telling you this.

467
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,200
I understand.

468
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,920
You don’t need to mention it anymore.

469
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,040
But I am tainted.

470
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,880
- You’ve seen it.
- Where is it tainted?

471
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,040
Here?
Tainted?

472
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,120
It’s not.

473
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,960
Here?

474
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,440
It’s not.

475
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,400
Or here?

476
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,320
I don’t see you that way.

477
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,760
I’ll prove it.

478
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,600
I will never hate you.

479
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,400
Somkit: It’s done.

480
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,200
You’re not my friend.
I don’t count you as a friend.

481
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,680
Get out of my face.

482
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,280
Don’t ever get close to me!

483
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,280
You’re angry at your friend
because she gave you lice?

484
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,600
No, we can just treat it.

485
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,760
Are you angry
because you had to cut your hair short?

486
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,200
I’m pretty.
I can rock any hairstyle.

487
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,840
Then why are you angry at Aoey?

488
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,880
She didn’t tell me the truth.

489
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,080
She didn’t admit she had lice.

490
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,920
I asked her so many times,

491
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,800
but she never admitted it.

492
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,080
Aoey, do you have lice?

493
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,400
I don’t.

494
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,400
Are you sure?

495
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,160
I don’t have lice.
I’m honest!

496
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,560
Aoey, do you have lice?

497
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,240
No, I don’t.

498
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,240
Are you sure?

499
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,240
Gen, Aoey didn’t tell you the truth

500
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,760
probably because she was afraid
you wouldn’t play with her.

501
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,560
if she doesn’t,

502
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,160
how can I help her with lice?

503
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,160
Aoey, what are you doing?
That’s dangerous.

504
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,920
It’s because of my lice
that Aoey moved to another school!

505
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,840
She’s moving to another school
because her parents are moving to Bangkok.

506
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,960
It’s not because of you.

507
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,440
But I haven’t even said sorry to her.

508
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,240
It’s okay.
It’s alright.

509
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,600
Teacher.

510
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,960
I’m here to pick Aoey up.
