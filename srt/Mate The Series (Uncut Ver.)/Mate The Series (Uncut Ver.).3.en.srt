1
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,640
- Gen, are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm good.

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,760
This long holiday, my mom said
she'll go on a vacation with your mom.

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,840
Are you coming?

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,120
I'm not sure.
I'll tell you when the day's close.

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,880
- Wait!
- Huh?

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,120
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,320
I forgot about that.

8
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,080
It's okay.

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,080
I should apologize to you instead

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,120
for ruining the private moment
between you and Thot.

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,600
Aoey,

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,920
he got us medication and took care of us.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,200
Are you okay?

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,240
I don't want to trouble you

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,480
by having you worry about me.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,960
If you keep acting like this,
I don't want to talk to you.

17
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,600
Good night, Gen.

18
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,400
I'd like to reiterate again that

19
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,840
love knows no gender.

20
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,360
To love is to be the other's happiness
and peace of mind

21
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,280
and to always have goodwill
and care for the other.

22
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
That's right.

23
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,320
If you have someone
who you can feel at peace with by your side,

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,760
no matter what relationship you're in,

25
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,560
Someone like me deserves a perfect guy.

26
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,000
Your fate will bring you to a petite girl.

27
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,880
- Will we do this again?
- Of course, why not?

28
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,560
You seem to pay special attention to Aoey.

29
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,960
How was Doctor Thot?

30
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,200
Did you like him?

31
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Gen?

32
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,640
Where are you going?

33
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm going to stay home.
My mom misses me.

34
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
- And tonight ...
- That way, it's more comfortable for you.

35
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm leaving.

36
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,840
How many days are you going to stay home?

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,400
Aren't you afraid your friend will feel lonely?

38
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,200
If you're worried about that,
you can text her.

39
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,200
She said she wants to go to
the same university as you.

40
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,600
Seriously?

41
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,880
Yeah.

42
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
I don't have the guts to text her.

43
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,000
I should call her!

44
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
This is for the best.

45
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,800
Aoey, which day are you free?

46
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,320
Do you want to eat out together?

47
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,880
(Great sent an image)

48
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,160
Gen, are you coming back tomorrow?

49
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,320
I want to ask you about the university.

50
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,280
Going to a mall tomorrow?

51
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,240
Okay.

52
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,040
Aoey.

53
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,400
Where are you taking me today?

54
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,080
Are we having lunch?

55
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,760
I know some good restaurants.
I want to ...

56
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,440
You'll help me choose new clothes.

57
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm having a date with Thot this Friday.

58
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,720
What about you?

59
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,520
Why don't you go on a date, too?

60
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,920
If Great isn't to your taste,

61
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,480
I can recommend someone else.

62
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,720
No, Great seems way better than this.

63
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,240
If so, how about you ask Great
to go on a date with me?

64
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,560
If Great knows you said this,

65
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,760
he'd probably be so over the moon.

66
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,880
How about we get something to eat?

67
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,400
I booked a restaurant.

68
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,480
If it's nice, I might come again with Thot.

69
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,800
You seem pretty serious about Thot.

70
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,080
Well, it's our first date.

71
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,320
Doctor Thot is ...

72
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,080
good-looking, wealthy,
and from a nice family.

73
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,360
And our moms know each other.

74
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,160
Our first date needs to be perfect.

75
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,160
What about your date?

76
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,600
Tomorrow?
I'll tell Great.

77
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,520
Let's go.

78
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,360
You can move now.

79
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
Hm.

80
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,960
I guess I'm no use to you anymore, Gen.

81
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,200
No one's watching.
We don't need to be so close anymore.

82
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,960
Your performance was exceptional.
This isn't your first time?

83
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,440
- I guess so.
- Huh?

84
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,360
A doctor with a smart mouth can find a partner?
That's new.

85
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,640
Hey, someone actually likes
a mean girl like you, too.

86
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,240
- But what is this?
- [Someone's watching. Pretend like we're a couple.]

87
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,280
Do you remember Aoey, my roommate?

88
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,520
I do.

89
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,400
Is she really your roommate, though?

90
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,160
That's the point.

91
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Even you know that she thinks of me
as more than a friend.

92
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,040
I don't want to get her hopes up.

93
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,760
A girl should be with a guy.

94
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,400
So, this is what you do?

95
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,480
I don't want Aoey to think of me
more than that.

96
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,120
Gen, if we don't think about
how a girl should be with a guy

97
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,880
and just think with your heart,
how do you want this to be?

98
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,120
If I were to have a partner,

99
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,920
I should be with a perfect guy.

100
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,640
There's no other answer.

101
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,400
I wanted to meet you today

102
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,840
because I needed your help, too.

103
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,520
Singh.

104
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,840
This is Singha,

105
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,040
my boyfriend.

106
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,440
He's probably a year older than you.

107
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,600
I'm Singha;

108
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,120
you can call me Singh.

109
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,680
I’m Gen, Genlong.

110
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,960
Are you not surprised?

111
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,840
I doubted that you'd be single.

112
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,080
I just didn't think that your partner would ...

113
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,680
Sing, you look very familiar to me.

114
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,960
Have we met?

115
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,200
We're from the same school.
I'm a year older.

116
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
You probably have seen me there.

117
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,840
Oh.

118
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,200
I see.

119
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,720
You said you wanted my help.

120
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,480
What is it?

121
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,520
It's quite similar to what you asked me.

122
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,880
I don't want my mom to know about this yet.

123
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,840
But she seems so open-minded?

124
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,920
That's what I thought,

125
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,880
but ...

126
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,520
Yeah, Ning.
That's why I want Thot to date Gen.

127
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,520
These two are perfect in every way.

128
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,520
Ning,

129
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,560
I can't imagine what it's like
if Thot dates someone of his gender.

130
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,480
Just like the middle child of Fuengfah.

131
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,280
I would be so sad.

132
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,720
I would doubt myself
if I hadn't raised him well enough,

133
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,280
making him attracted to the same gender.

134
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,840
I can't live with that.

135
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,480
So, you want me to pretend like
I'm your girlfriend?

136
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,880
Exactly.

137
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,440
Of course,

138
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,040
but you'll do the same for me
when Aoey is around, too.

139
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,120
- Deal.
- That's all I'm here for today.

140
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,720
I'll have to go now.

141
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,560
Stay safe.

142
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,840
Thot,

143
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,360
do you think this is a good idea?

144
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,640
Singh, I'm sorry.

145
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,520
I guess it doesn't sit right with you
for us to fake it like this.

146
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,160
It's okay.
I understand.

147
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,560
You're the best.

148
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,520
I thought you wouldn't come back.

149
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,920
It's my room.

150
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,760
I can come and go anytime I want.

151
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,240
Oh,

152
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,360
you're still up.
This is late!

153
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,960
I'll always wake myself up if it's you!

154
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,480
Have you chosen your faculty?

155
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,360
Hm,

156
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,840
I have.

157
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,000
I think I'll go to the same faculty as yours.

158
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,520
That way, we meet more often.

159
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,640
Whoa!

160
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Your reasoning makes me blush!

161
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,200
I don't think I can sleep tonight.

162
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,920
If you don't,

163
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,080
how can I find you in your dream?

164
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,680
Can you not?

165
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,760
I'm working here.
You two are interrupting.

166
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,520
I need to go see Gen.

167
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,000
What?

168
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,400
Hey, next Monday is the registration day.

169
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,720
I'll take Aoey to the university with me.

170
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,920
This is for the best.

171
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,320
I won't take the girl you like.

172
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,000
What?

173
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,200
What are you up to?

174
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm bathing.
What is it?

175
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,680
Can I come in?

176
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,880
Yeah.
The door's not locked.

177
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,720
What are you stressing about?

178
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,080
You always bathe
every time you are stressed out.

179
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,920
How wasteful.

180
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,960
Do you worry about me,
or just want to scold me?

181
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,560
I worry about you.

182
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,160
So, what happened?

183
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,800
Nothing.

184
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,360
Just my work and project.

185
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,840
But you're good at it.

186
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,640
You always get it done no matter
how much you complain.

187
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,000
Hey, about Aoey.

188
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,480
I really like her.

189
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,040
No one has ever made me
feel like that before.

190
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,480
Why don't you tell her?
Why are you telling me?

191
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,520
I want you to know
that I'm serious about your friend.

192
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,680
And?

193
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,840
I need your advice.

194
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,560
There'll be a 3-day orientation
for new students.

195
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,720
Should I start racking my scores?

196
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,960
Do whatever you want.

197
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,680
She'll get the most comfortable experience.

198
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,400
I'll bring her a good mattress myself.

199
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That way, at night,
she'll have the best sleep ever.

200
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,160
Huh?

201
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,120
A camp? At night?
What?

202
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,520
What do you not understand?

203
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
We'll be staying at our faculty!

204
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,160
- You leave. I need to get dressed!
- Hey!

205
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,720
You really want to go?

206
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Why do you keep asking that?

207
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,840
Are you ...

208
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,800
worried about me?

209
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,840
By Great, actually,
having to take care of you.

210
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,440
I can take care of myself.

211
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,560
No one needs to take care of me.

212
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,280
You struggle to be with anyone.
No one can even touch you.

213
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,560
Do you think you can go through a camp?

214
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,240
Remember, I dropped out for a year.

215
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,440
I've been through my previous university.

216
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,800
Besides, I want to have more friends
and know more people.

217
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,480
I can't be so friendless as you are.

218
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,520
What benefit do I get from having a friend?

219
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,240
I'm sorry.

220
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,640
Act tough how you want.

221
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,560
Make sure you don't scream
in front of everyone.

222
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,360
- I'll cause no trouble.
- I'll see.

223
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,560
Great, it's okay.

224
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,120
I can carry that myself.

225
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,600
It’s okay, Aoey.
Let me do it for you.

226
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,440
Please save your energy for today.

227
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,720
- It's going to be a long day.
- Hurry up.

228
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,160
Stop teasing already.
It's annoying.

229
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,600
Hey.

230
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,760
What are you filming?

231
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,120
I'm here to watch over my brother.

232
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,280
Are you a student here?

233
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,120
- Uh ...
- If you're not,

234
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,520
I'll need to ask you to leave.

235
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,800
- Gen, you're here to see your brother?
- Nut? Yes!

236
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,520
I'm here to help my friends with the camp.

237
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes!
She's with me.

238
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,240
The two of us will need to talk now.

239
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,040
Of course.

240
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,840
I invoke my big sister's privilege
to watch over my brother.

241
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,200
Sure.

242
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,160
Are you here for Great

243
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,160
or someone else?

244
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,400
It's my brother

245
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,040
and a friend.

246
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,920
She dropped out of another university.
Her name is Aoey.

247
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,280
Okay.
I'll allow it,

248
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,560
but I need something in return from you.

249
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,640
What?

250
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,280
You'll have a meal with me.
Please?

251
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,520
Sure, but you'll take care of my friend, Aoey.

252
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,600
What's going on with her?

253
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,640
That's Aoey.

254
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,840
She has a phobia.

255
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,320
She can't be touched.
Go help her!

256
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,680
- Please calm down.
- What's up with her?

257
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,800
Jed, keep everyone out.

258
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,480
Don't let anyone touch her,

259
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,520
- or her phobia will be triggered.
- I'll see it done.

260
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,560
Great, bring her to sit over there.

261
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,000
Aoey.

262
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,720
Aoey!

263
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,080
Stay calm, Aoey.

264
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,240
Where's Gen?
Can you get her for me?

265
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,400
She went home, but I'm still here.

266
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,920
- Please calm down.
- Gen!

267
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,320
Everyone, Aoey isn't feeling well.

268
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,520
We'll need to keep some distance from her.

269
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,160
You can talk to her,

270
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,600
but just don't touch her.

271
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,160
- Understood?
- Yes.

272
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,680
- Can we do that?
- Yes.

273
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,240
Keep the music going.

274
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,080
Okay.

275
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,680
How is she?

276
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,640
She's fine now.
Don't worry.

277
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,680
Other seniors are taking care of her, too.

278
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,600
Thank you.

279
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,400
Take care of her for me.

280
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,320
Aoey.

281
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,480
Feeling better?

282
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,320
Yes.

283
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,840
Thank you so much.

284
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,640
Are you sure you're alright?

285
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,440
You seem so pale.

286
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,120
Act tough how you want.

287
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,000
Make sure you don't scream
in front of everyone.

288
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,120
I can do it.

289
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,560
This is nothing.

290
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,720
Can I please continue with the activities?

291
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,320
You're as stubborn as Gen.

292
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,240
Alright,

293
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,480
just be careful when you move around.

294
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,760
Stay close to me, okay?

295
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,280
Let's get back, then.

296
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,560
Careful.

297
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
Great, I'll watch over her.

298
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
You can go back to your spot now.

299
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,680
I'll take care of this, okay?

300
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,720
Keep me updated.

301
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,840
Yes, Princess.

302
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,800
If you're so anxious,
why don't you look after her personally?

303
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,240
You talk too much.
I cancel our agreement!

304
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,520
What is this?
Hey!

305
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,760
Are you not helping with the activities?

306
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,520
I prefer to stay here.

307
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,560
Nut: Princess, who are you watching over?

308
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,640
Nut: We'll be singing and dancing.
Aoey seems alright.

309
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,800
Nut: She seems to enjoy it with everyone.

310
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,840
Great: I was assigned
to a different group from Aoey's.

311
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,840
Great: I am so worried.

312
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,160
Great: Can you send us some snacks?

313
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,800
Nut: Oh, she looks charming without glasses.

314
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,760
Great: She removed her glasses,
and every guy is coming for her!

315
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,360
Great: What do I do?

316
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,920
Block them out.
Don't be stupid.

317
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,120
Great: Why don't you do it?
You're always here anyway.

318
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,160
Great: Where are you going?

319
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,760
Great: I want to block them,
but who am I?

320
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,400
A brother of a friend?

321
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,280
Then cause a scene.

322
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,560
Tell her how you feel.

323
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,680
Quickly!
We'll be late for Doctor Mean and Dokfai's session!

324
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,720
Doctor Mean and Dokfai?

325
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,520
If you have someone
that you feel at peace with,

326
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,120
no matter who they are to you,

327
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,560
it's the beginning of love.

328
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,720
Is this the reason why
you're so insisting on coming here?

329
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,120
Hello, everyone.

330
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,520
Can I hear some noise
from the new students?

331
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,640
Today, we're honoured
by the two famous YouTubers.

332
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,800
Make some noise for Doctor Mean and Dokfai.

333
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

334
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,680
We've arrived at our last session.

335
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,360
Does anyone have a question
for Doctor Mean and Dokfai?

336
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,040
I'm aware that I am a student,

337
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,080
and our most important duty is to study.

338
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,360
Despite that,
studying isn't the only part of our life.

339
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,080
My question is,
what if our partner is very sick,

340
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,600
but we have an exam tomorrow,
what should we do?

341
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,160
That's a difficult question, for sure.

342
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,840
Hm.

343
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,840
If we talk about priorities,

344
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,000
like you said, studying is
of the utmost importance at this age.

345
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,480
However, our loved one
is surely at the top, too.

346
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,960
Do you agree?

347
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Yes.

348
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,640
If the two are on a scale,

349
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,080
the weight of their importance
is likely the same.

350
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Choosing just one of them is difficult.

351
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,680
I got nothing from listening
to these guys.

352
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,400
Hey!

353
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,560
Gen, wait.

354
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,040
I'm Fai.
We met at the car showroom.

355
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,840
- Oh, you're Dokfai.
- Yes.

356
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,640
Fai!
Let's go.

357
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,560
We'll be late.

358
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,920
I need to go now.
See you later.

359
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,200
- Of course.
- Let's go.

360
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,760
Bye-bye.

361
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,160
Here, as promised.

362
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,240
I thought we were going to eat out
with just the two of us?

363
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,120
I said I'll have a meal with you,

364
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,440
but I didn't specify when or where.

365
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,400
- Oh.
- Do you want this or not?

366
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,600
Of course!

367
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,040
How can I not take what you gave me?

368
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,880
But this is not for just two persons.

369
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,240
Can I bring my friend to join us?

370
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,920
Aoey, please take a seat.

371
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,080
That's a lot of food.

372
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,360
Where's Great?

373
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,680
He's having the time of his life
with the seniors there.

374
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,960
Shall we start?

375
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,160
Oh, fried chickens!

376
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,600
Aoey, here.

377
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,880
Here.

378
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,640
She doesn't like wings.

379
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,960
I'll take it.

380
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,640
Do you like pizzas?
I'll put on some sauce for you.

381
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,520
She doesn't like chili sauce.

382
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,240
Maybe no sauce, then.
Here.

383
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,560
It's a seafood pizza.
Take the big one.

384
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
She doesn't eat shrimp.

385
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,760
Okay.

386
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,000
Aoey, maybe have this.

387
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,040
Oh, she likes French fries?

388
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,480
Oh.

389
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,600
Grab your bag.
We're going to my condo.

390
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,760
Why should I listen to you?

391
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,520
Because I said so.

392
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,840
You must listen.
I don't like someone stubborn.

393
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,680
If I am, what can you do?

394
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,800
I won't care about you.

395
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,520
Gen.

396
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
What's going on with you?

397
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,600
Why do you always force me?

398
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,600
If you think that's what it is,

399
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,120
- why did you allow it?
- I won't anymore.

400
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,880
Then I won't care about you.

401
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,160
If so,

402
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,360
someone else can care about me.

403
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,040
Maybe Jed?

404
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,600
Jed?
What good does he have?

405
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,920
- Or Great?
- You can change that easily?

406
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,200
Then what are you so annoyed about?

407
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,920
You wanted me to have
a boyfriend yourself.

408
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,240
You think loving someone is that easy?

409
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,360
This is the real world,
not your fictional world.

410
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,080
- You have a boyfriend, too!
- That's my right.

411
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,600
This is mine, too!

412
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,160
I can do whatever I want.

413
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,960
No, because I feel jealous.

414
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,160
You said you felt jealous?

415
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,280
No.

416
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,800
I said I was protective of you.

417
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,440
You misheard it.

418
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,480
Hey, I just can't see well,

419
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,920
but my ears are perfectly fine.

420
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,560
I heard it right.

421
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,840
- You said you felt jealous.
- I didn't.

422
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,040
- You did.
- I didn't.

423
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,080
- Gen is jealous!
- I didn't say that!

424
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,600
- You really are.
- I'm not!

425
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,160
Gen.

426
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,680
Help me.

427
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,600
Gen.

428
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,320
Gen.

429
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,840
Genlong, don't.

430
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,360
Don't hug her.
Don't.

431
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,200
This is just to help her.

432
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,160
Doctor Thot, are you free this afternoon?
Can you come to my condo?

433
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,760
I can be there at 2 PM
but can't stay past 4 PM.

434
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,480
I need to pick Singh up.

435
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,680
It won't be long.
You can pick him up afterwards.

436
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,080
Okay.

437
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,240
I'm about to finish peeling.
Just wait a bit.

438
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,600
I invited Doctor Thot over.

439
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,840
Why?

440
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,360
I just wanted him to come see me here.

441
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,080
I wanted him to get to know my world more.

442
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,440
I also wanted to introduce
my good friend to him properly.

443
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,760
Your good friend?

444
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,600
Yeah, you are my good friend.

445
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,760
Doctor!

446
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,240
- Let me take that.
- It's okay.

447
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,000
It's alright.

448
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,120
Doctor, please take a seat here.

449
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,320
I'd like to introduce you two properly.

450
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,240
This is Aoey.

451
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,080
She's a good friend of mine.

452
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,400
And this is Doctor Thot,
my boyfriend.

453
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

454
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,960
I guess you two will want
to spend time alone together.

455
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,560
I should go.

456
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,680
Wait.

457
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,040
Hm?

458
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,240
Since you just got up,
can you put these on a plate?

459
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,480
And we can have the fruits together.
Just stay here.

460
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,320
Gen, why?

461
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,720
Pretending to be a couple,
like we agreed?

462
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,240
Don't slip.
Got it?

463
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,600
Stay and have the cake together.

464
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,680
This café made really good cakes.
Try it, Aoey.

465
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,360
It's from my favourite café!

466
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,240
I knew; that's why I bought it.

467
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,080
- That's crumble cherry.
- Hm!

468
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,280
You always know what I like.

469
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,920
I'm so lucky to be your girlfriend.

470
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,320
- Really?
- Of course!

471
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,160
I am so lucky to have met you that day.

472
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,120
My mom never misses.

473
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,280
Who do I have to thank for now?

474
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,720
Our moms, of course,

475
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,720
for bringing us together,

476
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,880
so that we can be in love.

477
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,560
I just realized that I ran out of my cleansing foam.
I need to go.

478
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,600
Gen, I think it's too much this time.

479
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,240
It's not.

480
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,280
I understand that you don't want Aoey
to think of you as more than a friend,

481
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,320
but don't you think this is overdoing it?

482
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,440
If I don't do this,

483
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,160
how can Aoey get away from me?

484
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,840
The relationship
between Aoey and me is impossible.

485
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,480
Impossible?

486
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,800
Gen,

487
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,400
I don't think Aoey is the only one

488
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,840
who think of someone else
as more than a friend.

489
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,560
You know I love perfection.

490
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,000
A girl needs to be with a guy.

491
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,080
And I won't accept anything that ...

492
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,520
looked down on by society.

493
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,880
Gen, we're in the new age.

494
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,040
As long as we're not cheating,

495
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,840
you can date just anyone you like.

496
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,640
It's your love and your heart.

497
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,840
Why let someone else dictate it?

498
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,200
If you really don't care about others,

499
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
why haven't you openly dated Singh?

500
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,240
It's not that I will never do it.

501
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,960
I'm just waiting for the right time.

502
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,720
Besides,

503
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,120
I never pushed away Singh
the way you did to Aoey.

504
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,200
You need to look into your heart.

505
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,080
Stop caring how others think.

506
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,320
When you do that,
I'm sure you'll get the answer.

507
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,680
Whatever you do,

508
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,200
try not to hurt someone for too long.

509
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,600
If you don't care about others,
why haven't you openly dated Singh?

510
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,000
- Where are we going?
- I'm taking you to meet my mom.

511
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,880
I think it's time for her to meet you.

512
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,200
- Hi, Mom.
- What is it, Thot?

513
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,360
I'm bringing a friend to see you
this evening.

514
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,600
How about later?

515
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,480
- I'm going to a gala dinner with your dad.
- It's okay.

516
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,480
Maybe later.

517
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,280
I'll call you again.

518
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,640
It's okay.

519
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,720
Things are happening too quickly today.

520
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,640
We can do this later.

521
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,160
I'm sorry, Singh.

522
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,880
No need to be.

523
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,000
You haven't done anything wrong.
Don't think about it.

524
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,320
How about we go get some food?

525
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,520
And ...

526
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,880
would you like a dessert?

527
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,880
My favourite?

528
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,120
Hey, you went to see Gen today.

529
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,520
How did it go?

530
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,200
She ...

531
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,680
used me to hurt Aoey, as usual.

532
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,040
I think she's trying to escape herself.

533
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,160
I think I see where she's coming from.

534
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,760
When it comes to love,
she should see it with her heart more.

535
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,240
Feelings are created in your brain,

536
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,200
so we should use our brains
when it comes to love.

537
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,480
What I mean is that you can't just use your brain
when it comes to love.

538
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,280
You need your heart, too.

539
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,040
I guess Gen's using too much of her brain,
like you said.

540
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,600
How about we show her

541
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,760
that loving the right person perfectly fine?

542
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,920
Like me?

543
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,160
Loving the right person.

544
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,720
Aoey.

545
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,640
I know what you're thinking of me.

546
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,440
I want you to stop it.

547
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,000
Gen.

548
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,160
You were being sarcastic to me
about dating someone.

549
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,720
I want you to actually do it now.

550
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,440
Open your heart.

551
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,000
Maybe Great.

552
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,440
He really likes you.

553
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,600
You know that, right?

554
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,960
Silly as he is,

555
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,400
he can take care of you.

556
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,760
Gen.

557
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,760
Can you not bring this up again?

558
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,600
I prefer a man.

559
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,800
I want to have a family.

560
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,000
Do you not understand?

561
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,240
We can be friends.

562
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,680
If you want to be more than that,

563
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,440
being friends wouldn't even be possible.

564
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,000
Gen is confused

565
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,000
and pushed Aoey away

566
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,520
despite wanting Aoey to be around.

567
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,200
Actually, between you and me,

568
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,600
if I think purely with my brain,

569
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,280
I might push you away, too.

570
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,960
What if you think with your heart?

571
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,520
I won't care about anything.

572
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,520
I'd just eat you whole.

573
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,360
No, this is not real.

574
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,680
You love me.

575
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,080
Don't you want to be next to me?

576
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,080
It doesn't matter.

577
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,960
I'm doing what's right.

578
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,240
If you still insist,

579
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,200
I'll show you that I mean it.

580
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,560
Gen.

581
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,280
You really don't feel anything
about me?

582
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,960
Your heart's beating quickly.

583
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,800
Singh, I know that,

584
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,160
despite your brain

585
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,760
telling no,

586
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,320
your heart made it very clear

587
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,720
that you can't resist it anymore.

588
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,560
Gen.

589
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,720
I want you to know that

590
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,560
both my brain and heart

591
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,920
are all yours.

592
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,000
If the two are on a scale,
the weight of their importance is likely the same.

593
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,080
Choosing just one of them is difficult.

594
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,920
Sometimes, you don't have to choose.

595
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,320
You just balance it as best as you can.

596
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,440
Your loved one's sick.
Then, you could get a bit less sleep

597
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,520
to study next to them

598
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,120
and taking care of them
at the same time.

599
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,280
We also believe that

600
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,640
our loved one

601
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,880
wouldn't want us to fail our studies
because of them.

602
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,320
We don't have to take care of them 24/7.

603
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,360
We don't have to reach the point
where we miss our classes or exams.

604
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,440
Just be sincere to take care of them.

605
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,560
Even if it's just a short time,

606
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,880
I'm sure they absolutely
can sense your sincerity.

607
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,000
To live a happy life

608
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,840
is to balance everything in life well.

609
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,880
Gen, can I comb your hair for you?

610
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,040
What you just told me earlier,

611
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,760
I understand it now.

612
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,520
No matter ...

613
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,320
who you want me to be,

614
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,920
every time you look for me,

615
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,880
I'll always be there.

616
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,240
I'll be your friend,

617
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,880
just like how you wanted, forever.

618
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,600
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore,

619
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,560
but I love you.

620
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,200
Hey, two cups of drink for yourself?

621
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,160
Can I have one?

622
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,680
No! One is for Gen!

623
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,960
We just want one!

624
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,240
No, no!

625
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,760
If you don't give us,
then you won't get to drink any!

626
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,840
Why are you so slow?
And why is it spilt everywhere?

627
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,920
You failed me!
Come with me, now!

628
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,720
Where are you going, girl?

629
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,440
You're rich, right?
Give me some money!

630
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,200
Hey!

631
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,440
Ugh.

632
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,160
Yay! You're the best.
Thanks for helping me!

633
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,600
Of course!
You're my best friend.

634
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,720
Without you,
who would do my homework for me?
