1
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,301
Yes.

2
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,179
Yes.

3
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,892
Sure thing.

4
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,981
See you.

5
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,402
Hm?

6
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,073
Where are you going?

7
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,866
I won’t let you go.

8
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,954
I need to.

9
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,580
It’s ...

10
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,042
very important.

11
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,171
Even more important than me?

12
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,612
Aoey!

13
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,782
Are you home?
It’s me, Great.

14
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,617
I’m here for you!

15
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,589
Big Sister!

16
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,133
We need to have a serious talk.

17
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:56,676
About what?

18
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,386
What?

19
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,139
About Aoey, obviously.

20
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,808
You said you’ll be our matchmaker,

21
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,643
but you haven’t done anything.

22
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,731
Hey, I sold you to her already.
What else do you want?

23
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,942
Come on.

24
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,777
Aoey and I,

25
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,280
It seems like it’s going well,

26
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,366
but we always end up on square one.

27
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,957
Can you flirt with her for me?

28
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,836
Are you crazy?

29
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,964
- That hurts!
- No one can help you with that!

30
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,760
If you’ve tried hard enough

31
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,261
and it doesn’t work out,

32
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,263
how about this?

33
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,557
You should ...

34
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,559
give up.

35
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,978
Just let Aoey find someone better.

36
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,689
How can you say that to me?

37
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,210
Aoey.

38
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,754
Please go out and shop with Great.

39
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,257
I have to be somewhere else.

40
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,384
Great can help you carry stuff.

41
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,052
Please let me tag along.

42
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,721
I’ll help you carry everything.

43
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,932
You won’t have to do any hard work at all.

44
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,102
I’ll do my best
and won’t cause any trouble.

45
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,313
Please?

46
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,216
What is it that you want to discuss with us?

47
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,887
- Um ...
- This is very important, yes?

48
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:11,769
So, you’ve been a couple
for quite some time, right?

49
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,023
And you’re both women, too.

50
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,527
And Mean is a doctor.

51
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,321
I’m a dentist.

52
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:29,329
I assume you studied women’s anatomy
or something?

53
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,124
Something like ...

54
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,090
How can we know
if a woman has reached her climax?

55
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,096
Are you having this problem
with your partner?

56
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,100
No, it’s ...

57
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,437
It’s a project I’m working on.

58
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,609
We’ll tell you as much as we know.

59
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,820
Please.

60
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,947
So ...

61
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,950
The way it works is that ...

62
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,093
Uncle Somkit, have you dealt
with the photos and videos?

63
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,764
Those must be heavy.
Let me open the door for you.

64
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,224
Thanks.

65
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,811
What is all this?

66
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,772
Well, it’s for a party.
A double date.

67
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,107
Huh?

68
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,652
Aoey and I are afraid
you might feel lonely.

69
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,321
So, we invited Doctor Thot, too.

70
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,075
What did he say?

71
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,036
Nothing much.

72
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,539
He said he'll come when he finishes his shift.

73
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,922
Why did you buy alcohol?

74
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,177
I’m thinking of making Aoey drunk.

75
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,305
Are you insane?

76
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,557
That hurts!

77
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,144
I think it’ll be fun!

78
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,942
Cheers!

79
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,244
Hey, I'm pouring into Gen's cup.

80
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,259
Doctor, pretend like we've been out today.

81
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,678
Don’t ask why.

82
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,521
Aoey, wait and see how crazy she can be when drunk.

83
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,982
Would you like this?

84
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,070
Aw, you’re so cute.

85
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,739
Here’s Doctor Thot.

86
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,574
- Hello.
- Hello.

87
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,076
Here’s your welcome drink.

88
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,747
- We’re starting off strong, huh?
- Let’s go.

89
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,123
Let’s go.

90
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,802
Aoey!
I’m sorry.

91
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,887
- I’m sorry.
- How can you do this?

92
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,057
Calm down!

93
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,309
- Great, go!
- Are you crazy?

94
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,562
Get off of me!

95
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:26,315
Get your hands off me.

96
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,775
Stay still!

97
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,302
Gen?
You woke up?

98
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,227
What is this?

99
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,731
Last night, you were really drunk.

100
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,566
You were lashing out at Great.

101
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,653
So, Doctor Thot and I had to get you in here

102
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,614
and lock you in place.

103
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,578
That idiot brother!

104
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,832
Do you remember anything
from last night?

105
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,963
Whoo!

106
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,717
Get up!
This isn’t fun enough!

107
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,802
- Okay!
- Get up on your feet!

108
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,472
Go!
Big Sister!

109
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,766
- Let’s go!
- This is hot, Doctor.

110
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,185
- Hm?
- Take off your shirt!

111
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,187
Are you crazy?
No!

112
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,897
Great, it’s hot in here.

113
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,149
- Take off your shirt!
- What?

114
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,236
- Fine, I’ll take off mine!
- No!

115
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,822
- That’s enough.
- Ugh.

116
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,038
Ew!

117
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,044
- Aoey, I’m sorry.
- Great, how can you do this?

118
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,462
- Great!
- Great!

119
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,130
Gen, calm down!

120
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,256
Calm down!

121
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,176
Great! Great!

122
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,720
Great!

123
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,931
Just go now!
I’ll deal with her.

124
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,891
- Gen, stay still!
- No!

125
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,310
Doctor, get off of me!

126
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,104
- Get off!
- Come here!

127
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,231
- Get off!
- Come here, Gen!

128
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,983
- Doctor, get off of me!
- Don’t move!

129
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,736
- No! Get off!
- Gen!

130
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,072
- Doctor, get away from me.
- Stay still!

131
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,658
- Gen! Gen!
- Get off of me!

132
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,577
Get off now!

133
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,954
Get off!

134
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,747
I told you to get off!

135
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,291
Ugh!
It hurts!

136
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,711
- What is this?
- Get me out of this!

137
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,838
Why won’t you do it?

138
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,132
- Doctor!
- Just go to sleep.

139
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,972
And are you alright?

140
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,517
You’re worried about me?

141
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,438
I’m so glad that

142
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,565
you’re worried about me.

143
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,818
Anyone would do the same.

144
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,361
But ...

145
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,572
now that you’re done being glad,

146
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,158
please get me out of this.

147
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,078
My whole hand feels so numb.

148
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,169
No.

149
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,923
You will not escape from me.

150
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,919
Give me a second!

151
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,588
How do I unlock this?

152
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,190
Doctor?

153
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,360
Gen, what is this?

154
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,575
Just eat me.

155
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,453
Gen, eat me whole
as much as you want.

156
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,288
This thing is broken.

157
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,792
It just recorded Aoey
when she was talking nonsense.

158
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,878
Hmm, I’ll pretend to believe that.

159
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,893
- Gen.
- Hm?

160
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,312
I actually want to talk to you
about something.

161
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,064
Yes?

162
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:22,194
I want you to talk with Singh for me.

163
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,781
- Me? Talk with him?
- Yeah.

164
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,741
He won’t talk to me.

165
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,869
Well,

166
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,706
he said that my lifestyle
and his are very different.

167
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,250
I don’t understand at all

168
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,586
about how that links to our relationship.

169
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,298
I think your family and your mom

170
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,300
might not agree with you

171
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,887
And I think that’s what Sing’s thinking.

172
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,223
Anyway, I’ll talk to him.

173
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,767
Thank you.

174
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,854
I’m glad that you agreed to help.

175
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,651
I also have something to ask from you.

176
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,656
Do you remember Aoey’s episode last night?

177
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:12,036
I think she needs a proper treatment.

178
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,705
Do you know any psychiatrist
by any chance?

179
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,500
Of course.
I’ll talk to my friends.

180
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,961
Thank you.

181
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,697
- Here.
- Okay.

182
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,826
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

183
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,999
Singh!

184
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,626
Oh, Gen?

185
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,461
Can we chat for a bit?

186
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,549
Singh.

187
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,595
I want to let you know that ...

188
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,641
the relationship between
Doctor Thot and I is impossible.

189
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,268
It’s just what the adults arranged.

190
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,979
You know that.

191
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,897
Doctor Thot doesn’t like ...

192
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,525
me.

193
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,194
Please don’t think much about it.

194
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,988
It’s not about that.

195
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,409
Thot and I are too different.

196
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,247
Having a 1,000-baht meal for me

197
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,290
is very expensive.

198
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,042
For Thot,

199
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,253
it’s pretty normal.

200
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,757
and buying expensive clothing for me.

201
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,343
He wants you to have
all the best things.

202
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,303
How is that a problem?

203
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,806
That means I’m not good enough.

204
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,225
I don’t think that’s what Doctor thinks.

205
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,185
On his birthday,

206
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,687
his friends ...

207
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,940
bought him surprise gifts
amounting to a hundred thousand.

208
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,192
Me?

209
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,029
I just gave him a birthday card.

210
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,115
They talk about studying abroad,

211
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,785
stocks, and investment.

212
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,831
It’s like they speak
a different language from me.

213
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,459
Do you see this class difference?

214
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,919
If both of you are fine with it,

215
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,964
why would you care what others think?

216
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,925
What does his mom think?

217
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,386
Not to mention his friends

218
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,056
I tried to not think much,

219
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,141
but it still doesn't sit right with me.

220
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,604
If your only option is to live at a temple,

221
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,022
just stay here with me.

222
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,650
- I’ll help you clean the room in return!
- Whatever.

223
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,777
Do whatever you want.

224
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,080
Wealthy or not,

225
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,248
anyone can experience love.

226
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,210
If you only care about other people

227
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,170
and not care just only you and Thot,

228
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,839
it will only hurt you two.

229
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,341
Let me ask you this.

230
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,469
If love alone is enough,

231
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,722
why haven’t you been open with Aoey

232
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,517
- about how you feel?
- I don’t ...

233
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,060
See?

234
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,438
We care more about
how we look than love itself.

235
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,875
I’ll leave you two to talk.

236
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,252
I can get home myself.

237
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,461
bye.

238
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,652
Aoey.

239
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,488
I’m sorry for what happened yesterday.

240
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,119
I had too much drink, too.

241
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,373
I didn’t intend to harass you.

242
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,878
I’m truly sorry.

243
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,508
Great, don’t do that again.

244
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,512
I’ll never do that again.

245
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,099
I’ll do a better job
of taking care of you.

246
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:49,188
I think it’s time to tell you this.

247
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,523
What is it, Aoey?

248
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,734
You’re nice,

249
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,903
and I like you,

250
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,740
but as a brother.

251
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,911
Besides,

252
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,748
I’m seeing someone else.

253
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,796
Is it someone I know?

254
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,878
Gen.

255
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,339
What is it?

256
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,931
I told Great
that I was seeing someone.

257
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:12,145
I asked him to get over me.

258
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,399
And what did he say?

259
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,494
I love you.

260
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,871
You know that, right?

261
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,754
You don’t need to take me
to a psychiatrist.

262
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,923
I’m perfectly fine.

263
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,969
I just need you next to me.

264
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,557
You heard our conversation?

265
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,225
Yeah.

266
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:56,106
I know you care about me,
and I won’t think much of it.

267
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,777
But you don’t need to take me
to a psychiatrist.

268
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,663
Hello, Mom?

269
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,707
Can you come to see your brother?

270
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,375
Something’s wrong with him.

271
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,961
He’s been playing drums loudly
for hours.

272
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,005
Yes, I’ll be there.

273
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,510
Aoey.

274
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,806
I’m worried about Great;
I need to rush home to see him.

275
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,433
Can I go with you?

276
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,357
- Hello.
- Mom.

277
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,775
How is Great?

278
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,069
I don’t know what got into him.

279
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,072
He won’t talk to me.

280
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,532
I’ll go check on him.

281
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,119
Aoey, wait for me in my room.

282
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,304
Great!

283
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,680
Great!

284
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,183
Great!

285
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,560
Great!

286
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,291
How’s Great?

287
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,085
He won’t talk.

288
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,295
Does this always happen?

289
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,299
Every time he’s stressed out.

290
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,145
It’s my fault.

291
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:02,858
I want to help,
but I don’t know how.

292
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:08,822
Everything will be fine
when he cools down.

293
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,589
That’s what I thought!

294
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,507
Great?

295
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,677
Why did you do this?

296
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,388
Why?
Why did you betray me?

297
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,641
Why acting like a matchmaker?

298
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,102
Why did you make me like Aoey?

299
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,189
I feel like a fool.

300
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,900
Great, calm down.
Aoey ...

301
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:49,070
I didn’t want it to turn out like this.

302
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,989
Aren’t you dating Doctor Thot?

303
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,909
How can you do this?

304
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,497
You cheated on him!
Are you lying to Aoey, too?

305
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,294
Great, get off of her!

306
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,475
Aoey, is she lying to you?

307
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,188
Great, what’s happening?

308
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,889
Hello.

309
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,641
What is it, Gen?

310
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,311
I’m sorry for such a late-night call.

311
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,731
I need your advice.

312
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,567
Just ask!
Mean is here with me.

313
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,902
Is this about the project?

314
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,946
Sort of.

315
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,575
The friend with whom
I’m working on this project

316
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,744
seems to have a mental problem.

317
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,956
Should I get her treated?

318
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,750
Hm.

319
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,960
What’s this problem?

320
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,630
She’s scared of being touched.

321
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,299
No one can get close to her.

322
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,676
If someone does touch her,

323
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,846
she’ll scream while shaking her body.

324
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,391
PTSD?

325
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,684
Yes.

326
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,854
Probably due to sexual harassment.

327
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,210
Be quiet!

328
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,296
Get off of me!

329
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,494
He did all these things,
and you still believe him?

330
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,746
Liar!

331
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,849
Oh, I think ...

332
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,560
she should get treated
as soon as possible.

333
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,688
The quicker she does,
the quicker this gets treated.

334
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,150
That’s what I want to ask.

335
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,694
She doesn’t want to see
a psychiatrist.

336
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:26,407
Should I tell her we’re hanging out
when I bring her to one?

337
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,160
I don’t think you should.

338
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,121
She should agree to it.

339
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:36,084
If you force her, she will distance herself further
from treatment.

340
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,546
What should I do?

341
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:47,220
Gain her trust and explain to her
the pros of getting proper treatment.

342
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,889
- Yes.
- Start by showing that you care

343
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,226
- and keep asking her about her condition
- Yes.

344
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,312
and if she copes well-being
with other people.

345
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,941
I think that’s a good start.

346
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,903
- That’s great.
- Thank you.

347
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,333
- Hello, Mom
- Hello.

348
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,089
Mom,

349
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,549
this is Singha,

350
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,718
my boyfriend.

351
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,562
I’m sorry.

352
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,440
In fact,

353
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,277
I haven’t been seeing someone.

354
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,574
I just don’t want to hold you back.

355
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,535
Singh.

356
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,663
I don’t know what you’ve heard,

357
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,543
but I don’t want it to be bigger
than our relationship.

358
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,423
Every time I feel tired,

359
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,176
want to give up,

360
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,305
or feel like the whole world
is against me,

361
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,557
only you

362
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,184
are by my side,

363
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,271
encouraging me.

364
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,232
For me,

365
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,944
without you,

366
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,738
I’ve made up my mind.

367
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,574
We will meet my mom together.

368
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,743
But ...

369
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,829
your mom might not like me.

370
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,708
We just want to let her know about us.

371
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,461
No matter what,

372
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,339
I’ll never let you go.

373
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,633
Thank you.

374
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,227
If this is your boyfriend,

375
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,230
what about Gen?

376
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,234
Actually,

377
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,860
Gen and I

378
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,737
aren’t really dating.

379
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,322
Seriously?

380
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,283
Does Ning know about this?

381
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,453
And what about Gen?

382
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,288
Well,

383
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,332
both of us

384
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,876
already like someone else.

385
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,546
And you are Singha, yes?

386
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,466
Please tell me

387
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:34,512
what year you are studying in,
what your job is,

388
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,265
I’m a fourth-year student.

389
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,808
I’m from another province.

390
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,894
I’m both working and studying now.

391
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,440
My family ...

392
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,110
My parents are freelancers.

393
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,492
Please stay for lunch with us.

394
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,420
Speaking of the devil.

395
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,423
You go talk to Gen for now.

396
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,799
Of course.

397
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,596
- Hello, Gen.
- Singha,

398
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,141
- please come help me in the kitchen.
- Of course.

399
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,242
Gen, are you okay?

400
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,373
It’s okay.
Are you alright?

401
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,131
Just take a break.
I’ll finish this.

402
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,304
Aoey,

403
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,183
have you thought about
seeing a psychiatrist?

404
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,688
I’m perfectly fine.

405
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,732
Why would I waste money on that?

406
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,403
Just take a break.

407
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,197
Let’s go.

408
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,256
About getting Aoey a psychiatrist,

409
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,466
have you found one for me?

410
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,843
I have.

411
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,011
I sent you their profile.

412
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,765
But has Aoey agreed to this?

413
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,644
She just kept saying that she’s fine

414
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,646
and didn’t want to see one.

415
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:52,275
Then you should convince her somehow.

416
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,318
If she agrees to it,

417
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,155
just call me,
and I’ll make arrangements.

418
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,824
Thank you.

419
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,743
- Doctor.
- Hm?

420
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,163
How about you and Singh?

421
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,834
I introduced Singh to my mom.

422
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,212
- She’s fine with it.
- Really?

423
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,257
I’m happy for you.

424
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,931
Aoey: Your mom is at our condo.

425
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,391
Hey!

426
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,394
Gen?
What happened?

427
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,605
My mom is with Aoey at my condo.

428
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,109
Why would your mom be with your friend?

429
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,445
Yesterday, we had some troubles at home.

430
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,989
So, I took Aoey to my condo.

431
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,783
I don’t know if Great told my mom
about this.

432
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,120
Is this very serious?

433
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,082
I guess so.
Great saw ...

434
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,251
Saw what?

435
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,546
- Saw me kissing Aoey.
- Huh?

436
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,134
I didn’t want my mom
to know about this.

437
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,013
But it is as obvious as it can get.

438
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,806
You still want to deny it?

439
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,684
Doctor, this is not the right time to do this.

440
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,270
You need to help me
on what to do next!

441
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,446
Doctor, you need to come with me!

442
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,573
Quickly.

443
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,457
Doctor,

444
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:37,755
don’t forget to act like we’re a couple
in front of my mom.

445
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,092
Gen, please.

446
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,511
Let’s just come out.

447
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:47,348
- I’m sure she’ll be nice about it.
- No! I can’t do that.

448
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,478
Don’t displease me.

449
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,272
Just do what I say.

450
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,616
Doctor, did you have fun?
We should go out again sometime.

451
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,577
- Of course.
- Put your shoes here.

452
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,914
Mom, when did you arrive?

453
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,251
- Hello, Mrs. Ning.
- Hello.

454
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,546
What is this?

455
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:27,388
A doll I bought for Aoey as a gift.

456
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,433
I know that it’s a doll,

457
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,893
but what is this?

458
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,732
Gen, just eat me.

459
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,819
Eat the whole thing.

460
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,071
Eat as much as you want.

461
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,668
Gen.

462
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,962
Sit here.

463
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,767
Aoey, sit next to me.

464
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,781
So?

465
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,077
You and Aoey are dating, correct?

466
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,539
What do you mean by dating?

467
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,124
Stop beating around the bush.

468
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:41,128
Just give it to me straight.
Great told me all about this.

469
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,979
Yeah, we’re dating.

470
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,739
And Doctor Thot

471
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,410
has a boyfriend named Singha already.

472
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,830
You think I haven’t talked to Tubtim?

473
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,709
I’m sorry.

474
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,796
- I ...
- She forced you, yes?

475
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,855
Gen.

476
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,941
Don’t give him that face.

477
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,156
Gen.

478
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,827
You dating Aoey

479
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,497
isn’t something I’m against,

480
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,502
but I’m worried

481
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,547
that, right now,

482
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:13,053
both of you are still young.
You have a long future ahead of you.

483
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,433
Besides, Aoey and you

484
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:22,480
might not even know if this feeling

485
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:26,025
is true or temporary love.

486
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,861
Mom,

487
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,698
I believe what my feelings tell me.

488
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,494
I love Aoey.
I really love her.

489
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,746
What about everything else so far?

490
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,790
You always told me that

491
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,377
you will only date only perfect men.

492
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,008
I just thought that

493
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,303
that will make me happy.

494
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,388
What about now?

495
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,059
Did you change your mind?
Huh?

496
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,781
Aoey.

497
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,368
I do not hate you,

498
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:27,378
and I don’t mind if you’ll have a female partner
like the fortune teller said.

499
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:34,176
Ultimately, any mom would want to see
her child happy.

500
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,598
I only ask you one thing.

501
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,269
Just one thing.
Ask yourself again.

502
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,232
I, too, adore Aoey.

503
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:55,698
I wish not to see you both hurt.

504
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,525
I brought you some food.

505
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,404
Don’t forget to put them in the fridge.

506
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,575
I need to go now.

507
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,746
- Yes.
- I’ll walk with you, Mrs. Ning.

508
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,289
Thank you.

509
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,708
Goodbye, Mom.

510
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,675
It’s beautiful.

511
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:43,347
- Reach for the cloud for me.
- How can I do that?

512
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,515
Whoa!

513
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,062
It’s so beautiful up on the rooftop here!

514
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:36,775
I only came here a few times myself.

515
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,115
- What is that?
- I think they put this on for Christmas

516
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,284
and haven’t removed it yet.

517
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,254
- Gen.
- Huh?

518
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:02,801
Your mom said that ...

519
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:06,805
you wanted to only date perfect men.

520
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,643
What changed your mind?

521
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,062
Well,

522
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,900
maybe just like what she said.

523
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:24,156
I was obsessed with my vision
of someone perfect.

524
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,203
Once I found you,

525
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,080
no one else is perfect anymore.

526
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,460
How?

527
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,050
You’re the perfect one for me.

528
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,972
You think of me as more than a friend,
right?

529
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,897
I’m very sorry for my daughter,
Fortune Teller.

530
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,567
In fact, there’s still one more card left.

531
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,405
What does it say?

532
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:12,496
Do you see the mistletoe in this card?

533
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:17,793
It signifies a happy celebration in the end.

534
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,881
Therefore, the story of your daughter,

535
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:26,802
no matter how many obstacles are in it,

536
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,263
in the end,

537
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:33,141
will have a beautiful ending.

538
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,979
- Really?
- Anything she wishes.

539
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,527
You’re more than a friend.

540
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,363
You’re my most beloved friend,

541
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,032
I love you so much.

542
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,952
I love you.

543
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:08,135
I love you, too.
You know it.

544
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,596
I’ve been loving you for a long time.

545
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,099
I want to be with you forever.

546
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,869
You said it.

547
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,413
You want to be with me forever.

548
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:40,626
If I start to show my bad side,
don’t you go anywhere.

549
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,337
I never want to go anywhere else.

550
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:49,092
I’ll make you love me more and more
every day,

551
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:53,472
and I’ll love you more and more every day, too.

552
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,191
That’s Gen’s number.

553
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:49,277
I got this when we attended extra classes
at Siam Square.

554
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,325
Thank you, Cee.

555
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,588
Hello?

556
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,049
Hello?

557
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,720
- If you don’t talk, I’ll hang up.
- Hello.

558
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,433
This is Aoey.

559
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,352
Gen, do you remember me?

560
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,564
I know many Aoey.
Are you a scammer?

561
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,899
I don’t have time for this.
I’m not in a good mood.

562
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,651
I had lice

563
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,070
and spread them to you.

564
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:36,450
Oh, Aoey.

565
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,953
How are you?

566
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,371
Everything’s going well?

567
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,166
I’m fine.

568
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,126
Why did you call?

569
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,423
I’m travelling to Bangkok.

570
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,759
I should arrive tomorrow.

571
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,886
Will you be free?

572
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,346
I know this is happening too fast,

573
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,807
so if you’re not free ...

574
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:05,604
You want to meet up?
Where would it be?

575
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:10,358
I’ll get off my bus at the station,

576
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,985
but ...

577
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,363
you can pick anywhere
that suits you best.

578
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,992
I’ll add you on Line
with this number

579
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,495
and send you a location nearby.

580
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,538
Let’s meet at 11 a.m.

581
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,248
Sure!

582
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,709
Okay, see you.

583
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:19,553
Does “Mate” mean a cleaning lady?

584
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:24,057
No wonder you fell our English class.

585
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,435
This is “Mate.”
It means friend.

586
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,771
If I have money,

587
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,857
I’ll buy this shirt

588
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,901
so that I can always be your friend.

589
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,570
I’ll buy it for you,

590
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,488
but I don’t have money today.

591
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,948
Next time!

592
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,375
Why is the shirt you bought so big?

593
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,836
Only one size was available.

594
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,612
But we need to go now.

595
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,741
Do you want to leave it with me?

596
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:27,412
When Aoey comes back,
I’ll tell her you bought this for her.

597
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:31,374
No, I want to hand it to her myself.

598
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,668
I’m sure I’ll see her again.
