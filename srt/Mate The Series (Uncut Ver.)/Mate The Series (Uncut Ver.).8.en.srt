1
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,160
- Gen?
- Hm?

2
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,040
Did you have any sleep?

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,360
Barely, Doctor.

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,640
How's Sing?

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,400
Singh.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,080
- Well ...
- Is there a problem?

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,480
He ...

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,680
packed up all of a sudden and left.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,360
I still can't contact him.

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,120
Huh?
I thought you were back together?

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,320
Leave it.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,160
We're here for your problem.
Is there anything I can help?

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,160
Just packing up, really.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,840
You really need to go, right?

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,920
There's no other choice.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,760
I have to leave in a few days.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,680
And Aoey?

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,720
I haven't talked to her yet.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,560
I don't know how to break it to her.

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,680
I promised her to never leave her,

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,920
so I don't know what to tell her now.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Chiang Mai?
Jeez.

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,880
What about Trat?

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,640
Will it be good for Gen?

25
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,600
We need our clothes,

26
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,960
chargers,

27
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,840
toiletries,

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,560
and medicine.

29
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,120
Doctor,

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,480
when Singh left

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,760
and you couldn't contact him,

32
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,480
how did that make you feel?

33
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,480
I was heartbroken.

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,200
It hurt.

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,200
And I wonder ...

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,400
if all the time we had together

37
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,080
wasn't enough for him
to at least tell me why.

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,000
You came to me like this—

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
aren't you afraid
of getting caught up in this, too?

40
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,600
Gen, a true friend

41
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
will always be there
when a friend is in need.

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,120
That, unless that friend
tells me to go home.

43
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,160
If I need help next time,

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,440
you'll be the first to hear from me.

45
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,000
Any time.

46
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,600
I looked at lots of rental homes.
Is there any that you like?

47
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,040
- You prepared everything?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,680
This one looks nice.

49
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,080
I agree!
Should I message them?

50
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,960
Are you sure about running away with me?

51
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,320
I am.

52
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,480
I will always take care of you.

53
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,760
All I ever need is you.

54
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,080
But I'm picky.

55
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm a picky eater.

56
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,320
I can't even do chores.

57
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,960
That's nothing.
I know you.

58
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,800
Besides, we've been together
for a while

59
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,280
without a problem.

60
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,480
I'll message the owner.

61
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
[Somkit]

62
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,080
Yes, Uncle Somkit?

63
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,960
Gen, we need to leave now.

64
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,200
To where?
Isn't that in three days?

65
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,160
Wut knows what we're up to.
We need to act fast.

66
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,640
Your father wants you home now.

67
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,320
Can I bring Aoey with me?

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,040
Gen, everyone thinks
she's the culprit of all this.

69
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,320
Also, don't forget that
we still have a problem with Sali.

70
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,800
If she's with us,
the press will be on our tail.

71
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,600
[Great]

72
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,840
I'll stay.
I wish everyone a safe journey.

73
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,800
Sir, we didn't see her at her condo.
We've looked everywhere.

74
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,320
I'll stay.
I wish everyone a safe journey.

75
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,000
She turned off her phone.

76
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,520
Let's go now.
We can't wait.

77
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,760
Yes, sir.

78
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,400
- Find her and report to me.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,760
You wait for me here.

80
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll be back in a bit.

81
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,320
Here's some Dramamine.

82
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,520
- Take it now.
- Will taking it now help?

83
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
It's better than not taking it at all.

84
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,080
We still have a long way to go.

85
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,000
What?
We haven't arrived?

86
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,200
How far is it?

87
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,760
Well, quite a bit.

88
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,720
You can actually eat this.

89
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,840
No mineral water?

90
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,000
This is all a restaurant like this offers.

91
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,440
They don't have straws, too.

92
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,000
Are you okay with that?

93
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,960
Yeah.

94
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,560
Can I get some napkins
to wipe my spoons with?

95
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,240
I think I'll get used to this after a while.

96
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,360
Gen!

97
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,560
Gen, are you alright?

98
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,720
How about we get some fresh ingredients

99
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,280
to cook in the evening?
I'll make your favourite dishes.

100
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,600
You said it like you knew
where we're staying.

101
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,200
I do.

102
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,240
Don't tell me it's that house.
The rent is expensive!

103
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,480
Yeah.

104
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,440
Where did you get the money to pay?

105
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,040
- You have money?
- When I stayed with you,

106
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,560
I barely paid for anything.

107
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,200
When my novels paid off,
I saved up.

108
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,400
Don't worry, Gen.

109
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,000
Let me pay for you this time.

110
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,960
- Do you want to take a break?
- It's okay.

111
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,200
We can rest when we arrive.

112
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,760
- Ah!
- Gen!

113
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,080
Gen, are you okay?

114
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,200
Gen.

115
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,320
Are you okay?

116
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,960
Come on.

117
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,240
Are you alright?
Can you walk?

118
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,240
- I can carry it.
- It's alright.

119
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,120
Okay.

120
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,960
We're getting there.

121
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,920
We've arrived.

122
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,400
Are you sure you don't want to see a doctor?

123
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,600
It's fine.

124
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,680
I just need some ointment and wrap.

125
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,400
I think I want to lay down now.

126
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,040
Whatever you say.

127
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Tada!

128
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,560
- Let's check it out.
- Go!

129
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,360
Whoa!

130
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,920
Do you like a bed with metal frames?

131
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,280
It's so convenient to tie a cuff with.

132
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,960
Are you sure that's me?

133
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
I think it's you.

134
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,120
The weather is nice.

135
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,880
Too bad it's so far away.

136
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,040
I'm sorry for making your life hard
like this.

137
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,560
Don't be.

138
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,600
I love it here.

139
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,040
I loved it when I saw the images.

140
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
- Really?
- Yeah.

141
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,520
Don't you think this place is special?

142
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,520
Special?
How?

143
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,760
I think it's too blend for you.

144
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,480
Anything can be special
with a special someone.

145
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,960
You're such a sweet talker!

146
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,440
Let's go.

147
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,400
Gen, I'll start looking for a job tomorrow.

148
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,720
Don't you want to take a day off?

149
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,280
You sit down.

150
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,720
I think I'm only slowing you down.

151
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,880
Don't think that.

152
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,320
I will always take care of you
and you only!

153
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,440
Wait here for now.

154
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,680
Where are you going?

155
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,320
Do some cleaning.
We still have a lot to do.

156
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,520
- Let me help.
- Stop!

157
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,120
Sit down.

158
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,480
Your ankle hurts.
You need to sit down.

159
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,320
- Look at you!
- I'm fine.

160
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,600
Don't be stubborn.

161
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,200
Thank you.

162
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,600
How can I not love someone
as obedient as you?

163
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,440
It's done!
Tell me if you need anything else.

164
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,320
Sure.

165
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,480
Let's get to it.

166
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,720
Let me get you some rice.

167
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,480
Are you not going to eat with me?

168
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,120
I haven't done cleaning yet.

169
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,840
There's still a lot to do?

170
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,520
I need to clean the bedroom
and put on a sheet.

171
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,640
How about you eat with me,
and I'll help you out?

172
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,280
But your ankle hurts.

173
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
It's just a sprained ankle,
not a whole broken leg.

174
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,240
Sit down.
Do as I say.

175
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,920
As you wish, my queen.

176
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,240
Sure thing.

177
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,440
Who am I to say no to you?

178
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,000
Let's eat.

179
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,840
Eat more!

180
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,280
- Are you tired?
- No.

181
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,240
Okay, go!

182
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,920
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

183
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,600
Good enough for you to sleep?

184
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,880
Thank you for everything you do for me.

185
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,600
Gen, wait.

186
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,120
I need to take a shower.

187
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,800
Can I take a shower with you?

188
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,560
Didn't you just do that?

189
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,600
I can do it again.

190
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,640
Eat more, Gen!

191
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,400
I'm out looking for a job—

192
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,960
I'll be back by noon.

193
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,040
Here's your drink.

194
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,880
Here's your dessert.
Your drink is coming right up.

195
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,200
Here's your drink.

196
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,800
Enjoy.

197
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,480
Oh, Gen!

198
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,800
Fai!

199
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,040
Wow.

200
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,640
Here,

201
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,560
your smoothie low-sugar cocoa.

202
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,840
Thank you.

203
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,680
How are you?

204
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,680
I never thought I'd meet you here.

205
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,560
Exactly.
What a small world.

206
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,760
Are you here with your family?

207
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,520
Uh.

208
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm with Aoey.

209
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,120
Oh.

210
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,280
And where do you guys stay?

211
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,440
Not far from here.

212
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,240
We rent a house together.

213
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,040
Hm.

214
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,960
Had I known this,
I'd find you a house close to mine.

215
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,200
Do you intend to keep this canvas empty?

216
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,400
No,

217
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,760
I want something to be drawn on it,

218
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,720
but I'm still looking for someone to help.

219
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,280
You said you're looking for
someone to help you draw?

220
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,000
Yes.

221
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,360
Can you please check out my portfolio?

222
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,400
Let me show you.

223
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Here, I actually ...

224
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,320
know how to draw and paint.

225
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Gen, these are beautiful.

226
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,320
Look at these.

227
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,560
This is exactly
what I've been looking for.

228
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,080
Really?

229
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,320
Are you interested?

230
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,200
Absolutely.

231
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,360
I'll sketch up some drafts.

232
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,240
If you like it,
I'll get started right away.

233
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,600
Of course.

234
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,640
Gen, where have you been?

235
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,880
I thought you ran away from me.

236
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,760
Where can I run away to
with my legs right now?

237
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,360
I just had a short walk around.

238
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,560
Next time, tell me where you're going.

239
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,120
You made me worry.

240
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,680
Aoey,

241
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,640
- I got a job.
- Job? What job?

242
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
- I paint at a café.
- Wow!

243
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,720
That's great.
It's your thing.

244
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,280
I got a job, too.

245
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,320
I'm a server!

246
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,120
Whoa!

247
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,240
You went out for a bit and got a job already.
Smart girl.

248
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,920
And so are you.

249
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,720
So,

250
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,320
should we celebrate
with a dish of stir-fried morning glory?

251
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,800
Aw.

252
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,520
Again?

253
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,880
Aw.

254
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:12,040
I promise to take you
to a good restaurant on payday.

255
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,840
What happened to your hands?

256
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,880
Uh.

257
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm probably allergic to detergent.

258
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,440
Have you applied anything to it?

259
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,400
Do you have any ointment?

260
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,120
There's a pharmacy near where I work.

261
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,440
I'll go get some tomorrow.

262
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,640
Now that you have to go out to work,
will you have time to write novels?

263
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,800
I told my fans that
I'm taking a break.

264
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,760
I'll get back to it when everything is settled.

265
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,000
And your study?

266
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,760
I just dropped out for now.

267
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,120
Or I can just study in an open university.

268
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,400
Hey,

269
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,920
why are you asking me these questions?

270
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,080
I feel bad.

271
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,320
I feel like I'm ruining your future.

272
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,600
My future has you in it.

273
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,240
Everything else comes second.

274
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,840
Okay?

275
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,480
I prepared you some breakfast.

276
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,680
Don't forget to take it to work.

277
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,120
I'll go now.

278
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,640
Thank you.

279
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,360
Bye.

280
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,600
I promise to take you
to a good restaurant on payday.

281
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,160
I'm probably allergic to detergent.

282
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,600
I need to withdraw some cash.

283
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,560
What?
Why can't I take money out?

284
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,800
An update on a hot case.

285
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,440
Today, officials have seized the assets
of the Bawonchai family.

286
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,480
Have you seen her?

287
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Looks familiar.

288
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,960
Dammit.

289
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,720
Young man.

290
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,280
The old man at the grain store said
he had seen the person you're looking for.

291
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,000
- Really?
- Yes.

292
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,760
Try asking him.

293
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,760
Maybe you'll know where to find her.

294
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,560
- Which way do I go?
- That way.

295
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,000
Gen.

296
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,680
Gen.

297
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,280
Yes?

298
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,440
Are you okay?

299
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,400
You seem distracted today.

300
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,240
It's nothing.

301
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,640
Just something to think hard about.

302
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,640
You're not having any problem,
right?

303
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,560
Yesterday, someone came looking for you.

304
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,480
You didn't tell them anything, right?

305
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
He seems untrustworthy.

306
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,480
So, I just told him I don't know you.

307
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,960
You have to be very careful.

308
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,960
If I need help next time,

309
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,520
you'll be the first to hear from me.

310
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,080
Any time.

311
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,920
Fai,

312
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,520
Oh,

313
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,760
sure thing.

314
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,400
I'll go take care of my customers now.

315
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,360
Don't worry, Mrs. Ning.

316
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,680
A strange number is calling me.

317
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,760
Thot,

318
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
don't hang me up.

319
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,120
That might be Gen.

320
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,000
Yes.

321
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,320
Hello?

322
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,320
Hello, Doctor.

323
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,160
This is Gen.

324
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,560
Gen?

325
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,800
Gen.

326
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
My bank account is frozen.

327
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,520
Can I borrow your money?

328
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,040
Of course.

329
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,120
How much do you need?

330
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,280
100,000.

331
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,800
But your account is frozen.

332
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,760
Where are you now?

333
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,560
Tell me,
and I'll bring the money to you.

334
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,360
I'll call you again later.

335
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,720
Mrs. Ning,
do you think she'll call again?

336
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,440
Yes.

337
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,440
Thot, you need to bring this money to her

338
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,680
and separate the two.

339
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,720
- Uh ...
- You might think I'm cruel,

340
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,080
but those two won't go far together.

341
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,400
They have financial problems,
not to mention Gen's behaviours in general.

342
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,600
Of course.

343
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,960
As soon as she calls me back,

344
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
I'll do what you told me.

345
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,560
Thank you, Thot.

346
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,040
Fai,

347
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,040
thank you.

348
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,920
Is everything alright?

349
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,000
Hey, Gen!

350
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,640
Doctor Mean, hello.

351
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,840
How are you?

352
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,800
- You finished your work?
- I did.

353
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,760
- Are you tired?
- I am.

354
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,400
Sit down.
Have some rest.

355
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,160
Gen, long time no see.
How have you been?

356
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,680
It's been great.

357
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,320
Uh,

358
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,160
Fai once said that Doctor Mean
once ran away to here alone.

359
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,920
Yes.

360
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,360
I cut off my contact with everyone.

361
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,560
Why did you leave Fai?

362
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,800
I didn't want to make it hard for her.

363
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,960
I thought that, by living with her,
she would be better off.

364
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,600
It was all in your head!

365
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,280
She didn't even ask about
what I was thinking.

366
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,040
Had I given it to you straight,

367
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,000
you wouldn't let me go.

368
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,120
Obviously!
Who would?

369
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,520
Gen, this is a bad example.

370
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,680
Don't think for others all by yourself.

371
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,120
Do you think two women can stay together
for the rest of their lives?

372
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,720
That depends on you
and your significant other.

373
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,920
There's nothing to guarantee
that your love will last forever.

374
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,680
All we do is make the best
out of the present.

375
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,680
That way, we won't regret it later.

376
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,600
But you aren't a burden to the other.

377
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,680
I am.

378
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,040
What makes you think that?

379
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,920
It's just Aoey who has to take care of me,

380
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,800
and there's nothing I could do to help.

381
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,760
It's only Aoey who does everything.

382
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,560
I don't even know
if she's really happy doing this.

383
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,440
And how did you know she isn't happy?

384
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,480
Did she tell you that?

385
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,400
No.

386
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,800
I just feel like I'm so selfish.

387
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,320
It's like I'm hurting her with our love.

388
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,640
Gen, listen to me.

389
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,320
No love is smooth sailing.

390
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,520
It will always bring with it problems
and something to test you.

391
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,080
If it's that difficult,
how is that even love?

392
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,800
It can be.

393
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,760
Obstacles are what test a couple

394
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,600
to see how strong
they would stand for their love.

395
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,680
How do we know if it's a test

396
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,240
or it's us hurting them?

397
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,680
Let me give it to you straight.

398
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,280
You never know

399
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
until you two have gone through it.

400
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,560
Wish you the best.

401
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,760
We wish you the best.

402
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,000
Thank you.

403
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,640
Where does Aoey work?

404
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,600
Aoey, bring me the bricks.

405
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,760
That's enough.

406
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,000
Just put it there.

407
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,840
I will always take care of you.

408
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,080
What happened to your hands?

409
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,120
I promise to take you
to a good restaurant on payday.

410
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,000
Hello, Doctor.

411
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,840
How was the journey?

412
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,160
Not too bad.

413
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,880
Let's talk inside.

414
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,840
Water.

415
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,440
Here's your 100,000.

416
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,920
Thank you so much.

417
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,560
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

418
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,400
No need to.

419
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,360
That's not my money.

420
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,160
Then whose money is it?

421
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,440
Your mother.

422
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,760
Doctor, why did you do this?

423
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,800
Why did you tell her?

424
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,080
I was on a video call with her
when you called.

425
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,720
Right, you can leave now.

426
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,440
No.

427
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,720
- You're coming with me.
- What do you mean?

428
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,120
Let me ask you this.

429
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,520
What do you gain from staying here?

430
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,040
You and Aoey haven't finished your study.

431
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,800
So what?

432
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,760
We both got a job.

433
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,440
A job?

434
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,600
Does it pay you enough?

435
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,720
You'll borrow money from me anyway.

436
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,480
Ask yourself again, Gen.

437
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:23,560
Ask yourself again, Gen.

438
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,880
Is what you're doing the right thing?

439
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,560
Not only that you ruined your future,

440
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,960
you ruined her future, too.

441
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,120
I'll give you time to think this over.

442
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,760
If you've made up your mind,
meet me at Phupha Hotel near the market.

443
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,720
- I'll never leave Aoey.
- Your mom's men are waiting.

444
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,080
Choose wisely.

445
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,160
I'm sorry for making your life hard like this.

446
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,640
Don't be.
I love it here.

447
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,360
You're such a sweet talker!

448
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,560
Aoey.

449
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,520
Hm?

450
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,360
Tomorrow,

451
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,960
can you take a day off?

452
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,800
I want to go on a trip with you.

453
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,280
Of course.

454
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,160
It's just a day off.

455
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,800
Where do you want to go?

456
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,920
Ever since we came here,

457
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,800
aside from our home and the market,

458
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,680
we haven't been anywhere else.

459
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,440
That would be nice.

460
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,520
I watched this one movie.

461
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,200
The character drew on a banknote.

462
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,080
If we're a true couple,

463
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,720
this banknote will come back to me.

464
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,920
Here.

465
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,640
Here you go.

466
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,920
Take a step.

467
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,320
Oh, I heard lots of things.

468
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,760
Nearly there.
One, two.

469
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,200
Take a step.

470
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,280
Where is this?

471
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,360
We've arrived.

472
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,080
We're here.

473
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,800
Are you ready?

474
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,040
I'm as ready as ever!

475
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,360
Okay.

476
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,080
One, two, three.

477
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,560
Surprise!

478
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,560
What?

479
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,720
It's Doctor Mean and Dokfai!

480
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,520
Thank you, my angel.

481
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,240
And you too.

482
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,080
This is the happiest day ever for me.

483
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,600
Wow, she's so beautiful—
I barely recognize her.

484
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,080
What are you looking at?

485
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,600
Gen!
It's Aoey.

486
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,280
Aoey?

487
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,800
You're so kind to me about everything.

488
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,480
For me,

489
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,600
you're my angel.

490
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,800
A devil like me?
An angel?

491
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,960
You are.
My angel only.

492
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,200
I love you.

493
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,600
I love you, too.

494
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,920
I love you the most.

495
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,600
Me, too.

496
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,800
Me, too.

497
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,640
This 100,000 is for Aoey.

498
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:06,720
She can use it for her novels
or whatever.

499
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,120
Sure.

500
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,240
Tonight, at midnight,

501
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,280
I'll come pick you up.

502
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,640
Can we do this tomorrow at midnight?

503
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,360
I want to spend one more day with her.

504
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,800
Sure.

505
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,000
Doctor,

506
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,720
I want to ask you one thing.

507
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,400
Of course.

508
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,680
What is it?

509
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,240
When I'm gone,

510
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,880
can you make Aoey hate me?

511
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,120
Do we have to go that far, Gen?

512
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,720
We don't know what will happen next.

513
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,960
I might die, or ...

514
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,200
I might never come back again.

515
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,480
I just don't want her
to wait for me pointlessly.

516
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,480
And please bring her mom here, too.

517
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,400
That's her mom's number.

518
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,280
We meet at tomorrow's midnight.

519
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:20,160
I'm sorry for causing trouble
for your family.

520
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,080
It's okay.

521
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,880
- What is this key?
- You'll know when you get inside.

522
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,840
But please don't use it
until I'm gone.

523
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:49,200
Please sell this watch and use the money
for her study and treatment.

524
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,720
Aoey!
Aoey!

525
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,560
Aoey!
My child!

526
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,280
- My child!
- Gen!

527
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,400
Aoey!
Don't go.

528
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,200
- Gen!
- Aoey! Don't go!

529
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,600
- Aoey!
- Gen!

530
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,240
Don't go!

531
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,760
Aoey!

532
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,480
Just drive.
No matter what happens, don't stop.

533
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,000
Gen!

534
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,840
Where are you going?

535
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,720
You said you'll be with me!

536
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,040
Gen!

537
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,120
Where are you going?

538
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,160
- Gen!
- Doctor, we need to stop.

539
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,760
- I need to help her.
- We can't do that.

540
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,960
- Please stop! Doctor! Please!
- Gen!

541
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,680
Gen!

542
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:51,240
- Doctor, stop!
- Gen, don't do this.

543
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,840
You said you'll never leave me!

544
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,120
Gen!

545
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,480
Gen?
Gen!

546
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,280
- Aoey!
- Gen!

547
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,840
Aoey!

548
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,360
Doctor!
Open the door!

549
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,680
- Open the door!
- You said you'll never leave me!

550
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,200
Gen!

551
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,200
Gen, don't do this!

552
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,960
Open it!

553
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,560
- Open it!
- Enough, Gen.

554
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,760
No love is smooth sailing.

555
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:32,080
It will always bring with it problems
and something to test you.

556
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,800
Gen!

557
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,720
- Stop! Stop!
- Gen!

558
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,920
- Stop! Doctor!
- Don't do this, Gen!

559
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,040
- Give me a chance.
- I understand how you feel.

560
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,000
Can you promise to never leave me?

561
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:52,200
All I ever need is you.

562
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,240
Don't you think this place is special?

563
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:01,520
- Special? How?
- Anything can be special with a special someone.

564
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,200
Gen!

565
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,920
Obstacles are what test a couple

566
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,240
to see how strong they would stand for their love.

567
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,680
Gen!

568
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,720
I love you.

569
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,000
I love you, too.

570
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,520
I can't contact her.

571
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,600
I went to their house

572
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,600
and didn't find anyone.

573
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,960
A sign says it's even up for rent, too.

574
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,120
Is this about the advice we gave them?

575
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:27,720
It might or might not.

576
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,120
What are you going to do with this drawing?

577
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,200
Will someone take over this?

578
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,840
No.

579
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:47,640
I think it's complete by itself.

580
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,320
What do you mean?

581
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,680
If Gen never comes back,

582
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:57,120
it will symbolize an unrequited love.

583
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,360
If she comes back and finishes this,

584
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,000
it will symbolize love, which needs to be tested
before it can be completed.

585
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,200
We can only hope

586
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:15,360
that this storm would make these two
hold their hands tighter than ever.

587
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,920
Yeah.

588
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:22,520
The only thing that dictates
if love is right or wrong

589
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,720
is love itself.

590
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,440
Love possesses not nor
would it be possessed,

591
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,400
for love is sufficient unto love.

592
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,920
Wow.

593
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,680
- You read The Prophet?
- How about that?

594
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,640
- You like it?
- Good one.
