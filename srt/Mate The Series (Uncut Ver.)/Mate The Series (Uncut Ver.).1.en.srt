1
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:18,615
Shuffle the cards with your left hand

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,918
and divide them into two piles.

3
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,468
Pick 10 cards!

4
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:31,349
Gen, pick them carefully, my dear.

5
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:47,700
The empress card shows up in the main position...

6
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:52,765
meaning this person is stubborn!

7
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,756
arrogant!

8
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:54,955
with a high ego.

9
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,039
Everything must be perfect.

10
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:58,913
And...

11
00:00:58,938 --> 00:01:00,317
they don't care about others.

12
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:01,445
However,

13
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,901
if they deeply love someone

14
00:01:04,926 --> 00:01:07,853
they often lose that person.

15
00:01:07,878 --> 00:01:09,559
Oh my!

16
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:12,347
Your precious Milky just passed away, right?

17
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,482
What’s this coincidence?

18
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,485
It’s giving me chills!

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,567
Isn't that obvious?

20
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:20,723
Everyone loses someone they love at some point.

21
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,563
Please, don’t say it like that.

22
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:28,084
Shuffle the cards again!

23
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:29,179
Gen

24
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:32,545
focus and shuffle again.

25
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:39,298
3 cards.

26
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:49,239
What?

27
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:52,120
The empress again!!

28
00:01:53,551 --> 00:02:00,303
This card says that you will meet your soulmate

29
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,714
but also come with severe life-changing events

30
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:07,035
family problems

31
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,930
and those close to your loved ones may face misfortune.

32
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:19,697
Fortune Teller, what kind of person is my child's soulmate?

33
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:26,042
Women!!!

34
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:27,161
A tiny one

35
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:33,110
Nonsense! Old hack!

36
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:33,586
Gen!

37
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,055
How could someone as beautiful, rich, and capable as Genlong

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,662
will have a girlfriend who’s a woman?

39
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:42,163
Gen, apologize to the Fortune Teller right now!

40
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:43,752
Why apologize?

41
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:45,535
I didn’t do anything wrong.

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,149
A famous fortune teller, really? Such nonsense.

43
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:49,595
She can’t fool me.

44
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,721
Dear, please watch your language.

45
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:53,699
Fortune Teller,

46
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:54,566
I’m really sorry!

47
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,858
Somkit, follow her immediately.

48
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:56,154
Yes, ma’am.

49
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:56,732
Thank you.

50
00:02:57,368 --> 00:02:59,918
Please, let’s me help you.

51
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:01,961
I’m really sorry about that.

52
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,331
Move! Come one, move it!!

53
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:08,882
How rude!

54
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:11,853
Miss…

55
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:14,242
Miss! Please, wait. Miss!!

56
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:20,707
Somkit

57
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:22,073
go get the car now.

58
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:23,167
I wanna go home.

59
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:23,869
I can’t.

60
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,253
Madam is still inside having her fortune read.

61
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:28,553
Even after hearing such nonsense,

62
00:03:28,578 --> 00:03:29,975
she still wants to continue?

63
00:03:31,934 --> 00:03:34,410
So, you won’t go get the car, right?

64
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:36,647
Fine

65
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:38,893
then go wherever you want.

66
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:39,949
I’ll go back myself.

67
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:47,769
Hello….

68
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:50,419
Hello!

69
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:52,874
If you don’t speak up, Imma hang up.

70
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:56,552
It’s me, Aoey.

71
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:57,774
Gen

72
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,638
Can you remember me?

73
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:01,402
Aoey, who?

74
00:04:01,427 --> 00:04:02,869
There are so many Aoeys.

75
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:04,157
Are you a scammer?

76
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:06,580
I don’t have time to talk I’m in a freaking bad mood.

77
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:08,643
Aoey with lice….

78
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:10,195
and ended up infecting you with them.

79
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:43,816
Why did you push Aoey like that,

80
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,645
Gen? So, mean!

81
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,017
So, what?

82
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,651
This’s just a beginning!

83
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:49,618
Because of Aoey,

84
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:52,198
I had to cut my beautiful hair!

85
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,052
Gen

86
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:57,212
I’m sorry.

87
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:59,204
I didn’t mean it.

88
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:00,507
We’re still friends….

89
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:03,750
No!! I don’t consider you as my friend.

90
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,392
Get lost.

91
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:08,441
And don’t ever show your face near me again!!!

92
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,217
Oh,

93
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:22,731
Aoey….

94
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:24,883
and so…

95
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,259
How are you?

96
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:28,276
I’m fine.

97
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:32,177
Then… why are you calling me?

98
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:32,987
Well..

99
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:34,630
I’m coming to Bangkok.

100
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:37,048
Probably arrive tomorrow.

101
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,456
Are you free?

102
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:40,772
I know it’s quite a hustle

103
00:05:40,797 --> 00:05:42,515
but if you’re busy then…

104
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,070
Hmm….

105
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:44,783
wanna meet up, right?

106
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:45,998
Sure,

107
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:46,990
where?

108
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,713
I’ll arrive at the bus station.

109
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:52,645
We can meet wherever

110
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,176
you’re comfortable.

111
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:55,236
Well….

112
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:57,052
I’ll add you on Line by this phone number

113
00:05:57,077 --> 00:06:00,959
I’ll send you a location around 11 AM.

114
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:02,090
Sure

115
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:02,698
Umm,

116
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:03,278
Ok

117
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:03,897
see you.

118
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,903
[Gen, wanna have breakfast tomorrow at 9 AM?]

119
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:20,340
No!

120
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:24,320
I'm busy

121
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,216
This card says you'll meet your soulmate.

122
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:30,979
Woman.

123
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:32,019
A small one!

124
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:00,426
During the long holiday,

125
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,299
let’s take a trip to the beach.

126
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:05,485
I’ve booked the whole resort and a luxurious yacht.

127
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,094
And if you like it,

128
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,070
I can buy it all for you.

129
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:13,390
I really want you to try Lobster sashimi

130
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:15,441
from a Michelin chef that I know.

131
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:17,288
Enough.

132
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:20,181
Please stop in front

133
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,033
I’ve changed my mind. I’m not going to eat with you anymore.

134
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:22,832
What?

135
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:23,692
Hold on, Gen.

136
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:26,117
And don’t bother meeting me again.

137
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:27,585
We’re done.

138
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,173
Bye.

139
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:29,897
Gen

140
00:07:29,922 --> 00:07:31,711
you can’t do me like this.

141
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:34,229
Don’t you know who my father is?

142
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:38,494
He owns one of the largest spiritual goods companies in Thailand

143
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,370
and my mother is....

144
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:42,342
So what?

145
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:45,043
If you’re going to brag about your parents.

146
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:46,432
then do you even know who my parents are?

147
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:49,427
Even the ministers respect them.

148
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:50,290
Now, stop the car,

149
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:51,303
I wanna get out.

150
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:52,534
I...

151
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,450
I won’t stop.

152
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:54,713
Stop!

153
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:56,701
If you keep acting crazy

154
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,525
with just a snap of my fingers,

155
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,152
I can ruin your entire family business.

156
00:08:00,177 --> 00:08:01,457
I’m not joking though.

157
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,544
try me if you want.

158
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:03,894
But Gen….

159
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,846
Don’t defy me.

160
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:07,302
I hate that.

161
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:22,544
Damn it!

162
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:49,636
Wow

163
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,899
almost didn’t recognize you because of your beauty.

164
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:53,113
What are you looking at?

165
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:03,671
Gen

166
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:05,354
it’s me, Aoey.

167
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:07,172
Aoey.

168
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,550
Aoey

169
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:41,421
just wait over there!

170
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,272
Over there?

171
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:43,104
Yes

172
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,550
keep running around like this and when do we talk.

173
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:05,641
Have you eaten yet?

174
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,204
Are you hungry?

175
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:07,625
Let’s grab something to eat.

176
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,982
I’ll treat you.

177
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:10,260
It’s okay.

178
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:12,034
Don’t mind me.

179
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,422
Why?

180
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,711
We’re friends, right?

181
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:18,385
Pick any place you like and don’t worry about price, I can pay for you.

182
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:20,733
Let’s eat quickly

183
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:22,413
I wanna go back and watch series.

184
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,208
Is there...

185
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:26,104
a Thai restaurant around here?

186
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:27,172
Of course!

187
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:29,527
Let’s go, shall we?

188
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:36,884
Come on!

189
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:50,150
By the way

190
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:52,722
what’re you doing here

191
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:54,161
and where did you get my number?

192
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,513
I got it from See.

193
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:57,576
Do you remember her?

194
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:00,156
Our classmate from Korat.

195
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,601
Of course.

196
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:03,863
So…what brings you to Bangkok?

197
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:04,737
Umm…

198
00:11:06,258 --> 00:11:09,764
This place is very famous for their sticky rice with mango, you know.

199
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:10,752
Miss,

200
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:13,816
one order of sticky rice with mango, please.

201
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,206
Yes, miss.

202
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:28,752
I just wanna see you.

203
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:31,345
It’s been so long since we last met,

204
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:35,605
and I have something for you.

205
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,080
I’ve been meaning to give it to you since then,

206
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:51,925
but you left for Bangkok so suddenly.

207
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,902
So, I didn’t get the chance.

208
00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:03,967
What is it?

209
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:06,327
It’s called a “louse comb.”

210
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:07,751
It’s for getting rid of lice.

211
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:08,450
What??

212
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:12,247
I’m giving it to you as a keepsake.

213
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:15,019
Hopefully, when you see it,

214
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:16,506
you’ll think of me.

215
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:17,641
What the heck?

216
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,379
Who gives such a gift?

217
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,913
So, how long are you staying in Bangkok

218
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:37,733
and where?

219
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,884
Umm…

220
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:40,081
well,

221
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:41,764
not long.

222
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:45,421
I’m staying at my relatives’ place  nearby.

223
00:12:53,726 --> 00:12:55,415
Here you go, miss!

224
00:12:58,664 --> 00:12:59,859
Wow,

225
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:01,534
it looks so delicious!

226
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,311
Hmph

227
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,671
are these “Okrong” mangoes?

228
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:13,712
I forgot to ask them to separate the coconut milk and bean.

229
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:15,737
And it so freaking big.

230
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,621
And it so freaking big. It’s hard   to eat

231
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:15,820
Gen, is something wrong with my face?

232
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,609
What?...

233
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:19,132
Nah.

234
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:25,804
Let’s eat the sticky rice with mango.

235
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:27,007
It’s really good.

236
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,387
I’ll drop you off.

237
00:14:43,412 --> 00:14:46,002
So, where’s the relative’s house you mentioned?

238
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,848
No need.

239
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:50,148
I’ll just call a taxi.

240
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,453
Umm..

241
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:52,763
Thanks, Gen

242
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:54,536
See you

243
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:28,841
Damn it

244
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,356
now where do I go?

245
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:33,472
I shouldn’t lied to her.

246
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:34,596
F*ck it

247
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:36,199
she really humiliated me.

248
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:38,368
That woman is so f*cking arrogant.

249
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:39,912
Bangkok, really?

250
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:42,653
Where will I sleep tonight?

251
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:52,637
F*ck!!!!

252
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:53,192
Watch where you’re going!!

253
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:54,033
I’m really sorry.

254
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,629
I didn’t mean to...

255
00:15:57,477 --> 00:15:58,566
I’m sorry.

256
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:02,578
You didn’t mean to but my phone screen is broken.

257
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:04,304
How are you going to make up for it?

258
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:05,723
How much is it?

259
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:07,181
But I

260
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:08,983
But I only have 500 baht on me.

261
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:12,350
500 baht, are you kidding me?

262
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,165
How about this

263
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,487
have dinner with me to make it up.

264
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:18,211
Please don’t be angry.

265
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:19,749
I really didn’t mean to...

266
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:25,057
Hey!!!

267
00:16:25,974 --> 00:16:26,991
F*ck off!!

268
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:28,174
Are you trying to hurt a woman?

269
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,357
She broke my stuff

270
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:30,816
so she has to pay for it.

271
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:31,921
Girl!

272
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:34,514
it’s your fault so, you will pay, right?

273
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:35,554
It’s just a cracked screen protector

274
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,047
not the actual screen.

275
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:39,269
Don’t try to scam her, idiot.

276
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:45,896
Damn it!!

277
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:05,899
Are you okay, dear?

278
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,117
Miss, are you alright?

279
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:08,417
Are you hurt?

280
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:10,480
Miss!

281
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,066
Didn’t you say you were going to take a taxi?

282
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:45,908
If you have nowhere to go why don’t say it?

283
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:47,644
Why did you have to lie?

284
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:49,716
if I told you that I have nowhere to go.

285
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,947
I don’t wanna bother you

286
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:56,476
Why do you always have to be so considerate?

287
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,452
You’re lice-free now, right?

288
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:03,006
Yes...

289
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,847
I’m lice-free now.

290
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:06,668
So, how much money do you have on you?

291
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:08,078
520 Baht…

292
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:09,088
Huh?

293
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:11,797
Do you think you can survive in Bangkok with that?

294
00:18:11,822 --> 00:18:13,448
Come and stay with me.

295
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:14,698
But…

296
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:15,646
Shut up!

297
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:17,742
No objections

298
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,112
and don’t defy me.

299
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:21,682
I don’t like it.

300
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,134
Somkit

301
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,155
please have the driver pick me up.

302
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,924
I’ll send you the location.

303
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:35,617
Thanks.

304
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:41,825
Don’t stand there like a fool.

305
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,984
Come!

306
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:27,039
Put your bag down

307
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:28,420
and let’s talk.

308
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:43,454
Honestly

309
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:44,847
If you’re not staying here

310
00:19:44,872 --> 00:19:46,200
where were you planning to sleep?

311
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:49,823
If it comes to that then

312
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:51,603
I plan to sleep in the temple.

313
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:53,506
Stop right there.

314
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:55,292
If it’s come to sleeping at a temple

315
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:56,950
then you’re sleeping here with me.

316
00:19:56,975 --> 00:19:58,286
Sleeping with you?

317
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:01,244
I mean, in my room, of course.

318
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,898
Oh

319
00:20:05,526 --> 00:20:05,947
um...

320
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,138
um...

321
00:20:09,122 --> 00:20:09,503
um...

322
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:12,378
sure, but let me at least help clean the place to show my gratitude.

323
00:20:12,403 --> 00:20:13,365
Whatever!

324
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,818
Do whatever you want,

325
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:17,230
but I’m not helping with the cleaning.

326
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,361
Sure thing.

327
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,085
Cleaning is my professional.

328
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:27,261
There too!

329
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,365
Up top!

330
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:32,128
That corner as well.

331
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:56,145
What are you doing?

332
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,471
Where are you taking that pillow?

333
00:20:58,369 --> 00:20:59,791
I’m going to sleep on the floor.

334
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:01,729
Just sleep on the bed with me.

335
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:02,921
Why sleep on the floor?

336
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:05,074
Put the pillow back.

337
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:08,495
I’m ordering you.

338
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:09,992
Don’t defy me.

339
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:19,630
That comb you gave me,

340
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:20,321
does it work?

341
00:21:22,662 --> 00:21:23,455
Sure,

342
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:27,111
do you want me to comb your hair for you?

343
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:28,240
That’d be nice.

344
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,742
No one’s combed my hair in a long time.

345
00:21:52,964 --> 00:21:56,695
Reminds me of when we were kids,

346
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,966
and

347
00:21:57,991 --> 00:21:59,760
I used to do your hair every morning.

348
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,323
Umm.

349
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:20,070
And….

350
00:22:21,795 --> 00:22:23,963
other than me,

351
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:27,020
did anyone else ever do your hair?

352
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:30,306
No one else but you.

353
00:22:57,731 --> 00:22:59,207
(sighs)

354
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,701
Aoey,

355
00:23:40,726 --> 00:23:42,313
I’m here.

356
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,163
Aoey,

357
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,021
It’s me, Gen.

358
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,715
Don’t be scared.

359
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,008
I will always be here for you.

360
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,754
Aoey!

361
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:49,581
Hmm?

362
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:51,131
I’m heading out now

363
00:25:51,156 --> 00:25:52,489
and will be back around noon.

364
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:25,423
Hello!

365
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:29,569
Where do you plan to go with all that cloth?

366
00:26:29,928 --> 00:26:31,653
I’m moving back to my condo, mom.

367
00:26:31,678 --> 00:26:33,184
I’m busy with work,

368
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,105
so I might not come back home often.

369
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,469
Didn’t I tell you to find a partner?

370
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:39,979
So, you can help each other.

371
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,817
No one really has caught my eye yet

372
00:26:43,842 --> 00:26:45,501
or should I say they’re all useless.

373
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,934
That’s not good.

374
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:50,564
You’ll graduate next year.

375
00:26:51,262 --> 00:26:56,218
Please, lower your standards a bit and pick someone from your list.

376
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:57,131
No way.

377
00:26:57,156 --> 00:26:58,401
I’ve gone through my list,

378
00:26:58,426 --> 00:27:00,219
and there’s still no one good enough.

379
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,190
Or...

380
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:10,425
are you going to end up with a girl, just like the fortune teller said?

381
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:11,726
Hold on,

382
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:14,456
I won’t allow it.

383
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:17,253
I want to see you marry a man.

384
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:22,412
I’ll throw the grandest,

385
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:24,405
biggest wedding

386
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,636
in Thailand just for you!

387
00:27:27,972 --> 00:27:32,240
Even the ministers and the prime minister will have to come.

388
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:33,019
Wouldn’t that be great?

389
00:27:35,575 --> 00:27:36,400
Mom..!

390
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:37,106
Hmm?

391
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,360
What if...

392
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:42,442
I can’t find the perfect son-in-law for you

393
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:46,065
but instead fall for a woman and run away with her?

394
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:47,884
What would you do then?

395
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:50,935
If that happens,

396
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,492
I’ll cut you off from the inheritance

397
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:55,875
and give everything to Great.

398
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,248
Lucky,

399
00:27:57,273 --> 00:27:58,184
Oh!

400
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,461
Go ahead.

401
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:01,179
I already have a car,

402
00:28:01,204 --> 00:28:02,123
a condo,

403
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:03,869
and money in my account.

404
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,043
Sorry girl

405
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:11,879
but I will have to take all that back.

406
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,604
So mean, mommy.

407
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:16,448
Is that so?

408
00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:17,274
Just….

409
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,396
trust me mom,

410
00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:20,818
your beautiful daughter here

411
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:23,794
will find the perfect son-in-law for you

412
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:25,054
Wow,

413
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:25,942
such a capable girl!

414
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:30,285
Always find the tiniest escape route to get out of any problem.

415
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,665
It’s because I’m your daughter.

416
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,564
Clever girl!

417
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:34,947
I’m going to finish packing.

418
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:35,645
Go on, dear.

419
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,039
Hmm…

420
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:49,389
I’ve never seen you wear these clothes before.

421
00:28:49,414 --> 00:28:50,793
Are you taking them too?

422
00:28:50,818 --> 00:28:52,880
Well….because of that which is why

423
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,834
I wanna wear them.

424
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,272
Anyway, I need to go back to work.

425
00:28:58,807 --> 00:28:59,767
Bye bye mom.

426
00:29:05,835 --> 00:29:06,581
Aoey…

427
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:17,445
Aoey…

428
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:29,650
Aoey…

429
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:40,334
Aoey…

430
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:03,787
Thank you for letting me stay.

431
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:07,109
I’ll reach out once I find a place.

432
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:09,774
I’m happy to have seen you again, Gen.

433
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:16,444
Is this how you repay my kindness

434
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:39,051
Forget it!

435
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:41,864
I don’t care anymore.

436
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,489
Where could she have gone?

437
00:30:57,514 --> 00:30:58,434
That idiot...

438
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:06,011
If you’re not staying here, where were you planning to sleep?

439
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:07,804
I plan to sleep in the temple.

440
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:14,126
Temple near me.

441
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:45,071
Ah!

442
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:46,771
Why didn’t you listen?

443
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:48,970
I told you to stay at the condo for as long as you need!

444
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,866
I’m sorry

445
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,442
but I don’t wanna bother you.

446
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:01,833
So, I thought I’d look for a new place.

447
00:32:02,907 --> 00:32:03,716
A temple?

448
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,123
Umm,

449
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:07,330
it’s just temporally.

450
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:09,753
Until, I find a job….

451
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:10,737
What?

452
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,834
Still talk back?

453
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:14,917
Do you really think you can survive with just 500 baht?

454
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,215
Are you going to beg for food here?

455
00:32:17,845 --> 00:32:22,026
Don’t just stand there in the sun. Come into the shade first

456
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:23,352
or you’ll get sick.

457
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:27,575
I’m really sorry

458
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:30,307
for making you worry so much.

459
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:36,427
Fine then let’s go back to my condo.

460
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:39,517
And don’t defy me again.

461
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,470
I don’t like it.

462
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,735
I’m not trying to defy you,

463
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,911
but staying for free... it feels wrong.

464
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:48,565
Who said it’s for free?

465
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:52,330
You’ll clean the room,

466
00:32:52,355 --> 00:32:53,981
cook for me

467
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,046
That’s the deal for staying.

468
00:32:58,266 --> 00:32:59,607
Alright,

469
00:33:00,614 --> 00:33:01,119
but...

470
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:04,410
this feels just like

471
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:09,112
when we played house as kids.

472
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,506
I always ended up being the maid.

473
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,739
Funny how life turned out that way after all.

474
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:18,369
Don’t call yourself a maid.

475
00:33:19,142 --> 00:33:20,621
You’re just working for your stay.

476
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:23,050
Don’t make me sound like the villain here.

477
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:26,105
Now, let’s go.

478
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:27,949
Hold on, Gen.

479
00:33:28,722 --> 00:33:29,476
What now?

480
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:31,773
Let me pick up my bread first.

481
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:33,424
I bought it but haven’t eaten it yet.

482
00:33:34,277 --> 00:33:35,808
It already fell on the ground

483
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,581
so just leave it for the birds.

484
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:39,043
If you wanna eat

485
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:41,086
that badly then I will get it for you on the way back.

486
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:43,625
Or I could buy the whole shop for you.

487
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,580
Ok,

488
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,326
but

489
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,010
let me feed the birds first.

490
00:34:31,265 --> 00:34:32,011
Who is it?

491
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:35,370
Your dear little brother!

492
00:34:36,238 --> 00:34:36,810
You jerk...

493
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:37,873
It’s so hot here!

494
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:38,976
Hurry up!!

495
00:34:39,638 --> 00:34:41,058
Stay calm,

496
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,606
and don’t look suspicious.

497
00:34:51,482 --> 00:34:52,346
Why are you here?

498
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,602
And what happened to your face?

499
00:34:54,627 --> 00:34:55,666
Did you get into a fight with a dog?

500
00:34:56,745 --> 00:34:57,882
Whoa,

501
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:59,726
is that how you greet your little bro?

502
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:01,484
I didn’t get into a fight with a dog.

503
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:03,032
Just got into a little trouble.

504
00:35:03,547 --> 00:35:05,102
And it’s not like I wanted to visit you.

505
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:06,835
Mom asked me to drop off some food.

506
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:10,387
Can I come in? It is heavy!

507
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:19,042
Fine, come in.

508
00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:25,669
Oh,

509
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,650
the girl from the other day.

510
00:35:28,785 --> 00:35:30,034
She’s my friend.

511
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:32,265
Do you remember me?

512
00:35:33,554 --> 00:35:34,673
Oh,

513
00:35:34,698 --> 00:35:36,096
I do.

514
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:37,470
We met the other day.

515
00:35:38,141 --> 00:35:39,535
Thanks for your help,

516
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,980
and sorry for running off like that.

517
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,107
Don’t worry.

518
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:46,131
I’m Great, by the way.

519
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:48,732
I’m Aoey.

520
00:35:48,757 --> 00:35:50,915
Just call me Aoey.

521
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:54,851
When did you two meet?

522
00:35:56,748 --> 00:35:57,700
The other day.

523
00:35:58,509 --> 00:35:59,734
I wasn’t asking you,

524
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:01,790
I was asking her.

525
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:05,269
2 days ago after we separated.

526
00:36:05,877 --> 00:36:07,338
I almost got attacked

527
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:09,099
but luckily

528
00:36:09,491 --> 00:36:11,381
he helped me.

529
00:36:11,406 --> 00:36:13,422
If he hadn’t, I would’ve been in big trouble.

530
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,206
How did a nice girl like you

531
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:21,301
end up with someone like Gen?

532
00:36:21,872 --> 00:36:26,937
So, mean and bossy just like a witch.

533
00:36:27,764 --> 00:36:29,325
If I’m a witch,

534
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,404
then you’re a demon.

535
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:33,035
See that?

536
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:35,873
See that?

537
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,191
See that?

538
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:55,514
Aoey,

539
00:37:56,832 --> 00:37:58,196
are you ok?

540
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:01,321
I’m sorry

541
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,560
for breaking your family photo

542
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,095
and for hurting Great.

543
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:11,319
It’s fine.

544
00:38:12,178 --> 00:38:13,575
You didn’t mean to.

545
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:15,782
As a matter of fact,

546
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:17,600
Great’s head is hard as a rock.

547
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,370
As for the photo frame,

548
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:23,377
I’ll have uncle Somkit buy a new one tomorrow.

549
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:26,149
Even if you replace the frame,

550
00:38:26,954 --> 00:38:28,771
it won’t be the same

551
00:38:29,936 --> 00:38:32,349
It's the picture inside that counts,

552
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:34,939
not the frame.

553
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:37,782
Don’t worry about it.

554
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:46,403
You’re right.

555
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,424
What’s important is inside,

556
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,389
just like you.

557
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:57,606
You seem harsh on the outside

558
00:38:57,631 --> 00:39:00,079
but are kind inside.

559
00:39:02,362 --> 00:39:03,583
Are you subtly insulting me?

560
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:09,621
By the way,

561
00:39:12,346 --> 00:39:17,742
Why don’t you like people touching you?

562
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:21,964
I just feel like...

563
00:39:23,871 --> 00:39:26,267
physical contact is dirty,

564
00:39:29,293 --> 00:39:31,033
so I avoid it.

565
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:33,762
So, am I dirty too?

566
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:36,071
No,

567
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:38,743
I mean not at all.

568
00:39:40,971 --> 00:39:42,264
I mean...

569
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:48,155
It’s just me

570
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:50,082
that is dirty…

571
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,598
and I don’t want to taint you.

572
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:42,599
You’ve been so kind to me.

573
00:40:46,282 --> 00:40:49,916
You’re like an angel to me.

574
00:40:55,645 --> 00:40:57,310
Someone as mean as me?

575
00:40:57,335 --> 00:40:58,282
An angel?

576
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,586
Well,

577
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:04,580
you’re my only angel.

578
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:23,158
Sis,

579
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:26,052
will your friend stay with you?

580
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,629
She came from out of town

581
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,264
and has nowhere to go,

582
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,368
so I’m letting her stay here.

583
00:41:33,393 --> 00:41:34,679
Hmm…

584
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:36,997
But don’t let mom know for now.

585
00:41:37,979 --> 00:41:39,263
Why?

586
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,796
She usually doesn’t have an issue about this kind of thing.

587
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:45,016
You will meet your soulmate.

588
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:46,682
Women!

589
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:48,350
A tiny one!

590
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:49,841
Or...

591
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:53,498
are you going to end up with a girl, just like the fortune teller said?

592
00:41:53,523 --> 00:41:55,381
I won’t allow it.

593
00:41:57,618 --> 00:41:58,555
Sis?

594
00:41:59,992 --> 00:42:00,738
Are you ok?

595
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:03,642
Nah.

596
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,874
I just don’t want mom to know right now.

597
00:42:07,374 --> 00:42:08,771
Hmm…..

598
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:10,895
Kind of suspicious,though.

599
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,388
If you haven’t done anything wrong,

600
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:13,507
why hide it?

601
00:42:14,462 --> 00:42:15,653
Can you stay out of it for once?

602
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:18,092
Just know that Aoey is staying with me,

603
00:42:18,117 --> 00:42:19,140
and that’s it.

604
00:42:19,165 --> 00:42:20,109
End of story.

605
00:42:21,644 --> 00:42:22,462
leave!

606
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,080
Fine,

607
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:25,573
but on one condition.

608
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:29,744
Help me hook up with her.

609
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:30,732
Please,

610
00:42:31,372 --> 00:42:32,793
sis! Please!!!

611
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:36,402
Come on…why don’t you find someone your own age?

612
00:42:36,998 --> 00:42:38,411
She’s older than you, you see?

613
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:40,173
No way!!

614
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,012
She is my dream girl.

615
00:42:43,425 --> 00:42:45,393
More like love at first sight

616
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:48,344
and struck by cupid’s arrow.

617
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,095
Gross! You sound like an old man.

618
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,302
I’m not helping you

619
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:57,482
Fine!

620
00:42:57,507 --> 00:42:58,704
But if you don’t help me,

621
00:42:58,729 --> 00:43:00,587
the fact that you’re not living alone

622
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:02,565
might somehow reach mommy though.

623
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,764
Ugh…

624
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,995
go ahead,

625
00:43:05,982 --> 00:43:07,744
tell her now

626
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:11,405
and you’ll never ever have a chance to talk with Aoey again!

627
00:43:11,611 --> 00:43:13,460
Ouch….Fine,

628
00:43:13,485 --> 00:43:14,619
I will keep my mouth shut.

629
00:43:15,082 --> 00:43:18,963
But I really like her definitely love at first sight.

630
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:21,291
Just like my dream girl.

631
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,825
Well... I guess

632
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:29,537
if you behave yourself for 3-4 months,

633
00:43:29,562 --> 00:43:31,315
I might change my mind.

634
00:43:32,071 --> 00:43:33,079
Ok.

635
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,369
Deal!!

636
00:43:35,638 --> 00:43:36,329
Hmm.

637
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:37,887
Now go!

638
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:39,895
What?

639
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:41,350
Just to make sure, sis.

640
00:43:42,592 --> 00:43:44,290
Why are you so protective of Aoey?

641
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:50,479
Why do you have so many questions?

642
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:51,464
Just go.

643
00:43:51,805 --> 00:43:52,710
So, annoying.

644
00:43:52,735 --> 00:43:53,839
Poor Aoey,

645
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,617
having to live with someone like you.

646
00:44:49,826 --> 00:44:50,642
Aoey,

647
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,287
it’s me, Gen.

648
00:45:24,382 --> 00:45:25,541
Thank you,

649
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:29,327
my angel.

650
00:45:35,631 --> 00:45:36,480
Fine,

651
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:38,761
even if I’m a mean witch to the whole world

652
00:45:39,295 --> 00:45:41,215
but I’ll be an angel just for you,

653
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:42,567
Glasses Girl.

654
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:26,802
This women

655
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:31,749
will slowly change the empress card.

656
00:46:31,774 --> 00:46:33,808
From a wicked witch,

657
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:36,805
she'll become a better person.

658
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:40,785
That's the kind of person who has the qualities

659
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,667
to be the life partner of your daughter."

660
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:48,829
Fortune teller

661
00:46:48,854 --> 00:46:52,163
Do you really think someone like her can be better?

662
00:46:52,787 --> 00:46:55,462
A coin always has two sides.

663
00:46:56,052 --> 00:46:58,377
It might not be good for us,

664
00:46:58,402 --> 00:47:00,980
but it could be good for someone else.

665
00:47:01,728 --> 00:47:03,072
Thank you so much.

666
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:06,235
Good luck.

667
00:47:13,187 --> 00:47:14,845
So many customers today.

668
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,281
Have you eaten yet, Mom?"

669
00:47:16,306 --> 00:47:17,671
Not yet. What do you have for me?

670
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:19,814
I brought lots of snacks for you, Mom!

671
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:25,084
Aoey!

672
00:47:25,545 --> 00:47:25,895
Yes?

673
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:30,080
Do you realize that

674
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:31,993
you're such a cute person?

675
00:47:44,664 --> 00:47:45,617
Cute?

676
00:47:45,942 --> 00:47:47,014
Then do you love it?

677
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:48,777
Hmm??

678
00:48:35,129 --> 00:48:36,033
Everyone,

679
00:48:36,058 --> 00:48:37,549
today, we have a new friend.

680
00:48:38,687 --> 00:48:40,608
Could you please introduce yourself?

681
00:48:41,284 --> 00:48:42,204
Hi,

682
00:48:42,229 --> 00:48:44,696
my name is Genlong Thanasap Arnan.

683
00:48:45,326 --> 00:48:46,811
Just call me Gen.

684
00:48:47,186 --> 00:48:48,480
I'm from Bangkok.

685
00:48:48,798 --> 00:48:50,122
My family is very rich.

686
00:48:50,147 --> 00:48:51,696
We could even buy the school if we wanted to.

687
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:54,140
WOWWWW!!!!!!

688
00:49:03,797 --> 00:49:05,851
Get up! I will sit here!

689
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,606
But this is my seat.

690
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:09,328
But I’m, Genlong!

691
00:49:09,353 --> 00:49:11,463
I will sit here and don’t defy me!

692
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:12,229
Uh…

693
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:13,705
See,

694
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,262
please go sit with Vivian first.

695
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:17,096
Let Genlong sit here.

696
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:18,311
Yes.

697
00:49:30,658 --> 00:49:31,880
What’s your name?

698
00:49:31,905 --> 00:49:35,378
Aoey, just call me Aoey.

699
00:49:35,403 --> 00:49:36,886
Wanna play with me?

700
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:40,823
Umm….

701
00:49:41,142 --> 00:49:42,015
sure, I do.

702
00:49:42,669 --> 00:49:43,715
Great!

703
00:49:43,749 --> 00:49:45,476
But judging from your clothes,

704
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:47,047
you look poor.

705
00:49:47,072 --> 00:49:49,945
If you're going to play with me, you should play the role of a maid.

706
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:50,970
From now on,

707
00:49:50,995 --> 00:49:52,526
you'll be my maid."

708
00:49:52,877 --> 00:49:54,702
I’m not!

709
00:49:54,727 --> 00:49:55,661
Alright,

710
00:49:55,686 --> 00:49:57,076
starting today,

711
00:49:57,101 --> 00:49:59,140
you have to do my homework first.

712
00:49:59,642 --> 00:50:02,651
Elementary school homework is too easy.

713
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:03,885
I don’t like it.

714
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,679
I think it’s for stupid people.

715
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,565
I….

716
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,955
no…

717
00:50:11,435 --> 00:50:12,817
Here's your payment.

718
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:15,708
A premium-grade chocolate.

719
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:17,725
It’s not available for sale in Thailand though.
