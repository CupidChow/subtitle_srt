1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,960
Hey, Ten.

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,440
Sorry,

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,800
- I'll just put the novels here.
- Of course, thanks.

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,680
Aoey, are you alright?

5
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,800
Let's walk over there.

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,240
We'll try having Ten touch you

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,800
to see if you're still anxious.

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,480
Are you ready?

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,760
Ready?

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,360
Wow! Aoey!

11
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,120
You want this comb, Aoey?

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,280
Let's look at those clothes over there.

13
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,080
- They all look great.
- Okay, let's go.

14
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,640
I want you to move to Oslo with me.

15
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
If you don't want to,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,600
I want you to marry Ten,

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,440
so that I don't have to worry about you.

18
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,480
I promise to take care of her
as best as I can.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,680
The Big Boss in the frozen food industry
or Boss Wut

20
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,880
has been shot while in his car.

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,000
- Aoey, let's eat.
- Police believe this is due to
conflicts in businesses.

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,240
Witnesses were on the scene.

23
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,880
- Ten.
- Huh?

24
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,320
You can go now.

25
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,920
How are you now?

26
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,960
Better now?

27
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
Do you want me to be with you?

28
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,320
It's okay.
I want to be alone.

29
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,840
Thank you for the ride.

30
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,200
Why didn't you tell me the artist was Gen?

31
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,040
You didn't really know Gen drew that?

32
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,960
You two haven't seen each other
for a long time,

33
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,240
and you're about to get married.

34
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,280
Don't you think
you should settle it with her?

35
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,360
I guess you've forgotten
what she had done to me.

36
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,280
But you two were once loving friends.

37
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,800
You know where she's staying, right?

38
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,240
Aoey?

39
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,280
Aoey, what is it?

40
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,680
You were gone for three years.
Why come back now?

41
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,640
I'm here for the infringement.

42
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,280
I thought you knew I was the artist.

43
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,440
How was I supposed to know?

44
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:34,720
Maybe it's you who knows well
that your art will resemble my work?

45
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,720
Nonetheless, you still did it.

46
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,080
Be honest,

47
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,080
when will you stop haunting me?

48
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,120
Who's haunting whom?

49
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,320
You wanted to sue me, so here I am.

50
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,640
You even splashed water on me.

51
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,200
That doesn't even amount

52
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,720
to what you did to me.

53
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,440
During these three years,

54
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,680
have you even thought
about what's happening to me?

55
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,480
I was happy living there.

56
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,160
Why should I care
about the hard time with you?

57
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,280
You never changed.

58
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
You're selfish.
You only think about yourself.

59
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,720
And you're making a joke out of it?

60
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,040
You're not angry at her, right?

61
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
How can I be?

62
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,600
Aside from my family,

63
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,920
the only person
whom I can forgive unconditionally

64
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,480
would be her.

65
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,480
You forgive her,

66
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,600
but will she do the same for you?

67
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,360
It'd be great if she doesn't.

68
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
That way, she can restart her life
with someone better.

69
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
And I ...

70
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,320
will keep all these feelings to myself.

71
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,640
I came back to Thailand for work.

72
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,400
I just happened to learn
about a friend's wedding.

73
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,880
I figured I should stop by.

74
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,200
And you never stop to ask
why I decided to get married?

75
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,800
Why would I question it?

76
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,240
People marry when they're in love.

77
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,400
Ten seems like a nice guy.

78
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,160
Your mom got married
and now lives with a new family.

79
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,280
Once you get married,
everything will be settled.

80
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,840
- You'll be happy.
- How did you know that?

81
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,880
You were never here.
What do you even know?

82
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,120
This is not over.

83
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,560
I'll hurt you way worse than you hurt me.

84
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,800
You said we'll be together forever!
Gen!

85
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,360
Gen!

86
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,600
- Hello.
- Someone wants to see you.

87
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,880
His name is Ten.

88
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,600
Who?

89
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,440
It's Mr. Ten.

90
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,280
Have him wait.
I'll go see him right away.

91
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,800
Hello.

92
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,080
I'm Ten.
We met yesterday

93
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,680
- when Aoey ...
- I remember.

94
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm sorry for that.

95
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,760
It's fine.
How can I help?

96
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,920
Aoey disappeared last night.

97
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,040
I tried to find and contact her
but to no avail.

98
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,680
I couldn't find her.

99
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,280
- Did you ask Dr. Thot?
- I did.

100
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,680
He said that she asked
about where you're staying.

101
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,440
So, I want to know if you met her last night.

102
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,760
We did, but she returned the same night.

103
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,840
I'm very worried about her.

104
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,000
Ever since I knew her,
she had never been gone this long.

105
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,680
I'll help you find her, too.

106
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,960
Thank you.
Call me if there's any update.

107
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,040
Here's my number.

108
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,280
Okay.

109
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,040
Doctor,

110
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,120
I went to yesterday's restaurant,
but I didn't find her.

111
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Ten told me to go look
at her favourite coffee shop.

112
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,720
She wasn't there either.

113
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,240
Can you help me think where she could be?

114
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,600
I need to hang up, Doctor.

115
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,560
I think I know where she is.

116
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,480
Aoey.

117
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,560
Why did you come here?

118
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,520
I should be the one asking you.

119
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,720
None of your business.

120
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,920
How did you know I'm here?

121
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,400
You always run away to the same old temple.

122
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,200
I can go wherever I want.

123
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,560
What does it have to do with you?

124
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,480
Well, I didn't want to get involved,

125
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,080
but your soon-to-be groom
asked me to help find you.

126
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,400
You're making everyone worried.

127
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,680
What does it have to do with you?

128
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,440
Why did you look for me?

129
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
From the past until now,

130
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,760
if you let me walk on my own path,

131
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,000
our relationship would be just

132
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,560
two elementary school friends
who used to be best friends.

133
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,800
Had this not worried anyone,
I would just let you be.

134
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,800
I don't care.
You're coming with me.

135
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,040
No, leave me here.

136
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,720
Come with me. Don't be stubborn.
Get up.

137
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,120
Hey! I said leave me here!

138
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,640
Get up.
Don't be stubborn.

139
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,640
Leave me.

140
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,040
You're sick and still talk like that?

141
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,520
Come.

142
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,840
Get away from me.

143
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,120
Don't touch me!

144
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Are you sure you don't want me
to drive you to a doctor?

145
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,280
Stop messing with me.

146
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,560
I'll go to my room.

147
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,520
I'll walk with you.

148
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,000
You can go now.

149
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,080
I need to wipe you with a wet cloth.

150
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,760
Aoey.

151
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,720
You're having a bad fever.
Why keep being stubborn?

152
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,840
Stay still.

153
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,320
Just go already.

154
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,560
Take your medicine.

155
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,080
Will you do this peacefully?

156
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,400
No.

157
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,480
Don't make me force you.

158
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,240
Force me?

159
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,400
How?

160
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,400
Are you going to use your mouth to do that?

161
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,760
- Don't try me.
- Do it.

162
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,080
You won't dare.

163
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,480
I hope you get sick from this.

164
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,480
I just wanted to give you your medicine.

165
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,080
Ten seems very anxious about you.

166
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,840
I'm very glade

167
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,200
for you to have someone
taking good care of you.

168
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,400
Since when did you start caring about others?

169
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,440
You're done here.
Just go.

170
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
I won't go until you've slept.

171
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,080
There's no more fever.

172
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,480
Doctor, why did you ask to see me again?
What now?

173
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,760
You got me into trouble last time.

174
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,240
What do you mean?

175
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,800
You told Ten to ask me to help find Aoey.

176
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,640
- What is it now?
- I want you to go on a trip with me.

177
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,240
Are you okay?

178
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,240
Why did you invite me on a trip
out of everything?

179
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,520
It won't be your usual trip.

180
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,960
It's an outing of a publisher
that Aoey is working in.

181
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,280
- What does that have to do with me?
- Well,

182
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,000
how does it not?

183
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,120
You're our executive.

184
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,440
Huh?

185
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,920
Just think of this as a chance to settle
the copyright infringement with her.

186
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,880
Wait, since when
did I become an executive?

187
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
Remember when you gave me money,

188
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,440
telling me to take care of Aoey?

189
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,440
I just invested that money
to establish a publisher and publish her novel.

190
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,760
Do you know how good
the feedback we're getting is?

191
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,280
We have over ten writers under our wings.

192
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,440
How come I never knew about this?

193
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,920
Whatever.
It still has nothing to do with me.

194
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,880
You can just run it like you always do.

195
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,040
I don't need to know
that it was my money.

196
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,160
Gen, why keep the low profile?

197
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,680
The troubles your family faced are now gone.

198
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Besides, Aoey is about to get married.

199
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,440
Don't you want to go on a trip
with her for once?

200
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,280
Think carefully.

201
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,080
Once you return to Macao after this,

202
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,000
you'll never see her again.

203
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,240
Think of it as a final trip.

204
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,360
A farewell trip.

205
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,200
Sounds good?

206
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
Gen,

207
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,480
prepare yourself for this evening.

208
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,920
I'll introduce you to the writers
as one of our partners.

209
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,680
Get some rest now.
I'll see you in the evening.

210
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,040
Thank you.

211
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,600
Aoey, you still need to take those meds?

212
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,400
I thought you were done with it.

213
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,400
No.

214
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,200
This is not over yet.

215
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,880
What is Gen doing here?

216
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,280
Everyone,

217
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,320
this is Genlong.

218
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,400
She's a partner of our publisher.

219
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,840
Hello.

220
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,080
A partner?

221
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,200
Why did I never know about this?

222
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,240
Aoey,

223
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,320
the fund we use to publish your first novel

224
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,400
was Gen's.

225
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,560
Why?
You're disgusted

226
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,840
that my money brought you this far.

227
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,720
Gen!

228
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,040
I'll quit.

229
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,960
I'm not doing this anymore.

230
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,720
- Aoey, calm down.
- Aoey.

231
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,520
I need to go.

232
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,440
I hate to be here.

233
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,000
Aoey.

234
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,200
- Aoey!
- Aoey!

235
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,160
Guys, everything's fine.

236
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,640
They were just joking.

237
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,880
Just have fun!

238
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,760
- Let's take photos over there.
- More photos?

239
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,560
- Doctor Mean? Dokfai?
- Oh!

240
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,440
Gen!

241
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,440
Gen, what a coincidence.

242
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,920
What are you doing here?

243
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,840
We came to a seminar yesterday.

244
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,360
- What about you?
- Outing.

245
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,760
Oh.

246
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,520
How have you been?
It's been a long time.

247
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,800
I moved abroad with my family.

248
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,040
I just returned to run some errands.

249
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,120
What about Aoey?
How is she?

250
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,040
From the look of your face,
I guess it's not great?

251
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah.

252
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,600
If we never met,
that would be much better.

253
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,640
It would be best for both of us.

254
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,000
These three years are filled with troubles.

255
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,240
Or maybe I should just tell her how I feel?

256
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,080
What will you tell her?

257
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:03,640
I'll tell her that I miss her so much.

258
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,480
I want to hug her.
I want to apologise.

259
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,800
Gen, I must first hand it to you

260
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,200
on how to keep these feelings
to yourself so well.

261
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,480
If our love will hurt someone,

262
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,280
keeping it to yourself would be best.

263
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,920
I believe that you wanting to see Aoey

264
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,720
is likely because you want to
redeem yourself for what you've done.

265
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,960
If you do it and you think
it's moved out of your chest,

266
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,400
I truly think it's time you two
should go separate ways.

267
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,920
Yes.

268
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,760
And most importantly, Gen,

269
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,480
you should learn to forgive yourself.

270
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,760
You'll have to live a happy life.

271
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,520
The past can be remembered,
but we should not get stuck in it.

272
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,200
Mean and I will have to go.

273
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,360
If you're not rushing to return to Macao,
see us at our café.

274
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,880
We can talk more that way.

275
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,680
Sure.
I'll see you there if I get a chance.

276
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,120
Gen.

277
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,920
Why are you sitting here?

278
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,520
You know me.
I don't know how to act around people I don't know.

279
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,480
What about people you're close with?

280
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,720
Speaking of the devil.

281
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,080
Doctors these days are so good.

282
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,520
Before, no one could touch her.
Now?

283
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,480
She can't be peeled away from Ten.

284
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,480
And you're just rubbing it in.

285
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,200
I'm so sorry for what Aoey did.

286
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,520
Only you can calm me down, Ten.

287
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,800
Without you,
I wouldn't know what to do.

288
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,600
I think we should head back to the party.

289
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,160
We should go, too.

290
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,040
Gen,

291
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,360
- someone wants to see you.
- Who?

292
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,600
There.

293
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,840
- Hi, Gen.
- John.

294
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,360
- How did you come here?
- I miss you.

295
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,520
Doctor Thot, who is that?

296
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,720
Probably Gen's boyfriend.

297
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,720
Uh,

298
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,480
I need to go to the toilet.

299
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,520
Are you Aoey?

300
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,480
Yes.

301
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,480
I'm Mai.
I'm a writer in the same publisher as yours.

302
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,960
I just want to say that I really love your work.

303
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,280
I read all of them.

304
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,760
Really?
Thank you.

305
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:28,200
Can I ask you about your novel?

306
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,280
I've been wondering about something.

307
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,480
What is it?

308
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:40,320
About the one character who decided
to never love anyone again

309
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,680
just to wait for someone for three years

310
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,320
without ever receiving any contact
from that someone.

311
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,440
Do you think there are people like that
in real life?

312
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,360
I think ...

313
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,880
they only exist in fiction.

314
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,600
It was so touching.

315
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,760
I thought you really believed it existed.

316
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,720
The waiting-for-love kind of things.

317
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,360
It's just an imagination

318
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,920
that I wished were true.

319
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,400
Though,

320
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,080
where can you even find people like that?

321
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,080
- Thank you.
- Thank you. See you.

322
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,160
Everyone,

323
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,840
this is John.

324
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,080
He's Gen's boyfriend.

325
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,640
Gen, are you alright?

326
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,640
I'm good.

327
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,680
How did you even fly all the way here?

328
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,960
Someone probably sent you my location?

329
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,640
I have something really important
to tell you.

330
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,920
Can we go outside and talk?

331
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,920
Let's go.

332
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,600
Let's go.

333
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,640
That couple seems so nice.

334
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,960
Keep your eyes on them.
Something is going down.

335
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,120
I was so surprised
to see you here all of a sudden.

336
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,760
I have something to tell you.

337
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,760
My family has decided to move to Canada.

338
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,120
So, I won't see you again when I go to Macao?

339
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah, that's why I don't want
to waste time any longer.

340
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,320
Gen,

341
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,080
will you marry me?

342
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,840
Oh, that's so cute!

343
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,840
That's my glass!

344
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,680
I have to go.
I need to rest.

345
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,120
I'll walk with you.

346
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,320
Goodbye.

347
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,760
Let's go.

348
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,800
Keep it up.

349
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,280
Oh, Ten and Aoey.

350
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,120
Hey, Singh.

351
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,440
What are you doing here?

352
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,280
I'm here for my company's outing.

353
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,760
You're organising a wedding here?

354
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,000
Yeah, I'm helping a friend organise a wedding.

355
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,160
Wow, these flowers are really beautiful.

356
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,920
I hope my wedding flowers
are as beautiful as these.

357
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,960
Of course.

358
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,880
Anything you want, just name it.

359
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,000
- I'll make it happen.
- Wow.

360
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,760
You're too busy organising
someone else's wedding.

361
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,000
What about yours?

362
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,040
I don't have a boyfriend.

363
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,560
Yes, Mr. Tum.

364
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,960
I'm sorry, John.

365
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,640
I can't marry you.

366
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,680
I'm thankful for the feelings you have for me

367
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,760
and for what you've done for me.

368
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,840
I'm not surprised by your answer.

369
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,360
I figured, but ...

370
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,480
I just wanted to hear it from you.

371
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,160
I am truly sorry.

372
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,120
Don't think about it.

373
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,280
I want you to keep this ring.

374
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,920
You don't have to.

375
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,680
Please give this to someone
who really loves you.

376
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,800
Besides,

377
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,720
I don't deserve anything good at all.

378
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,440
Nothing good ever lasts with me.

379
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,680
I always lose them.

380
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,520
Are you okay?

381
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,080
I'm fine.

382
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,920
Are we still good friends after this?

383
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,200
Absolutely.
Why not?

384
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,280
Uh, Doctor Thot.

385
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,720
This is Singh.
He's an organiser for our wedding.

386
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,040
I know.

387
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,080
You two knew each other?

388
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,240
- Uh ...
- Yes, I know him very well.

389
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,440
I think I should bring Aoey
to get some rest.

390
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,120
I need to go.

391
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,120
How have you been?

392
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,840
I'm doing fine.

393
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,120
Are you still a doctor?

394
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,680
Yeah.

395
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,640
I'm here to help
with Gen's company's outing.

396
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,440
So,

397
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,640
you've decided to date Gen?

398
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,480
You said that

399
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,720
as if you don't know me.

400
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,000
Singh, please come help us inside.

401
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,440
Sure.
I'm coming.

402
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,520
I have to go now.

403
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,760
You can go to your room now.

404
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,360
No need to get me to my room.

405
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,560
I just want to take a walk by myself.

406
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,240
Okay.

407
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,320
Call me if you need anything.

408
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,040
- Hello.
- I've arrived.

409
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,880
I'll take a shower and wait for you.

410
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,080
Oh, you're Gen's friend.

411
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,200
Why are you here alone?

412
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,840
I just want to listen to some music

413
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,720
and let my mind wander.

414
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,040
Then I won't bother you.

415
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,640
How's Gen?

416
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,720
Where is she?

417
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,560
Aren't you going to have a drink

418
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,200
to celebrate a new bride and groom?

419
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,040
Anything like that?

420
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,880
Well, right now,

421
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,960
Gen and I are just good friends.

422
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,600
Oh.

423
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,840
I kind of figured it out

424
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,160
that she never thought of me
as more than a friend.

425
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,520
I just wanted to give it a shot.

426
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,960
And this ring,

427
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,280
she won't keep it.

428
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,160
She said that

429
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,280
she can never hold on to good things.

430
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,960
That's true.

431
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,800
Someone like her

432
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,920
doesn't know how to keep good things with her.

433
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,000
Don't be disappointed.

434
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,920
You'll find someone made for you soon.

435
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,600
I need to go.
Good night.

436
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,960
Good night.

437
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,360
Aoey.

438
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,320
We need to talk.
Let me in.

439
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,640
- I don't think so.
- I said, "We need to talk."

440
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,200
Aoey!

441
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,840
Are you drunk?
Go to your room.

442
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,800
- You shouldn't be here.
- Why?

443
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,520
Why can't I be here?

444
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,720
You're about to be married.

445
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,720
And you'll just watch it happen?

446
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,720
Don't you feel anything?

447
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,720
Aoey!

448
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,520
Aoey!

449
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,880
Aoey

450
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,720
You're drunk.

451
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,480
The two of us should be here alone.

452
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,000
Why?

453
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,240
Feeling reserved now?

454
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,320
Before this,
you always wanted to kiss, hug,

455
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,160
- and have me eat you whole.
- I think ...

456
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,800
you should go!

457
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,400
I won't!

458
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,560
Aoey.

459
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,760
Aoey!

460
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,440
You know that this is wrong!

461
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,400
Isn't that what this whole thing is?

462
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,040
I was wrong because I love you.

463
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,960
You're wrong because you never made
our relationship clear.

464
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,760
You're wrong because you ran away from me.

465
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,880
I am wrong about getting married.

466
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,120
You're wrong for coming back.

467
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,560
Everything is wrong!

468
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,280
One more thing being wrong is nothing.

469
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,320
What do you really want?

470
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,200
I want you to love me!

471
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,840
I want you to feel regret
seeing me getting married.

472
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,800
I want you to cry,
get down on your knees,

473
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,440
and beg for me to come back.

474
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,000
I want you to experience
the pain I went through!

475
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,920
You never even thought about saying sorry

476
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,440
or pay for what you've done?

477
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,200
Gen?

478
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,280
Gen?

479
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,080
Gen?
Gen.

480
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,760
Gen.

481
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,160
Gen!

482
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,040
Gen!

483
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,320
- Fai.
- Huh?

484
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,320
That seminar is advanced to March.

485
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,400
It's earlier now.

486
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,480
We have to confirm this.
We've postponed it too many times.

487
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,080
- I'll do that.
- Okay.

488
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,320
Hello.

489
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,160
Is this Dream Tini Dee Hotel?

490
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,720
I'd like to order a birthday cake.

491
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,280
Are you feeling okay?

492
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,760
I can do this alone if you can't do it.

493
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,480
No, we both will do this together.

494
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,200
Will you really be okay?

495
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,880
Maybe karma is in the form of us
having to work.

496
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,280
Ready when you are.

497
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,240
Let's go.

498
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,400
Are you okay?
Let me get you your meds.

499
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,040
Thank you.

500
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,600
Get some rest.

501
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,200
I'll take a nap,
then I'll take a shower later.

502
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,840
What?

503
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,640
I slept through a whole day?

504
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,840
I didn't give Mean the birthday cake.

505
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,120
Mean, I'm so sorry.
It was your birthday yesterday.

506
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,400
I saw your cake in the fridge.

507
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,400
I actually took a bite, too.
Thanks.

508
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,560
Too bad we didn't celebrate it together.

509
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,440
I'm so sorry.

510
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,360
The best gift for me
is having you by my side.

511
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,200
If so,

512
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,160
how about we celebrate this later?

513
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,600
Sure!

514
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,640
Yay!

515
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:53,480
Maybe ...

516
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:59,720
karma is in the form of us
having to be together forever?

517
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,040
- Are you mocking me?
- I sure am.

518
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,440
Maybe.

519
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,520
- Mean.
- Huh?

520
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,680
I love you.

521
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,720
I love you, too.
