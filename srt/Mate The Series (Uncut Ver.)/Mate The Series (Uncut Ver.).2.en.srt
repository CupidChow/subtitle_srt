1
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,240
Mom: I’m having my eyes on this guy!

2
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,240
Seriously? Mom?

3
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,180
You’re not scared of being touched anymore?

4
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,720
I am,

5
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,940
but I saw you coming.

6
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,360
Besides, we’ve been living together for days.

7
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,440
I kind of got used to it.

8
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,820
- Also,
- What is it?

9
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,120
if it’s you, I don’t feel scared.

10
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,360
I feel safe.

11
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,120
That’s so nice to hear.

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,040
What are you making?

13
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,720
Stir-fried chicken
with holy basil and fried egg.

14
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
That works for you?

15
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,060
Of course.
I’m not picky.

16
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,180
Though, I prefer it not to be too spicy.

17
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,660
Two chilis are enough.

18
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,360
Also, I prefer chicken breast without skin.

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,620
Don’t add sugar.

20
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,980
No MSG.

21
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,240
No oyster sauce.

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,420
And no dark soy sauce.

23
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,400
Keep it dry.
Add lots of holy basil.

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,800
Lastly, I prefer my fried egg
with a crispy edge and sticky yolk.

25
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,100
Are you sure you’re not picky?

26
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,760
Alright, I’ll work on it.

27
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,080
You’re so lovely.

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,000
And what about loving me?

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,660
That’s an old joke.

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,860
Gen, I just got a job

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,700
at a place on the third street from here.

32
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,440
Starting the day after tomorrow.

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,840
If you’re trying to earn money to pay rent,

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,020
no need to.

35
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,200
I won’t ask you to pay.

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,360
I can’t do that.

37
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,180
I should at least pay for the utilities.

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,260
I also want to continue my study.

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,280
So, I need money.

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,740
Whatever works for you.

41
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,160
You wait for now.

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,860
Please take a seat.

43
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,120
- Hi, Big Sister.
- Why are you here?

44
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,300
I’m checking in on our promise.

45
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,160
Hey, I don’t have time for your nonsense.

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,440
- Get out.
- Hold on a second.

47
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,140
Does this mean you haven’t talked to Aoey yet?
That’s okay.

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,720
I’ll do it myself.

49
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,440
She’s sleeping.
Just leave for now.

50
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,400
It’s noon already.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,160
She’s not you!

52
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,380
I smell holy basil.

53
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,860
Did something get into you?

54
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,880
You cook?

55
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,920
Aoey without glasses is so cute.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,100
Stop looking and leave now!

57
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,620
Great, do you want to have lunch with us?

58
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,720
Of course, with pleasure!

59
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,260
If you’re still here,
I won’t help you anymore.

60
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,000
Come on.

61
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,600
Aoey, I’ll have to leave now

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,080
as I have something else to do.

63
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,140
I’ll have a meal with you soon.

64
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,120
I’ll call you.

65
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,620
Go!

66
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,280
You’re acting like you’re her girlfriend!

67
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,200
Aw!

68
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,580
Aoey, when you go to work,

69
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,140
tie your hair, no makeup,
and take off your glasses.

70
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,420
- Why?
- Trust me.

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,740
Just do what I asked.

72
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,900
Will do.

73
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,560
Just tell me what you need,

74
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,060
and I’ll do it.

75
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,840
Good.

76
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,380
Lunch is served.

77
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,820
Gen, do you want to use the laptop?

78
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,140
No,

79
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,600
I just checked to see what you’re up to.

80
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,840
I’m writing a novel

81
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,800
to publish online before leaving for work.

82
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,920
A novel?

83
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,660
Can I read it?

84
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,820
No!
I feel embarrassed.

85
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,600
Aoey, when you said
you wanted to study at a university,

86
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,020
I wonder what you want to study.

87
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,700
Like, where?

88
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,620
I’m thinking of an open university.

89
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,240
That way, I can work while studying
and only need to leave for exams.

90
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,600
If that’s the case,

91
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,900
the university Great’s studying in
is taking new students.

92
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,220
I’ll send you a link.

93
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,020
Maybe it’ll work for you.

94
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,180
Well,

95
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,720
I still have lots of time to think.

96
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,760
I’ll think about it later.

97
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,860
I need to see how much money I’m earning
from my novel.

98
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,440
Thank you, Gen.

99
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,720
I invoke my laptop’s owner privilege.

100
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,960
Wow!
She’s got a lot of readers.

101
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,340
Aoey, where are you rushing to?
Talk to me first.

102
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,580
I’m a fan of your novel.

103
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,280
I read every single chapter.

104
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,080
I just want to know
when the next chapter will be released.

105
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,300
Why are you backing away?

106
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,040
Do you want to have lunch with me?
I’ll take you there.

107
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,520
- Have you eaten anything?
- Aoey, let’s go.

108
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,480
I’m here to take you to lunch.

109
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,140
Hold on now.

110
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,380
Didn’t you see I was talking to her?

111
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,760
I did.
And?

112
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,960
Aw!

113
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,580
My toes!

114
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,140
I’m thankful,
but that was too unnecessary.

115
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,600
Who cares?

116
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,120
Do you know

117
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,760
that you seem so possessive of me?

118
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,720
What?

119
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,600
That’s not what it is.

120
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,880
I just don’t like that fake blonde head.

121
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,540
If you see him again,

122
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,080
tell him to get lost.
You got it?

123
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,020
Would you like some desserts?

124
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,220
Our kitchen is about top close.

125
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,240
We’ll have mango sticky rice.

126
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
Separate coconut milk and nuts.

127
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,560
And please get us Ok Rong mango.

128
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,140
Slice it into bite-size pieces.

129
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,520
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma’am.

130
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,080
You remember how I like it?

131
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,180
If it’s you, I remember every detail.

132
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,040
The guy we just met is Skyfall.

133
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,080
He’s a fan of my novel.

134
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,500
I only met him in person today.

135
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,700
You have lots of fans.

136
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,220
Why don’t you publish your novel as a book?

137
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,360
If I do pre-orders
and only a few people order it,

138
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,900
the printing cost will be so high.

139
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,120
If I print lots of books,

140
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,740
I’d probably lose money.

141
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,200
How do you know I have lots of fans?

142
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,520
Did you look at my page?

143
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,460
I’m sorry.

144
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,420
I needed to use the laptop,

145
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,520
and you forgot to log out.

146
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,560
So, I accidentally saw it.

147
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,760
Next time,

148
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,520
if you want to know anything about me,
ask me first.

149
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,660
Okay.
I won’t do it again.

150
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,380
Promise?

151
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,980
Promise.

152
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,100
Hey, Gen!

153
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,520
You came so early.
Is there anything you need?

154
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,040
My friend is a novel writer.

155
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,020
So, I need your help in publishing her novel.

156
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,320
Wait.

157
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,220
Tell me first who this friend of yours is.

158
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,180
Her name is Aoey.

159
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,200
She’s a friend from elementary school

160
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,420
from when we lived in Korat.

161
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,600
That pretty friend of yours
who stays in your condo?

162
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,920
Wait, Gen.

163
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,880
You live with a friend at your condo?

164
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,660
Yes.

165
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,220
You normally don’t let anyone stay at your place.

166
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,600
Are you sure this is a friend?

167
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,040
Let me ask you this.

168
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,180
Is she related to
you moving all your clothes there last time?

169
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,140
- She is not your girlfriend?
- Absolutely not.

170
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,020
But can you help with the novel, Mom?

171
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,200
I can’t help you with that.

172
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,900
Aw, Mom.

173
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,840
I can’t help

174
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,680
because that’s not my expertise.

175
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,880
I’ll talk to Uncle Dom

176
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,580
to see if he can help you.

177
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,060
He owns a book publishing company.

178
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,360
Yay!

179
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,560
You’re the best.

180
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,840
You’re the most beautiful.

181
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,320
Thank you.

182
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,820
However,

183
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,200
you need to date
one of my chosen soon-to-be sons-in-law.

184
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,980
- Do we have a deal?
- Come on, Mom.

185
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,140
- I don’t want to.
- I don’t want to either and don’t know how to help.

186
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,860
It’s just a date.

187
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,200
Not the end of the world.

188
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,520
Okay, fine.

189
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,760
Thank you, anyway.

190
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,080
I need to leave now.

191
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,240
Are you not going to have a meal with me?

192
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,820
There’s something I need to do.

193
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,840
I promise that I’ll stay
for a meal with you next time.

194
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,180
Okay, sure.

195
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,320
Take the food and fruits with you.

196
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,520
I bought a bunch of them.

197
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,060
Great will help you carry them.

198
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,660
It’s okay, Mom.
Don’t make it his problem.

199
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,840
I’ll carry them all myself.

200
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,080
You look suspicious.

201
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,260
I’ll help her carry the stuff
and check her room.

202
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,700
If you’re done, you should leave.

203
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,820
Why are you such a buzzkill?

204
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,660
You’re so protective of her.

205
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,300
I’m not.
If you keep talking to her,

206
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,920
she’s going to be late for work.

207
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,320
Fine, I’ll go.

208
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,780
Aoey, I’ll have to go now.

209
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,480
I’ll see you later.

210
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,600
Buzzkill.

211
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,500
You’re protective of me?

212
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,920
No, why would I?

213
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,680
If not, then I guess you felt jealous?

214
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,000
You’re jealous

215
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,500
that I talk to someone else?

216
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,840
What is it?

217
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,980
Do you see my phone?
I don’t know where I put it.

218
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,700
Um, I’ll leave for work now.

219
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,480
I’m late.

220
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,940
Aoey.
Aoey.

221
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,900
Aoey, it’s me.

222
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,800
It’s me, Gen.

223
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,120
Calm down.
Calm down.

224
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,640
It’s okay.
Everything is okay.

225
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,860
I’m so sorry about that, Great.

226
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,520
It’s okay.

227
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,720
You need to leave now.
Otherwise, you’d be late.

228
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,040
I’ll be on my way.

229
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,540
Stay safe.

230
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,860
Why is she so sensitive to touch?

231
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,780
No idea.

232
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,060
Why can you touch her?

233
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,460
I guess she trusts me.

234
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,900
So, if I’m going to approach her,

235
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,560
I have to visit you more often

236
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,380
to gain her trust.

237
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,000
to gain her trust.

238
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,400
Are you really going to?

239
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,540
Touching her makes her go nuts.

240
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,360
I mean it!

241
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,440
I promise to never make your friend sad.

242
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,480
Please be a bridge for us!

243
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,920
Please.

244
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,660
Fine.

245
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,540
Don’t blame me
if she breaks your heart.

246
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,280
Thank you.

247
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,740
One more thing.

248
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,640
Why is she so scared of being touched?

249
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,860
I don’t know.

250
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,900
Ask her!

251
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,860
Sure, fine.

252
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,600
Only if she tells me.

253
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,660
If she doesn’t,
you need to find out somehow.

254
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,600
Please help the Little Brother.

255
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,620
- Please.
- Fine, fine.

256
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,360
- Got it.
- Okay?

257
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,080
You can leave now.

258
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,100
- On my way now.
- Whatever.

259
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,080
Just leave.

260
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,760
Aoey,

261
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,160
you’ve been in Bangkok
for a long time.

262
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,280
I’ve never seen you call your family.

263
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,160
Didn’t Sali say anything?

264
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,020
No.

265
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,880
Doesn’t she worry about you?

266
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,100
Or is there any problem
between you and your family?

267
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,760
No.

268
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,780
I’m an adult.
Why would they worry about me?

269
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,920
If you have a problem,

270
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,180
please tell me.

271
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,920
This guardian angel will help you.

272
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,420
Thank you.

273
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,220
You’ve been such a big help already.

274
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,980
- Gen.
- Huh?

275
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,600
You already promised me

276
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,680
that when you want to know
something about me,

277
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,160
you’ll ask me first.

278
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,960
I asked, but you never answered.

279
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,760
What else can I do?

280
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,780
No! No!
No!

281
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,340
Gen, what can I help you with?

282
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,200
I’d like you to investigate one of my friends.

283
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,860
What did she do to you?

284
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,280
Not like that.
It’s more me worrying about her.

285
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,520
She never told me
what made her the way she is.

286
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
This friend must be important to you,
I presume.

287
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,580
Hence, you came seeking my help.

288
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,580
It’s not that overly important.

289
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,540
Just a friend from my elementary school.

290
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,480
Do you not trust me, Gen?

291
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,660
I sent an audio file to your phone.

292
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,720
Oh, Aoey? Her mom just kicked her out of the house.

293
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,140
She said that Aoey was flirting with her husband.

294
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,900
Such a shameless girl. She doesn't even care that it her mom's husband.

295
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,600
There're so many men out there and yet.

296
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,880
Honestly, there’s nothing wrong with being single.

297
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,940
Look!! Even someone like me, who’s attractive, is single!

298
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,540
If everything I uncovered is true,

299
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,380
I don’t think
you should associate yourself with her.

300
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,140
But ...

301
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,260
she’s my friend.
It would be impossible.

302
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,260
It seems you are
paying special attention to her.

303
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,060
My beautiful Big Sister,
have you talked to Aoey?

304
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,740
Not really.

305
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,880
Gen, you’re back.

306
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,540
I brought you some sweets.

307
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,300
Thank you.

308
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,900
Gen,

309
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,480
a publisher just called me.

310
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,000
Really?

311
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,560
I told you that you can do it.

312
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,980
They said they’ll send me
a contract as soon as I accept.

313
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,860
I’m so happy.
I’m going to make money!

314
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,760
- Aoey.
- Huh?

315
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,640
What do you think of Great?

316
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,420
Great?

317
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,740
He’s fun to talk with.

318
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,960
Why do you ask?

319
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,580
Does he take good care of you?

320
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,200
Is there anything you want to tell me?

321
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,520
Um.

322
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,820
Great likes you.

323
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,560
And I guess you like him, too?

324
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,980
Why do you think I like Great?

325
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,560
He’s good-looking.
He’s rich.

326
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,880
Fun to talk with and overall nice.

327
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,640
Do you want me to date Great?

328
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,660
I could do that. I’ll date him.
We’ll be so sweet together.

329
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,620
Aoey.

330
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,100
Cut the sarcasm.

331
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,280
Why?

332
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,320
I don’t like it.

333
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,760
Maybe Great does.

334
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,500
Don’t get on my nerves.

335
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,820
I’ll have him take me to lunch.

336
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,580
I’ll feed him.

337
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,440
I’ll have him take me to a movie.

338
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,160
Then, I’ll put my head on his chest.
How’s that?

339
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,720
You’re a big flirt, aren’t you?

340
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,060
That’s why Sali banished you.

341
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,660
What did you learn?

342
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,040
Isn’t that true?

343
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,020
You said you would stay away
from my personal life.

344
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,720
Isn’t it your fault for not telling me the truth?

345
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,640
- Is it?
- Yes.

346
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,680
If someone’s going to live with me,

347
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,860
I should know who they really are.

348
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,940
What you know might not even be true.

349
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,960
Aoey.

350
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,060
Can you tell me the truth?

351
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,440
Gen,

352
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,600
can you trust me?

353
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,060
I’m not what you said I am.

354
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,860
When I’m ready,

355
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,020
I’ll tell you myself.

356
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,260
I looked into it

357
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,320
because I care about you.

358
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,780
I assume that it’s been tough for you.

359
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,200
That’s why you have nightmares every night.

360
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,580
I hate to think about it.

361
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,580
I’ve never apologized to anyone,

362
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,340
but I’m really sorry this time.

363
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,720
I’m glad

364
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
that you’re sorry.

365
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,300
That made me feel so special.

366
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,780
I, too, am sorry

367
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,740
for saying that

368
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,540
despite knowing that you meant well.

369
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,580
However,

370
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,720
I’m still mad at you.

371
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,600
Please don’t.

372
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,860
Why is making it up to someone so hard?

373
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,260
But I only do this to you.

374
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,180
You’re so lovely.

375
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,520
And what about loving me?

376
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,620
Yes.

377
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,780
And do you think of me the same way?

378
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,500
Yes.

379
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,700
What I meant is that
you’re such a lovely friend.

380
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,200
I would obviously treat you the same way.
Isn’t that right?

381
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,160
You can love me however you want,

382
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,780
and I’m happy about it, nonetheless.

383
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,940
Stop crying.

384
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,440
Aoey, I’m back.

385
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,100
Gen.

386
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,600
Look at this.

387
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,320
Whoa.

388
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,180
- It’s 80,000!
- That’s a lot.

389
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,040
Now that you have money,

390
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,100
how about quitting your job
to just study?

391
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,000
The income from my novel is uncertain.

392
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,800
I should keep my job at the café.

393
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Do you come to work today?
I’ll bring my novel for you to sign!

394
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,300
Is this why you don’t want to quit?

395
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,660
Are you being possessive of me?

396
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,560
Quit your job.

397
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,500
That’s an order.

398
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,000
Aoey!

399
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,440
Yes, Mom.

400
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,540
How’s your study lately?

401
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,080
It’s been quite tough, Mrs. Ning.

402
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,620
Don’t forget about your health.

403
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,100
Of course.

404
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,300
Hello, Mom.
Hello, Mrs. Tubtim.

405
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,720
This is Gen.

406
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,940
Gen, this is Doctor Thot.

407
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,760
You’re studying medicine?

408
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,960
What kind of doctor are you?

409
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,320
For people or pets?

410
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,000
I’m an internal medicine doctor.

411
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,260
I treat normal everyday diseases.

412
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,260
And you?
What do you study?

413
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,180
Architecture.

414
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,480
Didn’t they teach you
when you were learning perspective drawing

415
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,440
to respect someone older than you?

416
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,080
Thot!

417
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,500
Maturity teaches you
to figure out who to respect.

418
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,120
What I’m saying is
you kind of look young.

419
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,720
What a perfect match.

420
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,100
I hope they get along well.

421
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,240
I’m so afraid that
Thot will date someone of his gender.

422
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,400
That isn’t wrong.

423
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,000
Our world has become
more open than ever.

424
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,900
Really?

425
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,540
What if Gen dates a girl?

426
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,560
Would you be alright with that?

427
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,780
Would I be alright?

428
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,620
I don’t know.
I worry more about her not picking the right person.

429
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,600
- How about this?
- Huh?

430
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,000
We leave the young ones be.

431
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,420
Staying here would only make us
a third wheel.

432
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,800
Alright.

433
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,920
Guys,

434
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,460
Mrs. Tubtim and I need to run some errands.

435
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,500
You two stay and enjoy the food here.

436
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,600
Thot,

437
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,760
enjoy this meal with her.

438
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,760
Don’t forget to send her home, too.

439
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,960
I’ll go now.

440
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,780
Yes, Mom.

441
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
Mrs. Ning, you don’t have to worry.

442
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,280
I’ll take good care of her.

443
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,160
Sure.
Thank you.

444
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,260
- Take good care of her.
- Be a good girl.

445
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,060
- Okay, Mom. Goodbye, Mrs. Ning.
- Goodbye.

446
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,220
- Take care now.
- Goodbye.

447
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,280
You’re scared to be with me?

448
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,520
What am I going to even do?

449
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,740
Do you think I’m scared?

450
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,940
I caught and threw
many people of your size before.

451
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,580
Tough one.

452
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,240
Order whatever you like.

453
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,820
I guess it’s on you.

454
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,880
No, we’re splitting it.

455
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Miss Genlong is splitting the bill?

456
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,140
It’s a long walk.
I told you to send me off down there.

457
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,660
I can’t.
I promised your mom.

458
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,900
This is Doctor Thot.

459
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,400
And this is Aoey.

460
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

461
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,000
I’ll leave you here.

462
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,660
- See you.
- Thank you. See you.

463
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,120
What a pretty outfit.

464
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,420
Your fan is waiting for you at the café?

465
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,920
You have a guy sending you
to your room.

466
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,460
It’s only normal
that I have someone waiting for me.

467
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,280
Yes?

468
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,340
Oh, Skyfall?

469
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,020
Yes.

470
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,540
See you.

471
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,820
Aoey!
Aoey!

472
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,320
Aoey!
We need to talk!

473
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,700
Aoey’s smell is really good.

474
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,040
I’m taking very deep breaths today,
for sure.

475
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,920
Yeah, that’s all for now.

476
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,100
What again?

477
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,180
Last warning.
Stay away from Aoey.

478
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,340
Are you her girlfriend?
Why are you so possessive of her?

479
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,180
I’m not, but someone like you
should stay away from her!

480
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,960
Huh.

481
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,480
Someone like me?
What about it, huh?

482
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,240
Hey!
Too slow!

483
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,980
Let go of me!

484
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,160
I said let go of me!

485
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,640
Let go!

486
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,560
- Are you okay?
- You!

487
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,720
- Are you okay?
- You!

488
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,700
Will you stay away from her?

489
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,440
I will! I will!
I’ll stay away from her.

490
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,220
- Will you delete everything?
- I will!

491
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,680
I’m not keeping anything.

492
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,880
Let go of me, please.

493
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,660
It hurts!

494
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,740
Aoey!
Are you okay?

495
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,060
Damn.

496
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,100
That girl is tough.

497
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,920
Hey, didn’t you say
you went to meet a girl?

498
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,460
Why are you so beaten up?

499
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,160
I met a third wheel.

500
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,420
You need to help me
take revenge on her!

501
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,600
Let’s go.

502
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,660
Hey.

503
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,200
Move, old man.

504
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,260
- What if I don’t?
- Old man!

505
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,860
Be old somewhere else!

506
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,620
Or are you looking for some punches
in the face?

507
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,500
Guys, let’s beat him up.

508
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,400
Losers.

509
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,380
I didn’t know he was this good.

510
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,860
- Is it hurt?
- Hm.

511
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,300
I must be bruised.

512
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,980
Gen.

513
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,500
- What?
- Today,

514
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,480
I quit my job.

515
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,120
- What?
- Well, today,

516
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,240
I put in this pretty outfit

517
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,840
because I was going to quit

518
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,780
and go for a meal with you.

519
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,960
What about you meeting that blonde head?

520
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,900
I did that to make you jealous.

521
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,680
Never do this again.

522
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,720
See how that got you hurt?

523
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,180
It’s better that I got hurt

524
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,180
because I prefer it to be me
instead of you.

525
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,600
Thank you for doing this.

526
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,240
I thank you, too, for caring about me.

527
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,320
You’re this lovely.
How can I not care?

528
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,960
Hey,

529
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,900
getting into a fight like that,

530
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,760
was it because you cared,
or was it because you felt jealous?

531
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,140
It’s not that overly important.

532
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,520
I’ve been watching you grow up
since you were young.

533
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,200
I’m glad to see you care for others.

534
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,340
That’s a strong compliment.

535
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,420
When you went out
with my dad to work,

536
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,580
I worry about both you and my dad.

537
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,960
That’s what family does.
It’s only natural.

538
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,020
But what I’m talking about

539
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,900
is someone that’s not in our family

540
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,980
who will soon become someone special.

541
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,520
You only want good things for her

542
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,840
and protect her from harm.

543
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,920
This ...

544
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,860
is what caring is.

545
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,200
If you don’t want anyone to get close to her,

546
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,280
wanting her to be yours

547
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,960
and to have you as a special someone,

548
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,740
that’s still caring.

549
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,040
If the feeling intensifies

550
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,160
to the point where
you don’t want anyone close to her

551
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,040
as it gets on your nerves,

552
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,360
making you angry,

553
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,600
this means that you have
a very special feeling for them.

554
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,300
This is you being possessive of her.

555
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,980
I don’t know if I just care about you,

556
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,680
feel protective of you,
or feel possessive of you.

557
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,120
I just know that it feels good

558
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,520
when you’re next to me.

559
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,960
Anything I can help you with?

560
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,520
Aoey, are you done feeding my kid?

561
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,680
Where’s my food?
You’re so careless!

562
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,460
Mr. Thud will come to see me soon.

563
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,880
What should I do?

564
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,260
Dress beautifully, your grace.

565
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,500
What do you think of my outfit today?

566
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,840
Very lovely, your grace.

567
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,700
And what about loving me?

568
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,840
Mr. Thud will surely love you, your grace.

569
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,840
Despite you being just a servant,

570
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,040
you should be protective of me, too!

571
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,820
What if Mr. Thud is a womanizer
and a horrible person?

572
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,560
Uh, yeah.
No!

573
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,460
Yes, your grace.

574
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,420
You’re not doing it right!

575
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,400
You’re supposed to stay quiet!

576
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,840
You should’ve combed your hair
while crying

577
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,920
because you pity your poor life.

578
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,800
Gen, please let me try it again.

579
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,760
I promise I’ll do better.

580
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,940
Fine, but I’m very thirsty.

581
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,760
Please get me something to drink.

582
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,840
Buy some for yourself, too.
It’s on me.

583
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,220
Here’s some cash.
