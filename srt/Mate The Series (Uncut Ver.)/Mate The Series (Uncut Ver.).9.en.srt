1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,800
Gen, where are you going?

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,760
Gen!

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,880
Gen!

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,720
Gen!

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,000
[Three years later]

6
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,880
Hello, Aoey.

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,720
Hi, Doctor.

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,160
- Are you free this afternoon?
- Of course.

9
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Meet me at the office.

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,680
Okay, bye.

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,800
Hmm, do you think
it resembles your work that much?

12
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,280
Yes.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Who did you even choose
to draw my novel's cover?

14
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,640
Why did she just copy my Best Friend novel?

15
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,000
I think it's just a coincidence.

16
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,680
Novels and series these days
are pretty much the same.

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,920
No.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,720
It's an exact copy of my novel.

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm pressing charges.

20
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,440
But Ms. Kate Wang is a foreigner.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Do you want me to email her first?

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,400
No.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,800
I'm suing.

24
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,360
Hm.

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,560
With a foreign party like this,

26
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,480
we might have to see her abroad.

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,880
No, it's her who has to come to me.

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,800
Do you think she'll come?

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,800
That is your job.

30
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,400
I want this to be done before my big day.

31
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,240
Big day?

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,520
Right,

33
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,080
- I'll see what I can do.
- Yes.

34
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,600
I need to go.

35
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,720
I'll go to Macao next week.

36
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,120
Really? See you then.

37
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,640
This is your last chance, Gen.

38
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,320
I hope it all ends well.

39
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,800
- Gen.
- Hi!

40
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,800
- How are you?
- I'm doing great.

41
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,840
Was it hard looking for my hotel?

42
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,640
Good thing my taxi driver was a pro.
He dropped me off exactly here.

43
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,080
This is your outfit nowadays?

44
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,520
Time changes: people change.

45
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,080
What's weird about it?

46
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,000
Give me a second.

47
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,480
Just come.

48
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,760
Who's that?

49
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,520
This is Jonathan.

50
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,960
You can call him John.
He's my friend.

51
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,840
This is Doctor Thot.

52
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,640
Nice to meet you.

53
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,920
Though she introduced me as a friend,

54
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,840
I'm looking to cross the friend zone.

55
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,600
Have you checked in?

56
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,200
No, can you do that for me?

57
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,360
Sure, will do.

58
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,200
Be with your friend for now.

59
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,440
Is that your boyfriend?

60
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,840
Not yet;
I haven't let him cross the friend zone just yet.

61
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,720
So, he has a chance?

62
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,080
Maybe.

63
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,400
Maybe I'll give in.

64
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,920
That's nice.

65
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,520
Does this mean you've gotten over Aoey?

66
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,600
I have news for you.

67
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,800
What is it?

68
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,280
Aoey is getting married.

69
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,280
And who's the groom?

70
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,880
His name is Ten.

71
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,720
He's the brother of a psychologist
who's treated her.

72
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,160
Those two probably met a lot
at the clinic,

73
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,880
and it sparked.

74
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,480
What does Sali think?

75
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,320
She didn't say anything.

76
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
She's happy, even,

77
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,200
to have someone take care of her daughter.

78
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,320
She just got married herself, too,

79
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,240
and is about to move abroad.

80
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,960
Aoey didn't move with her

81
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,200
because she's still traumatized
by her late stepdad.

82
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,040
When Ten proposed to her,

83
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,480
she said yes.

84
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,640
I need to leave and do some work.

85
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,920
Okay, I'll go with you.

86
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,320
No, no, no.

87
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,000
You haven't seen your friend in a long time.
Spend some time with him.

88
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,240
Call me when you want to go home.
I'll come pick you up.

89
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,440
Okay.

90
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,960
I'll send you off.

91
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,800
It's okay.
Feel free to stay with your friend.

92
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,640
He actually seems like a nice guy.

93
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,480
He takes really good care of you.

94
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,480
Hey, Gen.

95
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,360
Since Aoey is getting married,

96
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,320
why don't you just date John?

97
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,080
You two can go to her wedding together.

98
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,840
I don't think I'll go.

99
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,160
Please extend my congratulations to her for me.

100
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,080
Don't tell me you still haven't moved on.

101
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,960
Move on or not, I still can't go.

102
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,360
Gen.

103
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,160
Wut died a long time ago.

104
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
There's nothing for you to worry about.

105
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,000
I think ...

106
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,280
you should go see Aoey.

107
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,080
Big Sister!
Big Sister!

108
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,680
It's news about Wut.

109
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,880
- Hey!
- We're going back to Thailand!

110
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,800
But ...

111
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,560
we didn't end well.

112
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,760
I don't dare see her in person.

113
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,960
You can't avoid it.

114
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,320
Today,

115
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,800
I'm here as a representative of my publisher.

116
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm here to discuss with Ms. Wang.
about a copyright infringement.

117
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,560
- Copyright infringement?
- Yeah.

118
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,560
Your comic, Mate,

119
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,080
somehow resembles Aoey's novel,
Best Friend.

120
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,960
I'll delete the comic,

121
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,520
and she can ask for whatever amount
of compensation she wants.

122
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,160
That's not for me to decide.

123
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,560
Aoey said that everything
will be decided in Thailand.

124
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,840
That's crazy.
I'm not going.

125
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,360
Gen, just meet her for once.

126
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,800
Just try to end this nicely, okay?

127
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,520
Who am I going to see her as?

128
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,920
Well, an artist and a writer.

129
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,400
Or you can go to her wedding
as a best friend.

130
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
- Mrs. Ning, hello.
- Doctor Thot.

131
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,040
Hello.

132
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,400
- This is from my mom.
- Oh.

133
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,960
Please tell her I'm thankful.

134
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,320
Please have a seat.

135
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,360
Where are Mr. Big and Mr. Somkit?

136
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,520
Oh, they're talking in the room.

137
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,560
It seems like our casino is having a problem.

138
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,880
Thot, please stay and dine with us.

139
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,600
Of course.

140
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,640
Mom, I'm having a bit of a problem
with my work.

141
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,880
I want to return to Thailand with Doctor Thot.

142
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,040
Oh, Doctor Thot.
Hello.

143
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,520
Great.

144
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,280
Big Sister, just tell everyone
you want to see Aoey.

145
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,960
Don't hide your intention
with that work of yours.

146
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,640
I actually have a problem with my work!

147
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,680
Stop it.
Great.

148
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,680
Enough already.

149
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,720
Didn't your father call you?
Go to him!

150
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,920
Okay.

151
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
- I'll talk to you later.
- See you.

152
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,040
Gen, go pack your things.

153
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,760
Doctor Thot.

154
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,600
Does this problem you mentioned

155
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,800
has anything to do with Aoey?

156
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,800
Yes.

157
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,680
If you don't wish for her to return,

158
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,560
I understand that.

159
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,440
Letting her go would be the right call.

160
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,120
I don't want her to suffer anymore.

161
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,120
She can finally do what her heart wants.

162
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,200
When she newly moved here,

163
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,880
she only stayed in her room

164
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,760
and looked at photos of Aoey.

165
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,400
Big and I were worried that
she might take her own life.

166
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,640
So, we tried to find her
an artistic hobby to help her.

167
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,160
Gen,

168
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,520
I haven't seen you draw in a long time.

169
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,120
Please show me again.

170
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,560
Yes.

171
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,560
I will try.

172
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,320
Gen.

173
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,440
I brought some macarons for you.

174
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,880
- I'm actually hungry.
- These macarons are really good.

175
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,320
Eat them before Great eats them all.

176
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,520
Thank you so much, Ms. Genlong,

177
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,880
for making Thailand famous
with your artwork.

178
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
I'm here as a representative of Thais in Macao

179
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,120
to interview you

180
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,360
about your inspiration
behind these artworks.

181
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,080
My inspiration comes from a friendship
between two friends

182
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,040
who have had good times together before.

183
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,800
This relationship can be
in many different forms.

184
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,600
It's up to the person looking at these works.

185
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,960
I brought you lunch.
I'll just put it here.

186
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,520
Don't forget to eat.

187
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,120
Gen.

188
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,800
Why don't you contact Aoey sometimes?

189
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,880
I'd rather not.

190
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,280
By now,

191
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,960
she probably hates me like a poison.

192
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,320
I don't think so.

193
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,040
Maybe she's waiting for you to call her.

194
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,640
No.

195
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,760
Besides,

196
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't want her to pointlessly wait for me.

197
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,600
How about this?

198
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,720
We'll have someone pick her up
and come live with us.

199
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,720
It's not that easy, mom.

200
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
She needs to study

201
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,520
and her treatment.

202
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,040
Not to mention Sali.

203
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,880
I think staying in Thailand is best for her.

204
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,640
Gen, take a break.

205
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,480
Just eat something before you keep working.

206
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,760
I just need to finish a bit more of this.

207
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,560
You said this last night, too.

208
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,160
Did you even sleep?

209
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,680
Why would you keep drawing
and not getting any sleep?

210
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,520
It's the only way to make me feel like
she's still with me.

211
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,240
It's just pictures of her in my head.

212
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,920
Big Sister,

213
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,640
how about this?

214
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,280
You're drawing for a manhwa, right?

215
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,320
Why don't you draw for the story
of you and Aoey?

216
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,440
All these three years,

217
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,440
I've been carrying the guilt

218
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,320
of separating the two.

219
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,560
If someone is to blame, it's all of us.

220
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,920
But in the end,

221
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,440
it all started because of my actions.

222
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,760
I told you to do it.

223
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,120
Stop blaming yourself.

224
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,960
We just wanted the best for Gen,

225
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,600
without realizing that the best thing for her
is to have Aoey.

226
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,600
Please take care of her.

227
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,240
If the two's hearts are still connected,

228
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,000
please help them.

229
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,640
I'll do my best.

230
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,560
Mrs. Ning,

231
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
what about John?

232
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,960
Yesterday,

233
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,040
he talked to me about proposing to Gen.

234
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,880
I didn't know what to say.

235
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,840
I felt bad for him,

236
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,760
but I didn't know what to do.

237
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,440
I can only hope that

238
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,760
this will all end nicely.

239
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,600
That's what I hope, too.

240
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,840
What about Aoey?

241
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,040
How is she doing?

242
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,600
I'll have to take her to a doctor.

243
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,560
- Doctor!
- Aoey! Stop!

244
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,760
Bring Gen back!

245
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,320
- Aoey!
- Where did you take Gen?

246
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,160
Aoey!

247
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,160
When I'm gone,
can you make Aoey hate me?

248
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,600
- Bring her back!
- Aoey! Stop crying!

249
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,440
Stop crying!

250
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,680
She left you!

251
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,280
That's not true.

252
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,120
She promised
she'll never leave me.

253
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,840
Then why would she leave you?

254
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,000
You took her from me!

255
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,800
- Bring her back!
- Aoey!

256
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,960
You forced her, didn't you?

257
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,280
Just face it!

258
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,560
- Where did you take her?
- Aoey!

259
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,680
Face it!

260
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,480
She doesn't love you anymore.

261
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
She does!

262
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,760
We both love each other

263
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,440
until you came!

264
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,680
Aoey!

265
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,760
Trust me.

266
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,520
I mean well for you.

267
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,680
- No.
- You need to move on.

268
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,880
- That's not true.
- Aoey, please.

269
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,000
Calm down, Aoey!

270
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,200
Aoey!
Aoey!

271
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,320
Aoey!
Aoey!

272
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,280
- Aoey!
- Calm down.

273
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,840
Aoey!

274
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,560
Make yourself at home.

275
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,240
Thank you.

276
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Aoey.

277
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,640
Your room is over there.

278
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,080
I must thank you

279
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,000
for this condo

280
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,840
and the doctor for Aoey.

281
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,880
You're welcome.
It's my pleasure.

282
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,280
If you need something, just call me.

283
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,200
Thank you so much.

284
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,560
I have to go now.

285
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,000
If you're reading this letter,

286
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
you'll understand me more

287
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,520
about why I left you.

288
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,760
At first, I thought that love
would get us through anything.

289
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,600
That's not the case.

290
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,880
I couldn't tolerate hardship
and everything we had to face.

291
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,520
I hate how little money I had.

292
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,800
It made me question myself
why I didn't move with my family.

293
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,880
And the answer is you.

294
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,720
Without you,
I'd have a much better life

295
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,960
and would be much happier.

296
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,640
My family wouldn't have to deal
with all the troubles.

297
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,640
I just want you to understand that
a man needs to be with a woman.

298
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,920
One day, I'll have a good husband
who's in the same class as I am.

299
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,640
It's fiction that made us believe that
love will win against anything.

300
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,080
I don't intend to prove
that our love will last forever.

301
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,880
I'm not an experiment.
Goodbye.

302
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,440
I hate you.
Genlong.

303
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,440
Aoey!
Aoey!

304
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,560
Aoey!
My child!

305
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,680
Don't cry!

306
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,840
Aoey!

307
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,160
Aoey!

308
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,800
DOctor Thot, she's having an episode.
Help!

309
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,640
Doctor!

310
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,040
Please help me!
She's having an episode!

311
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,600
Please hurry!

312
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,240
Yes! Doctor!

313
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
Aoey!

314
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,480
Hello, Ms. Sali.
My name is Der.

315
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,040
I'm an attending doctor of Aoey.

316
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,360
Hello.

317
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,160
Let me first make it clear to you that

318
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,400
a patient being treated
in the psychology department

319
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,920
doesn't mean that they're insane.

320
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,720
Okay, that's good to hear.

321
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,480
Patients in our department
have some sort of abnormality

322
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,840
caused by different factors.

323
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,880
For instance, chemical imbalances in their brain

324
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,880
or an extremely violent, traumatizing event.

325
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,520
These conditions will recover
or be cured

326
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,600
with proper treatment and therapy.

327
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,040
Yes, doctor.

328
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,200
You don't have to worry.
I'll work on it.

329
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,160
I'll do my best to treat her.

330
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,120
The time this takes can be
three months or longer.

331
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,840
Some might take shorter,
depending on their mental state.

332
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,120
But this is all fine.
Don't worry.

333
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,160
Let us deal with it.

334
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,960
Yes, doctor.

335
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,480
- Please take care of my daughter.
- Yes.

336
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
[Three months later]

337
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,800
Let me take your blood pressure.

338
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,200
Don't be afraid.

339
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,480
Put your arm through here.

340
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,480
We're about to begin.

341
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,760
We're about to begin.

342
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,520
Are you alright?

343
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,720
- I'm good. Thank you.
- Okay.

344
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

345
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,760
Take good care of yourself, Aoey.

346
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,720
Let's go.

347
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,400
Let's go home.

348
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,520
Today, I have omelette soup
waiting for you at home.

349
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,240
Let's go.
Careful.

350
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,400
We're finally going home.

351
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,000
Aoey, how are you?
I brought something for you.

352
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,640
You don't have to come.

353
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,960
How can I not see my number one writer
of our company?

354
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,680
Now that you're here,
I have a question.

355
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,520
Did you force Aoey to write this letter?

356
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,680
Gen I know will never do this.

357
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,880
Aoey, the truth is that she left you.

358
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,600
She has moved on.

359
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,120
You shouldn't be stuck in the past.

360
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,560
Did you just say ...

361
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,880
Do you know where she is?
How is she?

362
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,280
- Where is she?
- Aoey.

363
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,440
If you're trying to find her, stop.

364
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,440
The fact that she never comes back to you

365
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
or never even asks about you

366
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,760
should be the answer already.

367
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,240
I think ...

368
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,120
you should stay in the present.

369
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,120
Make the best of today.

370
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,360
She will regret leaving me.

371
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,600
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Thot.

372
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,120
I've booked you a room.

373
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,040
Here's the keycard.
Thank you.

374
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,560
Thank you.
Please wait for me a bit here.

375
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,880
Gen, I'll have to do a bit of work.

376
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,880
I'll come to take you to dinner in the evening.

377
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,840
Okay, I miss Thai food dearly.

378
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,560
I want some street food.

379
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,240
You can do street food now?

380
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,360
- Hey, I changed.
- Of course.

381
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,000
I'll text you in the evening.

382
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,200
I'll rest for now,
and we'll see each other then.

383
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,880
And my little cat finally has a good owner now.

384
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
[Doctor Thot]

385
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,640
Yes, Doctor.

386
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,320
Aoey, I brought that artist here.

387
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,160
When would you like to meet her?

388
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,800
Does the day after tomorrow work?

389
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,760
You can specify the time.

390
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,640
I'm free that entire day.

391
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,120
Okay, I'll deal with it.

392
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,280
I'll text you with an update.

393
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,520
Okay.

394
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,560
[Ten]

395
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,280
Yes, Ten.

396
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,640
I made an appointment
with a souvenir shop.

397
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,360
Are you free to come with me?

398
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,520
Sure, but I need an hour.

399
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,360
Okay, I'll wait for you
at a coffee shop near you.

400
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,040
Just call me when you're done.
I'll come pick you up.

401
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,680
Sure, I'll call you when you're done.

402
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,320
Here are the wedding souvenirs you selected.

403
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,440
They look even better in person.

404
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
These are the wedding souvenirs I chose.

405
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,160
Do you like them?

406
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,560
These are cute.

407
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,320
- A couple of cats?
- No.

408
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,720
It's these guys.

409
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,200
You like cats?

410
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,920
- Yeah.
- Then, shouldn't you like me, too?

411
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Because I'm cute like a cat.

412
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,000
If you're a cat, what am I?

413
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,040
A little monkey!

414
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,040
Aoey?

415
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,960
What do you think?

416
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,760
Why a monkey?

417
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,600
Well, I think it's pretty cute.

418
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,920
I was born in the Year of the Monkey, too.

419
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,040
Look at it!

420
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,240
You don't like monkeys?

421
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,400
No,

422
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,840
I just don't think they go together well.

423
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,120
Well, I figured you like cats, so ...

424
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,720
I don't.

425
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,360
I don't like cats.

426
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,800
Sorry.
Can I please see the catalogue again?

427
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,440
Of course.

428
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,400
Miss Aoey, if you don't prefer these,
here are more options.

429
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,840
These are keychains.

430
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,640
The popular colours are silver and gold.

431
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,360
You can also go for scented candles.

432
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,520
You can customize the scent yourself.

433
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,600
What's wrong?
You've been looking at this for a while.

434
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,840
I am confused.

435
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,880
For someone to not like something cute

436
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,040
and deny or ...

437
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,840
I can't put my finger on this.

438
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,640
Hm.

439
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,160
Describe it.
I'll help you understand it.

440
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,960
Well,

441
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,720
it's obvious that this person likes cats.

442
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,280
She really likes cats.

443
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,760
However, she doesn't like a cat doll

444
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,280
and gets upset about it.

445
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,480
That doesn't seem right.

446
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,680
Doctor,

447
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,760
why does it hurt?

448
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,520
The feeling of a cat being abandoned
by its owner.

449
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,880
Is this how it feels?

450
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,200
A cat?

451
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,080
Why a cat?

452
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,360
I ...

453
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,600
am a little cat for Gen.

454
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,960
And Gen is my little monkey.

455
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,960
Those are cute nicknames.

456
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,280
But ...

457
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,880
is this Gen your friend?

458
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,680
She's a friend

459
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
and my lover.

460
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,840
We loved each other so much.

461
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,400
She promised to never leave me,

462
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,040
but she betrayed me in the end.

463
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,960
And how do you feel now?

464
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,200
Disappointed.

465
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,840
Sad.

466
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,800
Angry.

467
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,320
Loved.

468
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,000
I don't know what to feel anymore.

469
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,120
It might not be a bad thing.

470
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,960
It might be a good memory
or a symbol of someone she loves.

471
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,720
When she lost it,
she built a wall of hate for it.

472
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,560
That way, she can hide her sorrow.

473
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,640
A symbol of someone she loves?

474
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,200
Why did you ask me
about this out of everything?

475
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,000
It's nothing.
It's about a friend.

476
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
It was a scammer.

477
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,560
- Really?
- Yeah.

478
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,000
Okay, I'll take a shower.

479
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,280
Do you want to keep watering these?
No?

480
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,480
Okay.

481
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,160
Hello, honey.

482
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,560
I'm sorry.
I was busy when you called.

483
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,400
I'll go see you this evening.

484
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,240
Okay?

485
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,160
Okay, I'll see you.

486
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,080
Bye-bye.

487
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,520
What do you think?
Does this satisfy you after a long time without Thai food?

488
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,920
Let me order you some dessert.

489
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,440
Would you like mango and sticky rice?

490
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,520
Gen?

491
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,760
I asked you if you wanted mango and sticky rice.

492
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,520
I think I'll have fresh milk tofu.

493
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,400
- Hey, two fresh milk tofu please.
- Yes.

494
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,240
Will you be free the day after tomorrow?

495
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,120
I can have you meet the writer that day.

496
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,760
She's free that day?

497
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,840
Yes.

498
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,080
If you're not ready,

499
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,760
that's okay.

500
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,520
Ready or not,

501
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,320
I have to meet Aoey anyway.

502
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,480
So, let's just get this over with.

503
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,720
But Aoey doesn't know that
you're the artist.

504
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,160
When she does,
it's going to be quite a surprise.

505
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,120
What is it, Gen?

506
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,400
A fine-tooth comb.

507
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,960
Why did you bring it?

508
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,720
A gift after a long time.

509
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,280
Ready?

510
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,640
Let's go.

511
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,760
Doctor, hello.

512
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,240
Hello.

513
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,680
Aoey.

514
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,960
How are you?

515
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,200
Nice to meet you.

516
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,600
I'm Ten.

517
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,040
- And you ...
- Genlong.

518
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,840
I'm the artist of the comic, Mate.

519
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,960
Here.

520
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,760
It's a little gift for you.

521
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,760
- What are you doing?
- Why did you do that?

522
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,320
- Gen.
- It's okay.

523
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,960
I deserve it.

524
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,600
That's right!

525
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,520
This doesn't even amount
to what you did to me!

526
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,400
You two know each other?

527
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,360
Used to.

528
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,080
For the infringement,
I'm going to sue you into bankruptcy.

529
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,480
I'm taking back everything from you!

530
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,000
Mark my words!

531
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,320
Aoey!

532
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,840
Genlong and Doctor Thot,
I'm sorry.

533
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,160
I need to go.
Goodbye.

534
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,640
Gen.

535
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,840
Are you okay, Gen?

536
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,560
It's okay.

537
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,440
I just regret

538
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,720
not bringing a raincoat.

539
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,880
I didn't know they had a water war ongoing.

540
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,400
And you're making a joke out of it?

541
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,240
You're not angry at her, right?

542
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,800
Aside from my family,

543
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,400
the only person
whom I can forgive unconditionally

544
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,400
would be her.

545
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,800
[Six years ago]

546
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,640
What do we do, Mean?

547
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,480
Not a single place seems right for us.

548
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,360
I don't think we have to rush it.

549
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,880
- Just keep looking around.
- You're right.

550
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,360
It's about to rain.
Let's go.

551
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,040
Get under here.

552
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,960
Be careful.

553
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,480
It's all wet.

554
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,720
Are you okay?

555
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,760
- Mean.
- Huh?

556
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,240
This one seems good!

557
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,640
What?
Here?

558
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,560
It's far from any community!

559
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,000
People would find it hard to come here.

560
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,640
I don't care.
I just like it.

561
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,520
There's their phone number.

562
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,440
Let's call them.

563
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,240
Who are you here to see?

564
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,200
We're looking for a location
for our coffee shop.

565
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,360
There's no phone signal here.

566
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,640
- We can't contact the owner.
- Oh.

567
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,720
That's my daughter.

568
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,200
She said if anyone's interested,
I could give them a tour.

569
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,760
Can we look inside?

570
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,840
Let's go.

571
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,120
And what will you name it?

572
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,280
Gemini, the third astrological sign
in the zodiac.

573
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,760
Hm, the twins.

574
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:19,080
But due to the location
and lots of other things,

575
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,200
I don't think it's a good location.

576
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,400
Do you think our business will do well here?

577
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,080
Let me look at the cards.

578
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,800
The Hangman.

579
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,440
Bad things will turn into good things.

580
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,520
How long have we been running
this coffee shop now?

581
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,200
Almost six years.

582
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,440
Time sure flies.

583
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,600
I agree.

584
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,520
When we first opened,

585
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,520
everything seemed to do poorly.
I thought we were going to fail.

586
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,720
True.
That's why they said that

587
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,320
time will prove everything.

588
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,080
We can turn what seems bad
into greater things.

589
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,960
- Is that right?
- Yes.

590
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,280
Okay,

591
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,840
it's done.

592
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,480
What time is it?

593
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,880
What time is it?

594
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,640
9:59 a.m.

595
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,400
9:59 a.m.

596
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,000
Are you ready to open your coffee shop,

597
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,080
Miss Owner?

598
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,000
Not yet, we still have a minute left.

599
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:39,040
Can I get a charge from my beloved girlfriend?

600
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,120
A charge?
How would you do that?

601
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,120
Like this.

602
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,480
- Did you get it?
- I did!

603
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,520
Finished charging?

604
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,720
- Ready?
- Yes.

605
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,680
- Let's open it.
- Yes.

606
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,400
Done.

607
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,600
Oh, welcome!

608
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,040
Please have a seat.

609
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,800
What would you like?
