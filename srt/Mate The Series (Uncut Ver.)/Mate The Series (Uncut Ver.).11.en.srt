1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,800
If our love will hurt someone,

2
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,520
keeping it to yourself would be best.

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,400
You want to redeem yourself
or what you've done.

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,480
If you do it and you think
it's moved out of your chest,

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,960
I truly think it's time you two
should go separate ways.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,400
Gen?
Gen?

7
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,560
Gen.

8
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,840
Gen!

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,440
Gen!

10
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,960
Singh.

11
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,440
Why were you just gone?

12
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,480
What happened?

13
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,480
What should I do?

14
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
I'll give you a million baht.

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,440
If, within three years,

16
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,320
you can turn it into five million,

17
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,640
I'll accept your dedication.

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,400
I haven't even saved up enough money.

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,920
What if we don't think about money

20
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
or my mom?

21
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,600
Just our relationship.

22
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,720
Do you miss me?

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,520
How are you?

24
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,160
Did you date Gen?

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,520
Are you dating anyone?

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,720
I am,

27
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,800
and it's not Gen.

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,800
And ...

29
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,640
who's that lucky person?

30
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,040
The person in front of me.

31
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,640
We never broke up, Singh.

32
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,960
Can we be back together?

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,360
Can I ask you something?

34
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,960
What is it?

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,000
Can I hug you?

36
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm going to work.

37
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,680
- Let's get something to eat.
- ok

38
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's go.

39
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,720
I've arrived at my condo.

40
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,280
Please schedule a meeting with Gen.

41
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,760
I'm discussing with her
about the infringement.

42
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,360
Oh, about that.

43
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,840
Just tell me however much
you'd like to be compensated.

44
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,440
She's willing to pay for it.

45
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,000
She's flying back to Macao tomorrow,

46
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,200
so she left this to me.

47
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,440
Where are you, Gen?

48
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,880
[Aoey]

49
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,080
I'm not feeling well.
Can you get me medicine?

50
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,640
Hello, Ms. Sali.

51
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,640
Where would you like to meet me?

52
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,680
I'll wait in the lobby.

53
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,240
Yes.

54
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,640
I'm sorry about Gen, John.

55
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,960
It's okay.
I understand.

56
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,840
I must thank you for always helping me.

57
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,280
I'm going to the toilet.

58
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,440
Doctor,

59
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,320
can you please help me
win Gen's heart?

60
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,440
Where would you like to meet me?

61
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,240
Anyway,

62
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,480
I'm still sorry I can't help you
to be with Gen.

63
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
I do hope that

64
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,920
you will still be Gen's good friend.

65
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,760
Of course.

66
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,560
Hello, Gen.
Did you wait long?

67
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,400
Thank you for meeting me today.

68
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,160
Give me a second.

69
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,360
I really thank you

70
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,040
for giving me this watch.

71
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,560
It helped me a lot
when I needed money.

72
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,280
Now, I want to return this to you.

73
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,120
Ms. Sali, you don't have
to return it to me.

74
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,320
I have to!

75
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,240
I'm doing well now.

76
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,200
I want to return it to you.

77
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
Gen!

78
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,560
You hung me up!

79
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,200
And you're talking to my mom?

80
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,840
What are you tricking her into this time?

81
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,120
Aoey,

82
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,000
why did you say that?

83
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,400
I asked her to come see me today!

84
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,400
I wanted to see her
and return her watch!

85
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,040
I think I should go.

86
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,120
Goodbye.

87
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,520
No!

88
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,040
You stay and talk with me!

89
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,920
What is it?

90
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,560
You seem really good
at running away, huh?

91
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
You always run away from anything.

92
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,440
You did that when you were young.
You did it again three years ago.

93
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,960
- And you did the same last night.
- I did not.

94
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,040
- There's just no need for me to stay.
- That's what running away is.

95
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,320
Be honest,

96
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,440
have you ever thought about
doing something to apologize to me?

97
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,960
What do you want?

98
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,720
If this is about the infringement,

99
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,040
just name your price.
Doctor Thot will deal with this.

100
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,720
I'm not even going to negotiate.

101
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,520
That's not enough.

102
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,840
You need to help me with my wedding

103
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,800
and come to it.

104
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,120
Huh?

105
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,880
Can you do it?

106
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,000
If you do it, I say we're even.

107
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,320
Do you dare,

108
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
or are you scared?

109
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,240
Sure.

110
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,360
I'll stay

111
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,920
and do what you asked.

112
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,000
I hope you're not running away this time.

113
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,960
I'll send you to your bridal house myself.

114
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,440
How about that?

115
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,760
I'm sorry for causing all this fuzz.

116
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
I didn't fly back with John

117
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,040
because I have to help
with Aoey's wedding.

118
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,400
Seriously?

119
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,920
I guess it's a good thing.

120
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,320
You two finally will have time
to sit down and talk.

121
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,800
I haven't told you about this!

122
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,680
I met Singh!

123
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
Singh?
Seriously?

124
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,840
And what's even more surprising

125
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,040
is that he's one of the organizers
of Aoey's wedding.

126
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh!

127
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,120
What a small world.

128
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,800
Did he tell you where he has been?

129
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Now, He and I

130
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,680
just need to hold hands
and talk to my mom.

131
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,440
I wish you both the best.

132
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,560
Thank you.

133
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,640
What about you?

134
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,720
Will you be okay
going to Aoey's wedding?

135
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,320
I'll be fine.

136
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,560
And after her wedding,

137
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,480
will you two be friends again?

138
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,320
I don't know.

139
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,200
Hey!
Great?

140
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,840
How did you find me?

141
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,120
You sneaked out, so did I

142
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,520
- And how did you know I'm here.
- Doctor Thot checked in,

143
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,080
and I remember that
you two love to meet here.

144
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,280
So, I followed you to give you a surprise.

145
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,080
Come in for a hug, my little brother!

146
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,720
Hey!
That's too tight.

147
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,280
Lots of people here!

148
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,560
You want to eat something?
On me.

149
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,920
If it's on you, I'm in.

150
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,080
I want some dessert, too!

151
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,880
- Of course.
- The one you bought for me when I was angry at you.

152
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,840
You want to tag along, Doctor?

153
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,320
On you, right?

154
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,760
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

155
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,200
What we need to do now
is to fix the dress's design,

156
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,720
film pre-wedding videos,
and the presentation video.

157
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,400
I brought Gen in to help.

158
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,840
Of course.

159
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,920
What do you want her to do?

160
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,000
Everything.

161
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,560
Well,

162
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,320
I don't have many female friends
to help with my outfit

163
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,440
and all the girly stuff.

164
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,880
Is that right, Gen?

165
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,800
I guess you should come
and help me with my dress.

166
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,600
Okay.

167
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,280
Ten, I'm so excited.

168
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,440
Our big day is closing in.

169
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm excited, too.

170
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,960
You're feeling alright now, right?

171
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,000
Of course I am.

172
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,240
Why did you ask?

173
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,760
Well, you seem stressed lately.

174
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,760
Once this is done, there's nothing for us
to worry about anymore.

175
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,160
Besides,

176
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,840
you will get to do more
than just hold my hands.

177
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,480
Turn around, please.

178
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,360
Do I look good in this dress?

179
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,840
It looks nice.

180
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Do you think anyone will regret losing me

181
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,720
seeing me getting married?

182
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,160
We're done, Miss Aoey.
You can change back now.

183
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,520
Sure.

184
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,120
Gen,

185
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,360
help me take off my dress.

186
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,400
Let's go.

187
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,960
I still remember

188
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,680
how you slowly stripped me off

189
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,280
piece ...

190
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,800
by piece.

191
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,960
Why don't you ask Ten to do this?

192
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,920
Think of it as a practice round.

193
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,800
Done!
We're coming out.

194
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,120
How did you guys hold this?

195
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,640
- We need this for our video!
- What's going on?

196
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,600
We accidentally spilt paint on this.

197
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,320
We need this for our videos, too.

198
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,840
I'll repaint it.

199
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,360
It should look fine from afar.

200
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,200
Thank you.

201
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,720
What's going on?

202
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,360
Genlong's really good at painting.

203
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,200
Aoey.

204
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,000
Aoey.

205
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,960
What did you say?

206
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,480
I said, Genlong's really good at painting.

207
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,760
Umm.

208
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,880
- Let's go.
- Umm.

209
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,120
Now, please look at each other.

210
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,080
That's great.

211
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,000
Okay, can you move closer?

212
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,240
That's right.

213
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,400
Alright.

214
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,320
I think it seems a bit too tense.

215
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,120
Can you try relaxing yourself a bit?

216
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,000
Okay.
Move your hand closer.

217
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,920
Gen, can you help me with my poses?

218
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,320
How should I pose?

219
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,800
I don't know how.

220
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,320
Okay, let's continue.

221
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,520
Look at each other now.

222
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,320
Give me a sweet smile.

223
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,080
That's great.

224
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,520
Feel free to comment on this.

225
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,320
Try it out.

226
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,520
Please switch out coriander to parsley.

227
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,960
For the chicken broth,
please add more milk and cream.

228
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,360
- I prefer thicker broth.
- Of course.

229
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,960
I never knew
you knew a lot about cooking.

230
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,560
Well, it's not that much.

231
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,400
That's nice.

232
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,200
I want to try what you cook for me.
Can you do that?

233
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,960
Sure thing.

234
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,120
If so,

235
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
once we move in together,

236
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,840
I'll cook your breakfast, lunch,
and dinner.

237
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,680
- Sounds good?
- Yes.

238
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,680
I can't wait to move in with you.

239
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,560
Umm.

240
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,960
Delicious.

241
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,520
I'm waiting to taste your cooking.

242
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,520
Okay.

243
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,080
If you add milk and cream, it will be even more delicious.

244
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,600
You're amazing. I never knew that.

245
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,920
Actually,

246
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,680
I wanted Gen and Aoey
to become friends again

247
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,400
because ...

248
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,440
it was partly me who made this happen.

249
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,320
I'll help you.

250
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,200
I was gone for a long time.

251
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,400
I didn't get to take care of you at all.

252
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,160
During that time,

253
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,560
while it's true that I cared
about our future,

254
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,040
I totally forgot that the present
is just as important, too.

255
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,040
Big Sister!

256
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
How's the infringement thing going?

257
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,360
Doctor Thot is on it.

258
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,480
And you helping Aoey's wedding?

259
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,160
You're sure you can do that?

260
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,280
Hey,

261
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,520
I'm worried about you.

262
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,120
Are you sure
this will make you feel better?

263
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,600
Why?

264
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,560
During the three years,

265
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,760
I always saw you in pain.

266
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,280
I want you to get over the past

267
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,600
and over Aoey.

268
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,240
Hey,

269
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,600
I'll be fine.

270
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,520
I want you to forgive yourself

271
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,680
and just let it go.

272
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,520
You should be happy for once.

273
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,960
Ask yourself.
What are you doing now?

274
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,240
If your mind is still unclear,
how about going away for some time?

275
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,760
I didn't know you had a serious mode.

276
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,760
Anyway, thanks for asking.

277
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,640
Here's your Americano.

278
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,360
Oh!
Gen!

279
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,200
Hey!
It's really you!

280
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,720
Doctor Mean.
Dokfai.

281
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,440
What would you like?
Coffee?

282
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,680
Give me a second.

283
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,080
How have you been?

284
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,720
[Aoey]

285
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,240
Gen.

286
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,080
Yes?

287
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,840
Are you okay?

288
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,240
I am.

289
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,800
Seems like we're due
for a long conversation.

290
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,720
Sit down and talk.

291
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,960
Seeing someone taking care of
and loving her

292
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,920
made me happy.

293
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,040
Though, it sometimes hurts.

294
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,080
I feel you.

295
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Though, you've come to terms
with your feelings now.

296
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,760
You can still love her as a friend.

297
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,120
Did you know that friendship

298
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,880
might last even longer
than other kinds of relationships?

299
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,840
If you can finally be her friend again,

300
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,720
you won't have to worry about anything
when you return to Macao.

301
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,920
To see our loved one happy,

302
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,200
I think, is what true love is.

303
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,360
Feel free to look around.

304
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,760
Thank you.

305
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,400
Hello, Aoey.

306
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,160
Gen!

307
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,000
Where are you?
You need to see me now!

308
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,720
To see our loved one happy,

309
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,560
I think, is what true love is.

310
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,640
Calm down, Aoey.

311
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,080
I'm coming to see you.

312
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,560
Please wait for me.

313
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,080
Okay.
Hurry.

314
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,720
Where have you been?

315
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,040
Why didn't you help me
choose my flowers today?

316
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,920
You didn't pick up my calls.

317
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,160
Were you going to run away from me?

318
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,960
I'm sorry.

319
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,320
I have already ordered the flowers for you.

320
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,960
You're not ruining this, aren't you?

321
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,120
Are you trying to ruin my wedding?

322
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,880
Why would I do that?

323
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,320
I want to see you happy.

324
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,760
I need to go to my room.

325
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,320
Oh, Aoey.

326
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,920
Can I help you?

327
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,440
I'm not done talking.

328
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,120
I remember when we lived here together.

329
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,800
You loved to stay at your home.

330
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,680
But I came back to help you
with the King's Card game.

331
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,920
The game that got us kissing?

332
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,320
Aoey, what are you saying?

333
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,760
In a few days,

334
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,000
I will get married.

335
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,960
Will you just watch me loving someone else?

336
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,520
Huh?

337
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,480
Aoey.

338
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,320
I don't want to create bad memories of us both.

339
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
If you want to take revenge on me

340
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,600
or hurt me,

341
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,400
do something else,

342
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,400
not this.

343
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,960
If you do this,

344
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,240
you'll only hurt Ten.

345
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,640
And you will regret this, too.

346
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,080
I promised to help with your wedding,

347
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,240
and I will do my best

348
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,560
as your best friend.

349
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,640
- This one seems good.
- It's looking alright, but ...

350
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,880
I want to revise it a bit.
What do you think?

351
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,440
- That'd be nice.
- Okay?

352
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,680
I love this already.
It's so cute.

353
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,960
- I agree!
- I'll revise this for you.

354
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,480
- Or we can just go with this?
- Of course.

355
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,480
That's why I came to see you.

356
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,280
Anytime!

357
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,160
- This seems good and fun already.
- It does!

358
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,920
I need some fresh air outside.

359
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,960
Okay.

360
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,040
I guess she's just nervous.

361
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,000
Let's just go with this.

362
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,920
- Sure.
- Thank you.

363
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,960
Here's the script.

364
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,920
I think it's perfect already.

365
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,880
Okay, can you please sit
on this chair here?

366
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,120
- I just want to test my lighting.
- Oh.

367
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,160
Okay.

368
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,520
Let me just put a mic on you.

369
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,720
You can test your voice now.

370
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,720
- Please test the mic for us.
- Sure.

371
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,560
One, two, three, four, five.

372
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,400
Actually, you're looking great
with your outfit and makeup today.

373
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,600
Would you like to say something
to the couple?

374
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
We'll record it for you.

375
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,760
Okay, ready?

376
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,520
Five, four, three, two, one.

377
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,520
Hello, Miss New Bride.

378
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Hey!
Great!

379
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,880
What brought you here?
How are you?

380
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,080
Are you doing alright?
It's been a long time.

381
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,280
I came back to Thailand

382
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,080
and stopped by to see my sister.

383
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,240
I heard that you're about to get married.

384
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,560
I'm not sure if I should be happy or what.

385
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
Great,

386
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,320
for all the bad things I've done to you,

387
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,560
That's alright.

389
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,040
I'm not here for that.

390
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,960
This is about you and my sister.

391
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,360
During the three years in Macao,

392
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,840
I'm sure you have no idea
how my sister was.

393
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,040
I do.

394
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,000
She said she's doing fine.

395
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,600
She never thought about me.

396
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,200
Hearing that,

397
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't think we should worry.

398
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,360
It's the opposite, actually.

399
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,840
Since we moved,

400
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,880
she only thinks about you.

401
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,680
She drew portraits of you every day.

402
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,800
She feels guilty for leaving you.

403
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,600
She still draws you every day.

404
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,960
It took a long time for our family
to bring her back.

405
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,360
You don't have to believe me.

406
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,680
I just want you to see this
from her side.

407
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,080
Why are you telling me this?

408
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,480
Gen is selfish,
and she deserves it.

409
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,840
I don't care what happens to her.

410
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,760
This script seems good.

411
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Aoey,

412
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,640
drink some water.

413
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,400
Just express your feelings.

414
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,280
Don't worry about the script.

415
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,360
Just relax.

416
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,680
- Okay, are you two ready?
- Yes.

417
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,560
Okay.

418
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,840
Five, four, three, two, one.

419
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,560
Can you two please introduce yourself?

420
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,440
Hi, I'm Ten.

421
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,720
I'm Aoey.

422
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,320
How did you two first meet?

423
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,120
We first met
when I went to give novels to my sister.

424
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,760
I met here there,

425
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,760
and ...

426
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,640
if I remember correctly,
we made eye contact.

427
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,320
I was so impressed by her.

428
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,080
I just felt like
she was the right one for me.

429
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,720
She's the most beautiful woman for me.

430
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,120
I fell in love with her on that day.

431
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,240
Have a seat.

432
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,680
Are you okay?

433
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,880
You seem pale.

434
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,960
I'm fine.

435
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,600
Are you okay?

436
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,360
I have something for you.

437
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,440
Thank you.

438
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,240
I want to give you this
as a wedding gift.

439
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,360
I want you to know that
I'm really happy for you.

440
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,880
You did great today.

441
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,040
Don't worry about a thing.
I'm always here for you.

442
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,720
You're probably tired now.

443
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,640
Let's get some rest.

444
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,560
I won't bother you anymore.

445
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,520
Doctor,

446
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,560
you wanted me to stay away from Gen,

447
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,480
but now,

448
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,880
you brought her back.
Why?

449
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,480
That's what I intended, yes.

450
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,000
But now?

451
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,760
I want the two of you

452
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,840
to be friends again.

453
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,840
Friends?

454
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,560
Considering what she did to me,

455
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,400
you want us to be friends again?

456
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,480
Isn't that too simple?

457
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,120
Aoey,

458
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,840
the truth about Gen

459
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,400
isn't what it seems to you.

460
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,520
This 100,000 is for Aoey.

461
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,080
She can use it for her novels
or whatever.

462
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,320
The money we used to publish your novel
and set up our publisher

463
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,360
is Gen's money.

464
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,080
And your tuition and treatment fee

465
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,000
were supported by her watch

466
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,880
that your mom pawned
time and time again

467
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,960
to go through hard times.

468
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,880
When I'm gone,

469
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,120
can you make Aoey hate me?

470
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,640
Do we have to go that far, Gen?

471
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,880
We don't know what will happen next.

472
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,000
I might die, or ...

473
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,840
I might never come back again.

474
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,480
I just don't want her
to wait for me pointlessly.

475
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,320
And did you know

476
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,400
that the letter you read

477
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,320
wasn't really her true feeling for you.

478
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,120
It was just something she did
so that you can move on

479
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,000
and get over her.

480
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,280
It was all my fault.

481
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,920
I let everything become what it is today.

482
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,440
I'm sorry, Aoey.

483
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,920
Oh.

484
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,200
Aoey?

485
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,000
Why don't you get some rest?

486
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,280
Can I come in?

487
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,720
Wait for me here.
I'll get you water.

488
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,800
I'm sorry, Gen.

489
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,040
I just learned the truth

490
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,200
from Great and Doctor Thot.

491
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,840
About your letter

492
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,200
and everything you did for me.

493
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,480
I'm sorry

494
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,080
for never realizing the feelings
you have for me.

495
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,120
It’s okay, Aoey.

496
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,200
I understand everything that you did.

497
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,760
- But ...
- In a few days,

498
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,360
you're going to get married.

499
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,680
You will start a new life.

500
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,600
But no matter what happens,

501
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,960
I will always be your best friend.

502
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,880
I'm sorry, Gen.

503
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,560
I'm sorry, too.

504
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,280
I truly am.

505
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,200
Gen, are you hungry?

506
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,600
Congratulations.

507
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,160
Why are you looking at me?

508
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,840
Is there something on my face?

509
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,880
I ...

510
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,040
dreamed.

511
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,680
What about it?

512
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,960
I dreamed that you married a man.

513
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,080
My heart will never change,
and you know that.

514
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,000
If that day really comes,

515
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,320
do you think we'll still be friends?

516
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,880
Hm.

517
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,600
If I say yes,

518
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,880
that would go against my feelings

519
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,120
because that would hurt me a lot.

520
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,760
I guess all I can do is try my best.

521
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,240
But ...

522
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,520
if that day really comes

523
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,080
when you're marrying someone else,

524
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,000
I'll be happy for you

525
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,320
for seeing someone I love

526
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,080
happy.

527
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,320
Hm.

528
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,920
I'll do the same for you,

529
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,080
- but ...
- But what?

530
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,480
that will never happen!

531
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,400
I won't ever be friends with you.

532
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,720
Removing me from your life
won't be easy!

533
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,600
I never even thought about that!

534
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,360
Whatever,

535
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,320
my heart will never change.

536
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,480
What about yours?

537
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,280
With those soft cheeks of yours,
who would?

538
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,680
- You like it?
- I do!

539
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,920
Let me smooch it!

540
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,880
Who could resist that?

541
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,080
Huh?
