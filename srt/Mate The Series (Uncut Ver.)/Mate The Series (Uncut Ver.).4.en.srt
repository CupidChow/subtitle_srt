1
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,040
Aoey: What are you up to?

2
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,900
It’s raining!

3
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,440
- Ah!
- Aoey, be careful!

4
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,940
Come quickly!

5
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,540
Come quickly!

6
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,740
Thank you, Mint.

7
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,460
- My pleasure.
- It’s raining; please drive safely.

8
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,200
- The road is slippery.
- How about this?

9
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,440
- I’ll see you to your room.
- It’s okay.

10
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,380
This is enough.
I don’t want to trouble you.

11
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,680
I’ll see you tomorrow.

12
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,260
Okay.

13
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,340
That’s everything.
Okay.

14
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,320
- That’s what you are to me.
- Huh?

15
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,980
- What joke was that? See you!
- Okay, bye-bye.

16
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,540
Walk slowly; the floor is slippery!

17
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,900
I want you to actually do it now.

18
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,280
Open your heart.

19
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,060
My heart melted all over the floor.

20
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,240
- Ugh, Mint.
- Okay.

21
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
Bye.

22
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,180
Have a good night.

23
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,180
She has to love this!

24
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,660
Doctor.

25
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,260
Did you know that Aoey has different people
giving her a ride home every day?

26
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,180
The university gave me a headache.

27
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,720
That’s normal.
You’ll get the hang of it soon.

28
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,060
- Of course. Thank you for today.
- Sure.

29
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,920
You can do it, Aoey.
I believe you can definitely do this.

30
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,260
- Thank you for the ride today.
- Yes.

31
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,120
- Have a good night.
- Stay safe.

32
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,920
Bye-bye.
Have a good night.

33
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,140
Can I give you a ride again tomorrow?

34
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,040
Again?
I don’t want to trouble you.

35
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,540
It’s alright.
I pass here anyway.

36
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,480
- Please?
- Alright, fine.

37
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,180
- Bye-bye. Thank you, Mint.
- Bye-bye.

38
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,340
See you.

39
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,340
So what?

40
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,300
Are you jealous?

41
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,880
Absolutely not.

42
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,080
I just don’t like seeing her getting fooled.

43
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,340
She always gets used by her friends.

44
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,120
Hm.

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,540
You’re worried about her?

46
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,860
I am not!

47
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,620
I just hate seeing people being exploited.

48
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,620
Are you sure?

49
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,920
Your mouth doesn’t match your heart.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,440
- Have you ...
- Stop right there!

51
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,380
fallen for her?

52
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,920
Gen.

53
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,080
I feel you.

54
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,500
Sometimes, we can’t express
everything we hide inside

55
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,460
because we never know
if our goodwill will hurt them.

56
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,720
At this time, you need to calm down.

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,980
Nothing is happening right now.

58
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,700
It might not happen at all.

59
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,540
Trust me.
Don’t think much about it.

60
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,300
Calm down.

61
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,080
I hope that’s the case.

62
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,320
Gen!
I’m back!

63
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,660
- Can I ...
- Hm?

64
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,540
Can I have friends over
to work on a report tomorrow here?

65
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,740
Sure!

66
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,240
I’ll stay at home, then.

67
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,140
Oh, why?

68
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,300
Am I troubling you?

69
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,080
No, this is so you can work freely.

70
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,360
Thank you.

71
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,520
Hello, Mint.

72
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,820
Meet me at the condo tomorrow.

73
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,060
I asked the owner.

74
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,020
Yeah, of course.

75
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,220
See you.
Bye.

76
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,080
- Oh, Gen!
- Oh.

77
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,960
I never thought I’d see you here.

78
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,620
What are you here for?

79
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,840
Looking for an idea for my project.

80
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,700
You’re studying art?

81
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,980
Architecture.

82
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,520
Right.

83
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,940
Okay, we’ll be somewhere else now.

84
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,940
Yes.
Wait!

85
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,780
Can I ...

86
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,580
have your Line ID, please?

87
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,760
Sure thing.

88
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,240
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

89
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,040
Let’s go.

90
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,600
- Hey, Gen!
- Hey.

91
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,060
- Hello.
- Have you eaten? Hi.

92
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,620
I have.

93
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,880
Are you staying at home
or at the condo tonight?

94
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,760
I’m staying home tonight.

95
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,720
Are you alright?

96
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,520
Are you fighting with your friend?

97
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,860
Hm, no.

98
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,400
Hm?
Normally, when you’re troubled by something,

99
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,580
you always tell me about it.

100
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,820
You’re acting strange.

101
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Hey!
Big Sister!

102
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,660
You remember your way home?

103
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,080
- Do you think this is your home only?
- Ahem.

104
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,480
Nuh-uh.

105
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,120
You’re not the only one who lives here.

106
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,640
Nope.

107
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Does this mean Aoey is alone?

108
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,200
Can I stay there?

109
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
Quit that thought.

110
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,300
- Mom! Look!
- You two were just joking.

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,800
But that’s great.
You could be there

112
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,220
because Aoey’s invited
many people to the condo,

113
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,000
to help take care of my room.

114
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,020
Seriously?
Is this true?

115
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,160
- I can actually do it?
- Yeah.

116
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,260
- I’m grabbing my bag.
- Stop it.

117
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,120
- Stop right there.
- Aw.

118
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,060
Great, you promised me.

119
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,360
You said you’ll go out with me tonight.

120
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,580
Are you going to break your promise?

121
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,500
- Can I change my mind now?
- Not even a slight chance.

122
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,340
Get dressed.
I’ve been waiting for a while now.

123
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,400
- I’ll go now.
- Sure.

124
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,100
Wait for me.

125
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,300
Get ready quickly, Great!

126
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,840
- That’s everything.
- Okay.

127
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,520
That’s what you are to me.

128
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
- Bye now.
- Bye-bye. Thank you, Mint.

129
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,280
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

130
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,080
Bye.

131
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,200
Hello, Mint.

132
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,160
Meet me at the condo tomorrow.

133
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,560
Hello, Aoey.

134
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,960
Are you at your condo now?

135
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,580
Oh, you came with Mint?

136
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,040
What a shame.
Had I not gone out with Mom, I’d go see you.

137
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,480
I wish you the best.
Miss you.

138
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,120
This has nothing to do with me.
This has nothing to do with me.

139
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,580
Don’t care.
Don’t care.

140
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,400
Genlong, stay home.
Stay home.

141
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,980
Stay home.

142
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,600
I will absolutely not go to the condo.

143
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,440
I think Jeng is having something
with our group.

144
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,260
- Yeah, he seems to like our group a lot.
- I know, right?

145
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,060
What a handsome guy!

146
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,060
He’s such a dream guy for me.

147
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,140
Guys,

148
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,860
this is Genlong.

149
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,040
She’s my friend.

150
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,840
She owns this room.

151
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,260
Make yourself at home.

152
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,600
I guess this TV will be too loud for you.

153
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,380
I’ll go inside.

154
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,920
Make yourself at home.
If you need something,

155
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,220
I’m in the bedroom.

156
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,620
Drop your stuff!

157
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,080
Make yourself at home.
Genlong is very nice.

158
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,120
- What are you looking for?
- My phone.

159
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,700
It’s here.

160
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,640
Gen, are you alright?

161
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,380
Are you feeling well?

162
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,800
I’m fine.

163
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,760
Didn’t you say you’d stay home today?

164
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,640
Why are you here?

165
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,680
I changed my mind.

166
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,500
I prefer it here.

167
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,560
Are you here because ...

168
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,620
you’re jealous of me
being with my friends?

169
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,540
No.
Not at all!

170
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,900
I’ve been looking for his.

171
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,800
What is this?

172
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,620
- How can I eat this?
- Just eat it.

173
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,780
When are we starting?

174
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,960
I’ll just skip this part.

175
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,960
This opening is so long.

176
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,840
You’ll love it.

177
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,840
This looks like a jellyfish.

178
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,300
Yeah, yeah.
You’re right.

179
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,420
- Haha!
- Can I have that, too?

180
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,360
Did you order the handcuffs we need
for the short film?

181
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,940
I did.

182
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,420
It arrived.
I put it there.

183
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,620
- I’ll get it.
- Get it!

184
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,820
Whoa!
Let’s see it!

185
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,980
Ah-huh!
Look at this.

186
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,860
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!
- Can we use this as a jumping rope?

187
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,160
- Haha! Good idea.
- It’ll hurt so badly when it hits your legs.

188
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,600
Don’t play with it like that.

189
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,060
You’re going to break it.

190
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,620
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!
- Give me that.

191
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,120
You’re going to break it!

192
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,940
I can’t wait to play with that!

193
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,580
Give me snacks!

194
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,280
- Oh, oh! It’s here.
- Where?

195
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,380
I can’t tell whom he looks like.

196
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,160
- He looks familiar.
- That’s crazy.

197
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,740
Is everything alright, Gen?

198
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,020
I didn’t want to get myself into this,

199
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,820
but I saw that your friends
didn’t help you one bit.

200
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,200
You’re the only one working.

201
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,080
Have you realized
that they’re using you?

202
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,940
They are not.
They did help.

203
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,040
Don’t be too quick
to judge my friends like that.

204
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,400
This is going to be so funny.
Just look at this.

205
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,120
- Whom does he look like?
- Looks familiar?

206
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,440
Yeah!

207
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,240
- So handsome!
- I’m going to get this very cut.

208
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,120
- Doesn’t that look good?
- It does.

209
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,400
- It seems great for me.
- Of course.

210
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,920
Are you done with your report?

211
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,980
Yes, we are.

212
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,360
Aoey is so good at it.

213
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,500
She finished it so quickly!

214
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,460
Now that we’re done working,

215
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,760
how about we give ourselves
a little party?

216
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,140
- I came prepared!
- Wow!

217
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,000
I’ve got a game, too.

218
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,240
Wanna play the King’s Card?

219
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,940
I’ll teach you how to play.

220
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,800
In this game,
I’ll deal one card to each of us.

221
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,480
One of them will be a king.

222
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,600
Whoever has it is the King.

223
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,300
The King can command anyone
to do anything.

224
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,920
For instance, you can command
numbers one and two to hug.

225
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
If I’m number one,
and Aoey is number two,

226
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,180
we’d have to hug.

227
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,760
- Hey!
- Yeah! Sounds good?

228
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,940
Hm, no.

229
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,820
I’d rather not play this.

230
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,640
Aw, please.
This seems like so much fun.

231
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,080
What if I don’t do what the King said?

232
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,240
- You have to drink the whole glass.’
- Exactly.

233
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,080
- Let’s play.
- Please.

234
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
We’re all friends.

235
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,860
If you don’t want to touch others,
just drink.

236
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,660
It’s just a drink.
It’s alright.

237
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,440
- Please?
- Please?

238
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,920
- Fine, I’ll play.
- Yay!

239
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,920
That’s what I’m talking about.

240
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And would you like to play, too?

241
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,160
No, I’d rather just watch.

242
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,420
Okay, let’s clean up the table.

243
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,660
Get everything off the table.

244
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,480
I’ll deal you guys cards in the first round.

245
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,860
- Okay?
- Okay.

246
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,620
Don’t look just yet.

247
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,860
We’ll look at the same time.

248
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,000
Who’s going to be the King?

249
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,620
Let’s keep it going.

250
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,880
Okay.

251
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,580
Look now.

252
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,740
Who’s it going to be?

253
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,400
Hey!
I am the King!

254
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,980
I did not cheat, by the way!

255
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,720
Now that I’m the King,

256
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,860
I want number three

257
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,120
to kiss the person on her
right on the cheek!

258
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,040
Who’s number three?

259
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,060
- Not me!
- Hey!

260
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,140
- It’s me!
- Whoa!

261
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,820
Aoey’s number three?

262
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,880
If you kiss me on my cheek,

263
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
you’ll find that it smells pretty nice

264
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,080
because I just put on powder!

265
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,220
You want to do it?

266
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,400
What’s it going to be?

267
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,340
- Aw.
- Aw.

268
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,580
What a painful rejection.

269
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,900
Okay, if you don’t want to,
bottoms up.

270
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,800
- The whole glass.
- The whole thing!

271
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,420
In one go!

272
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,680
Yeah!
Awesome!

273
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,600
Good job.

274
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,220
- Nice.
- Let’s keep it going!

275
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,220
Let’s keep going.
It’s getting intense!

276
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Aoey, you’re drunk.

277
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,480
- Quit now.
- What?

278
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,540
How can she quit?

279
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,640
Three people playing this isn’t any fun.

280
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,680
We need more people.

281
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,340
Please stay.

282
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,480
I’ll play for Aoey.

283
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,720
Play for her?
Are you having a crush on her?

284
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,960
Are we playing or quitting?

285
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,340
Playing, of course.

286
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,580
Let’s go!
Let’s go!

287
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,300
Don’t cry if you’re unlucky!

288
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,440
Let’s do it.

289
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,160
We’ll see how this goes.

290
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,900
Look at your card.

291
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,340
Who’s the King?
Let’s see.

292
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,240
It’s me.

293
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,500
- I am the King.
- Again?

294
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,140
You never deal,
but you’re always the King.

295
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,300
It’s you again and again.
What is it going to be?

296
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,600
I command number two

297
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,060
to take off their underwear.

298
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,780
Isn’t that too much?

299
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,420
- Who’s number two?
- Hey!

300
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,100
- Who’s number two?
- Not me!

301
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,240
Reveal yours!

302
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,400
Oh!
She got it in her first round!

303
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,760
Do you dare?

304
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,260
I hate being challenged.

305
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,080
Yeah!

306
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,800
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

307
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,640
Whoa!

308
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,360
She’s so real.

309
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,560
She is so real!

310
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,060
- Awesome.
- She’s so real for that.

311
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,180
Okay, okay.

312
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,740
You did it.
Let’s continue.

313
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,040
Who’s going to be the King this time?

314
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,860
Make us do nice things, please.

315
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,600
- Hey!
- I command ...

316
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,580
number one and three

317
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,360
to kiss on the balcony!

318
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,860
What?
Are you serious?

319
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
- I mean it!
- I’m number one!

320
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,520
- Whoa!
- And who’s number three?

321
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,040
Reveal yours.

322
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,300
- Not you.
- It’s me.

323
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,840
Wow.

324
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,480
If you don’t dare, just drink.

325
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,560
- Drink up!
- Who said I don’t?

326
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,580
- I hate being challenged.’
- Wow!

327
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,740
- Whoa!
- Let’s do it.

328
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,340
- Do you dare?
- Anytime!

329
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,820
Let’s do it.

330
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,100
Meet me on the balcony!

331
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,600
I’ll stand here,
or I won’t be able to reach you!

332
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,700
Kiss now!

333
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,200
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

334
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,180
Do you dare?

335
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,680
No!

336
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,060
Gen is mine only!

337
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,140
Let’s leave.
Everyone’s too drunk!

338
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,880
Let’s go.

339
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,640
Thank you for inviting us

340
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,420
and sorry for the mess.

341
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,340
Careful.
This way.

342
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,780
Where’s everyone?

343
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,460
They left.

344
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,420
Just rest.

345
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,000
I’ll go clean everything.

346
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,800
Aoey.

347
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,940
Good morning, Gen.

348
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,020
Something’s wrong?

349
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,060
No.

350
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,040
You’re still blushing from last night.

351
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,780
What do you mean by “last night”?

352
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,800
- Weren’t you drunk?
- I was,

353
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,700
but I remember

354
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,800
that we ...

355
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,080
Stop it.

356
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,680
Don’t mention it.

357
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,000
Why?

358
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,460
You don’t want to talk about it

359
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,400
because you want to do it?

360
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,620
I’m sorry.

361
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,440
I didn’t mean to do it.

362
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,840
I was just taken away.

363
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,600
Why are you sorry?

364
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,780
Wasn’t that your true feeling?

365
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,500
My true feeling is now.

366
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,200
Quit being drunk.
Wake up.

367
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,640
You are the one to wake up.

368
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,480
I know what your heart really wants.

369
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,300
I have woken up,
and I know that I have a boyfriend.

370
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,100
That’s Doctor Thot.

371
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,040
You should see someone, too.

372
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,840
If not, you have to leave my life.

373
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,760
- Why do you keep pushing me away?
- So that what happened last night won’t happen again.

374
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,580
Fine, I’ll do what you want.

375
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,040
- I’ll get a boyfriend.
- Good.

376
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,980
Get one.

377
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,500
I’ll date Great.

378
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,840
I’ll date him
and do what I did to you last night with him.

379
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,120
So?

380
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,140
Why don’t you look happy?

381
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,120
Isn’t this what you want?

382
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,440
Or are you acting against your heart?

383
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,760
I am not.

384
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,900
I mean it.

385
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,980
Hello.

386
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,340
I’d like to leave this for Doctor Thot.

387
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,660
Sure thing.

388
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,080
- Did you know that Doctor Thot have a boyfriend?
- Huh?

389
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,020
- Doctor Thot?
- Yeah.

390
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,320
If you’re talking about the guy
that left a bag for him,

391
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,100
I think he’s in it for money.

392
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,860
That is nothing.

393
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,400
What I am going to say is that

394
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,660
Doctor Thot already has a girlfriend.

395
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,700
The beautiful rich girl?

396
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,100
She looks more belong than that guy.

397
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,680
Singh.

398
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,600
I was going to call you.

399
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,320
Yes.

400
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,420
Gen called me,

401
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,880
asking for help.

402
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,320
Can you come with me?

403
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,400
Please?
Please?

404
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,820
When we’re done, I can drop you off.

405
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,680
Sure.

406
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,080
Gen really makes me look like
I’m her boyfriend.

407
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,180
Let’s go.

408
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,900
Let’s go.

409
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,540
This has been a long day.

410
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,220
- No one was there to comfort me.
- Hi, Doctor!

411
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,500
Oh, Gen.

412
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,540
Let’s find a place to sit and talk.

413
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,040
- That’s great.
- Where should we be?

414
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,940
How about this one?

415
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,880
Of course.
Whatever you say.

416
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,100
Let’s go.

417
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,360
We always have shabu when we meet.

418
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,740
- And Thai BBQ.
- We both will gain weight soon!

419
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,500
- How about this one?
- This?

420
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,200
These look good.

421
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,160
You’re together?

422
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,600
Yes.

423
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
I’m with Doctor Thot, too.

424
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,380
We have one table available
at the moment.

425
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,760
We’re having
the Come 4 Pay 3 Promotion.

426
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,800
Would you be interested?

427
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,080
Are you four together?

428
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,640
Wait, is it five?

429
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,380
I think I’ll leave for now.

430
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,460
Thank you, Doctor,

431
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,060
for having me around.

432
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,980
I’ll see you later, Singh.

433
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,280
And what about us?

434
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,460
Do you want to eat here?

435
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,780
If you do, I’ll go with you.

436
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,200
I’m not picky.

437
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,420
Jed, can we sit at the same table
with Genlong?

438
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,680
Do you mind?

439
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,400
No, not at all.

440
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,560
We only have to pay for three, too.
It’s a deal.

441
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,040
- Please come inside.
- Let’s go.

442
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,940
I think you should talk it out.

443
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,180
If you keep this going,
it might get out of hand.

444
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,440
Aoey, are these two a couple?

445
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,560
They seem very strange.
Are they fighting?

446
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,680
I think these two don’t look like
a couple at all.

447
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,500
I’m just not used to
being with strangers.

448
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,460
We’re actually a very sweet couple.

449
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,680
Is that right?

450
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,160
Yes.

451
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,800
Feed me, please.

452
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,000
- Oh.
- Feed me, please.

453
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,660
The seaweed here is really good, Gen.

454
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,680
Really?

455
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,180
Try it.

456
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,360
You like it?

457
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,820
They seem so nice.

458
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,660
I just had this, and it was so good.

459
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,180
Yum!

460
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,160
- Here, Doctor.
- Hm!

461
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,240
Jed, try my seaweed.

462
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,200
I guarantee that
it tastes better than yours.

463
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,660
- Hm!
- How was it?

464
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,480
I love it!

465
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,120
Gen.

466
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,260
- This pork’s great.
- Doctor,

467
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
can you please take photos of us two?

468
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,540
Of course.

469
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,520
Get a bit closer.

470
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,480
Closer.

471
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,340
Say cheese.

472
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,460
Gen?

473
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,740
Where are you going?

474
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,540
The toilet.

475
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,560
- I guess we’ll just keep going.
- Sure.

476
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,900
- Would you like more photos?
- Sure!

477
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,860
No, I want to eat.

478
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,540
- She’s hungry.
- Here, Aoey.

479
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,700
Thank you.

480
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,020
Let’s go.

481
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,200
Doctor, pick up!

482
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,220
Pick up!
Pick up!

483
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,360
Hey!

484
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,480
Let me feed you seaweed.

485
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,480
What is this?

486
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,700
What’s wrong with you, Great?

487
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,520
- Great, no! No!
- Stop it!

488
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,720
Great, calm down.
You, too.

489
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,120
Great, stop it. Let’s go outside.
Gen, come.

490
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,180
- Stop it, Great.
- Hey!

491
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,800
What is this?

492
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,440
Are you okay?

493
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,420
Great, calm down!

494
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,140
- Great!
- Stop it!

495
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,700
No one wants to be with someone
who can’t control themselves like you!

496
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,380
Dammit!

497
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,260
Let’s get you clean up.

498
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,840
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

499
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,680
Gen!

500
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,760
Gen!

501
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,740
Gen!
We need to talk!

502
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,100
Did you call Great?

503
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,300
Why did you do this?

504
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,940
You told me to see someone,

505
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,040
and you hurt me like this.

506
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,900
What do you want?

507
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,340
So what?

508
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,380
Didn’t you say you’ll date Great?

509
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,740
Why did you go out with Jed?

510
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,340
Didn’t you think I did that
just to get back to you?

511
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,000
How would I know that?

512
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,200
Isn’t teasing men what you always do?

513
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,700
You still think I’m that person?

514
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,860
That’s how I see it!

515
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,540
I thought you’d understand me.

516
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,620
I thought you’d see how much
I’ve done for you.

517
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,080
I did see it.

518
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,780
You did it to have a place to stay.

519
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,640
I’m moving out.

520
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,260
No.

521
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,700
You stay; I’ll return home.

522
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,760
Think of it as support for a friend.

523
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,520
Hey!

524
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,820
Why are you looking like that?

525
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,700
What got into you?

526
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,840
It’s the project, as always.

527
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,840
Oh, will you be alright?
No one will be home.

528
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,120
Where are you going?

529
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,640
I’ll go with Dad to have dinner
with an ambassador.

530
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,560
He’s been waiting.

531
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,960
Then you should go.
He’s waiting.

532
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,780
I’ll be fine.

533
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,500
If you need something, call me.

534
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,540
Mom.

535
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,480
Hm?

536
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,380
I have a question.

537
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,180
Why don’t my thoughts
and what I express match?

538
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,120
It might be because
you’re thinking too much?

539
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,280
One option is bad,
while the other is not good for you.

540
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,140
You’re overthinking,

541
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,220
and that stops you from expressing
what you really want to.

542
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,160
What should I do?

543
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,060
I think that

544
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,680
when you want to say something,

545
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,280
you should just say it.

546
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,160
If you decide not to

547
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,400
or say what you don’t want to,

548
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,780
That will only make others mistake you.
Am I right?

549
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,180
Yes.

550
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,020
However,

551
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,980
if what you’re going to say

552
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,520
might hurt someone’s feelings,

553
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,480
be careful with your intention

554
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,440
whether you’re trying to hurt them

555
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,140
or you’re giving them what’s best.

556
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,880
And when you do say it,

557
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,160
try to make it sound nice.

558
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,760
Don’t be as blunt as you always are.

559
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,480
Understood?

560
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,960
Thank you, Mom.

561
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,880
I think Dad’s been waiting long enough.

562
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,020
- Please go.
- Ah.

563
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,580
It seems like this project will be
very difficult for you.

564
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,220
I wish you the best.

565
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,140
Come get this.

566
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,240
- Thank you.
- I’m leaving now.

567
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,940
I hope you feel better.

568
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,660
- Big Sister!
- What?

569
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,980
Come in.
The door’s not locked.

570
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,800
What is it?

571
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,160
Someone’s waiting to see you.

572
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,280
Who is it?

573
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,920
I’m not seeing anyone;
I’m taking a bath.

574
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,000
Okay.

575
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,880
I’ll tell Aoey.

576
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,160
You were so good!

577
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,220
You kicked, punched,
and threw them!

578
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,440
Aoey! Do you have lice?

579
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,420
What? No.

580
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,480
Ah!
Lice!

581
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,220
Why did you push her like that?

582
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,900
You’re terrible.

583
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,260
So what? See.

584
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,040
That wasn’t harsh enough, too!

585
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,560
Because of Aoey,
I had to cut my beautiful hair!

586
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,720
Gen, I’m sorry.

587
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,360
I didn’t mean to.

588
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,280
- I am your friend.
- You’re not!

589
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,860
I don’t count you as a friend.

590
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,520
Get out of my face.

591
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,960
I don’t want to see you again.

592
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,800
Don’t ever get close to me!
