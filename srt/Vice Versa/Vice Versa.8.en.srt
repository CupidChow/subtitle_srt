00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:01,500
Should we go celebrate?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,740
Go out of town.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,790
I like it so much when you sing.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,020
Can you sing for me again?

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,760
Our company will not do the Romantic Not Comedy project anymore.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,800
Are you really leaving me?

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,080
Why are you doing this?

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,100
Because it's the only thing I get to do with you.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,900
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:30,160
Bro, why does Dad want me to present it alone?

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,260
Do you know?

12
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,270
He was probably confused.

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,600
The other day, you said you'd quit doing it.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,400
The next day, you want another chance.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,928
If you were someone else, you wouldn't get a second chance.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,687
Tess, be a fighter.

17
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:59,550
Though the board is a little intimidating, you must prove to them you can do it.

18
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,250
Got it?

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,270
I will go check upstairs and see if they are ready.

20
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,370
Be right back.

21
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,796
- Hey!
- Shit!

22
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,404
What the hell, Tun?

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,992
You looked really stressed, so I just relieved that for you.

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,148
Why do you still look so stressed out?

25
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:47,740
Come on. It's just a presentation. Why are you so worried?

26
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,340
Concentrate.

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,340
Why are you here anyway?

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,360
I came to help with the presentation.

29
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,280
I will not let you fight alone.

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,752
I'm going to this war with you.

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,520
War, my ass.

32
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,730
My dad is in there, too.

33
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,676
He's not your dad. He's Tess's dad.

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,036
You're so into being Tess these days, Talay.

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:30,788
If Tess were in this situation, he wouldn't be so worried.

36
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,000
That's why I'm here to assist.

37
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:49,660
Remember.

38
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,600
Where there's you, there's me.

39
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,410
Damn!

40
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,380
I'm so envious of you.

41
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,468
You always have me by your side.

42
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,700
How can you be so damn lucky?

43
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,720
I think it's good.

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,100
After reading the Treatment, I think it's even better than the last one.

45
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,020
It's true that it's good.

46
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,460
But it's not better than the other movies we're making this year.

47
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,276
Besides, this year's movie quota has been met.

48
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,420
May I please ask you to leave us alone

49
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,260
as I have a personal matter to discuss with Thattawa?

50
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,520
Let him stay, Dad.

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,488
I'll fill him in later anyway.

52
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,110
You insist on making this movie this year, don't you?

53
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,270
Yes, I do.

54
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,820
We've already come this far.

55
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,136
As the CEO, I can't just fund the company's money for you.

56
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:26,360
But as a dad who wants to see his son achieve his dream,

57
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,150
I will be funding this project for you.

58
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,560
- But Dad...
- Thank you, sir.

59
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,900
But if that's your offer,

60
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,036
we don't think we can accept your money.

61
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:40,536
Thank you.

65
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,580
Should we just spend our own money?

66
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,280
That's easy to say.

67
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
One movie requires a fortune.

68
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,104
Make it in the budget we have.

69
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:15,448
I will ask my family for money.

70
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:17,980
They plan to spend this amount on their shop renovation.

71
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,890
But I will take it for our movie first.

72
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,820
If you're doing that, then I'll sell one or two of my family's boats.

73
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,610
Then I will sell the old cars left unused at my house.

Tess, what about you?

Me?

76
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,040
I will edit the movie colors for free.

77
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,828
Just what we need, a colorist.

78
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:05,150
Tess, will you get to be a colorist if this movie doesn't happen?

79
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,920
We're nearly selling our houses here.

- Right.
- All right.

81
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,985
I'll sell all the designer clothes at home then.

I'm sure our movie is going to be a hit.

And don't worry. They are all authentic.

I think it pronounces "Tun".

Okay. Don't forget to message me after this.

Don't you know the prices you called were too freaking cheap?

125
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,860
Those designer clothes are above 10K baht.

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,710
How would I know that? I don't use branded stuff.

Besides, I wanted them to get sold out quickly.

That's why I set the prices so cheap.

Why did you have to rush it so much?

So your dad isn't funding it anymore?

The company isn't making it.

149
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,680
So he offered his personal fund.

150
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,120
But the team thinks we're using too much of my father's connections.

00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,440
So I'm trying to find another way.

I do it because I believe in you, Tess.

161

After reading the synopsis, I think this movie can be big.

162
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:35,610
Besides, it's not for free.

163
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,820
It's an investment.

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:54,036
Around 15 million, including the PR budget.

167
00:11:57,397 --> 00:12:01,483
Let me call my partner.

168
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,730
What's up, my dear partner?

169
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,700
Hey, our friend is in need here.

170
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,360
He needs 15 million to make his movie.

171
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,870
If we both help him, we will need 7.5 million each.

172
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,980
Is that okay?

173
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,880
That offer is accepted.

174
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,650
On one condition though.

175
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,890
I want a lead role.

176
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,208
Me too. I've wanted to be a movie star.

177
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,064
Come here, you two.

178
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,070
Thank you.

179
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,170
Seriously?

180
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,520
We don't even have a director yet. Why are we doing the casting now?

181
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,664
Tess said we should proceed with whatever we can first.

182
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,237
So this is the casting studio?

183
00:13:01,237 --> 00:13:03,280
Are we in the wrong place?

184
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,750
Looks too run-down to be a studio.

185
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,996
Hey, watch your words. It's my friend's house.

186
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,760
Excuse me. What are these fancy suits for?

187
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,000
It's a casting place, not a red carpet event.

188
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,036
More like a doormat than a carpet.

189
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,630
Who are you guys?

190
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,180
You don't have to know.

191
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,870
I don't think we need to collab with you foul-mouthed people.

192
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,770
Right.

193
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:39,636
Hi, Tess.

194
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,110
We're at Tun's house.

195
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,410
We are facing two men barking at us over here.

196
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:49,868
Ah... Screenwriters?

197
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,180
Okay. See you.

198
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,480
Don't tell me you guys are Fuse and Kita, the investors.

199
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,310
Hell, yeah.

200
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,904
And we're about to be the lead actors in the movie.

201
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,530
I knew it.

202
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,408
You dressed up really nicely.

203
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:11,360
And you're so radiant.

204
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,268
So handsome.

205
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,208
Is this a suit from Spain?

206
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,720
So hot.

207
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,560
Get the door.

208
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,730
We have a bunch of luxurious drinks inside.

209
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,332
They are for you, sir.

210
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,910
All right, Bro.

211
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,640
Holy shit!

212
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,730
Chang will be working on a series project until next year.

213
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,700
We have no directors.

214
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,760
Have you tried indie movie directors?

215
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,600
My brother sent me a contact of this guy named Mek.

216
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,290
He just graduated from abroad.

217
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,416
But he cuts off my call every single time.

218
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,400
Should I direct it and get it over with?

219
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,056
Directing and acting are two different things.

220
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,040
I've worked with many directors. I know how.

221
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,260
Here. I'll show you my directing skills.

222
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,656
Let's suppose this is a scene where you're thinking of someone you like.

223
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,400
Close your eyes.

224
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,860
Come on. Do it.

225
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,480
Sit up straight.

226
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,600
Take a deep breath.

227
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,880
Breathe in.

228
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,780
Breathe out.

229
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,510
You're thinking about his face.

230
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:52,656
Thinking about the first time you guys met in a bar after he traveled between universes here.

231
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,060
You and he hit it off.

232
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,260
Wait a minute. I don't think this is right.

233
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,860
Don't interrupt me.

234
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,221
Close your eyes. I'm the director here.

235
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,508
You went on an adventure with him.

236
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,964
You made a movie with him.

237
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,672
Though your team broke up, the members missed each other so much.

238
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,308
They finally regrouped.

239
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,588
When you saw his face, you smiled.

240
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:03,076
Just like that.

241
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,480
But this is like admitting that you like me? Right?

242
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,090
You were doing as I briefed.

243
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,430
You're wrong.

244
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,750
I was just thinking about someone else.

245
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,248
Really?

246
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:19,420
Who? A guy named Tun?

247
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,420
No.

248
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,520
Hey, buddy. Don't sleep.

249
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,832
Get up. I've got good news.

250
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:31,800
- Come on.
- What is it?

251
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,710
The guy named Mek, my friend knows him.

252
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,840
I told my friend to contact him on Headbook.

253
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,471
He said he's interested in directing our movie.

254
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:43,000
He asked us to meet tomorrow.

255
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,280
Are you happy? Happy, huh?

256
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,680
Wait!

257
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,270
But he always cuts off my calls.

258
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,690
I don't know.

259
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,830
Tomorrow, you and Tun go meet him.

260
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,248
Because Aou and I need to edit the script a little more.

261
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,990
Time to sleep now.

262
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,832
How comfy!

263
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,047
- I'll go talk to him tomorrow.
- Great.

264
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,336
You sure you can handle this?

265
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:14,200
You're a dog lover, not a cat lover.

266
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,999
I'm trying to get into the character. I now love every type of animal.

267
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,091
Right, kitten?

268
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:21,010
Meow.

269
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,408
Come on, give me a hug.

270
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,560
- You, ungrateful cat!
- Hold that, my friend.

271
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,680
You just said you're in a nice and gentle vet character.

272
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,680
I can't be nice now. It just bit me.

273
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,430
What should I do if I want to change his character?

274
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,390
Ask the one who wrote this vet character.

275
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,090
Who?

276
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,100
You're the one who created the Dr. Wayu character?

277
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,600
Yes. Why?

278
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,690
Can you change his character from a kind and warm vet

279
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,320
to a hot and rich vet?

280
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,190
Of course.

281
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,800
Of course not.

282
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,810
There's much more detail to the character.

283
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,240
You can't change it as you please.

284
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,284
Can't we just have an agreement here?

285
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,450
I'm hiring you to fix it.

286
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,120
This is all the cash I have.

287
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,040
The rest I can transfer to you.

288
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,220
I want four more.

289
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,775
- Four thousand?
- Four million.

290
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,336
If you don't have that, go talk to Tess.

291
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,780
Bye.

292
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,488
Damn you! Four million to edit the script?

293
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,324
Eat something sweet to boost your energy, producer.

294
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,764
What are you looking at?

295
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,208
It's vanilla today.

296
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,280
The scent just kicks in.

297
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,765
I'm going to kick you for real.

298
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,750
Calm down.

299
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,120
You smell nice. Just like this cake.

300
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,207
How did you know that?

301
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,570
So? Do we smell just alike?

302
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,596
Talay, what are you playing?

303
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,320
Now you smell even more like it.

304
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,090
I can't tell the difference between you and the cake now.

305
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,420
Damn it, Tun. I'm all messy.

306
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,420
Well, look at me.

307
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,350
Okay. I got it.

308
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,481
Let go of me. I'll wipe it for you.

309
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,160
Holy shit, Tun! What are you doing?

310
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,510
You're wiping is too slow.

311
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,860
I did it once and it's all gone.

312
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,620
I mean why did you eat it?

313
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,870
If we're at home,

314
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,370
I'd eat it right from your face.

315
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,360
Wipe it yourself.

316
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,410
I'll wash it off in the bathroom.

317
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,110
I'll be quick.

318
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,456
Don't miss me.

319
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:47,020
Excuse me. Are you from the Romantic Not Comedy screenwriting team?

320
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,520
I am.

321
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,540
Mhok.

322
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,420
Mhok, my ass. I'm Mek.

323
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,320
You dared come and meet me, Tess?

324
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,250
Do you have a problem?

325
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,370
Hold on.

326
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,540
Do we know each other?

327
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,640
Hey, you met the director?

328
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,440
Hello.

329
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,840
Hold on, Tun.

330
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,100
Are you also on the screenwriting team with him?

331
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,050
What the hell are you two playing?

332
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,410
Wait a minute. Do you know Tun?

333
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,710
Oh, cut that.

334
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,800
Are you pretending to have amnesia or something?

335
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,800
We were all in the same class in high school.

336
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Tun, can't you remember?

337
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,296
We promised each other we wouldn't make a movie for him.

338
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:46,996
Hold on.

339
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,484
What did I ever do to you?

340
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:58,776
Of course, an asshole like you wouldn't remember the shit you've done.

341
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,390
You too.

342
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:05,200
I'm so disappointed that you're working with him.

343
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,560
- This shitty...
- Relax, man.

344
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,604
Let's have a private conversation, Mek.

345
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,664
Follow me then.

346
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,510
Tun, did you forget what Tess did to us?

347
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,350
Sit down.

348
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,403
He ditched his role in our short film.

349
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,590
We worked so hard to make this film for the contest.

350
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,780
But he was with a girl and didn't show up on the filming day.

351
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,313
We almost missed the deadline. Don't you remember?

352
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,012
I do. But he must have had his reason.

353
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:57,152
Are you...

354
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,461
fooling him?

355
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:05,710
Don't play dumb.

356
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:10,620
You're tricking him into making this movie and ruining the movie as revenge.

357
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,920
You're making him pay for what he did to us. Right?

358
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,190
Yeah. That's right.

359
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:25,120
So that's why the screenplay of this movie is so crappy.

360
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,820
What's crappy?

361
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,540
Yeah. It was intentional.

362
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,510
Good.

363
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:41,440
I'll agree to be the director then.

364
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,276
Let's make it a big failure, my dear friend.

365
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,140
Come on.

366
00:25:52,737 --> 00:25:55,451
Your plan is freaking evil.

367
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:07,540
- Hey. Mek wants to...
- Wait.

368
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,760
Let me talk first.

369
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,980
Mek looks like someone I liked in high school named Mhok.

370
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,470
Well. You said you've never been in a relationship.

371
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,405
It was only a secret crush. It wasn't even a relationship.

372
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,560
Yeah?

373
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,536
Did you guys hold hands?

374
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,780
Almost, when we were working together for sports day.

375
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,720
What about a kiss on the cheek?

376
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,904
How could I go and do it?

377
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,852
Then go do it.

378
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:49,892
Because I'm the only one who has the right to do this.

379
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,640
Tun, what are you doing?

380
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,840
Come on.

381
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,973
Let me recharge my energy because we're going to need a lot.

382
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,636
You know, Mek agreed to direct the movie because he wants to ruin it.

383
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,110
Wait.

384
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,050
Why didn't you stop him?

385
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:23,400
How could I? I had to go with the flow.

386
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,544
I will try to change his mind later.

387
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,280
Don't risk it. It's not worth it.

388
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,204
Just change the director.

389
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,750
We can try him first.

390
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,400
He's got skills and graduated from abroad.

391
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,850
He won't really fail it, will he?

392
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,710
Or he will be discrediting himself. Right?

393
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,391
And if he will? What are we going to do?

394
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,040
We don't have much of a choice now.

395
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,212
Let's try to trust him.

396
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,890
Come on. Let's go. Don't think too much.

397
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,081
I'm giving you three days to edit it.

398
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:10,081
Hurry.

399
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,560
As per your feedback, it isn't easy to edit.

400
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,470
- Three days aren't enough.
- So?

401
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,708
The rest of the crew needs your screenplay to work on.

402
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,588
Do you have a problem?

403
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,240
No.

404
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,372
I will talk to the screenwriters.

405
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,168
Good.

406
00:28:37,168 --> 00:28:39,690
Oh! One more thing.

407
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,010
I want to recruit my friend as the cameraman for this movie.

408
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:50,083
You can contact him on his Headbook.

409
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,240
Alessandro?

410
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,271
Doesn't sound like a Thai name.

411
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:04,010
Of course not.

412
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,520
He's Spanish. We met in school in the States.

413
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,340
He's highly skilled.

414
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,244
He's always been my cameraman.

415
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,440
Are you trying to bug me?

416
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,508
Do you think he'll fly here to be our cameraman?

417
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:27,116
Isn't that your duty as a producer?

418
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,240
What if I don't do it?

419
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,376
It's all good.

420
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:41,436
I just... won't direct it.

421
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,320
When will this Alessandro guy reply to my message?

422
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,200
Is this a fake Headbook account?

423
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,444
My friend!

424
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,990
I need help.

425
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,050
Did someone break your heart?

426
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,790
Can we talk about that later? I'm busy with the cameraman.

427
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,751
No, not that. It's about the movie.

428
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,451
Listen to me.

429
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,880
Shoot then.

430
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,650
I went to a workshop for Dr. Wayu's role.

431
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,310
But our characters don't click.

432
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,880
So I asked your friend Aou to help edit the character,

433
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,530
but he refused to do it.

434
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:43,370
So I'm thinking of hiring someone else to fix the character.

435
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,470
You can't do that.

436
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:51,056
Don't you know fixing one character affects the whole movie?

437
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:53,760
In order to get Dr. Wayu's character,

438
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,720
Aou needed to do a lot of research on veterinarians.

439
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,692
What? He could have just searched on the internet.

440
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:03,440
Of course, he couldn't.

441
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,240
Look.

442
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,020
[Dr. Wayu, the nice and gentle vet.]

443
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,360
He might be a supporting character, but his character is important.

444
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,710
That's why he had to study a lot.

445
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,200
He spent a lot of time at animal clinics

446
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,444
in order to design Dr. Wayu's character.

447
00:31:30,444 --> 00:31:34,264
It isn't something you can just edit as you like.

448
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,680
[Dr. Wayu, the nice and gentle vet.]

449
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,160
Here.

450
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:54,864
I told you if you want me to edit the character, give me four million.

451
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:59,280
It isn't for the editing. It's your wage to help me do some research.

452
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,380
Can you take me to the clinics you went to?

453
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,296
I want to study Dr. Wayu's character more.

454
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,280
That amount can't make up for my valuable time.

455
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,560
What an ass! I'll just go by myself then.

456
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,876
I'll take you.

457
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:21,664
It will surely be fun.

458
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,140
This draft is a lot better.

459
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,886
Your team is pretty good. They are fast and smart.

460
00:32:39,886 --> 00:32:44,048
Of course. They are giving all they have.

461
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:47,680
They don't want to hear more comments from an asshole like you.

462
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,951
What about the cameraman? Have you reached out to him yet?

463
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:54,050
I booked his schedule.

464
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,460
He's okay to fly here to work.

465
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,820
He even offered a discounted wage.

466
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,770
How did you get to him?

467
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,272
I'm his friend, but he takes a month to reply to my message.

468
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,860
Then we only have the casting left to do tomorrow.

469
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,580
But you don't have to come.

470
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,770
I've got something else for you to do.

471
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,670
What could that be?

472
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,850
You must cast these two cats.

473
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,360
See which one of them fits to be the female lead's pet.

474
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,840
I'll be in charge of human casting.

475
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,381
Hold on. This isn't my duty.

476
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,612
What criteria should I use to see which one fits the role?

477
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,824
Let's see if you're a nice girl.

478
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:58,490
I've seen dogs ignoring people.

479
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,620
But now cats are ignoring you.

480
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,010
You find that funny?

481
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,320
Mek just wants to pick a fight with me.

482
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,430
He assigned me to cast these two cats.

483
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,760
He's evil.

484
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,320
Easy there.

485
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,070
To play with cats, you must get familiar with them first.

486
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,670
Here.

487
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,908
How do you know so much?

488
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,250
Are you a cat lover?

489
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,980
See? She's come round now.

490
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,908
How did you do that?

491
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,808
Do you want to play with Talay?

492
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,568
He's mean to you, isn't he?

493
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:41,580
I'll hit him for you.

494
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,200
What? Why are you hitting me?

495
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,400
Oops.

496
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,977
I ordered a cake. It's probably here.

497
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,882
- Here's your order.
- All right. one second.

498
00:35:02,882 --> 00:35:03,880
Okay.

499
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,692
May I take a picture as delivery proof?

500
00:35:05,692 --> 00:35:07,490
Of course.

501
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,140
Let me take off my helmet.

502
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,064
Can you please hold this for me?

503
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,820
Thank you.

504
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,288
Hey!

505
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,380
- What?
- Guys!

506
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,670
Guys! Come see his face.

507
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,720
You're definitely Tay Tawan.

508
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,040
Tun! Talay! Look.

509
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,563
Who does he resemble?

510
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,850
That's Tay.

511
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,080
Who's Tay Tawan? I'm Tong Tawhan.

512
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,730
Are you okay?

513
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,412
Tong, you're good-looking. Want to be an actor?

514
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,640
I do, but I prefer being a food deliveryman.

515
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,621
Come on. Maybe because you haven't tried anything else.

516
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,884
Here, march with this.

517
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,630
How?

518
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,510
Twirl it, like a drum major.

519
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,110
Like this?

520
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,360
Right.

521
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,810
Can you do it on your back?

522
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,670
Spin. Turn around.

523
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,950
Turn.

524
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,400
You're so cool.

525
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,990
Now throw it.

526
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,710
Yes!

527
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,560
Was that right?

528
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,013
Guys, how about we write the male lead character as a drum major

529
00:36:31,013 --> 00:36:33,400
and let him sing and dance, too?

530
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,830
I think that's great.

531
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,270
You know?

532
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,816
In another universe, you can be an actor.

533
00:36:38,816 --> 00:36:41,450
With this face, you're a protagonist.

534
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,183
- You're exaggerating.
- I'm not.

535
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:45,071
- Come here.
- I can't do it.

536
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:47,800
- Come on, Tong.
- I need to deliver food.

537
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,610
Trust me.

538
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,817
- I'm on duty here.
- Come with me for just a second.

539
00:36:52,817 --> 00:36:55,232
This is surely a face of a male lead.

540
00:36:55,232 --> 00:36:58,670
You're just my type.

541
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,836
I know someone I can introduce you to.

542
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,220
From what I see, I prefer the second cat.

543
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,680
But the second cat is wicked.

544
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,830
Pick the first one. Should be easier to film.

545
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,764
You can tame it.

546
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,600
If not this cat, I won't be your director.

547
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,081
- Come on.
- Why?

548
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,600
Are you not happy?

549
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,680
Fine. I'll find a way.

550
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,750
Come on, Mek.

551
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,730
Stop giving Tess a hard time.

552
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,572
You can see he's changed.

553
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:05,160
He's hard-working now, isn't he?

554
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,760
You're right.

555
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,490
Him being like this...

556
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,400
reminds me of old feelings.

557
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,940
You mean the hatred?

558
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,511
Affection.

559
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:24,730
What? Affection?

560
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,632
Sorry, I didn't tell you.

561
00:38:27,632 --> 00:38:30,730
I secretly liked him in high school.

562
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:35,220
It's the reason I picked him as our male lead in the short film.

563
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,900
But after he did that shit to us,

564
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,540
I began to hate him.

565
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,388
And now he's being nice and cute,

566
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:49,770
I think... I'm falling back to liking him again.

567
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,720
What?

568
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,424
He said he liked me before?

569
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,476
I meant Tess.

570
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,870
Hell, yeah.

571
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:18,040
I think he'll be hitting on you so hard from now on.

572
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,546
Judging from his eyes, he's for real this time.

573
00:39:21,546 --> 00:39:26,176
Probably not. It might be his plan to mess with me.

574
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,640
- Maybe...
- Maybe...

575
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,400
Why are you copying me?

576
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,550
You're the one copying me.

577
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,904
You're even wearing the same outfit as me.

578
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,870
I didn't copy you.

579
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:57,530
If you didn't intend to wear the same clothes as me, that means...

580
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,360
we read each other's minds, Talay.

581
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,000
I read no one's mind.

582
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,999
My mood today is just cloudy grey.

583
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:07,720
That's why I picked this color.

584
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,587
Wow!

585
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:13,999
Even the mood name includes the name of your dear friend, Mek (Cloud).

586
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:21,068
And this, we think alike again.

587
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,989
Of course, I'm drinking what you drink.

588
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,160
You're the one who introduced it to me.

589
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,156
It's sugar-free. For this one, I'm following you.

590
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,730
Tun, what are you doing?

591
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,680
Tun?

592
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,830
I'm just checking if Tess's six-pack are still there.

593
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,070
They are still there. Don't touch them.

594
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,970
I don't believe you.

595
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,076
Tun!

596
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,400
We're doing the same thing again.

597
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,596
Right.

598
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,410
- I hope you can mirror me all day long.
- I hope you can mirror me all day long.

599
00:42:28,943 --> 00:42:32,980
You're cheating. You said you'd mirror me.

600
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,756
I'm tired.

601
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,050
You're playing like a kid.

602
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,088
And you were playing along.

603
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,930
Damn!

604
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,880
The sky is getting greyer here.

605
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,080
Mek is calling.

606
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,880
He's finding a way to pick on me again. You'll see.

607
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,040
What's up?

608
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,360
Hello, Tess.

609
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,330
Tomorrow, I'm checking the filming location at a gallery.

610
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,710
Come with me.

611
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:15,150
Okay. Fine.

612
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:18,560
I'm bringing Tun, too.

613
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,540
Don't. Just you and me.

614
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,790
See you tomorrow afternoon.

615
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,648
I have to go. Bye.

616
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,540
See?

617
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,710
He's definitely asking you on a date.

618
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,690
I don't think so. We're just checking the location.

619
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,877
You're over-thinking it.

620
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,800
[Greyllery]

621
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,281
Sorry.

622
00:43:57,281 --> 00:43:59,890
Took you long enough.

623
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,920
Let's check inside and find some nice spots to film.

624
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,900
Did you bring your camera?

625
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,030
Holy crap!

626
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,390
I forgot.

627
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,780
I'll just use my phone camera.

628
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,700
I knew you'd forget.

629
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,200
Smile.

630
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:25,841
Why did you take my picture?

631
00:44:25,841 --> 00:44:28,400
Take pictures of the location.

632
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,992
Well, someone is blushing.

633
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,271
Two tickets, please.

634
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,428
Three, actually.

635
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:56,790
♫ I always have you by my side. No matter where I look, I see your face ♫

636
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,280
Why are you here?

637
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,768
It'd be so lonely just the two of you.

638
00:45:06,768 --> 00:45:08,830
I came to help.

639
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:15,120
♫ Looking at you and him, even though I know,
I'm still not going anywhere ♫

640
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,720
Thank you.

641
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,680
Wait. That one is pretty.

642
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,180
Hey, Guys.

643
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:40,090
There. It looks good.

644
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:43,440
It should be nice for the scene where the two main characters walk hand in hand.

645
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,480
You think?

646
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,828
But I think it's too plain.

647
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,220
Hey. It's better here, Tess.

648
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,920
You go up there.

649
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,260
- Me?
- Yes.

650
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,760
Go.

651
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,824
Right here?

652
00:46:09,824 --> 00:46:11,824
A little left.

653
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,870
Pretty.

654
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,560
Tun, take it.

655
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,640
Take the place up there. Right? Okay.

656
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,200
Where are you going?

657
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,870
I mean take the pictures. I'll be up there for the blocking.

658
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,570
Hurry up.

659
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,220
Why are you looking confused?

660
00:46:38,288 --> 00:46:39,988
This angle.

661
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,450
So in this scene,

662
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:52,680
the male and female leads look at each other.

663
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,860
The guy slowly takes her hand...

664
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:07,750
and says "Though I used to hate you,

665
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,508
I'm now madly in love with you."

666
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,420
Cut!

667
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,550
It's just a test shot. You don't have to go full-on.

668
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,310
Let's check out some other places.

669
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,210
I think it's great.

670
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,480
Pretty nice.

671
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,500
Damn! This is cool.

672
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,936
Scan this QR code and you get to listen to exhibition music.

673
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,452
Earphones.

674
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:04,230
Here.

675
00:48:40,624 --> 00:48:43,740
You guys go ahead.

676
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:52,450
♫ I don't understand our relationship ♫

677
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:57,770
♫ What position do I take? ♫

678
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:05,200
♫ In my heart, I'm always waiting, breathing for you ♫

679
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:12,270
♫ No matter what you think, I want you to know that I'm still here ♫

680
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:18,290
♫ But I just wanted to know, so I'm asking ♫

681
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,643
We apologize for the inconvenience.

682
00:49:21,643 --> 00:49:23,510
We are experiencing electrical failure issues.

683
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,260
Please give us a moment to resolve the issue.

684
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,160
It's me.

685
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,150
What's the matter?

686
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,248
You seem quiet today.

687
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,890
It's nothing.

688
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,000
Listening to sad songs, huh?

689
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,200
Are you filming a music video?

690
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,250
So what's wrong?

691
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,040
Answer me.

692
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,968
I'm trying to cheer you up here.

693
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,576
I don't like seeing you getting close to Mek.

694
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,692
It's just work, dude.

695
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,100
I'm scared.

696
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,224
I'm scared you'll like him.

697
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,930
Especially, because he looks like someone you liked before.

698
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:53,188
Tun, I have no feelings for Mek.

699
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,420
I know.

700
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,744
But if you get closer to him,

701
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,870
your heart might get shaken one day.

702
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:05,470
Hey.

703
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,844
I don't like people for their appearances.

704
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:25,840
I haven't even seen your real face,

705
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,412
yet I like you.

706
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,964
What did you just say?

707
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,524
I said I like you.

708
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:51,488
I like you even though I don't know what you look like.

709
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:56,708
I don't know who you are.

710
00:51:58,918 --> 00:52:01,024
But I like you.

711
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,572
I like you, too.

712
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,620
I like everything about you.

713
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,850
Happy birthday!

714
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,390
Make a wish, son.

715
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,840
What did you wish for?

716
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,310
For me to be in this universe as long as possible.

717
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:24,358
I'd like to know Tun's life in the other universe.

718
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:27,470
I can only give you a general idea.

719
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:28,720
Trust me.

720
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,281
Your life won't be the same.

721
00:53:30,281 --> 00:53:34,181
Once in your lifetime, you had me.

722
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:43,990
♫ Is it you? That will change this world ♫

723
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:49,070
♫ Is it you? The person I've been searching a long time for ♫

724
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,650
♫ Have I found, Have I found ♫

725
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:59,330
♫ Someone who will be ready to walk through this side by side with me from now on ♫

726
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:04,440
♫ Is it you? That won't let me be sad ♫

727
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:13,320
♫ After a night of nightmares, making every tomorrow look bright ♫

728
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,200
♫ Forever, please tell me to be confident ♫

729
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,120
♫ That you won't go and leave me ♫

730
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:31,180
