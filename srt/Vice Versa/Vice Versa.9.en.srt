Chang will be working on a series project until next year.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,418
Have you tried indie movie directors?

3
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:07,769
My brother sent me a contact of this guy named Mek.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,590
Stop giving Tess a hard time.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,940
I think I'm falling back to liking him again.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,660
I don't like to see you getting close to Mek.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,850
Especially, he looks like someone you liked before.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,630
I like you,

9
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,730
even though I don't know what you look like.

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,836
But I like you.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
Hey!

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,431
- Mek...
- Don't say a word.

13
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,372
I know that you have had a crush on Tess since high school.

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,760
I thought you had forgotten all about him.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,140
But from your actions today,

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,896
it is obvious how much you like him.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,790
- I'm sorry.
- You don't need to apologize to me.

18
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,080
I told Tess that I like him

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,760
because I just wanted to mess with your head.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,780
I... I know you have been liking him for a long time.

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,960
I wanted your wish to come true.

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,236
This surprising thing to me is that Tess also feels the same way.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,710
Wait. Are you saying that everything that you did,

24
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,808
including giving Tess a hard time, you did it because you wanted to mess up with my head?

25
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:35,792
No.

26
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,592
I gave him a hard time because I dislike him.

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,592
I didn't plan to ruin his film project.

28
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,420
From now on, please take good care of my friend.

29
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,416
Don't make him sad.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,460
Now, let's go back to work.

31
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,820
Bring my camera with you.

32
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:10,156
Don't forget to take care of me.

33
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,530
I know it.

37
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,630
Before the next filming, I have something I want to discuss with you.

38
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,760
This scene is the first morning after Pitch and Toey start seeing each other.

39
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,380
They sleep in the same bed the night before.

40
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,200
The script says that they wake up and look at each other while smiling.

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,170
I think something is missing here.

42
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,681
Who wrote the script for this scene?

43
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,281
I wrote it.

44
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:48,364
Can you show me how the scene should be displayed?

45
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:52,140
Why?

46
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,380
Just do it.

47
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,250
It would help me.

48
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,472
You too, Tess.

49
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,330
Me?

50
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,032
All right.

51
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,424
I'll play the role of Pitch.

52
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,481
The first thing that he does after waking up.

53
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:25,097
He looks at Toey's face.

54
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,084
He is happy that they are finally together.

55
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,790
He reaches his hand to touch Toey's face,

56
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,136
and asks himself if he is dreaming.

57
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,100
A moment later,

58
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,060
Toey reaches her hand to touch his face.

59
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,950
She wants to feel the warmth of the man that she loves.

60
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,868
I don't think that matches Pitch's character.

61
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,830
That's simply your personal fantasy.

62
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,130
You two are displaying too much romance here.

63
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:36,490
Wait.

64
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,070
Did Mek tell you to play the scene for him?

65
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,190
That's right.

66
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,350
He said he wanted to know how sweet the couple

67
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,030
would be on the first day of their dating life.

68
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:51,272
Then how was it? Was it super sweet?

69
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,240
It was lucky that Up and I weren't the ones who did it.

70
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,570
If we did it, Pitch and Toey wouldn't be as sweet as your depiction.

71
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,720
Who said so?

72
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,936
I think I can be sweet as well.

73
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,736
Add some sweetness to your life.

74
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:15,536
Thanks.

75
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,270
You should drink the whole bottle.

76
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,770
But it's late in the evening.

77
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,660
Is it a good idea to drink the whole bottle?

78
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,000
You can drink it. It contains no sugar.

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,610
Look at my six-pack abs.

80
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,660
- Really?
- Sure.

81
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,270
If you don't believe it, you can touch my abs.

82
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,900
Give it a try.

83
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,360
I don't feel a thing.

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,410
Immature.

85
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,810
Tess!

86
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,630
It's true. His abs are firm.

87
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,110
Why don't you try it again?

88
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,785
That's enough. Being hit a few times can hurt.

89
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,400
Aou, why are you starting to worry about your looks and health?

90
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,390
Are you having a spark with someone?

91
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,440
Spill it.

92
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,154
What spark? I'm just taking care of my health.

93
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:11,669
How is it?

94
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,548
Do you think you and I can be another sweet couple?

95
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,044
Of course.

96
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:36,199
Tun, that's my seat.

97
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,040
What? You can take my seat.

98
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,952
No. My seat is exactly in the middle of the roll.

99
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:41,230
This is my lucky seat.

100
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,736
No.

101
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:44,940
Go away.

102
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,984
This is my seat.

103
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,880
(Let go.)

104
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:52,632
Tess.

105
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,290
Talay.

106
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:10,651
(I can't sleep.)

107
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,192
(Me, too.)

108
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,452
(I want to hold you.)

109
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,856
(No.)

110
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,000
(Please let me hold you.)

111
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,760
(Hold the pillow in the meantime.)

112
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:11,792
(The pillow is you.)

113
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,110
(Tun!)

114
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,220
(Stop it.)

115
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,992
Stop it, Tun!

116
00:10:28,992 --> 00:10:31,364
No, dentist. No!

117
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,800
It's okay. I was sleep talking.

118
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,945
- I'm afraid of dentists.
- You can go back to sleep.

119
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,230
Hurry up.

120
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,970
Hi, Hoshi.

121
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,648
You're so sweet to come out to welcome us.

122
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,570
This is the pet clinic that I came to for my research on Dr. Wayu's role.

123
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,380
I told the vet that you would come here for a job observation.

124
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,940
Let's start with your first lesson.

125
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,070
Give me your hand.

126
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,820
Good boy.

127
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,590
Damn it. That's for dog training.

128
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,210
Where is the vet?

129
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,910
I'm here.

130
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,500
This is Dr. Mix.

131
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,100
He's the model for Dr. Wayu's role.

132
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,020
This is Fuse.

133
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,120
Yes.

134
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,280
If you didn't tell me you were a vet, I would have thought that you were a celebrity.

135
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,890
He should be an actor more than me.

136
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,980
Thank you.

137
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,360
But running the clinic keeps me busy enough.

138
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:09,360
Welcome both of you.

139
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,800
If there's anything you want to know, feel free to ask me.

140
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,416
Please make yourself comfortable.

141
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,700
You said we came here for a job observation.

142
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,320
Who said that?

143
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,630
You need to do everything as if you are staff here.

144
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,100
Why are you surprised?

145
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,930
Dr. Mix is doing almost everything in the clinic by himself.

146
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,120
You need to help him take care of small errands.

147
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,756
What are the small errands?

148
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,830
Damn it.

149
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,928
This is your small errands.

150
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,700
How will you get it off if you don't rub it hard enough?

151
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,690
You need to rub it harder like this.

152
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,832
Can you do it?

153
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,620
- I'll go get it myself.
- Fuse!

154
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,810
Show me how to do it properly. I don't know how.

155
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,620
Does a vet need to do this?

156
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,860
- Bathe a dog?
- That's right.

157
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,724
You have to do everything that the script says Dr. Wayu does.

158
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:09,360
If you scrub only that area, other areas won't be clean.

159
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,880
Scrub like this so the shampoo will reach it.

160
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,540
Why the hell are you looking at me like that?

161
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,208
No, it's dirty because of the cat's pee.

162
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,688
You can touch it.

Let me tell you, this wound is nothing.

168
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,420
My wound was much worse than this.

169
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,240
When will I get to have a dinner break?

170
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,128
What dinner break? You just had your meal not long ago.

171
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:04,732
Why is time passing so slowly?

172
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:08,088
I want to cry.

173
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:14,410
- If you want to change your mind, I can tell him for you.
- Tell the vet?

174
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,521
Tell Tess that you don't want to be a part of his film anymore.

175
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,760
Do you think you can threaten me with that?

176
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,350
It's not going to work.

177
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,780
- It's not going to work on you?
- I'm not going to stop working.

178
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,740
Doctor, I want to work.

179
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,544
Assign me any work.

180
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,152
Talay, I want to ask you to eat shabu shabu at my house.

181
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:45,979
My parents are not home today.

182
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:48,800
I also asked Up and Aou to come, but they said they were busy.

183
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,500
I'm busy, too.

184
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,820
What?

185
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,320
How can all of you be busy on the same day?

186
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,920
Is there something I don't know about?

187
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,240
You think too much.

188
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,281
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy happy birthday.

189
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:17,120
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy happy birthday.

190
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,700
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy happy birthday.

191
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,600
Wait. Today is my birthday?

192
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,700
Yes, it's your birthday.

193
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,350
We didn't come early because we were preparing this cotton candy for you.

194
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,890
People in this universe celebrate their birthdays with cotton candy instead of a cake.

195
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,780
Thank you, guys.

196
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,170
Thank you, Dad.

197
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,200
Thank you, Mom.

198
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,984
Make a wish, honey.

199
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,760
- I'm going to blow the candles now.
- Wait.

200
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,488
Who on earth blows the birthday candles?

201
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,140
What do they usually do?

202
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,230
You will stare at the candles until they are put out.

203
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,927
- Stare at them?
- Yes.

204
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:26,621
Why are you acting like you've never celebrated your birthday?

205
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:29,641
On my birthday, I was staring at them like this.

206
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,190
Stare at the candles and make your wish.

207
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,932
As you are staring at the candles, you are staring at your wish.

208
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,190
What kind of wish did you make?

209
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,890
I won't tell you.

210
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,140
I don't think it's that hard to guess.

211
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,160
You want to go back to your universe soon.

212
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,760
No.

213
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,708
My wish is to stay in this universe as long as possible.

214
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,370
Talay, what do you think

215
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,116
if we decide to stay in this universe?

216
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,620
Why?

217
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,610
Think about it.

218
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,500
Here, we have everything.

219
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,325
We have a family, friends, and new dreams to pursue.

220
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,150
Your life here is also good.

221
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,581
Your family supports everything that you do.

222
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,292
You want to be a colorist. You can do it.

223
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,328
But that's selfish.

224
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,456
How?

225
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,784
If we do that,

226
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,640
we are stealing the lives of Pakorn and Tess.

227
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,630
Why?

228
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,960
Pakorn also stole my life.

229
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:38,968
Have you ever asked him if he wanted to live your life?

230
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,340
This is his family and his home.

231
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,909
We have our families in the other universe.

232
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,160
We have mom, dad, and friends.

233
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,700
But I don't have any of that.

234
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,624
How could you?

235
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,325
- I...
- Is that why you want to steal his life?

236
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,300
Because you don't have parents?

237
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,520
Where is the person who promised to go back with me?

238
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,868
Are you changing your plan?

239
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,920
I shouldn't waste my time on you.

240
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,096
I hope you are happy living someone else's life.

241
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,200
I'm not going to do it.

242
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,890
I think it's a bit too forced.

243
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,543
Why does a romantic scene happen in a bar?

244
00:19:50,543 --> 00:19:52,030
Were you drunk when you wrote the scene?

245
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,800
Did you use your brain when writing it?

246
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,503
All you do is criticize others.

247
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:57,583
If you have a better idea, then say it.

248
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,887
- I don't have it yet.
- See? You don't have a better idea either.

249
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:01,640
Even if I don't have one, I can tell that your idea won't work.

250
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,351
So you think your idea will work? All you do is criticize other people.

251
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:05,710
Up!

252
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,890
Calm down.

253
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,160
How can I calm down?

254
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,600
Why does everything need to revolve around you?

255
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,206
Are you the center of the world?

256
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:15,269
If that's so, I will pay homage to you.

257
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,950
Aou.

258
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,950
Do you think I'm going to make up with you?

259
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,776
Up. Hey!

260
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:23,476
You guys!

261
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,880
What should we do?

262
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,488
They have been quiet for an hour.

263
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,556
- Aou!
- Up!

264
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:01,980
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,504
It's my fault that I didn't believe you.

266
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,510
Guys, how did you suddenly reconcile?

267
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,600
Suddenly? This is the longest time that I have stayed mad at him.

268
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,291
We usually make up within half an hour.

269
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:19,393
We were this upset because of you two.

270
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,920
How did we have anything to do with it?

271
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,780
Why not? You two kept making a stern face.

272
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,650
The atmosphere stressed us out.

273
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,200
That's right. What's the problem between you two?

274
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,072
We don't like the atmosphere. Right?

275
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,560
Nonsense. We don't have any problem.

276
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,460
Right, Tess?

277
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,905
Yes. We are so loving.

278
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,810
Look.

279
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,880
If I was mad at him, I wouldn't hold him like this.

280
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,380
Right.

281
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,790
Did we misunderstand you two?

282
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,690
Yes.

283
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,100
Now, you can relax.

284
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,460
Actually, he and I felt stressed from work.

285
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,170
It's nothing.

286
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,230
Really?

287
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,380
Yes.

288
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,520
Don't lie to me.

289
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,728
You guys.

290
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:46,867
Talay.

291
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,508
Talay, wake up. We've arrived.

292
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,620
Talay.

293
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,184
Thank you.

294
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,039
What are you doing?

295
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,960
I'm going to wipe the drool on your face.

296
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,576
You were drooling like a kid.

297
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,800
Then, I'm going in.

298
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,800
Wait.

299
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,910
- I...
- Tess.

300
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,470
It's good that you're here.

301
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,460
I had a fight with my father.

302
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,744
So I'm stopping by to watch a movie at your place.

303
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,610
- But I...
- You should go.

304
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,830
I'm leaving now.

305
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,744
Shit! This movie is so good.

306
00:24:35,744 --> 00:24:37,600
I really like it.

307
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,221
I like sci-fi movies about multiverses.

308
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:42,021
What about you?

309
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,583
Tess.

310
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,150
What?

311
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,640
What's wrong with you?

312
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,490
I saw you looking depressed for some time.

313
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,780
You can tell me about it.

314
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,340
Can I ask you something?

315
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,340
Yeah.

316
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,610
If one day you woke up

317
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,480
in someone else's body as we saw in the movie,

318
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,636
what would you do?

319
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:26,200
How is the life of that person?

320
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:31,900
It's great.

321
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,750
He has a warm family.

322
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,572
He has good friends.

323
00:25:37,572 --> 00:25:40,160
He has the financial support to pursue his dream.

324
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,060
If you were him, would you want to live his life?

325
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,820
If I think about it lightly, I would want to live that life.

326
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,730
Why?

327
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,930
It may be better than my life right now.

328
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,860
What if you had a chance to go back to your life,

329
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,790
would you do it?

330
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,940
No.

331
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,010
Why?

332
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,520
If I was him, I would go back.

333
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,740
I don't want other people to suffer from my hard life instead of me.

334
00:26:15,811 --> 00:26:20,811
Tess, you are not me.

335
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:25,542
We all have our own pain that we are enduring.

336
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:30,980
You can't compare your life to theirs and judge them on what they should do.

337
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,720
We all just follow our gut feelings at the time.

338
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,240
Talay, why are you here alone?

339
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,089
Pang, have you seen Tun?

340
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:04,610
I went to his house, but he wasn't there.

341
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,740
I thought he might be here.

342
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,430
I haven't seen him.

343
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,776
What's going on?

344
00:27:18,544 --> 00:27:21,740
We had an argument.

345
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,840
I hope you two can reconcile soon.

346
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:43,916
Pang, can I ask you something about Tun?

347
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,070
If you are going to ask me about his real name,

348
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,180
I can't tell you.

349
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,056
Not that.

350
00:27:52,900 --> 00:28:00,200
I want to ask you about Tun's life in the other universe.

351
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,180
Why do you want to know it?

352
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,932
I'm close with him.

353
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:13,448
But I feel like I barely know him.

354
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,108
I don't know what he has been through.

355
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:24,123
So there are many times that I don't understand what he's thinking.

356
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:35,024
But I can't tell you in detail.

357
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,940
He has been living a hard life since he was young.

358
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,300
How?

359
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:53,736
His parents died when he was young.

360
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,752
He doesn't have any relatives.

361
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,870
So he had to work since young to support himself.

362
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,336
He has been living on his own all his life.

363
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,640
I used to live that kind of life as well.

364
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,800
So I understand how he feels.

365
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,060
When I was in the other universe,

366
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,004
I had no one.

367
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,470
But when I live in this universe,

368
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,164
I have a family.

369
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,248
I have many people that love me.

370
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,190
There was a time when I felt...

371
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,960
that I didn't want to go back to that universe.

372
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,440
Because I knew even if I got back there,

373
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,840
there was no one waiting for me.

374
00:30:05,224 --> 00:30:08,640
I think Tun feels the same way as I did at the time.

375
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,420
I'd better get going.

376
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,990
I'm sorry.

377
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,440
He's very cute.

378
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,870
- Please come again.
- Sure. Thank you.

379
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,247
- Thank you.
- Bye.

380
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:58,580
Let's go back to work.

381
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,040
Wait, dude.

382
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,060
Let's call it a day.

383
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,460
Why?

384
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,940
I think I know enough about the veterinary job.

385
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,140
I don't need to do the research anymore.

386
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,279
I think you just don't want to do hard work anymore.

387
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,604
How hard do I have to work? I did a lot of work.

388
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,340
You call that a lot of work?

389
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,240
You only cleaned the floor and bathed a dog.

390
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,000
You don't even experience the pressure of treating sick animals.

391
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,940
Do you know how hard it is to fight to save a life?

392
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,037
No, I don't. If I did, I would be a vet.

393
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,690
If you want to leave, you can go alone.

394
00:32:05,052 --> 00:32:07,172
Why is it bleeding so much?

395
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,830
What happened to the dog?

396
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,360
I think it was hit by a car. Go get Dr. Mix.

397
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,977
- Okay.
- Open the door for me, too.

398
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:46,040
Do you think you look hot, sitting topless like this?

399
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,540
Here.

400
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,060
How are they doing in the surgery room?

401
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,970
I'm worried about the dog.

402
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,050
Just trust Dr. Mix.

403
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:02,385
He can run the clinic by himself because he's a great vet.

404
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,280
The dog is awake.

405
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,620
The surgery went well.

406
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,280
It still feels drowsy.

407
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,480
I need to do an x-ray of it. Okay?

408
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,591
Thank you.

409
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:23,291
Don't worry.

410
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,604
That's a relief.

411
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,064
It's a good start for you.

412
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:44,312
I think you are starting to understand more about this profession.

413
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,080
Hey!

414
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,796
Have you seen Tun?

415
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,840
I can't reach him.

416
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,752
Didn't he tell you? He went out of town.

417
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,070
He said he wanted to clear his mind.

418
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,472
So he went to a beach in Aou's hometown.

419
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,170
When we went there,we usually went to a secret island.

420
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,350
The scenery on the island was so beautiful.

421
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,070
After traveling by boat, we need to walk on a sandbar to go to the island.

422
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,548
But when the tide rises, you need to be careful.

423
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:55,112
Talay.

424
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,740
Are you going to cross to the island?

425
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:22,915
Yeah.

426
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,312
Up said you would be on the island.

427
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,210
He was right. I'm thinking of going to the island.

428
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,930
Do you want to come with me?

429
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,620
Yeah.

430
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,624
Are you afraid of water?

431
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,160
No, I'm not.

432
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,560
If you aren't afraid, then why are you shaking?

433
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,700
Hop on.

434
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,953
What are you doing?

435
00:36:06,953 --> 00:36:08,200
No.

436
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,690
Just hop on my back before the tide rises higher.

437
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,890
Come on.

438
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,890
I'm taking off.

439
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,156
Why did you come to see me here?

440
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,292
I saw your message.

441
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,820
I'm sorry that I was too harsh on you that day.

442
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,300
You didn't do anything wrong.

443
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,900
It was all my fault.

444
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,600
I'm sorry that I said harsh words to you that day.

445
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,921
No. I should be the one who apologizes to you.

446
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,430
It should be me.

447
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,896
Are you competing with me again?

448
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,540
I'll keep doing that until you feel better.

449
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,924
I'm fine now.

450
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,270
Talay,

451
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:58,880
do you know why I don't want to tell you my real name?

452
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,270
It's because you want to tease me.

453
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,540
That was the reason at first.

454
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,250
But after that, my feelings changed.

455
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,532
I don't want to go back to my old life.

456
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:22,948
When I saw Pakorn has a warm family and good friends,

457
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,340
it made me want to continue to live here.

458
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,514
I understand how you feel.

459
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,748
Even if I wake up one day and go back to my old life,

460
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,048
that's still my life, isn't it?

461
00:38:40,144 --> 00:38:41,644
Trust me.

462
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,180
When you go back to your universe,

463
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,476
your life won't be the same.

464
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,230
Why?

465
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:59,310
The first scenario is that Pakorn may ruin your life.

466
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,908
The second one is that he may make you famous.

467
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,720
Either way it turns out to be, it's not as important as this one.

468
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,430
That is...

469
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,160
At one time,

470
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:20,932
you had me in your life.

471
00:39:23,704 --> 00:39:27,490
♫ There's only you here, I'm not going anywhere ♫

472
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,000
♫ With you right here by my side ♫

473
00:39:31,016 --> 00:39:33,033
♫ Forever, not expecting anything more than this ♫

474
00:39:33,033 --> 00:39:36,360
♫ Just you right here is enough ♫

475
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:44,360
♫ There's only you here. Whatever happens, I won't be afraid ♫

476
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,460
It's not that "I had you". But it should be "I have you".

477
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,920
Talay,

478
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,720
it seemed like I was surrounded by many people.

479
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,060
But in fact, I had no one in my life.

480
00:40:13,816 --> 00:40:16,050
So I always thought,

481
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:22,280
I wanted to wake up and see that someone was waiting for me.

482
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,888
Can you be that person for me?

483
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,080
Sure.

484
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:41,920
♫ Just having you here by my side ♫

485
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,640
♫ There's only you here, I'm not going anywhere ♫

486
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,200
♫ With you right here by my side ♫

487
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,177
♫ Forever, not expecting anything more than this ♫

488
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:54,630
♫ Just you right here is enough ♫

489
00:40:54,630 --> 00:41:02,630
♫ There's only you here. Whatever happens, I won't be afraid ♫

490
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,884
♫ Just having you here by my side ♫

491
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,276
Here it is.

492
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:22,892
Today is the first anniversary of the official foundation of Friend Credits.

493
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,240
A new way to open the cap.

494
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,645
Let's eat. This one is for Aou.

495
00:41:32,645 --> 00:41:33,895
I know you like drumsticks.

496
00:41:33,895 --> 00:41:35,800
It's so pretty. You know my mind.

497
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,612
You also like drumsticks.

498
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,920
It's already been one year. Time has passed so fast.

499
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,530
We have been through many things together.

500
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,500
True. Our movie was a flop.

501
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,330
We went our separate ways. We got back together.

502
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:57,200
We went on a trip and wrote our wishes.

503
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,660
If we have to talk about our ups and downs, it will take more than ten days.

504
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,240
That's right.

505
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,250
I'm thinking about writing our last wish.

506
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,370
Wait a sec.

507
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,640
Stop.

508
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,644
Sit down.

509
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,120
We should celebrate first.

510
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,640
Eat up. That's all.

511
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,012
Chicken fight!

512
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,710
What did you write?

513
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,410
I won't tell you.

514
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,320
If you tell me, I'll give you my chicken.

515
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,332
I also have my share.

516
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,870
Crap!

517
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,280
Didn't you see that? Up already took your share.

518
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,330
- You can eat mine.
- What are you talking about?

519
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,080
I won't tell you no matter what.

520
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,056
But mine smells so good.

521
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,670
You ate it. So tell me what you wrote.

522
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,176
I won't tell.

523
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,092
Stop it, Up.

524
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,440
Who will be the first one to hand out the presents?

525
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,920
These are handmade notebooks.

526
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,090
I drew the picture on the cover, Friend Credits, myself.

527
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,180
You can use it when you have an idea for a film script.

528
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,830
Your present is a notebook.

529
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,560
My present is a pen.

530
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,320
Your names are engraved on them.

531
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,120
Tun, it's your turn.

532
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,620
My turn?

533
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,320
Here.

534
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,650
I drew the Friend Credits design on the t-shirts for the four of us to wear.

535
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,740
It looks great.

536
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,470
Your t-shirt looks so cool.

537
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,080
Look at the back.

538
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,340
It said "Friend Credits".

539
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:11,830
It's pretty.

540
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,600
For Tess, I have another present for you.

541
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,032
I get two presents?

542
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,872
Wow. It's so pretty.

543
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,384
Tun.

544
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,510
Why does he get two presents?

545
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,960
I also want an hourglass like that one.

546
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,036
That's right. This is discrimination.

547
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:52,992
Yes, it's discrimination.

548
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,270
I think I found something that has connected us together for a long time.

549
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,420
Just as Dol said,

550
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,220
If we are portkeys for each other,

551
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,060
there must be something that connects us together.

552
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,960
Really?

553
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,590
What is it?

554
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,410
I'm not going to tell you now. I'll tell you later.

555
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,820
What about you, Tess?

556
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,180
The present I've prepared?

557
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,870
Here.

558
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,120
This one is for you. Is that a dog?

559
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:40,320
Up.

560
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,452
It's a monkey.

561
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,180
Isn't that a dog?

562
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,237
I drew the designs myself.

563
00:45:50,237 --> 00:45:54,171
I drew the animals that I think of when I look at you.

564
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,790
Here.

565
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:15,328
Congratulations on your role in an international film.

566
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,650
What's wrong? You don't like it?

567
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,830
No.

568
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,010
I just wonder what animal it is.

569
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:45,650
Is it a llama?

570
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,990
It's an alpaca.

571
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:51,080
I don't know why.

572
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,400
But I think your personality is similar to alpacas.

573
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:04,240
Are you saying I look stupid?

574
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
That's right.

575
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:12,968
I mean you look shy and gentle.

576
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,170
Should I wear it like this?

577
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:32,920
That's right.

578
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,116
But the print is out of place.

579
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,450
Excuse me.

580
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:01,056
Do you want to know what my third wish is?

581
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,160
Of course.

582
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,336
I wrote...

583
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:17,868
No matter what will happen,

584
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,840
all I want is for us to reunite.

585
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,224
We will meet again.

586
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,224
I'll search for you.

587
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,600
Tun,

588
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:47,462
I used to worry a lot.

589
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:52,896
I was worried that if you went back,

590
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:56,400
I would be left alone here.

591
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,410
But after spending time with you,

592
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,908
getting to know you,

593
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:09,916
and understanding my own feelings,

594
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,292
I got the answer, now.

595
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,292
I think...

596
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,092
I am falling for you.

597
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,432
Can't you tell?

598
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,056
I'm falling for you, too.

599
00:49:47,056 --> 00:49:48,756
Puen.

600
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,510
I drew the print myself.

601
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,684
It's cute.

602
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,360
I don't know when we will be able to go back to our universe.

603
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,820
Then let's make memories together as much as we can when we are here.

604
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,440
Wow!

605
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:56,140
It has the same smell as the crab I ate in our universe.

606
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:06,820
Talay, what are you eating?

607
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,080
Why are your lips pouting?

608
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,180
That's right.

609
00:51:19,164 --> 00:51:20,990
Then you should eat a lot.

610
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,390
Because I want to see your pouting lips.

611
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:27,123
Then feed me the whole bag.

612
00:51:27,123 --> 00:51:29,437
I'm sick of your over-confidence.

613
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:42,044
It's empty.

614
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,280
What?

615
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,770
Your lips are really pouting.

616
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,537
Hello.

617
00:51:52,537 --> 00:51:56,057
Do you want to buy a lotus and take a polaroid photo with your boyfriend?

618
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,100
Take it.

619
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,681
- Here.
- Thank you.

620
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,080
Here.

621
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,070
This is a tip for saying that he is my boyfriend.

622
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,736
Thank you, cool customer.

623
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,727
Here is for my boyfriend.

624
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:31,332
When I go back, I will miss this universe.

625
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,736
You have another bag?

626
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,350
Why didn't you tell me?

627
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:42,236
Do you want to eat it?

628
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,630
What?

629
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:52,656
One peck for one piece.

630
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,474
No. Okay, okay.

631
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,670
I submitted our film to Kannes Film Festival.

632
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,480
10 out of 10.

633
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,233
You make me want to live for a long time to do what I love.

634
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:27,391
You make me realize what I love.

635
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:30,516
I don't know when we will get to go home.

636
00:53:30,516 --> 00:53:35,075
I want you to know my real name, so you can look for me.

637
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:51,950
♫ Just see your own worth ♫

638
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:55,610
♫ There's only you here, I'm not going anywhere ♫

639
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:59,150
♫ With you right here by my side ♫

640
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:04,830
♫ Forever, not expecting anything more than this ♫

641
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:13,970
♫ There's only you here. Whatever happens, I won't be afraid ♫

642
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:19,680
♫ Just having you here by my side ♫

643
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,800
♫ By my side ♫

644
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,440
♫ Just having you here by my side ♫
