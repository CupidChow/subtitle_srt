1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:08,000
Can you explain what a colorist is to you?

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,600
People may think a colorist designs the color scheme for a film.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,100
To me, it's the position that brings a film to life.

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,800
It emphasizes the moods of the scenes.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,360
Let's say in sad scenes, the sky doesn't have to be blue.

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,010
It can be moss green.

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,080
Or...

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,580
if this room is too gloomy,

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,210
I can use my magic to make it brighter.

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,110
It says here you analyze and categorize people into colors.

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,970
Try analyzing us.

12
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,343
Are you sure?

13
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:55,234
Give it a shot.

14
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:58,290
Tell us what you think.

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,980
All right.

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,720
The man on the far left seems lively,

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,170
yet he has something on his mind.

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,120
He reminds me of...

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,107
a rotten carrot orange.

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,700
As for you, you seem calm and passive.

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,100
You give me...

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,391
a pickled cucumber green.

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,420
As for you, you look serious.

24
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,020
You remind me of...

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,140
a horse manure brown.

26
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:41,430
Brown like...

27
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,240
Brown like a horse shit. You know?

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,760
"Brown like a horse shit"?

29
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:58,660
I am sorry. I talked too much.

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,240
Sorry.

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,760
Damn it!

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,386
I shouldn't have said that.

33
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:10,930
My emotion right now is low-spirited blue.

34
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,410
Here we go again. Emotions by colors.

35
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,060
Come on.

36
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,180
It all boils down to your skills anyway.

37
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,460
- You'll get it.
- True.

38
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,040
Besides, working is stressful.

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,340
Look at me. I'm an assistant director.

40
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,380
They work my ass off like a slave.

41
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,570
Shoot!

42
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,250
The series is on. Puen is in it.

43
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,680
Come on, Gyo.

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,380
You can watch the rerun.

45
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,470
I can't.

46
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,330
I must help retweet.

47
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,350
This episode must trend worldwide.

48
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,880
You're too much.

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,200
Lay, you won't forget the gift I asked you to make, will you?

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,820
Yeah. I will do it tonight.

51
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,240
Great. I need it tomorrow.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,680
Time to watch it now. Bye.

53
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,913
- What is it?
- Just hold it and follow me.

54
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,810
Well, come on!

55
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,510
Hold on.

56
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,910
Do we really have to do this?

57
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,130
We do.

58
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,920
If they know we're fans, we'll be asked to wait at the exit.

59
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,620
But I'm a VVVVIP fan.

60
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,800
Therefore, I have to welcome Puen on his first step at the airport.

61
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,540
Guys,

62
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,620
Puen is coming.

63
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,290
What? That's not Puen.

64
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,150
Guys, we're at the wrong gate.

65
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,190
Puen is at a different gate.

66
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:35,310
Run! Go!

67
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,260
Wait.

68
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,930
I need to pee. You go ahead.

69
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,140
Make it quick then.

70
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,700
The gift is with you. Catch up with me.

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,900
All right.

72
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,690
Are you Puen?

73
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,510
I am.

74
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,860
My friend is your fan.

75
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,450
She brought you a gift.

76
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,900
Here.

77
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,960
Congratulations on your international film.

78
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,420
Is it against the rules to give a gift to an artist directly?

79
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,503
No. Just wondering if you've washed your hands.

80
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,760
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,040
I'll do it now.

82
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,140
But I think...

83
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,337
it's too late.

84
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:55,107
I'll wash it for you and...

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
That's okay.

86
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,080
I should wear it like this. Right?

87
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,680
Almost right.

88
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,748
It should be in the center.

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,080
Excuse me.

90
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,190
You have a big head.

91
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,820
The alpaca is now in the center.

92
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,222
So it's supposed to be an alpaca?

93
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,310
Yes.

94
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,814
It doesn't look like one?

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,230
Looks more like a llama.

96
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,040
Did your friend draw it?

97
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,590
- Actually...
- It's cute.

98
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:16,247
I guess the one who drew it is very cute, too.

99
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,970
Tell your friend I said thanks.

100
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,630
Puen.

101
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,180
I drew that.

102
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,340
Cute.

103
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,330
Damn it! I forgot to wash my hands.

106
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,510
You were damn lucky to meet Puen up close.

107
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,490
Is he hot?

108
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,160
Yeah. He is.

109
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,010
But I'm not his fan like you are.

110
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,170
Right now, I'm just worried about the interview.

111
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,700
Wondering if I'll pass.

112
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,880
I dragged you to have fun, yet you still think about work.

113
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,530
You should do something else while waiting and put your mind at ease.

114
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,340
By the way, Joe is looking for a movie extra. I told him you were available.

115
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,930
What? Why didn't you ask me first?

116
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,680
What role?

117
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:28,680
The hero will walk in from here.

118
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,980
Just be a corpse and lie down.

119
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,750
Why do I have to be a corpse?

120
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,127
You can use anyone.

121
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:36,210
Stop complaining.

122
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,330

Right.

126
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,850
That's why she wanted you to join this set.

127
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,700
So you can take lots of his photos for her.

128

Are you happy you're dead?

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,450
Seriously?

176
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,880
Thank you.

177
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,700
Sure.

178
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,900
Yes!

179
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,520
Are you kidding me?

180
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,640
I know you're a workhorse.

181
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:08,060
But you can't bring your work here to celebrate your new job.

182
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,670
Come on.

183
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,600
Let's go out. Our friends are waiting.

184
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,810
Your feet haven't touched the sand yet.

185
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,070
Okay? Gyo has taken hundreds of photos while waiting for you.

186
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,880
Damn it.

187
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,830
I told you I start the job at BFB next week.

188
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,200
So I must finish my old tasks before that.

189
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,160
You're this drunk and you can still work?

190
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,080
Yeah, I can.

191
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,680
Dang!

192
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,030
Guys, you're still here?

193
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,930
Come on. The sun is gorgeous.

194
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,660
- I'm waiting for him.
- Look!

195
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,940
Damn! That's stunning.

196
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,750
Lay, let's go.

197
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,440
This is stunning?

198
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,120
The sky is too pinky.

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,230
Again? His attitude against pink.

200
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,580
Right.

201
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,820
The only pink he likes is bacon pink.

202
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,300
This is what you call beauty.

203
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,635
Look.

204
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:23,420
Any color of the sky is beautiful except black.

205
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,090
It's getting dark here.

206
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,210
Come on, Lay.

207
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,763
You guys go ahead. I'm working.

208
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,970
Let's go.

209
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,050
Hey, Joe!

210
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,093
I haven't finished! I'm not done!

211
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,700
Guys, let's take a photo.

212
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,730
Photo time.

213
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:59,070
1, 2, 3.

214
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,320
Yeah!

215
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,110
Lay, don't go too far. It's dangerous.

216
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,760
I know.

217
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,020
Let me appreciate these beautiful colors a little longer.

218
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,300
Lay, get back here.

219
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,720
You're drunk.

220
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,793
All right. I'm coming.

221
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,990
Shit!

222
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,790
Cramp.

223
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:35,490
Help!

224
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,740
Tess!

225
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,650
You're awake.

226
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:50,958
I was worried sick.

227
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,500
Your friends said you were in bad shape.

228
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,877
When are you going to quit causing trouble?

229
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:03,140
Last time, you hit someone with the car.

230
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,710
This time you got yourself into a bar fight.

231
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,440
- You're just..
- Wait.

232
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,490
Who are you?

233
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,320
I'm not your son.

234
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,740
You, bastard!

235
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,470
Now you're pretending to have amnesia?

236
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,100
Stop it. Don't hit him.

237
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,570
He's hurt enough.

238
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,120
Hold on a second.

239
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,400
I think there's a misunderstanding here.

240
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,510
I get it.

241
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,130
This plan doesn't work.

242
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,001
- I...
- Shh.

243
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,000
Just cry.

244
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,900
Look at you.

245
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,380
You must be in so much pain.

246
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,420
My son.

247
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,980
My poor son.

248
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,910
Don't cry, baby.

249
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,850
Don't cry.

250
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,840
Let's go.

251
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,280
Don't you run away.

252
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,600
What the hell is going on?

253
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,730
Shit!

254
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,730
Who's that?

255
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,010
Help!

256
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,630
A patient's running away!

257
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,430
Help!

258
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,663
Help! Anybody!

259
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,410
Let me go. I'm going to find my body.

260
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,010
Let go!

261
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,380
Hello, Tess.

262
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,920
What's up, my dear friend Tess?

263
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,650
Who are you guys?

264
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,670
Your daddy, maybe.

265
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,320
Don't bug him.

266
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,520
- Well, look at him.
- He's in pain.

267
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,250
So? Are you feeling better?

268
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,650
When you're fully recovered, we will deal with those scum who beat you.

269
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,160
Are we friends?

270
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,267
Amnesia, I see.

271
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:34,477
Your mom already told us you'd pull this shit.

272
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,840
Here. A special gift from me.

273
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,740
Have a sip when you're bored.

274
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,520
I hate to see you have alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

275
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,260
No. I don't want Dad to chew me out again.

276
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,653
Tess, when did you become afraid of your dad?

277
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,920
Just now.

278
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,300
Hey! Don't be afraid.

279
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,490
We were never golden sons anyway.

280
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,910
It's good that we won't finish university in four years.

281
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,260
Otherwise, we'd be taking on the family businesses by now.

282
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,520
Damn boring.

283
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,220
Guys.

284
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,900
I have a question.

285
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,640
What is Qooqle?

286
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,750
I can't find my name there.

287
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,000
And where is Google?

288
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,100
Google, my ass. Qooqle is the right one.

289
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,190
If you can't find it on Qooqle, then you can't anywhere else.

290
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,340
What about Behind the Film Bangkok Company?

291
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,040
Do they exist?

292
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:37,890
Is it a filmmaking company? I've never heard of it.

293
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,590
The number one filmmaking company in this country.

294
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,480
Never heard of it?

295
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,370
Tess, listen to me.

296
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:54,300
There's only one best filmmaking company here and that is 26 Pictures.

297
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,800
And?

298
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,600
And, my freaking ass!

299
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,805
It's your father's company. Are you okay, man?

300
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,060
Excuse me.

301
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,758
May I take the patient out for an x-ray?

302
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,221
I asked the radiologist about you.

303
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:16,740
He said you're speedily recovering.

304
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,620
Really?

305
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,100
I feel like I'm going crazy.

306
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,730
You seem to have fun with your friends.

307
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,683
I look like I'm having fun?

308
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,980
Wait.

309
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,035
May I ask you something?

310
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,640
Do you believe in reincarnation?

311
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,803
Absolutely. Why?

312
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:43,283
What about dying and switching bodies with other people?

313
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,890
I knew it. I was right.

314
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,220
You're laughing. You must be thinking I've lost it.

315
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,380
No. It's the opposite, actually.

316
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,168
It's just that my theory is right.

317
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:03,220
You're not Tess.

318
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,020
You're someone else.

319
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,640
You had an accident and woke up in a stranger's body

320
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,660
in a world that looks familiar but is not really home.

321
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,660
Am I right?

322
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,460
So you know?

323
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,900
It's not just you who has this fate.

324
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,840
Remember one thing.

325
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,440
This isn't only body switching.

326
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,950
But you traveled between universes to be in a new body.

327
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,680
Before we continue,

328
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,140
what's your name in the other universe?

329
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,820
It's Talay.

330
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,730
You don't have to speak with me so politely.

331
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,360
Okay, Talay.

332
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,230
My name is Phuwadol. I was a male nurse in that universe.

333
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,663
Then I got hit by a car and my soul traveled to this universe

334
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:03,580
and now reside in a female nurse's body.

335
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,100
For real?

336
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,910
Are there a lot of people who travel between universes?

337
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:12,940
From what I've seen in this hospital, not more than two people a year.

338
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,880
But those who I haven't found, I think it's a lot.

339
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,820
Can any of them travel back to the old universe?

340
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,120
I'm in a rush.

341
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,040
I just got a new job.

342
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,080
Calm down, brother.

343

What's your job?

344
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,390
- I'm a colorist.
- Colorist?

345
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,660
Like a color mixer? Do you make house paints?

346
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,707
No.

347
00:24:39,707 --> 00:24:41,800
I adjust colors for films.

348
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,760
Pretty much like editing photo colors in applications.

349
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:53,120
So will you tell me now if we can travel back home?

350
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,620
Can we? Well, we can.

351
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,330
But it's going to be a long story.

352
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,310
I will take you to a place and explain it to you there.

But if you can't, you can skip and rest.

359

Get to class this afternoon.

360
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,930
Then I'll send someone to take you for a CT Scan.

361
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,480
You seem out of your mind.

362
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,920
We will leave now.

363
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,860

364
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,260
Come on, Honey.

365
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:48,348
Yes?

366
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,700
Hey.

367
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,350
My dad said the CT scan is tomorrow.

368
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,710
Why did you come so soon?

369
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,450
What CT scan?

370
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,540
I'm just taking you to a place you should know if you want to live here.

371
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,070
Wow!

372
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,630
They're going so slow. Can you honk?

373
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,580
Relax. Let them.

374
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,840
They're having a good time.

375
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:38,342
Wow! Our country in this universe allows men to get married?

376
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:42,160
Of course. Don't tell me they still can't in our universe.

377
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,580
No.

378
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,420
How has our country changed?

379
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,490
Nothing has.

380
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,510
Sidewalks are crappy just the same.

381
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,123
Buses are as old as dinosaurs.

382
00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:56,463
But the gas is now more costly.

383
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,770
What we have more are the SkyTrain lines.

384
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,733
That's good. No more traffic jams then?

385
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:07,783
The traffic is still bad.

386
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,060
The SkyTrain tickets are pricey.

387
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,700
Who would use it?

388
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,210

People who can access this building

396

must know the password only folks from our universe know.

Welcome to the Association of Thai Citizens in the Alternate World.

407
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,180
My name is Joobjang.

408
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,480
I'm the head of the association.

409
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,810
I've only heard of an Association of Thai Citizens in a Different Country.

410
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,300
Didn't think there was one in a different universe.

411
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:05,170
Can your association take me home?

412
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,640
Easy there.

413
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,310
This is where people who have traveled between universes gather.

414
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,070
In case we can help each other.

415
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,170
Did Phuwadol give you an intro to this universe?

416
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,440
Yes.

417
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,762
According to Phuwadol, this is a parallel universe.

418
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:25,600
There are certain things that are not like those in our universe.

419
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,580
And I traveled between universes to live in a body of a guy named Tess.

420
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,920
And Tess traveled between universes to live in your body.

421
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,650
You two just switched universes.

422
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,450
What?

423
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,700
Then my life will be so fucked up.

424
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,200
As for the question of how you travel back,

425
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,374
let me explain it to you.

426
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,940
To return to the old universe, you must first

427
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,090
find someone who has traveled between universes like us.

428
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,650
There will be something of that person that matches you.

429
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,690
Once you find that person, you will dream.

430
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,980
Dream?

431
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,090
Right.

432
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,590
Have you noticed that you haven't dreamed since you came here?

433
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,060
Universal travelers don't dream.

434
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,300
People who usually live here can dream as usual.

435
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,547
If we dream, what will it be about?

436
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:23,210
It will be a place.

437
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,420
When you dream about a place, you must go there as soon as you wake up.

438
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,480
There's a chance for you to return home.

439
00:32:31,197 --> 00:32:35,840
And... how do we know if that person matches us?

440
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,430
There will be a sign.

441
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,540
When you find one, you will feel it.

442
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,710
For example, you two may share the same interest.

443
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,280
You may both have moles or marks in the same area on your body.

444
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,330
You two might also have a brief memory together but you can't remember it.

445
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:55,040
That means if I come to this association,

446
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,260
I might find that person here.

447
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,620
Possibly.

448
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,988
But there's a 99.99% chance that the person we're looking for

449
00:33:01,988 --> 00:33:05,640
is close to the owner of the body we're in.

450
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,860
Even more difficult.

451
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,080
What if I can't find that person?

452
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,820
Do I die here in this universe?

453
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,070
Not always.

454
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,160
You might be lucky the person in your body dreams and can come back.

455
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,590
Then you can go back, too.

456
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,700
But if he dies, you die too.

We call the person we're looking for "the portkey".

461
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,120
You might start with something simple like I did.

462
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,920
But it will be a little embarrassing.

463
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,720

00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,760
Guys,

510
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,440
I got beaten up here?

511
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,920
Damn right.

512
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,080
Can't you remember anything?

513
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,100
You flirted with a girl here not knowing she wasn't available.

514
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,150
Her boyfriend brought his friends to beat the crap out of you.

515
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,120
Lucky you.

516
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,620
Someone nice called an ambulance for you.

517
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,320
And that person was nice enough to wait until the ambulance came.

518
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,620
Who was it?

519
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,450
Go away. I can't let you check the video.

520
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,260
Come on, dude?

521
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,730
It's just for a second. My friend wants to know who helped him.

522
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,880
Relax, man. Let me handle this.

523
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,920
Hey!

524
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,810
I'm begging you.

525
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,480
Please help us.

526
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,310
Please.

527
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,621
Be kind to other human beings. Please.

528
00:38:45,621 --> 00:38:47,280
Just go.

529
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,420
Here.

530
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,820
Will you help?

531
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,320
It's all I have.

532
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,710
All right.

533
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,350
You have 10 minutes. Make it quick.

534
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,830
Make it quick.

535
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,150
Damn. I'm broke.

536
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,200
Look here.

537
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,350
There!

538
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,270
Hello.

539
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,910
Can you please call an ambulance here?

540
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,280
Please hurry. It's bad.

541
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,790
Tess!

542
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,820
Right here.

543
00:40:04,386 --> 00:40:06,160
Joe!

544
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,110
Easy there.

545
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,080
Who is Joe?

546
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,180
I'm Pramote.

547
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,850
Same old Pramote. Only he's hotter now.

548
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,610
Not funny.

549
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,980
I'm just not wearing glasses and have long hair.

550
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,770
You don't remember me now?

551
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,200
You asked me here because you're curious about Tun. Right?

552
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,910
What is it?

553
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,780
Who is Tun?

554
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,410
What?

555
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,490
Tun.

556
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,790
Tun, aka Pakorn. Student number 18 in class.

557
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:48,140
So Tun is Pakorn?

558
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,967
Right.

559
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,670
You normally call him Tun.

560
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,640
Actually, whatever questions you have, you can call him.

561
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,460
I did, but he hung up on me.

562
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,600
I don't know why.

563
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,780
Do you know where he is or what he's doing?

564
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,490
I guess I do.

565
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,920
These are his business cards.

566
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,820
Hold on.

567
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,920
Just Pakorn's contact.

568
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,210
These are all his.

569
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,120
What?

570
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,550
Yes.

571
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,657
Did you forget he's a screenwriter?

572
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:35,900
So he switches jobs all the time to get inspiration to write his script.

573
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,053
That's what he told me.

574
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,080
Do you have any idea where he is working today?

575
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,420
It's Saturday. He shouldn't be anywhere else.

576
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,660
Here.

577
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,850
At his older friend's bar.
[Pakorn Aue-ankun]

578
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,837
You should take them all.

579
00:42:04,837 --> 00:42:08,860
Since I've brought them. Here.

580
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,500
Tun?

581
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,280
He should be coming later tonight. He won't come now.

582
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,740
Look. It's deserted here.

583
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,490
Life sucks!

584
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,380
Relax.

585
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,140
Can I get a beer?

586
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,520
Wow. Luxurious choice!

587
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,400
Beer is luxurious?

588
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,420
It costs several times more than wine.

589
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,140
A poor guy like me drinks only wine.

590
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,950
Beer is once in a blue moon for me.

591
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,200
Beer in my universe is so damn cheap.

592
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,900
How many cans?

593
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,910
Hey!

594
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,100
You will drink two all by yourself?

595
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,160
A heavyweight, huh?

596
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,750
This is one.

597
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,320
That's two.

598
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,220
This is one. This is two.

599
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,310
So this is one. This is two...

600
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,600
There is Tun.

601
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,200
Hi, Tun!

602
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,840
I'm going to go play.

603
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,550
What's the hurry?

604
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,640
Won't you come talk to your friend?

605
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,797
What's with him?

606
00:43:44,797 --> 00:43:48,000
Bartender, give me a beer. Here.

607
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,270
- It's coming.
- Here.

608
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,880
Pay attention.

609
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,840
He's the best.

610
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:18,670
♪ Just when you lay eyes on me ♪

611
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,140
♪ I can't feel my heart ♪

612
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:27,170
♪ Because I already gave all my heart to you ♪

613
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:33,410
♪ I have no idea how I can live ♪

614
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,143
Bro.

615
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:38,120
You sure he's the best?

616
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,120
The best at singing off-key.

617
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,530
If there's a show searching for the most off-key singer, he wins.

618
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,550
Thank you.

619
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,370
I knew you'd run away.

620
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,800
Can we talk for a sec?

621
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,600
Hey! Pakorn!

622
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,420
I don't want to talk to you.

623
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,140
Pakorn!

624
00:45:37,772 --> 00:45:39,372
Pakorn!

625
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,600
Hey, Pakorn!

626
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,250
Damn you! Why did you run away?

627
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,070
Hot-headed as always.

628
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,660
Who?

629
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,480
How did you get in here?

630
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,500
Enough with that amnesia joke.

631
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,590
I'm Thanin, your big brother.

632
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,680
The guy who cleans up after your shit.

633
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,363
Why are you here then?

634
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,950
Dad is furious you skipped class and the CT scan.

635
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,995
He sent me to scold you.

636
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,820
Sorry about that.

637
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,537
I got something to deal with.

638
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,880
Tess.

639
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,600
I don't want to order you around.

640
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,560
But please at least show up at the company.

641
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,630
Work sometimes so that Dad won't get mad.

642
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,060
At the filmmaking company?

643
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,760
Hell yeah.

644
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,600
I know you don't want to.

645
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,430
- But I...
- I'll go.

646
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:17,040
Does our family really own this?

647
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,540
Of course.

648
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,940
How can I help?

649
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,400
Lots of people are coming to sell their movie projects.

650
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,080
I can only handle a few as I need to go see the editing process.

651
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,863
Sorry to keep you waiting. If you're ready, let's get started.

652
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,660
You.

653
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,360
You two know each other?

654
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,340
Should be easy then.

655
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,620
Something like that.

656
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,700
Actually, you can go to the editing.

657
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,830
I'll listen to his presentation.

658
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,960
You think?

659
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,360
All right, then.

660
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,080
Take care of it. I'll be right back.

661
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,160
What are you doing?

662
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,280
Preventing you from running away.

663
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,580
I have questions for you, Pakorn.

664
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,950
First, why are you avoiding me?

665
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,220
Second, when I got beaten up at the bar, you helped me, didn't you?

666
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,509
If we're not talking about the screenplay, I'll leave.

667
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,709
Wait.

668
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,080
Answer me.

669
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,240
I have nothing to say to you.

670
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,860
Damn it. Let go.

671
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,821
You let go.

672
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:04,903
What the hell is wrong with you?

673
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:07,493
Let go. I said let go!

674
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,700
Stay away from me. I hate you.

675
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:32,210
Shit.

676
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,920
This is harder than I thought.

677
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,780
I'll do anything to go back as soon as possible.

678
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,280
Have you found anyone who seems right?

679
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,350
There he is.

680
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:51,840
Is he the real Tun?

681
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,400
I think Pakorn is the one I'm looking for.

682
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,840
Check again if he traveled between universes like you.

683
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,880
Shit!

684
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,340
What happened last night?

685
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,240
To be my wife, you must endure.

686
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:15,610
♫ Is it you? That will change this world ♫

687
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:20,710
♫ Is it you? The person I've been searching a long time for ♫

688
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:23,260
♫ Have I found, Have I found ♫

689
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:30,840
♫ Someone who will be ready to walk through this side by side with me from now on ♫

690
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:36,070
♫ Is it you? That won't let me be sad ♫

691
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:42,110
♫ After a night of nightmares, making every tomorrow look bright ♫

692
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:48,790
♫ Forever, please tell me to be confident ♫

693
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:53,050
♫ That you won't go and leave me ♫

694
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,480
