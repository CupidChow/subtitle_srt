I'm not into love.

I think your heart hasn't been used in a long time.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,400
I promise I will put my best effort into writing this movie's script.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,450
And I'll live Tun's life to the fullest.

6

With you.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,810
We must name our team.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,960
I think it should say we're working behind the film.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,843
What do you think?

10
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:27,260
"Up and His Crew."

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,100
Nice and clear.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,060
It's clear that you're brainless, Up-Pree.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,200
I got something.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,430
"End Credits."

15
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,580
Almost there.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,760
But it's too simple.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,700
"Friend Credits."

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,460
Add F-R-I before E-N-D and it makes "Friend."

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,720
"Friend Credits."

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,620
This means friends who go through thick and thin together until the end.

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,597
Hey! That's good.

22
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,070
You guys like it?

23
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,093
Yeah.

24
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:07,777
Let's go with it.

25
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,150
Use this name.

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,280
"Friend Credits."

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,210
I will make a sign and put it up in front of our studio.

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,020
Hold on, Up.

29
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,570
When did we have a studio?

30
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,350
I've prepared you guys a surprise.

31
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,780
It's dope, I must say.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,680
What is this?

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,160
The restaurant owner rented it out so cheap and I got it from him.

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,100
Damn! You didn't discuss it with us.

35
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,320
If I did, this rental wouldn't happen.

36
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,050
I decided to go ahead and rent it.

37
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,840
Welcome. Welcome.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,660
- See?
- Surprised, huh?

39
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,870
Surprised?

40
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,740
Is it going to work?

41
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,540
It's nice.

Hey, Up.

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,020
For the scene where the male lead confesses,

48
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,760
why did you leave it blank?

49
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,420
I can't come up with any remarkable sentence.

50
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,489
Any good ideas?

51
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,389
I can't think of one.

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,280
"Do you want to try to get to know each other?"

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,520
"You don't have to like me very much."

"Just keep your heart open for me."

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,707
I love that already.

57
00:03:40,707 --> 00:03:42,300
I think we should use it.

58
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,630
Damn it, Tun! You're a genius.

59
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,740
Now that we got it,

60
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,440
I'm going to go get a drink. I'm thirsty.

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,130
Coming with you. I need the restroom.

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,260
You're a cheater.

63
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,520
That was from "2gether."

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,490
I was just saying. Who would have thought they'd love it?

65
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,940
Shit! Is this copyright infringement?

66
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,180
It's from a different universe. It should be okay.

67
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,720
I skimmed through what you wrote.

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,010
It's pretty good.

69
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,160
Just one tiny problem, though.

70
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,560
Here.

71
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,300
In the scene where the guy seduces the girl,

72
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,520
we can make it more swoon-worthy.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,280
I told you I wasn't an expert in romance.

74
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,740
Haven't you acted in this kind of scene?

75
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:56,921
I have.

76
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,320
It was a short thesis film my senior made.

77
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,360
It's the scene where the male and female leads sit on a dining table.

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,060
Then what?

79
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,963
You're showing me the scene, huh?

80
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:22,463
Go on.

81
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,980
This is seductive already?

82
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,050
Do I need to blush?

83
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,680
What were you looking at?

84
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,440
Was there a stain on my hand?

85
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,070
What?

86
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,420
Why are you so stoic?

87
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,900
When I acted in that short film, my partner was captivated.

88
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,810
There, there.

89
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,450
I'm just strong-minded.

90
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,550
Didn't you feel anything at all?

91
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,900
I did.

92
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,610
I feel you were adorable...

93
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,780
when you pout.

94
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,890
Hold on.

95
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,840
Is that an act or are you actually blushing?

96
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,060
There. You're blushing.

97
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,310
Just an act!

98
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,633
That's enough. Keep reading the script.

99
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,220
You're cute and tiny when you blush.

100
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,420
It's mine.

101
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,320

00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,480
What did you just call me?

109
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,603
Dang.

110
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:09,543
Then you're not going anywhere.

111
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,737
Please, Mr. Tun the Hottie. Give me a ride.

112
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:17,100
Fine. You should've said that from the beginning.

113
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,900
Follow me.

114
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,580
Can we go slower?

115
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,078
You won't make it in time if I go slower.

116
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,660
What will happen first: us crashing or the gas running out?

117
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,380
What did you say?

118
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,367
I said, I don't know what will happen first: us crashing or the gas running out!

119
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,490
We won't crash and the gas won't run out.

120
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,650
It's a fuel-efficient motorbike. I know my bike very well.

It's Pakorn's bike.

122
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,030
What?

123
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,040
Turn right.

124
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,200
Left?

125
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,730
Right!

126
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,770
Crap! I can't hear you well.

127
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,950

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,240
Okay.

130
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,200
Was that an "L"?

131
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,130
It's an "R".

Look at me.

141

Hold on.

You got a new one.

145
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:07,600
What are you doing?

146
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,257
Giving you an inhaler. Do you think it's a flashlight?

147
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:11,630
Sticking it in my nose?

148
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,003
Yes. It's an inhaler. You're supposed to sniff it.

149
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:16,279
Not something you can eat.

You want me to turn right? But we've arrived already.

154

It's "Really thankful."

155
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,452
How about this?

156
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,440
"L"?

157
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,000
You 'like it?'

158
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,328
Just wished you "Luck".

159
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,583
Now go. It's a long exam day, isn't it?

160
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,580
See you.

161
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:35,378
Guys, should we go drink tonight?

162
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:37,656
Celebrate the end of the exam.

163
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,400
You come up with a reason to celebrate every day.

164
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,660
I'm having a bit of a headache. I want to rest.

165

He keeps staring at you.

167

Is he picking a fight? Should we beat his ass?

169

Easy, man.

00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:01,690
- Easy.
- Easy.

171
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,520
That's Tun.

172
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,068
- Tun?
- Yes.

173
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,470
A friend who's working with me on the film.

174
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,180
You guys go ahead.

175
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,102
I'm going to talk to him.

176
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:20,673
- You sure?
- Yes.

177
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,000
See you.

178
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,592
Why are you still waiting?

179
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:39,230
I was leaving,

180
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,883
but then I thought of looking for more nice cafés.

181
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:44,300
So I decided to wait for you.

182
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,710
Until now?

183
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,960
Yeah.

184
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,080
You could've just gone back and worked on the script.

185
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,843
Let the production team do the job.

186
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:55,710
This is not the screenwriter's job.

187
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,740
I can't.

188
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,604
If I'm not into it, I won't be able to write it.

189
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,692
I want to find it myself.

190
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,870
Can we do it some other day?

191
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,960
Okay.

192
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,750
And...

193
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,040
how are you getting home?

194
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,250
A taxi, I guess.

195
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,420
Or are you giving me a ride home?

196
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,900
As you wish.

197
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,850
Did you bring me here to murder me?

198
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,370
It's desolate.

199
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,904
Qooqle Maps told me to take this route.

200
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,460
Stop here.

201
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,700
Stop. Stop.

202
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,200
What?

203
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,857
I think we should go back to the main road.

204
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:18,047
This path is frightening.

205
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,720
Damn it. We've almost run out of gas.

206
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,210
I don't think we can even make it midway down the path.

207
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,360
Just because it's fuel-efficient doesn't mean

208
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,920
you don't need to gas up at all.

209
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,540
That's true.

210
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,910
I'm going to search for the nearest gas station.

211
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,087
Hey. I'm going to stop there for a sec.

212
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,487
What?

213
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,476
Is this the right time to find the location?

214
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,933
Don't complain just yet. Let's go inside first.

215
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,720
Shit!

216
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,150
I didn't know this kind of place existed.

217
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,208
So mysterious.

218
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,228
Let's check it out.

219
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,532
Holy cow! It's gorgeous.

220
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,796
This is what I've been looking for.

221
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,070
I designed the ending scene already.

222
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,650
After the lead characters parted,

223
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,850
they run into each other here one day.

224
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,250
That's nice.

225
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,728
It's their favorite café.

226
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,760
Do you think after they meet again here,

227
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,120
they will fall back in love with each other?

228
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,783
How would I know that? You're the one who's writing the script.

229
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,140
I don't know it either.

230
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,430
Can you walk into the shop again?

231
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,850
I will stand here as the male lead.

232
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,040
No.

233
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,380
Come on. Help me.

234
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,400
Please.

235
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,680
Come on. Don't be reluctant.

236
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,860
Go.

237
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,320
What?

238
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,200
Me again?

239
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,460
So? Will they fall in love?

240
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,480
I think they will.

241
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,900
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

242
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,864
Yeah. Come here quick.

243
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,480
I told Up to bring us some gas.

244
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,980
He said he was with Aou not so far from here.

245
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,060
Shit!

246
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,472
The cake is a chef's kiss.

247
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,996
Your eyes go bigger every time you see desserts.

248
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,920
Of course. "My precious."

249
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,470
Your lover must be so tired,

250
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,300
having to take you out for a dessert every day.

251
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,535
I can buy it myself. I don't need a lover to take me.

252
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,530
Hey! Seriously.

253
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,130
Are you going to work only? When will you start thinking of dating someone?

254
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,187
Don't know.

255
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:54,930
Maybe after I become a colorist for a movie

256
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,690
and it is presented at a huge film festival.

257
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,236
Hasn't it occurred to you that the key to finding the portkey is love?

258
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:11,675
Why are you talking about this all of a sudden?

259
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,972
Because you don't care about love at all.

260
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,450
What if to go back, you must fall in love with someone?

261
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,150
What are you going to do?

262
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,680
I don't know.

263
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,336
It depends on who that is.

264
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,360
What if it's me?

265
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,610
What are you talking about?

266
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:54,880
I've been thinking about lots of things lately.

267
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,872
About going home and about work.

268
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,548
Everything is related to love.

269
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,470
So?

270
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,136
So I want to know a little more about love.

271
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,790
How about we fall in love with each other?

272
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,370
Shit!

273
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,572
This place is stunning!

274
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,210
Up, let's go.

275
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,688
You guys are here.

276
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:45,843
Yes.

277
00:21:45,843 --> 00:21:48,211
It's gorgeous.

278
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,690
Wow!

279
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,968
Guys, I've got something to show you.

280
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,200
It's our group's folders.

281
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,900
Wait a minute.

282
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,443
That's my drawing.

283
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:06,380
Where did you get it?

284
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,790
It was on the treatment paper that you and Tun drew.

285
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,928
I found it funny, so I'm using it as our team's mascot.

286
00:22:12,928 --> 00:22:14,837
Is it cool?

287
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:16,540
Take one.

288
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,520
I tried to stop him, but he didn't listen.

289
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,120
So I brought him here.

290
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,610
But it's nice, isn't it?

291
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,810
Yes, it is.

292
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,388
Let's join forces.

293
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,160
To the team folders that I just spent the team budget on.

294
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,680
Yeah!

295
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,916
What? The team budget?

296
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,700
Up! You bastard!

297
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,647
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

298
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,690
I'm glad you asked us out to drink once in a while.

299
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,860
But I didn't think you'd bring your secret lover here too, zebra.

300
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,560
What secret lover?

301
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,590
Why are you here?

302
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:26,517
I'm hitting on you, aren't I?

303
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:31,230
Hi. I'm Tun.

304
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,730
Hi.

305
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,596
You're the screenwriter, aren't you?

306
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,360
If you need an actor to play a charismatic and handsome guy, reach out to me.

307
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,350
My name is Fuse.

308
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,750
Fuse.

309
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,440
And this dude is Kita. You don't need to remember him.

310
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,640
And why are you bribing him?

311
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,779
Stop it, you two. We're here to drink.

312
00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:59,530
Fine.

313
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,430
He's here after all.

314
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,280
We need a welcoming activity.

315
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,761
- Take my glass and drink it all.
- That's it?

316
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:09,440
First glass first.

317
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,050
Sure.

318
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,160
Wait.

319
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,820
Pakorn is a lightweight.

320
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,150
Don't you remember?

321
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,820
The last time you drank, you woke up in a police station.

322
00:24:22,365 --> 00:24:25,550
I do, darling.

323
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,980
Stop that.

324
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,420
Here, Tun.

325
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,180
Come on.

326
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,032
Here, buddy.

327
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,940
Let go.

328
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,712
Wow!

329
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:25,036
What are you doing?

330
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,108
Why am I topless?

331
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,590
You were drunk and threw up on your shirt.

332
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,940
Kita was going to take you home.

333
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,760
But I offered to bring you here instead.

334
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,160
Why?

335
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,643
Because I'm hitting on you.

336
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:50,090
Hit on me, my ass!

337
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,890
Give me my shirt.

338
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,120
It's a little wet. I washed it for you.

339
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,652
Wow!

340
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,320
You read shoujo?

341
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,257
This is what you like?

342
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,212
Hands off it.

343
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:43,400
It's Pakorn's.

344
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,164
I just read it for fun.

345
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,920
It's Pakorn's, too.

346
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,860
I'm just wearing his.

347
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,590
I haven't asked yet. Don't be alarmed.

348
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,490
Go away.

349
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,890
Those are mine.

350
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,440
They're Pakorn's favorite.

351
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,860
And my favorite too now.

352
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,143
They are so soft.

353
00:27:20,143 --> 00:27:22,280
Can I steal some?

354
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,676
Sure. They're right there.

355
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,550
Whoa!

356
00:27:45,092 --> 00:27:48,464
So? Is it soft like my cheek?

357
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,436
How would I know that?

358
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,510
Do you want to touch it?

359
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,100
No.

360
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,096
Maybe it's soft like your cheek.

361
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
Probably.

362
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,820
It's pretty soft.

363
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,600
Let's see.

364
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,590
Hey, Tun!

365
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,076
Soft, indeed.

366
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,040
Let go.

367
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,640
No.

368
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,250
Fine!

369
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,723
You're not letting go, are you?

370
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:46,087
I'll pinch your cheek, too.

371
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,192
Talay.

372
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,612
You want to fight?

373
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,120
Eat that.

374
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,070
Get some sleep.

375
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,120
All right, then.

376
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,480
Hey, Tun. Are you asleep?

377
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:38,203
I have a question.

378
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,480
Ever since you've been here,

379
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,272
have you ever been scared of tomorrow?

380
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:54,452
Scared of anything that hasn't come.

381
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,640
I have.

382
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,788
How do you deal with it?

383
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,076
I do nothing.

384
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,970
Thanks.

385
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,444
You're such a big help.

386
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,872
You already have me here.

387
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:59,684
One day, if there's a problem or you're scared,

388
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,108
you can tell me.

389
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,896
I might not be able to fix everything for you.

390
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,992
But I'm right here,

391
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,440
willing to hear anything you vent.

392
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,500
Thank you.

393
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,572
That sounds a lot better.

394
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,753
Get some sleep. Good night.

395
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,560
Good night.

396
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,400
Tun, you've got work this Saturday. Right?

397
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,610
What work?

398
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,400
What? Did you forget?

399
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,150
It's your high school friend's wedding.

400
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,260
You agreed to be the photographer.

401
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,460
Are you going with Tess?

402
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,280
Please welcome the groom and the bride on stage.

403
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,684
Let's give it up to them.

404
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,748
They look perfect together.

405
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,920
You two have gone through so much.

406
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,243
Hello.

407
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:44,460
Hey. Where are you?

408
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,064
I'm inside. Just walk in.

409
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,480
Now that we're all ready,

410
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,838
let's witness their love together in this video.

411
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,840
Hey.

412
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,030
You're so into it. Want to get married too, don't you?

413
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,020
That's normal, isn't it?

414
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,670
Of course, I think about it sometimes.

415
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,990
When you get married and have a video presentation like that,

416
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,440
you can hire me.

417
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,408
Before I go to that, I should get myself a lover first.

418
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,570
Yeah, I know.

419
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,340
But when you get married, hire me.

420
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,220
I'm telling you, my wage is high.

421
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,510
If I need to pay that much, I should just marry a colorist.

422
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,410
Problem solved.

423
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,368
All right, guys.

424
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,670
The bride is about to throw a bouquet of lotuses.

425
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:03,710
Those who are still single, please step up front.

426
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,360
Please.

427
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,180
Don't you want to join them?

428
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,780
All right.

429
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,480
3, 2, 1.

430
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,692
Go!

431
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,000
Shit!

432
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,090
And the one who got the bouquet is Tun,

433
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,320
the photographer of this wedding.

434
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,756
Mr. Tun, please step up on stage.

435
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,500
Please.

436
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,100
Congratulations on the flowers.

437
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:50,044
As someone who got the wedding bouquet, please answer this classic question.

438
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,047
Are you already taken?

439
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,850
I'm not.

440
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,170
He's available.

441
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:05,120
Are you hitting on anyone right at the moment?

442
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,808
Actually, I'm hitting on someone.

443
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,240
But he's playing hard to get.

444
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,100
I'm wondering who that is.

445
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,890
Why is he so mean to someone so handsome?

446
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,390
Yeah. So mean.

447
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,700
That's all right.

448
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,720
We all wish you the best of luck.

449
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,912
You got the wedding bouquet. You should be lucky soon.

450
00:36:05,608 --> 00:36:07,990
Who was that mean person you talked about?

451
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,170
What for?

452
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,188
I talked about the one I'm hitting on.

453
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,828
More!

454
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,360
How about we fall in love with each other?

455
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:04,120
No!

456
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,293
Why not?

457
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:07,900
We can just fake it.

458
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,616
Love isn't something you can fake.

459
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,840
Of course, we can.

460
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,050
I faked it all the time when I was an actor.

461
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,310
Then you fake it with someone else.

462
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,010
Leave me out of it.

463
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,520
"Do you want to try getting to know each other?"

464
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,760
"You don't have to like me very much."

465
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,980
"Just keep your heart open for me."

466
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,320
Add more feelings into it.

467
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,360
If I do, will I get to be the protagonist?

468
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,336
Look! What's that?

469
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,590

Who is Talay?

00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,920
Right. Who is Talay?

474
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,060
Why is Tun doing this?

475
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,936
What the hell are you doing, Tun?

476
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,050
Hitting on you.

477
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,070
Hitting, my ass.

478
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,080
You're embarrassing me.

I'm not.

480
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,212
I'm just making a scene so that I can write romantic scenes better.

481
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:03,568
So all you've done is for your screenwriting?

482
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,020
Of course.

483
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,156
Are you actually feeling it?

484
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,700
But that might be good.

485
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,636
It might unlock us and get us back to our universe together.

486
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,330
Hey, Tun.

487
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,316
Stop doing this.

488
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:46,180
If we're the right ones for each other, we'd be back by now.

489
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,960
You're just having fun messing with me.

490
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,400
I'm not messing with you.

- I...
- Please.

492

Can you stop doing this to me?

493
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:06,564
Feelings aren't something you can toy with.

494
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,050
It's not funny.

495
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,610
Fine.

Just throw up already.

I was right to rent this studio.

00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:28,250
Just came to hang out.

509
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:32,300
Where is Tun?

510
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,400
Tun?

511
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,540
He hasn't been here for a while.

512
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,872
He said he'd isolate himself and write the script.

513
00:42:39,872 --> 00:42:42,470
You can leave any messages for him with us.

514
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,990
I'm done here.

515
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,890
Will you excuse me? I've got something to do.

516
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,890
See you.

517
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,080
What kind of hangout lasts 3 seconds?

518
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,070
You're not a movie.

519
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,320
You are real.

520
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,720
- Hey.
- Hi.

521
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,243
Talay, it's late.

522
00:43:42,243 --> 00:43:44,483
And you've come alone.

523
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,860
Has Tun been here at all?

524
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,327
He hasn't. What is it?

525
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,540
Nothing.

526
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,800
Everybody is gone?

527
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,240
Of course.

528
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,567
Why? Do you want to vent to the support group?

529
00:44:10,688 --> 00:44:12,190
No.

530
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,790
Liar.

531
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,930
- You can tell?
- Come on.

532
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,080
You can't be more obvious.

533
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,564
It's just me here. You can talk to me.

534
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,884
How do I start?

535
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,860
Lately,

536
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,920
someone has done something nice to me.

537
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,480
So nice that I thought he was serious.

538
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:46,692
But in the end, it turned out he did it just for fun.

539
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,510
Did he tell you he did it just for fun?

540
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,790
He didn't.

541
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,436
I could tell from his actions.

542
00:44:56,237 --> 00:44:59,000
I think you judged him too quickly.

543
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,260
I get it that you're mad.

544
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,900
But isn't it a little too harsh on the other person?

545
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,508
You haven't heard what he has to say yet.

546
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,140
I tried to look for him.

547
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,984
But I don't even know where he is.

548
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,060
Think carefully.

549
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:21,528
If you guys are close enough, you know where he is.

550
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,028
Holy cow! It's gorgeous.

551
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,144
This is what I've been looking for.

552
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,937
I know it.

553
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:43,070
Thank you so much. Bye now.

554
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,967
It's raining outside.

555
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:30,508
I've been waiting for you.

556
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,476
How did you know I was here?

557
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:01,380
The script says both lead characters part...

558
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,216
and meet again here in the end.

559
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:09,796
I came here just like what your characters did.

560
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,810
Have you got the inner feeling you want?

561
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:33,020
I am sorry for making you feel bad.

562
00:47:34,512 --> 00:47:37,050
I didn't mean to play you.

563
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,650
I just...

564
00:47:40,528 --> 00:47:46,044
wanted to know the feeling when I really love someone.

565
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:51,452
Anything I say now sounds like bullshit.

566
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,820
Since it looks like I already played with your feelings.

567
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,176
But I want you to know...

568
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,816
that if it's not you,

569
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:14,468
I wouldn't be able to work this well.

570
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,696
Will you forgive me?

571
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:29,440
Yes, you're forgiven.

572
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,320
But if your script turns out bad,

573
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,380
I'll kick your ass.

574
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:45,104
Thank you for understanding.

575
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,980
Come on.

576
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,880
We should go.

577
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,240
We can't go yet.

578
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,724
There's one more thing about the characters that I still don't understand.

579
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,680
Are you messing with me again?

580
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,480
No.

581
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,490
I'm not messing with you this time.

582
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,356
Kissing you helped me improve so much on my scriptwriting.

583
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,790
What the heck are you doing, Tun?

584
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:01,716
You two go stand where marked as lead characters for me.

585
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:09,144
If you found your portkey one day, will you go back immediately?

586
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,444
That's totally your call.

587
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:34,900
"Have I Found" - Sea Tawinan

588

♫ Is it you? That will change this world ♫

589
