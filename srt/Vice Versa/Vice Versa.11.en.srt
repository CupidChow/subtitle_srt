00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,203
I dreamed. We're going home.

Don't tell me...you're Pakorn.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,760
I don't know when we will get to go home.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,000
But no matter where you'll be, I promise I'll look for you.

[One day earlier]

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,672
Puen, in this scene, the athlete will walk in and punch you with his left fist.

9
00:00:32,672 --> 00:00:35,390
Just like we rehearsed it. Okay?

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,230
Once you got punched, you pretend to fall into the pool.

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,640
But don't really go in there because it's dangerous.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,040
Thank you, guys. Good luck.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,370
Thanks, Pramote.

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,080
I'm Joe.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,900
Why do you keep calling me Pramote? I just don't get it.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,810
I have a friend who looks like you named Pramote.

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,871
- Looks like me?
- Yes.

18
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:54,990
So he's hot?

19
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,600
- If you say so.
- Okay. Let's start.

20

21

Pramote?

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,800
Ready?

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,840
Ready?

24

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,160

26
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,040
And... action.

27
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:27,163
Shit! Puen is drowning!

28
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,333
Go in and help him, Joe.

29
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,600
Joe, jump in.

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,880
Why did you literally punch him?

31
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,950
Talay.

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,480
He's conscious.

33
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,920
Talay.

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,600
Where's Talay?

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,931
We're not going to the sea. We're going to a hospital.

What's happening?

37
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,450
Don't you remember at all?

38
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,300
We were filming a movie and there was an accident.

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,548
Luckily, nothing serious happened, Puen.

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,400
What did you just call me?

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,520
Puen.

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,524
Do you have amnesia after getting punched?

43
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,590
Easy, Puen.

44
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,728
We're going to the hospital.

45
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,450
Am I back?

46
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,512
I'll postpone the filming.

47
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:05,320
Rest in the hospital for a few days.

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,320
No.

49
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Puen!

50
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,801
Easy, Puen. Calm down.

51
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,727
I need to go find someone.

52
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,332
Lie down. We're nearly at the hospital.

53
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:17,610
I'm not going. I'm fine.

54
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,056
- Stop the car!
- Oh, come on. Lie back down.

55
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:23,260
You're not fine, Puen.

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,680
- Hey, stop the car!
- Puen, pull yourself together.

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,696
Lie down.

- Talay!
- Tie him.

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,748
Sorry, Puen.

61
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,803
Stop the car.

62
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,450
Stay put.

How did you get back here?

68
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,810
The other day, I dreamed.

69
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,032
I dreamed of a place.

70
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:11,983
The next day, I went there to film a movie.

71
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,584
They happened to be in the same location.

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,152
I accidentally fell into a pool.

73
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,312
Once I woke up,

74
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:28,721
I was here.

75
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:45,489
That means Tun suddenly went back...

76
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,130
because you came back.

77

It's just as Dol said.

and go to the place in your dream in order to return.

Why do you call him Tun though?

81

That's my name.

Come on. We can't go now.

I can't tell the exact time. Might be a week.

Hold on, Uncle.

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,020
I'm in a rush.

165
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,840
I'll book accommodation around here.

166

Once the tide is low, please let me know.

167

Fine. I'll keep an eye on the water level for you.

Yeah.

172

Why are you calling again? I told you Talay hasn't come back yet.

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,980
At least I get to hear his voice.

174
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,660
Though you're not really him.

175
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,980
You're so drunk in love. Why don't you come and look at my face?

176
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,980
You said it yourself.

177
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,340
Shit! How did you get in here?

178
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,833
I saw no one else was home. So I climbed over the fence.

179
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:41,500
I'm going to share this on Twitter.

180
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,288
A crazy-in-love actor breaks into his crush's home.

181
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,125
It's worth it if I get to see Talay's face a little longer.

182
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,971
What on earth?

183
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,980
Stop looking at me, jackass.

184
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,330
What the heck?

185
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,473
I'm playing a mobile game. You just ruined my mood.

186
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:21,500
It can't be fun playing alone.

187
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,520
Here. I'll play it with you.

188
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,900
What's up with you?

189
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,767
Here.

190
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,940
If Talay comes back, how will he contact me?

191
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,396
Have him call you.

192
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,236
I'm not even sure if he knows my name.

193
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,570
Let's do this.

194
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,560
Can you leave him a post-it note?

195
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,920
What now?

196
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,492
You broke into my house and order me around.

197
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,376
There's no post-it note here.

198
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,104
Please help, sir.

199
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:33,080
Happy?

200
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:36,420
Now, leave.

201
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,880
My mom and my brother will be back soon.

202
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,600
Why?

203
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,120
Can't I wait around to greet them?

204
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,470
No. I don't want to answer their questions.

205
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,456
Go already.

206
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:51,680
Okay.

207
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,020
Wait.

208
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,130
- What?
- Where are you going?

209
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,283
I'm leaving.

210
00:16:56,283 --> 00:17:00,677
Do it like when you entered.

211
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:02,170
You want me to climb over the fence?

212
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,390
Yes.

213
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,730
No.

214
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,904
Do it.

215
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:11,423
You will pay for it. I'll climb again.

216
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,755
Don't step on my grass.

217
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,880
When you're back, call a guy named Puen.

218
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,060
His number is on your contact list.

219
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,110
Why did you give me an hourglass?

220
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,810
It's an indicator of how long we're together.

221
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,680
Though we're apart.

222
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:50,388
I will meet again someday and spend time together once more.

223
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:52,360
Just like this hourglass.

224
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,670
It goes from one side to the other.

225
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,044
Like our universal traveling.

226
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,490
Uncle.

227
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,110
Has the low tide come yet?

228
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,440
You again?

229
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,361
Take it easy. It's still high.

230
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:31,764
Just wait. I'll take you there.

231
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,510
Talay?

232
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,380
[One month later]

233
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,120
Damn you, ocean tide!

234
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,692
When will you go lower?

235
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:53,760
Aren't you gonna say what you wished for?

236
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,460
Don't break the rule. Tell us.

237
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,400
I won't.

238
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,780
Tess is the only one allowed to know.

239
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,856
That day, in the glass house, I'd fallen head over heels in love with you.

240
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,610
So? Will they fall in love?

241
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,900
I guess they will.

242
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,770
Son, stop.

243
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,480
Calm down.

244
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,770
Where are you going?

245
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,220
To see Tun.

246
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,280
- Let me go.
- Calm down.

247
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,360
Don't lose your mind. Pull yourself together.

248
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,830
I checked the water level on the other side.

249
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,470
The tide is getting lower there.

250
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,432
If you really wish to go, I'll take you.

251
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,200
I have a question.

252
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,700
What's the first thing you'll do when you go back?

253
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,250
Look for you.

254
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,660
No. I mean...

255
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,036
What's your dream?

256
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,720
Still, look for you.

257
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,200
Because my dream is to be with you.

258
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,010
Yuck. Cheesy.

259
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,960
What about you?

260
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,428
What's the first thing you'll do when you go back?

261
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,870
Look...

262
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,230
for you as well.

263
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,740
Yuck.

264
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,432
You're as cheesy as I am.

265
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,080
Let's make a promise then.

266
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,780
Let's promise to find each other when we go back.

267
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,400
Promise?

268
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,680
I promise.

269
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,880
Talay, are you awake?

270
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,268
It's time to eat.

271
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,400
Why didn't you answer me?

272
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,976
Come on. Time for breakfast.

273
00:27:35,593 --> 00:27:39,400
Talay, what's going on?

274
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,100
Why are you crying? What's wrong?

275
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,308
Talay.

276
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,504
Are you okay?

277
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,890
Is there a problem?

278
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,040
You can tell me.

279
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,580
Nothing, Mom.

280
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,292
I just missed you.

281
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,870
You had a nightmare, didn't you?

282
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,424
It's okay.

283
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,470
Here it is.

284
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,279
Why do you want to eat a basil stir-fried dish now?

285
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,251
You've been saying you hate it.

286
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,979
Nothing. I just want to eat it.

287
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:48,957
I miss your food.

288
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,900
You eat my food every day. You don't make any sense.

289
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,010
Mom, I've bought the ice cubes.

290
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,009
All right.

291
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:04,430
- Ice cubes are here.
- Put them right there.

292
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,210
It's scorching outside.

293
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,404
So hot.

294
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,520
What's up?

295
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,928
Why are you staring at me?

296
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,230
Oh, did you...

297
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,780
find out I took money from your piggy bank?

298
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,620
I'm sorry.

299
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:34,177
Once I get the money, I'll pay you back.

300
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:36,400
Don't tell Mom.

301
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,700
I'm in need...

302
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,310
Take it.

303
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:51,500
Damn! Who are you?

304
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,930
Where is my hot-headed little bro?

305
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,498
Are you real?

306
00:29:56,498 --> 00:29:57,360
You're weird.

307
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,483
Exactly. Like he's back to being him two years ago.

308
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:06,266
My cute and calm Talay. He's back.

309
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,710
What happened to you today?

310
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,840
Why did you get up early?

311
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,823
Are you going out looking for a job?

312
00:30:15,823 --> 00:30:17,867
Looking for a job?

313
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:20,000
Aren't I working for TBFB?

314
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,833
You were.

315
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,420
But that was two years ago.

316
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,235
Did you forget? You quit a long time ago.

317
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,730
Wait.

318
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,104
What's my job then?

319
00:30:34,104 --> 00:30:38,550
You became a manager of an actor named Puen.

320
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,193
But it was brief.

321
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:44,443
You were fired and are now jobless.

322
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,850
Why am I telling your own story?

323
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,840
Hold on.

324
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,030
What did you say the actor's name was again?

325
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,730
Puen.

326
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,580
What's up with you?

327
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,480
You need a hand, Mom?

328
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,173
- Take this.
- Sure.

329
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,340
Puen.

330
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,710
Talay?

331
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,176
Thank you. Thank you.

332
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:52,250
Guys, please make some room.

333
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,500
Leave your presents with me.

334
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Puen, get inside. Let Puen take some rest, guys.

335
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,534
Will you excuse me? Bye, guys.

336
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,737
You guys go wait over there.

337
00:33:03,737 --> 00:33:05,809
This evening, when he's done working, we will take photos again.

338
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:07,057
Go back for now.

339
00:33:07,057 --> 00:33:09,070
Bye, guys. Thank you so much.

340
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,120
See you. Go before it rains.

341
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,400

Hold on. I...

344

You caused him a lot of financial damage.

00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,388
"Can you be that person for me?"

508
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:24,520
I never knew you could be so drunk in love.

509
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,232
Is that person still in your life?

510
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,676
We've been apart for a while.

511
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,176
But I hope one day, we will find each other again.

512
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,683
So he isn't dating the female lead?

513
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:53,791
Who's that lucky person then?

514
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,170
Lay!

515
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,720
Finished what you needed to do?

516
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,839
-Is Puen still in there?
- Hold on.

517
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:33,264
He left right after the interview was over.

518
00:48:33,264 --> 00:48:35,180
I was in line to get a souvenir.

519
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,950
This. I got one for you, too.

520
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,600
Cute, right?

521
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,600
So cute.

522
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:27,116
We also have one in this universe?

523
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:33,260
Excuse me.

524
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,753
I'm sorry. We're closed.

525
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:44,600
Can I please take a look inside?

526
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,696
I'll be just a second.

527
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,410
Fine.

528
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:55,323
I'll clean up the storefront in the meantime.

529
00:49:55,323 --> 00:49:57,123
Thank you.

530
00:50:49,616 --> 00:50:51,750
Everything is the same.

531
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:06,842
I'm done. I'll be leaving...

532
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,410
Talay.

533
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,692
Sorry, Tess.

534
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,840
If you were Talay, you would have called me.

535
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,084
I got a bit lost around here.

536
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,796
I didn't think this place was here in this universe.

537
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,880
Bye, now.

538
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,480
Dang.

539
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:20,010
Do you know what the first thing I'll say to you is if we meet in our universe?

540
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:20,920
What?

541
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,110
Dang!

542
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:27,500
Dang! Dang! Dang!

543
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,420
When did you come back?

544
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,580
Days ago.

545
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,440
I just couldn't get to you.

546
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:47,480
Because of your fame, I just...

547
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,820
♫ Have I found, Have I found ♫

548
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:03,520
♫ Someone who will be ready to walk through this side by side with me from now on ♫

549
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,860
♫ Is it you? That won't let me be sad ♫

550
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,290
I'm sorry.

551
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:17,240
You must be very tired.

552
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,140
From now on, things will be okay.

553
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:29,200
♫ Is it you? That won't let me be sad ♫

554
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:35,130
♫ After a night of nightmares, making every tomorrow look bright ♫

555
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:41,910
♫ Forever, please tell me to be confident ♫

556
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:45,168
♫ That you won't go and leave me ♫

557
00:53:45,168 --> 00:53:50,676
I told you, "To be my wife, you must endure."

558
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,064
Your wife, my ass!

559
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,800
You know what?

560
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,460
I dreamed about the secret island.

561
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,140
I tried to get there.

562
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:20,896
But it was flooded. I waited a whole month.

563
00:54:20,896 --> 00:54:23,410
Do you know how long...

564
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:29,490
those 43,200 minutes I waited for you felt like?

565
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,070
It was not different for me.

566
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,870
Because for me,

567
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:42,930
it was 2,592,000 seconds I waited for you.

568
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,880
We share the same brain cells.

569
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,596
We literally measure every bit of time.

570
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,390
But damn.

571
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,290
I'm so happy.

572
00:54:55,927 --> 00:55:01,679
Now that I'm with you seeing your real face,

573
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,516
it feels like a dream.

574
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,320
Does it still feel like it's a dream?

575
00:55:36,107 --> 00:55:38,820
Or do you want me to do more?

576
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,176
What are you saying, Puen?

577
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:47,515
I'm kidding.

578
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,100
Promise me...

579
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,140
you won't leave me again.

580
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:15,720
I don't want you to disappear on me again.

581
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:23,500
♫ It's because of you that gave today meaning ♫

582
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:29,120
♫ And you made me learn my own worth ♫

583
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,580
♫ There's only you here, I'm not going anywhere ♫

584
00:56:35,784 --> 00:56:37,952
I will not leave you again.

585
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,640
I promise.

586
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:06,290
♫ There's only you here, I'm not going anywhere ♫

587
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,980
♫ With you right here by my side ♫

588
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:15,620
♫ Forever, not expecting anything more than this ♫

589
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:24,850
♫ There's only you here. Whatever happens, I won't be afraid ♫

590
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:31,290
♫ Just having you here by my side ♫

591
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,120
I miss the time when we were in the other universe.

592
00:57:54,357 --> 00:57:58,623
Should we do something to reminisce about it?

593
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:31,920
I miss that universe, too.

594
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,240
Do you remember we ate these noodles when we were there?

595
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,696
Of course, I do.

596
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,910
We have one here as well.

597
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,470
That's right.

598
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,373
Take this.

599
00:58:52,373 --> 00:58:54,173
Hold it.

600
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:07,933
You just stopped talking to me.

601
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:10,080
Good, isn't it?

602
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,400
Oh, yes. It's so good.

603
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,940
Besides, they taste just the same.

604
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,788
Can we switch?

605
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,240
Do you want some garlands?

606
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,663
No. I'm not worshiping Buddha today.

607
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:31,100
Hey.

608
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,900
I'll take one.

609
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:44,028
What are you eating?

610
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,940
It looks yummy.

611
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,020
Here.

612
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:59,164
Thank you.

613
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,640
What are you eating?

614
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,696
It looks yummy.

615
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,180
What is it now?

616
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,883
Here. Eat these flowers for now.

617
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,860
Are you sulking?

618
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,212
Come on. Eat it.

619
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,612
Will you open your mouth or do I make you do it?

620
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,832
Are you mimicking me?

621
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,880
There.

622
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,868
If you're going to stare at me like that, you might as well eat me.

623
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,460
Can I?

624
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,360
You're crazy.

625
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,240
Eat it. Do it.

626
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,140
Take it all.

627
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,457
Thank you for coming back and searching for me.

628
01:02:09,457 --> 01:02:14,190
And thank you for taking away my fear of tomorrow.

629
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:17,150
But you know what this showbiz is like, Puen.

630
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,180
I miss our time together.

631
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:21,160
Can we just go back?

632
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,828
Are we back to this universe again, Tess?

633
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,760
I want to stop time.

634
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,130
I want to stop universal traveling.

635
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:33,268
We finally get to see the same moon.

636
