1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,977
I have a question.

2
00:00:00,977 --> 00:00:03,980
What's the first thing you'll do when you go back?

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,280
Look for you.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,790
Because my dream is to be with you.

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,889
We will meet for sure this time.

6
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:12,480
We're apart for now.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,680
But I hope one day, we will find our way back to each other.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,540
Promise me you won't leave me again.

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,700
I don't want you to disappear on me again.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,703
I will not leave you again. I promise.

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,764
Are we back to this universe again, Tess?

12
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:02,830
Wait.

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,500
You're...

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,750
Yes.

15
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,550
I am...

16
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,680
Puen!

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,284
You were fooled.

18
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,160
I knew you were fooling me.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,940
How can you be a famous actor?

20
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,032
Your acting skills suck.

21
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,180
I'm like this with you only.

22
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,096
When I'm with you, I don't act.

23
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,810
Too early to be cheesy.

24
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,320
I'll go get something to eat.

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,320
Hold on. What's the rush? It's still early.

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,600
I need to go to work. It starts at 10.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,240
It's just 7:30.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,480
We can do so much before that.

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,880
May you tell me what you would like to do this morning then, Mr. Puen?

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,900
Kiss you.

31
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,900
Damn you.

32
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,043
Can I?

33
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,731
What if I say no?

34
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,900
I won't do it.

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,832
I will be sad for two days though.

36
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:20,383
I will get better.

37
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:22,635
Exaggerating.

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,920
Come on.

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,720
Can I?

40
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,396
I promise I'll be as gentle as possible.

41
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,220
How?

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,368
Gentle, but intense.

43
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,280
I won't hurt your lips.

44
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,492
You don't have to describe it.

45
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,112
I'm feeling awkward.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,040
Then I'll stop talking.

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,188
I'll just do it.

48
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,424
I didn't say you can do it.

49
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,720
With that morning breath, I won't let you kiss me.

50
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,660
It's not even bad.

51
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,670
Please.

52
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,000
No, Puen!

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,440
Go brush your teeth.

54
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,040
No.

55
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,888
If I do, will I get to kiss you?

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,160
No idea.

57
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,440
Talay, what are you waiting for? Come brush your teeth.

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,579
All right. I'm coming.

59
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:01,404
Here.

60
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,900
Wait.

61
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,430
Did you buy the same product Pakorn used?

62
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,840
No. Pakorn had a lot in stock.

63
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,640
It's good.

64
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,300
So I can brush my teeth very often.

65
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,060
And you won't have any more excuses.

66
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,826
What are you looking at?

67
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:34,700
At you.

68
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,000
I want to look at you all day.

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,010
Smells just great.

70
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,120
No more excuses now.

71
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,200
Not yet.

72
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,040
I'm always hungry after brushing my teeth.

73
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,680
It's my body mechanism in the morning.

74
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,960
Mechanism, my ass.

75
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:32,400
Puen, what are you doing?

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,464
Taking advantage of you.

77
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,950
Wow. You know how to make it?

78
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,940
Look. You like it?

79
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,020
It might not look the same.

80
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,624
But it's something to remind us of the old times.

81
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
Yeah,

82
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,950
but this is not enough.

83
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,076
This is better.

84
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,140
If I get this every day, I won't ask for anything anymore.

85
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,760
Keep your word.

86
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,675
I won't ask. I'll just do it.

87
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,604
Whatever comes from you is so good.

88
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,472
Thank you for coming back and searching for me.

89
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:50,544
And thank you...

90
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,924
for taking away my fear of tomorrow.

91
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:01,399
I thank you too...

92
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,836
for being born so that I could love you.

96
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,410
Please wait a moment. I'm almost there.

97
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,110
Sure.

98
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,400
See? I'm late for work because of you.

99
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,696
I know. I'm taking responsibility here.

100
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:31,660
Turn left or right?

101
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,650
Left.

102
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,870
What?

103
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,210
Left.

104
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,990
Huh?

105
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,848
It's noisy.

106
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:41,743
Let me write it down on your palm.

107
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:43,343
Here.

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,880
Yeah!

110
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,384
Damn. I miss our time in that universe.

111
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:57,630
Now you can write whatever you want on it.

112
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,330
Really?

113
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,836
Is it "WTH"?

114
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,960
Are you cursing at me?

115
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,740
You're so bad.

116
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,743
All right, I lose. Reveal it.

117

"Where there's you, there's happiness."

118
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,413
You're cheating. That's not even the right initials.

119
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:35,713
Who would know it?

120
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,660
Do you like it though?

121
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,888
I like it so much.

122
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,160
Woo! I have the energy to work today.

123
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,980

Puen.

125
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:02,240
It's almost time for probation evaluation.

126
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,350
So I just wanted to talk to you first.

127
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,040
I didn't pass?

128
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,072
Not really.

129
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,540
Actually, everyone likes your work.

130
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,710
We love your color grading.

131
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,980
However, we're still concerned

132
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,840
about you ditching the job so suddenly.

133
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,990
Arm.

134
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,360
To tell you the truth,

135
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,452
I didn't ditch the job.

136
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:37,880
There was an accident.

137
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,080
What accident?

138
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,783
You wouldn't believe me.

139
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,640
I just want you to know...

140
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,300
that I've wanted to work for BFB all my life.

141
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,832
And now I have that chance.

142
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,724
Who would throw away the chance to work for the company he loves?

143
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,108
You think I'm lying, don't you?

144
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,370
That's okay.

145
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,492
I don't pass the probation. I get it.

146
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,560
No.

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,412
Actually, I believe every word you said.

148
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,616
Talay, I have a question.

149
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,044
You died before, didn't you?

150
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,310
Shit!

151
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,590
We have this restaurant in our universe too? I miss this place.

152
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,080
There you are.

153
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,930
Hello.

154
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,830
This is Puen.

155
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,880
Okay.

156
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,140
Actually, I'm only 16.

157
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,230
What?

158
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,200
I traveled here and woke up in a 40-year-old man's body who is a director.

159
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,900
I feel fainty every time I have to climb the stairs.

160
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,312
Let me take you to the Association of Universal Travellers of Thailand.

161
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:26,090
There's no certainty of when we will dream.

162
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,796
So please don't give up yet.

163
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:34,540
I believe you all will get to go home.

164
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,280
I do.

165
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,240
I'm here for you.

166
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,696
I hope you get to go home soon.

167
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,530
All these times, I'd thought you were a job quitter.

168
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,660
Now, I get everything.

169
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,810
I will talk to someone in BFB for you.

170
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,510
Really?

171
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,913
Thank you, big bro.

172
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:04,513

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,764
Multiverse is so damn chaotic.

342
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,210
Are you guys close?

343
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,010
That's right.

344
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,920
This is Tou from the editing team as well.

345
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,320
We joined around the same time.

346
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,400
Wait.

347
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,316
Are you Talay?

348
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,630
Yes.

349
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:53,977
Do you two know me?

350
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:55,550
Of course, we do.

351
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,572
The news about you and Puen dating is all over the place.

352
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,043
About that...

353
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,810
It's all good.

354
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,420
We kind of figured it out.

355
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,724
Puen is pretty obvious about it.

356
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,860
How?

357
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,460
A while ago, Puen came here asking for you every day.

358
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,960
Excuse me. Is there any employee named Talay here?

359
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,440
We could see it in his eyes he's so in love.

360
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,852
Tou, don't tease him.

361
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,000
It's okay, Talay.

362
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,300
We won't tell anyone.

363
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,432
You can trust us.

364
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:59,140
We get what you need to go through dating someone famous.

365
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,587
But hang in there. We're rooting for you, man.

366
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,140
Thank you.

367
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,880
Are you Talay?

368
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,860
May we get an interview?

369
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,100
- Please answer some questions.
- I...

370
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,870
Are you the guy in that picture with Puen?

371
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,968
Are you?

372
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,798
Is that right?

373
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:29,740
I am. The guy in that picture is me.

374
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,650
Did Puen really kiss you on the cheek?

375
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,430
He did.

376
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,778
Are they dating?

377
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:44,464
But it was just two old colleagues playing with each other.

378
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:51,270
I confirm here Puen and I...

379
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,360
are just two good friends.

380
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,380
Will you excuse me?

381
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,160
- Please wait a minute.
- Excuse me, Talay.

382
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,716
So he just made it clear they're only friends.

383
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,100
Why did you say that to the press?

384
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,508
Don't you love Puen anymore?

385
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,320
I love him. That's why I said it.

386
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,160
Would you let someone you love lose his job

387
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,710
because of you?

388
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,480
I get you. But what are you going to do now?

389
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,400
Nothing.

390
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,736
Going our separate ways is a good way out.

391
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,280
- Puen.
- Hold on, girl.

392
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,160
Puen is filming a show today.

393
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,820
No fans assembling here.

394
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,380
He will see you at the next open event. Okay?

395
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,000
But this is a present from me. Can you please accept it?

396
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,150
- But it's a private event...
- Prikyuak.

397
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,350
It's okay.

398
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,470
- Thank you.
- Thanks, honey.

399
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,924
Next time, come to an open event.

400
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:23,628
You must open it.

401
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,250
We have more fans waiting.

402
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,030
These kids. I told them it was a private event today and yet they came.

403
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,310
Ready, Puen?

404
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:38,750
The question is if you face the same situation as the guy in the movie,

405
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,110
what would you choose?

406
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,004
Work or love?

407
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,388
There you are.

408
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,736
Hey, I've got something to ask you.

409
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:16,330
Mountain and sea, what will you choose?

410
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:20,380
Sea, of course. My name answers it all.

411
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,820
What about white and pink?

412
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,299
No doubt. Pink.

413
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,060
Your smile is so sweet.

414
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,530
My turn to ask you.

415
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,230
Shoot.

416
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,930
Between work and love,

417
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,850
what will you choose?

418
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,420
Love, of course.

419
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,290
No.

420
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,290
I'm serious here.

421
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:04,192
Without your job, you won't have money.

422
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,580
Without money,

423
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,676
it's hard to take care of the one you love.

424
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,672
I'll let you answer again.

425
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,460
What will you choose?

426
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,610
For me, I choose...

427
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,448
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

428
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:29,120
Just a second, please.

429
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,620
Puen,

430
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,890
have you seen this?

431
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,693
He did kiss my cheek.

432
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:41,447
But it was just two old colleagues playing with each other.

433
00:32:42,531 --> 00:32:48,100
I confirm here that Puen and I

434
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,810
are just two good friends.

435
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,580
Puen,

436
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,980
seriously.

437
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,024
Are you and Talay a thing?

438
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,710
Not just a thing.

439
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,590
We're way more connected than that.

440
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,444
But you know well what showbiz is like, Puen.

441
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,640
I don't want to butt in.

442
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,180
But just forget about it.

443
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,940
Please.

444
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,624
It's good that you two are apart.

445
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,820
These are the presents from your fans.

446
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,740
Don't open them yet. Go to bed.

447
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,530
Take a good rest.

448
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,450
You will answer the press about Talay in the morning.

449
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:47,731
I'll handle the script.

450
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,620
Bye.

451
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,763
Hello, Puen. I'm Talay's friend.

452
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:56,255
He's with me right now.

453
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,490
I didn't want to say that.

454
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:05,284
I did it because I love him so much.

455
00:35:05,284 --> 00:35:08,356
I don't want his career to be ruined because of me.

456
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,320
But damn.

457
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,316
My heart is aching so damn much.

458
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,770
Did you hear that?

459
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,860
I just want you to know that my friend has always loved you.

460
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,590
I miss our time together.

461
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,900
Can we go back to that universe?

462
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,400
You're too drunk.

463
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,123
I'm ending it here, Puen. Bye.

464
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,810
Handle it well.

465
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:51,552
Follow the script the management team prepared for you.

466
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:54,572
Don't go off it. Got it?

467
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,360
Hey!

468
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:05,552
Hello, everyone.

469
00:36:05,552 --> 00:36:07,870
Hi.

470
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,164
I'm here to confirm that the man in the picture is me.

471
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:19,210
Talay said it was just two friends playing.

472
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,928
What would you say about this, Puen?

473
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,080
That's right. We were just playing.

474
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:37,436
But my feelings for him are real.

475
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:41,400
Whoa. So it's true?

476
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,810
So are you and Talay boyfriends?

477
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,840
- Are you?
- Is that right?

478
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,190
- How long have you been together?
- Please answer the question.

479
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,090
Not yet.

480
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:57,150
But he's the one I have good feelings for.

481
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,584
And I want to learn about him for as long as I can.

482
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,640
Someone asked me before

483
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,010
what I would choose between love and work.

484
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:17,370
Ask me countless times and my answer will be the same.

485
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,820
I choose love.

486
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,280
Without work, I can survive.

487
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,480
Without him, I can't.

488
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,500
What's that look on your face?

489
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,540
Puen told everyone about you. You should be happy.

490
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,310
I'm happy. I'm happy, of course.

491
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,730
But I'm afraid that his job has been impacted.

492
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,630
Especially now that his movie is airing.

493
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,290
Don't worry just yet.

494
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,280
Let me check the feedback on Twitter.

495
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,900
Shit!

496
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,563
My mom is messaging me.

497
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:20,723
Telling me to go home immediately. She needs to talk to me.

498
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,240
So she knows about this?

499
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,300
Will she say anything?

500
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,480
I've never told my family about this.

501
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,320
I'm sure it'll be fine. I'll go with you.

502
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,892
Puen is right there sitting on my friend's couch.

503
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:55,383
Gyo, calm down.

504
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,010
Puen, what are you doing here?

505
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,930
I told the press about you.

506
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,470
I'm here to take responsibility for my action.

507
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,212
Mom, I'm taking this chance to ask for your permission.

508
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,003
Wait.

509
00:39:12,003 --> 00:39:14,221
What are you asking?

510
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,476
Asking if I could...

511
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,652
take you out of town.

512
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,000
Can I, Mom?

513
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,450
Of course, you can.

514
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,440
You can take him out of town, out of the country, or out of the universe.

515
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,500
I don't mind.

516
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,120
Mom, aren't you worried about me at all?

517
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,332
How old are you, eight?

518
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,088
Your mom gave us permission.

519
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:45,610
You can't say no.

520
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:50,460
Someone like you would just drag me with you even though I said no.

521
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,670
Puen, you're welcome to eat here whenever you want.

522
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,200
Just let Talay know.

523
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,800
Thank you, Mom.

524
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,160
I guess I'll stop by to eat here quite often.

525
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,400
Sure.

526
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,320
Can I come, too?

527
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,980
I'm so overjoyed seeing these two together.

528
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,580
Girl.

529
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,600
What a shame I didn't prepare anything today.

530
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,304
You won't get to try my recipe today.

531
00:40:18,304 --> 00:40:22,570
Can I borrow your kitchen for a day then?

532
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,220
Yes.

533
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,720
And can I borrow Talay for a moment?

534
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,050
Take him.

535
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,152
What are you doing?

536
00:40:33,152 --> 00:40:34,970
Cook.

537
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,970
Let's go.

538
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,230
Your son is stubborn.

539
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,030
Go.

540
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,360
Cooking time.

541
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,344
What should we make here?

542
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,100
Talay,

543
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,780
do you want this?

544
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,756
Good idea. I want to eat Chef Puen's food.

545
00:41:14,447 --> 00:41:15,610
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

546
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,163
Here. Eat it now.

547
00:41:17,163 --> 00:41:19,359
It's still hot.

548
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,956
Here you go.

549
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,640
I'll eat now.

550
00:41:45,408 --> 00:41:47,108
Do you want some?

551
00:41:55,456 --> 00:41:57,456
With egg whites.

552
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,868
Full bite.

553
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,520
Is it good?

554
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,550
You helped me cook. That's why it's so good.

555
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,132
Phi Puen, can you feed Talay, please?

556
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,050
It's messy.

557
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,720
You're such a good cook, Phi Puen.

558
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,560
Your lover is so lucky to have you.

559
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,700
Just eat. Stop talking.

560
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,820
Finally, we get to see the same moon.

561
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,840
Yes.

562
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,060
I don't need to look at it and imagine your face anymore.

563
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,092
It's time to go home.

564
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,672
I don't want to leave you.

565
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:17,720
Don't be too clingy. We will meet again in just a few hours.

566
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,740
No. It's too many hours until we meet again.

567
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:44,460
When did you have it made?

568
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,960
I didn't.

569
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,534
I brought it between universes with me.

570
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,372
You totally fell for it.

571
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,220
But look.

572
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,739
- The sand doesn't go...
- Do you have any idea...

573
00:44:11,237 --> 00:44:14,911
how long I waited for you to travel back here?

574
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:22,356
I don't want time to go by without you from now on.

575
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,792
I want to stop time right here.

576
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:33,016
I want to stop our universal traveling.

577
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,080
Just like the sand in this hourglass.

578
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:45,840
♫ Oh, the time has stopped moving. This city is no longer lonely ♫

579
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,830
♫ Just today I have you ♫

580
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:55,160
♫ You are here, standing next to me ♫

581
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:01,150
♫ I never even dreamed that I would find you among ♫

582
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:09,530
♫ a million people in a city without having to search for someone else ♫

583
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:14,460
♫ when you possess me ♫

584
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,744
From this moment on, it's you and me.

585
00:45:25,744 --> 00:45:27,812
Talay and Puen.

586
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,220
You're such a baby.

587
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:38,790
♫ You are here, standing next to me ♫

588
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:44,890
♫ I never even dreamed that I would find you among ♫

589
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:52,900
♫ a million people in a city without having to search for someone else ♫

590
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:00,710
♫ I will hold you and never let you go ♫

591
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:04,100
♫ I will hold you and never let you go ♫

592
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:09,560
♫ Ever since you came into my heart ♫

593
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,990
♫ There's no need to search for anyone ♫

594
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:19,100
♫ when you own me ♫

595
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,168
I miss this place.

596
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:33,608
We are lucky to have it here in this universe, too.

597
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,644
Why did you want to come here?

598
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,944
Because it's the place I left you behind that day.

599
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:45,960
So today I brought you here to tell you

600
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,930
no matter what happens from now on,

601
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:53,356
I will never leave you again.

602
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:06,767
I kind of miss that universe.

603
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:11,204
I wonder how everyone is doing.

604
00:47:12,272 --> 00:47:15,912
Right. I miss it a lot.

605
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,184
I miss Dol,

606
00:47:19,184 --> 00:47:22,884
Up, Aou,

607
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,668
Kita, and Fuse.

608
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,328
I miss the association.

609
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,557
I miss this, too.

610
00:47:32,557 --> 00:47:37,180
The password to enter the association building. We needed to say it every time.

611
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,280
Right. I barely got some of them right.

612
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,610
Let's play the association password-guessing game.

613
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:48,976
I will start the first sentence and you finish it.

614
00:47:49,878 --> 00:47:52,044
Let's do it.

615
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,240
Keep looking at me like that...

616
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,640
And I'll kiss till you drop.

617
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,130
You're not a movie...

618
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,730
You are real.

619
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,230
Do you want to try?

620
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:07,230
Try to get to know each other.

621
00:48:08,357 --> 00:48:09,960
You don't have to like me very much.

622
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,660
Just keep...

623
00:48:12,647 --> 00:48:15,167
Just keep your heart open for me.

624
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,550
♫ There's only you here, I'm not going anywhere ♫

625
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:25,450
♫ With you right here by my side ♫

626
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,390
You said it all.

627
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:29,420
There's nothing left for me to say.

628
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,963
Just answer the last question.

629
00:48:30,963 --> 00:48:33,707
Yes or no?

630
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,780
No.

631
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:48,100
Because I opened my heart to you a long time ago, dumbass.

632
00:48:58,023 --> 00:49:00,430
So you're officially...

633
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:06,270
my boyfriend from this moment on, dummy.

634
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:07,970
Sure.

635
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:40,240
If our lives were like a movie, it would be our happy ending right here.

636
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,360
But we all know life always goes on.

637
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,190
This scene first.

638
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:48,363
Puen's life as an actor, for instance.

639
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:51,979
He's so in love, he can't even focus on this job.

640
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,000
Some nights, I dream about my friends in that universe.

641
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,420
I see Up and Aou become the most wanted screenwriters in my dream.

642
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,516
They're given many rewards.

643
00:50:06,516 --> 00:50:10,040
Kita becomes a sensational actor.

644
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,450
Always striking poses for people to take his photos.

645
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:16,720
Fuse is taking an acting class overseas.

646
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,145
Waiting to be a world-class actor.

647
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:19,600
Fighting!

648
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,963
Sometimes I dream about him coming back to Thailand.

649
00:50:22,963 --> 00:50:27,080
And he's always with Aou.

650
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,580
I'm wondering what's going on between these two.

651
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,160
Pong's bar becomes famous.

652
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,600
I guess it's because Kita, the hot actor, loves to come here.

653
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:43,370
And Tess and Pakorn join forces with Aou and Up to write film screenplays once again.

654
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,800
And the plot is so familiar.

655
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,880
Their film is called "Vice Versa".

656
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,780
I dream about those friends so often.

657
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,690
But what's weird is that I never dream of Phuwadol.

658
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,240
"Phuwadol"?

659
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,040
Sorry.

660
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:07,560
When Puen and I miss Up and Aou too much,

661
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,920
I'd take Puen to the office to see

662
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,280
this universe's version of Up and Aou.

663
00:51:15,056 --> 00:51:18,940
Puen's life and mine have changed dramatically since then.

664
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,920
Puen is leaning towards work behind the camera.

665
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,550
fAnd he decided to set up a screenwriting studio called "Friends Credits".

666
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,930
[Friend Credits]

667
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:34,910
Joobjang once told us we travel between universes to learn something.

668
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:38,600
For me, I learned about love.

669
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,780
I was someone who didn't believe in love.

670
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:44,380
I never even thought of having someone in life.

671
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,860
But then universal traveling brought Puen to me.

672
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:51,440
And he paints my life pink forever.

673
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,812
I think we're missing something.

674
00:51:54,832 --> 00:51:56,440
What?

675
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,772
A pink trumpet tree.

676
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,980
We aren't.

677
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,000
There.

678
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,020
A pink trumpet tree.

679
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,750
Damn.

680
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:14,584
This is a 25-meter-tall pink trumpet tree.

681
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,087
- What are you wishing for?
- Hey!

682
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,300
Don't be nosy.

683
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,892
I knew you'd read it!

684
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,780
Well, well.

685
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,032
Someone just fell for it.

686
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,008
The real wish is here.

687
00:52:43,937 --> 00:52:47,439
Here. I'll let you read it.

688
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,290
Ever since I saw you singing in Pong's bar,

689
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:58,628
I'd fallen head over heels in love with you.

690
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:07,280
Do you want to know the wish I want to write down the most now?

691
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,990
I do.

692
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,300
Puen!

693
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,300
What are you doing?

694
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,280
Tonight, let's go head over heels for each other!

695
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,900
This reminds me of that universe.

696
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,750
Same-sex marriage in Thailand is already approved.

697
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,940
It's also allowed in many countries in this universe.

698
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,020
Do you want to get married?

699
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,200
Here.

700
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:43,460
What?

701
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,008
Roses for my boyfriend.

702
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:54,160
Hey, where are you going boyfriend?

703
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,860
Wait up.

704
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,200
Eating all alone here.

705
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,364
I miss that universe.

706
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:21,490
Though both universes have many differences,

707
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,480
there's one thing we have just the same.

708
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,660
What?

709
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,920
These.

710
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,200
Taste exactly the same as that.

711
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,396
Snacks can't entice me.

712
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,620
The sunset here is just as beautiful as it is in the other universe.

713
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,644
And we're always together in both places.

714
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,440
Can I have that flavor?

715
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,300
Can I have this Lay, too?

716
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,760
Are you crazy?

717
00:56:54,707 --> 00:56:56,240
What are you doing?

718
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,320
Asking you to marry me...

719
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,808
in our universe.

720
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:06,895
What are you saying? It's cheesy.

721
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,540
Will you take it?

722
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,868
So it's a yes?

723
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,120
Yes.

724
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:50,710
