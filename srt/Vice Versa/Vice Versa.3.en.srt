1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,290
You're not Tun, are you?

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,460
You know. I'm like you.

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,290
I died and traveled between universes, too.

4
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,943
Are you sure your system works?

5
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:09,768
I don't feel like we match at all.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,510
I don't think it works.

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,000
The rule sounds too much like fantasy.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,711
We traveled between universes. Isn't that a fantasy at all?

9
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:22,430
Congratulations!

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,808
Okay.

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,408
Bye.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,820
Som and Prae called.

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,420
They matched each other, didn't they?

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,970
Yes. They talked and felt like they clicked.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,580
And don't you two click at all?

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,130
"Click" isn't the right word right now.

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,267
"Kick" sounds more like it.

18
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,220
I just want to kick his ass.

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,080
Well, well. Mr. Nice Guy.

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,532
I don't want to kick you at all.

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,300
What should we do now?

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,540
Does it mean the matching system isn't reliable?

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,040
Calm down.

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,220
The matching system was only built to help us find probability.

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,242
Nothing is guaranteed.

26
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,084
Honestly, it's like finding a soulmate.

27
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:26,710
We must keep searching and searching

28
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,560
until we find the one, right?

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,224
The best advice I have for you right now is...

31
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:38,020
follow your heart.

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,763
I'm starting to lose hope of ever finding the portkey.

33
00:01:57,763 --> 00:01:59,660
Why?

34
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,940
Think about it.

35
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,280
It's extremely difficult to match someone.

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,720
And we don't know if that's the right one until we dream.

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,593
So many conditions that I'm discouraged.

38
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:10,510
Can I just not go back?

39
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,416
Relax.

40
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,460
Just do what Dol said.

41
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,624
Follow your heart.

42
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,890
Easier said than done.

43
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,100
What is "follow your heart" anyway?

44
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,600
It's like...

45
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,290
live your life to the fullest in the meantime.

46
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,108
When it comes, it comes.

47
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:37,037
Why do I feel like you're letting it go?

48
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:41,227
There's no point to get obsessed.

49
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:46,128
I should focus on studying and helping you with the movie.

50
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:48,596
But I will keep on looking.

51
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:54,380
Don't tell me after spending time together,

52
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,508
we turn out to be each other's portkey.

53
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,890
That's not a problem.

54
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,390
If it's you, I'm okay.

55
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,300
I'm okay, too.

56
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,180
Then... let's live the best life we can in this universe.

57
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,290
Deal.

61
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,940
I've arrived.

62
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,470
You bastard. You took forever.

63
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,780
Sorry. I got up late.

64
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,560
Don't tell me you just left your house when I called.

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,090
No. I just woke up when you called.

66
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,120
Asshole. You're allowed to lie sometimes.

67
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,280
What do you want my help with today?

68
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,940
Help me find the location.

69
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,810
I'm searching for the regular café where the main characters hang out.

70
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,510
I want to see several places.

71
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,563
Hop on. We're late.

72
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,360
You're late. Not me.

73
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,293
We're both late. Come on.

74
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,616
You can wear it on the bike.

75
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,721
So slow. I'm leaving.

76
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:46,960
Hey! Wait up.

77
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,820
Ready.

78
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:01,020
I don't like pink.

79
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,968
You should look at the pants you're wearing today.

80
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,936
These are Tess's. Not mine.

81
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,670
Will it be good?

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,940
Come on. Don't judge the book by its cover.

83
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,640
Try it first.

84
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,160
Here.

85
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,990
What?

86
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,090
No.

87
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,812
Open your mouth willingly or I'll make you open it?

88
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,560
Quickly.

89
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:46,450
Wow! The strawberries are rich.

90
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,150
I want more.

91
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,852
Do you think this place is nice?

92
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,704
Good enough to be the characters' favorite café?

93
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,750
Actually, it is okay.

94
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,170
It just doesn't really wow me.

95
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,700
You can take photos just in case.

96
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,400
Yeah.

97
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,231
Hey! What are you doing?

98
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,831
No.

99
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,040
What?

100
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,850
I'm just taking photos. What's the big deal?

101
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,370
I'm tired of striking a pose.

102
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,960
When I was modeling, I took photos all day long it was exhausting.

103
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,330
So you're an actor and a model.

104
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,500
I just narrowed down the scope of who you are.

105
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,588
Most actors started out as models.

106
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:03,450
Now that we're talking about this,

107
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,364
can I guess what you look like?

108
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,870
Go ahead.

109
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,808
Draw me if you're good enough.

110
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,136
I think... you're mixed race.

111
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,410
Wrong.

112
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,550
A little snub-nosed?

113
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,550
Wrong again.

114
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,193
Eyebrows?

115
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:36,793
Thick.

116
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,860
- Straight hair?
- I've had so many hairstyles.

117
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,273
Your natural hair.

118
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:45,159
Were you born with straight hair?

119
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,570
Yeah.

120
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,370
So I am right.

121
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,024
You should look something like this.

122
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,130
Wait a minute.

123
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,360
Are you trying to bug me?

124
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,823
No. I'm serious.

125
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:13,723
Serious?

126
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,193
This is cute.

127
00:09:16,193 --> 00:09:18,519
Cute, my foot.

128
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,556
It's hideous.

129
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,290
It looks like you.

130
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,715
Hold on. Aou is calling.

131
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:34,939
Hey. What's up?

132
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,523
Script meeting?

133
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:42,270
Okay. I'll be right there.

134
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,180
I forgot I had a meeting.

135
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,240
Let's go.

136
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,088
Wait. Why do I need to go?

137
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,340
You're in charge of this project.

138
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,673
Besides, you know I'm not good at screenwriting.

139
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:57,890
It's for the best if you come.

140
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,463
- What?
- Come on.

141
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,530
Quickly.

142
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,800
The bread.

143
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,146
Leave it. Let's go.

144
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,280
We have two opinions here.

145
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,650
Tun and I think we should have a happy ending.

146
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,130
You and Tess want a sad ending.

147
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,830
What now?

148
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,520
Why do you want a sad ending, Tess?

149
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,880
Right.

150
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,640
I'm not into love.

151
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,080
Come on.

152
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,820
This movie is made for people to be into it.

153
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,360
Not for you.

154
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,240
Let's Rock Paper Scissors. Get it over with.

155
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,120
No way. That's too sloppy.

156
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,310
How about this?

157
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,320
We meet halfway.

158
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,840
They part for so long and meet once again.

159
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,110
What do you think?

160
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,190
Is that happy or unhappy?

161
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,870
Open ending.

162
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,760
Tess, I like that ending.

163
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,813
I'll go with it. Let's do it.

164
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:03,290
Our job is done. Relieved.

165
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,890
I'll go pee now.

166
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,740
I'm coming, too.

167
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,140
Sure.

168
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,990
I just talked to my dad.

169
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,600
This Friday, we'll present him with the film treatment.

170
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,000
Awesome.

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,755
Go home and handle our own section of the presentation.

172
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:21,277
Huh? What presentation?

173
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:22,770
Why are you confused?

174
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,400
Our responsibility.

175
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,120
You normally take care of the synopsis and tagline.

176
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,330
Then you collect files from us and put together a presentation.

177
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,720
But I'm not...

178
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,020
You're not what?

179
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,010
He's not feeling well.

180
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,010
Right, Tun?

181
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,820
Yes.

182
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,764
I'm having the flu.

183
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,370
He's burning up.

184
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,790
Tun, you're a workaholic.

185
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,040
There was one time you had a 39°C fever.

186
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,600
But we were still working like it was nothing.

187
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,500
You're right.

188
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,520
Fine. I'll do it.

189
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,560
See?

190
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,180
I knew someone like you would never ditch work.

191
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,780
Right?

192
00:12:13,997 --> 00:12:16,060
Do you even know how to create a tagline?

193
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,690
Of course.

194
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,290
Of course not!

195
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,280
I don't even know what a tagline is.

196
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,570
What?

197
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,627
It's a caption.

198
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:28,000
A short sentence that makes movies more appealing.

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,348
I can't even rhyme words in poems, let alone the tagline.

200
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:35,667
Can you even handle this?

201
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,056
Let me help.

202
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,843
I can. I will come up with something eventually.

203
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,580
[5 days later]

204
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,660
He hasn't arrived yet?

205
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,120
Am I a joke to you, Tess?

206
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,428
No, Dad.

207
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,240
Has he picked up yet?

208
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,479
No.

209
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:59,411
I called his mom. She said she had no idea.

210
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,920
Hey!

211
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,820
He's calling!

212
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,620
Hello, Tun. Where are you?

213
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:19,093
Huh? Police station?

214
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:23,248
Your friend was arrested for drunk driving at the checkpoint.

215
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:25,652
So I brought him here.

216
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,873
Hey!

217
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:33,439
You're here to pick me up, T.L.?

218
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:36,890
I think it stands for Talay. My name is Talay.

219
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,300
No. Not Talay.

220
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,570
T.L. is Teelak (darling).

221
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,316
You came for me, darling?

222
00:13:48,677 --> 00:13:51,120
I'm sorry. My friend is drunk.

223
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,184
May you excuse me?

224
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,970
Tun.

225
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,630
This is not funny.

226
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,500
Not trying to be.

227
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,940
Pull yourself together.

228
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,480
Tess,

229
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,610
your dad canceled the presentation.

230
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,750
He's angry that we didn't come prepared.

231
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,350
Shit.

232
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,880
What should we do?

233
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,090
What the hell are you doing, Tun?

234
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,140
We've worked so hard.

235
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,720
You decided to ruin it on the presentation day?

236
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,279
Hey, I didn't mean to.

237
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,632
Who would know this guy is such a lightweight?

238
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,303
What the heck are you talking about?

239
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:46,860
Never mind.

240
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,687
Hey, guys.

241
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,640
Look on the bright side.

242
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,583
We have more time to prepare the new presentation. Right?

243
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,310
And... Tess will talk to his dad for us.

244
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,720
Where is your work file?

245
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,520
Work file?

246
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,520
Ah! In my thumb drive.

247
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,064
I have it with me. Let me find it.

248
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,080
It's gone.

249
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,150
Tun, I have a serious question.

250
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,610
The promise we made,

251
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,310
did you forget all about it?

252
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,480
Huh?

253
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,780
What promise are you talking about?

254
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,228
You're not the same Tun I used to know.

255
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,400
Hey! Where are you guys going?

256
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,243
It's only a missing thumb drive.

257
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:15,727
I'll buy you a new one.

258
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:17,710
Why are they frustrated?

259
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,710
Right, darling?

260
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,280
This universe is so damn cool.

261
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,330
They even have crispy pork on sticks.

262
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,980
Freakin' yummy.

263
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,580
Want some?

264
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,664
Tun, it's not funny.

265
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,573
What's wrong? What's bothering you?

266
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,840
Nothing is.

267
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,540
I'm just living my life to the fullest as you suggested.

268
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,040
What?

269
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,230
When I was an actor, I barely had time for myself.

270
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,700
Now that I'm here, I get enough sleep.

271
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,970
I eat anything I want.

272
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,964
I can go out and get drunk all I want.

273
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,580
Tun,

274
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:07,528
what I meant was to live the life of the body owner to the fullest.

275
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,384
Not spoiling yourself like this.

276
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,300
- Yeah?
- Hell yeah.

277
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,992
Phuwadol warned you.

278
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,680
We're in their bodies. We should live their lives wisely.

279
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,384
Will you not be sad if Pakorn ruins yours?

280
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,410
That's true.

281
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,280
I didn't realize that.

282
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:45,320
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,912
Don't apologize to me.

284
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:51,644
The ones you should say sorry to are Up and Aou.

285
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,732
[Aou]

286
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,876
Here you are.

287
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,170
I started working hard on this screenplay in grade 12.

288
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,776
A year has passed and it was done.

289
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,360
I decided to offer it to 26 Pictures.

290
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,828
I was damn nervous.

291
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,120
Aou!

292
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,130
Pakorn.

293
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,490
You're here for the screenplay pitch, too?

294
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,473
Yes. I've been working on it since high school.

295
00:19:23,473 --> 00:19:24,912
Shit!

296
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:26,648
- I came to sell mine, too.
- Seriously?

297
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:28,555
What a coincidence!

298
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,004
Not just the two of us.

299
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,280
Hello.

300
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,550
Up!

301
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,320
You're here, too?

302
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,106
Why didn't you tell me about this?

303
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:41,040
You never asked.

304
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,240
Guys.

305
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,730
If you want to sell a comedy, I'm right here.

306
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,644
Because mine is hilarious.

307
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:50,000
Stop right there. You make me want to spit.

308
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,193
Social satire is a hit in this era.

309
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:54,480
Comedy isn't going to sell. Trust me.

310
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,205
Social satire is too serious.

311
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:57,796
What works is romantic movies.

312
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,830
Yuck!

313
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,610
- Hello.
- You're still here?

314
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,305
About the screenplay, right? Let me discuss this with my team.

315
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:11,268
If we like it, we will reach out. Okay?

316
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:16,460
Hey, let's go for a coffee. Urgent meeting coming up.

317
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,770
What? They're gone?

318
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,320
Hey.

319
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,700
Those first-year students selling their screenplays were so unqualified.

320
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,690
Exactly.

321
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,240
I almost fell asleep listening to their screenplay pitch.

322
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,365
Seriously, it's like herding behavior.

323
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:54,717
Offering their scripts to directors so that they can brag about it with friends.

324
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:58,600
See this. The comedy play by Up-Pree.

325
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,374
It's not even funny. Such a sloppy job he did.

326
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:04,460
Hey! Why do you still keep a screenplay like this?

327
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,693
Throw it away.

328
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:07,687
I will when I go to the toilet.

329
00:21:08,777 --> 00:21:10,560
Why wait until then?

330
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,080
That's a trash bin.

331
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,700
Come here.

332
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,590
But before we dump it, let's give them blessings.

333
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,950
Agree.

334
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,990
To the dream of the first-year students.

335
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,045
- Yuck!
- Yuck!

336
00:21:24,045 --> 00:21:25,980
What the heck are you doing?

337
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,937
- You can say my work is crappy all you want.
- Easy, bro.

338
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:30,540
But you can't say my friend's work is sloppy.

339
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,810
He stayed up all night writing this to sell to you.

340
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,040
He didn't pull an all-nighter just to hear your shitty criticism.

341
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,785
- Calm down.
- Apologize to his work.

342
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:41,340
Do it!

343
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,520
Go away! You guys have no future here!

344
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,444
You will regret this!

345
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,910
I'm mad he bad-mouthed us.

346
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,790
But I think our scripts aren't good yet.

347
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,400
Take Aou's for example.

348
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,730
His prologue lasts forever before he tells the core story.

349
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,990
But you tell it too early, Up.

350
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,010
It's like you force the comedy too much.

351
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,510
Your comedy is okay.

352
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:26,110
But the characters' backgrounds are too weak. Too light.

353
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,020
Your characters' backgrounds are so strong.

354
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,120
But there are so many loopholes in your script.

355
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,800
Shit!

356
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,270
Why didn't I do this from the beginning?

357
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:39,880
We have our own strengths.

358
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,170
You have your strength. I have mine.

359
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,200
We can help seal each other's leakage.

360
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,116
What if we write screenplays together?

361
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:52,460
How great will it be?

362
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,860
Dang! He's right.

363
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,130
We've had classes together for the whole semester. Why couldn't I think of it?

364
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,340
We will join forces.

365
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,100
Write our best script.

366
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,187
And sell it to all film companies.

367
00:23:05,187 --> 00:23:08,240
26 Pictures will be so jealous.

368
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,020
I think the opposite.

369
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,670
We will write it and sell it to 26 Pictures.

370
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,200
They will regret saying no to us today.

371
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,805
Right!

372
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,183
Cheers!

373
00:23:23,183 --> 00:23:25,567
It's just water, but cheers!

374
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,860
Hey.

375
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,660
You're here?

376
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,040
Found it.

377
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,900
Can you guide me through the presentation making?

378
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,760
Sure.

379
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,848
Are you... okay?

380
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,120
Yes. I'm okay.

381
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,790
Don't lie to me. I can tell.

382
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,220
You're normally more upbeat.

383
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,770
Yeah.

384
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,036
Just take a look at the files.

385
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,890
Not right now.

386
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,432
Can you take me to a place first?

387
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,380
Why did you ask me to bring you here?

388
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,400
Because you frown so much.

389
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,884
I thought a cool breeze at the riverside should help.

390
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,850
It's okay. Just get to work.

391
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,740
There.

392
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,800
You do have something on your mind.

393
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,804
I'm going to make you smile.

394
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,680
What are you doing?

395
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,260
I'm not ticklish.

396
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,800
What?

397
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,384
How about this?

398
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,180
It kind of worked.

399
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,496
I laughed because you tried so hard to make me laugh.

400
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,372
At least your mood is lifted.

401
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:39,724
Will you tell me now what's bothering you?

402
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,360
It's about Up and Aou.

403
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,700
They don't pick up my calls.

404
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,960
They don't respond to my messages.

405
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,080
I don't know what to do.

406
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,220
I feel sorry for what I did to them.

407
00:26:06,193 --> 00:26:09,480
I can't talk to them for you,

408
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,850
but I have some advice.

409
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,350
What?

410
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,392
Sincerely apologize for everything.

411
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,024
Say goodbye to the misbehaving Tun...

412
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,984
and start over.

413
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Don't get stressed out.

414
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,370
Dang it!

415
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,390
The synopsis isn't easy to do.

416
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,980
It goes to 10 pages no matter how I summarize it.

417
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,644
Tun could've done it in one page.

418
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,400
Stop talking about him.

419
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,484
The old Tun has died.

420
00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:36,291
Guys, I know I was a real asshole.

421
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,510
But can you give me a chance to make it right?

422
00:28:09,712 --> 00:28:12,632
Hey, guys.

423
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,400
All the files are in here.

424
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,670
We'll make 26 Pictures say sorry

425
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,670
for bad-mouthing us.

426
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,740
Let's go eat.

427
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,328
You're paying!

428
00:29:53,248 --> 00:29:56,720
Hello. Where are you?

429
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,010
Don't tell me you just woke up.

430
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,810
I'm right here.

431
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:17,140
Gosh! What an unusual day.

432
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,380
You're early.

433
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,270
I told you I'd better myself.

434
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,580
Back then when I was an actor, I was always early.

435
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,140
You asked me to meet you here. Why?

436
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,780
I just finished the synopsis for the presentation.

437
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,380
I need your help looking at it.

438
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,337
I'm not an expert in romance.

439
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:43,600
Use your dating experiences.

440
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,780
Haven't you been in a relationship before?

441
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,330
Never.

442
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,400
Have you?

443
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,310
Never either.

444
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,796
I'm single by choice.

445
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:14,268
Have you ever imagined the day you were in love by choice?

446
00:31:19,972 --> 00:31:23,872
I have. A long time ago.

447
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:26,716
Think about it.

448
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:29,020
Life is full of intense situations.

449
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,495
We need to work to follow our dreams.

450
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:35,704
They consume all my energy.

451
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,900
You and I are so bad when it comes to love.

452
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:51,124
Will we be able to make a romantic movie?

453
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,040
Is it necessary?

454
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,600
Of course.

455
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,684
You have to know what people in love do each day.

456
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:14,536
Study from that couple.

457
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,140
Are you out of your mind?

458
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,120
Don't interfere with other people's business.

459
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,288
Besides, how do you know they're a couple?

460
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,120
They definitely are.

461
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,020
I don't think they are.

462
00:32:28,807 --> 00:32:30,110
Wanna bet?

463
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,240
I think they're in a relationship.

464
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,870
The winner can make the loser do anything.

465
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,570
No.

466
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,012
To find out, we must follow them.

467
00:32:46,012 --> 00:32:48,395
Come on. They're gone.

468
00:32:50,624 --> 00:32:54,520
You asked me to help with work. You haven't started working.

469
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,243
We have. That's our work.

470
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:04,980
Look. The smiles they're exchanging.

471
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,930
So sweet.

472
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,600
Of course, they're dating.

473
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,020
No freaking way.

474
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,460
Look at his outfit.

475
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,030
He's too chilled.

476
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,180
They're definitely not dating.

477
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,270
Come on. The girl is wearing pretty makeup.

478
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,060
They're surely on a date.

479
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,380
There! That's it.

480
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,420
They are a couple. The guy is paying.

481
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,656
He might advance it and the girl pays him back later.

482
00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:38,844
Modern age.

483
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,840
They're moving. Let's go.

484
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,200
- Follow them?
- Yes.

485
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:03,360
See? They're not holding hands.

486
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,752
They aren't a couple.

487
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,744
Lots of couples don't hold hands.

488
00:34:09,744 --> 00:34:13,070
Wait. How do you know?

489
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,330
You said you'd never been in a relationship.

490
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,576
I observed people around me.

491
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,450
What now?

492
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,631
Do you need to ask? Buy the tickets and follow them inside.

493
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:06,296
They're eating from the same bucket. They're a couple for sure.

494
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,280
Friends can share that.

495
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,928
You and I are eating from the same bucket, too.

496
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,600
Just friends?

497
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,840
We might be boyfriends.

498
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,650
Boyfriends, my ass!

499
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,550
Shut up and eat.

500
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,080
Holy shit!

501
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,080
He kissed her cheek.

502
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,710
Is it clear now? I won.

503
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,241
We got the answer. Let's get back to work.

504
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:54,670
Wait.

505
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,910
Sit back down.

506
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,810
We paid for the tickets after all.

507
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,228
Finish the movie first.

508
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,360
Sleepy?

509
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,390
Who's sleepy?

510
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,990
No.

511
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,435
The movie has ended?

512
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,643
How could you sleep through it? The movie was superb.

513
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:54,420
I told you I'm not into love.

514
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,440
The scene where the male lead confessed to the female lead was fantastic.

515
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,513
Really? What did he say?

516
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:17,177
"From the moment we met,

517
00:37:17,177 --> 00:37:21,144
I've been falling head over heels in love with you."

518
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:37,039
What are you doing?

519
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,860
You asked me what he said.

520
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,240
I'm just repeating it.

521
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,508
You don't need to poke your face so close.

522
00:38:04,845 --> 00:38:06,270
Crap!

523
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,690
It's 8:00 already.

524
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,280
Let's get back to work.

525
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,560
I'm hungry. Let's go eat first.

526
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,652
Why do I have to go?

527
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,090
Have you forgotten?

528
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:26,428
I won the bet. Those two were together.

529
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,040
I'm using the winner's privilege to make you have dinner with me.

530
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,420
Thank you.

531
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:50,432
Wow! I didn't think this fried chicken existed here.

532
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,510
Right.

533
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:57,060
I thought they had a different name and I couldn't find it.

534
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,850
Lucky us.

535
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,088
Look at you. You want it, too. Right?

536
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:16,750
If I ask to get one piece of it, will you say I'm spoiling myself?

537
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,970
Come on. Just eat.

538
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,240
I'll even let you pick.

539
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,640
You want a drumstick or a wing?

540
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,680
Tick tock. Tick tock.

541
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,500
They are hot.

542
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,160
The drumstick.

543
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
There you go.

544
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:41,212
They say people who love to eat drumsticks are smart but lazy.

545
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,304
What about those who eat wings?

546
00:39:45,304 --> 00:39:50,040
Enthusiastic and determined.

547
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,064
"They" is you, isn't it?

548
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,716
I read it somewhere.

549
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,910
Can I have the wing then?

550
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,620
I want to be a determined guy.

551
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,420
Nope.

552
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,230
I'm the determined one.

553
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:13,372
We both want to be determined. I guess we need to share the wing.

554
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,130
What?

555
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,680
Fine. Let me find a new wing.

556
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,480
Come on.

557
00:40:28,448 --> 00:40:30,090
Here.

558
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,990
Eat this.

559
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,220
Hey! Feed me.

560
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,920
Here. I love this.

561
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,883
- No.
- I want it.

562
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,728
You want some lotus, brothers?

563
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,270
No. I'm not worshiping Buddha images tonight.

564
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,330
What are you talking about?

565
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:12,280
These are for your lover.

566
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,390
No way. You're lying.

567
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,544
I'm not buying those.

568
00:41:25,577 --> 00:41:30,030
You're making him sad. Why didn't you buy some?

569
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,080
Why didn't you?

570
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,456
I'm eating.

571
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:35,580
Would you like some lotus for your girlfriend?

572
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,230
20 baht each.

573
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,010
Shit!

574
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,580
They give lotus instead of roses in this universe.

575
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,480
Unbelievable.

576
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,880
The whole day with you, no work has been done.

577
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,932
What a waste of time.

578
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:01,268
Who told you? I've got so much work done.

579
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,904
[Lovers eating together]
[Long-distance relationship?]

580
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:18,560
[Two people who love each other have to part]
[Single by choice]

581
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,760
[Follow a couple into a cinema]
[Head over heels...]

582
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,600
Stunned, huh?

583
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,444
When I get serious, my work gets done.

584
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,480
Good.

585
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,092
Go back and finish it.

586
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,310
No.

587
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,420
There's still a lot you need to look at.

588
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,290
I think I'll finish it tonight.

589
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,890
And?

590
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,540
I'm going to work at your place tonight.

591
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,368
Chop-chop. It's going to be a long night.

592
00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:09,240
Come.

593
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,756
Don't be stunned. Move.

594
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,510
What if I play with words like this?

595
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,677
"A romantic film about people who are single by choice

596
00:43:23,677 --> 00:43:27,690
and the mysterious challenge that tests the depths of love."

597
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,540
Damn!

598
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,240
I like it.

599
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,600
You borrowed the words I said.

600
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,980
Of course.

601
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,070
I'm so lucky to have you.

602
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,870
Thank you.

603
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,350
You're done. Go home.

604
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,880
I'll take a shower and go to bed.

605
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,328
I'm not done. I still need to do the presentation.

606
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:58,020
I'd like you to look at the layout.

607
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,160
Do it then.

608
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,180
I'll go take a shower.

609
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,060
Okay.

610
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,160
Talay.

611
00:44:36,997 --> 00:44:38,697
Talay.

612
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:51,230
What the heck?

613
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,000
Why are you in here?

614
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,107
I called you a million times.

615
00:44:55,107 --> 00:44:57,050
You came in here just to sleep.

616
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,428
The work is all done.

617
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:03,240
Then go home. What are you still here for?

618
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,940
It's too late to go home.

619
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:09,430
I'll take a bath and crash here tonight.

620
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:13,440
Wait until I'm finished.

621
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,140
No.

622
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,200
Close your eyes.

623
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,692
I said close your eyes.

624
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,210
Why are you backing up? Don't tell me you are shy?

625
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,332
I'm not.

626
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,340
I just like taking baths alone.

627
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,048
Don't you know? Privacy.

628
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:04,080
I think you must forget all about privacy for now.

629
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,528
And seek togetherness.

630
00:46:06,528 --> 00:46:10,028
You might be able to write a better romantic film script.

631
00:46:10,028 --> 00:46:13,290
That's a screenwriter's job.

632
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,168
Not mine.

633
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,760
You're right.

634
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,540
Move.

635
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,200
Your bathtub is huge.

636
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,724
No wonder you fell asleep.

637
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,560
What are you doing?

638
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,260
Are you getting back at me?

639
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,264
I was just going to clean your face.

640
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:19,287
Why? I'm not wearing any makeup.

641
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,776
I'm wiping away the dust. To deeply clean your face.

642
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:30,688
This universe is as dusty as the other universe.

643
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,630
Why are you looking at me?

644
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,330
What do you want?

645
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,110
Give me a cotton pad. I'll clean yours.

646
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:59,028
I already cleaned it. Look.

647
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,956
Just give it.

648
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,292
If this can be used to wipe away dust, I should use it with your heart.

649
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:41,070
I think your heart hasn't been used in a long time.

650
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,970
It must be really dusty.

651
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,536
Now that it's clean,

652
00:49:20,287 --> 00:49:25,771
I hope you can now put your heart into romantic movies, Talay.

653
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:38,280
After that, the male lead and the female lead see each other again

654
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,020
in the coffee shop where they met for the first time.

655
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,415
And they exchange smiles.

656
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,856
It's an open ending, Dad.

657
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,960
All right.

658
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,084
I will take it into consideration.

659
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,628
I'll have someone reach out later.

660
00:50:09,977 --> 00:50:12,620
The middle is a little prolonged.

661
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,640
And there are many loopholes.

662
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:22,090
But I like the idea of the movie. It's fresh and honest.

663
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,856
Go back and improve the script.

664
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:32,740
Once it is better, prepare for the casting.

665
00:50:33,824 --> 00:50:35,876
Thank you, Dad.

666
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,920
Thank you so much.

667
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,492
Guys!

668
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,420
The script is approved!

669
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,168
I've stopped for a while. When are you going to get off?

670
00:51:17,168 --> 00:51:19,332
Let me store my things first.

671
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:22,090
Done!

672
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,430
Thank you.

673
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,432
I should be thanking you.

674
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:31,932
For what?

675
00:51:33,155 --> 00:51:35,600
For everything.

676
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,208
All the insanity that happened,

677
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,944
I'm so lucky to have you.

678
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:52,168
I am also glad I have you.

679
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:59,216
But now I can't take this helmet off.

680
00:52:01,457 --> 00:52:03,157
Do it for me.

681
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,200
No.

682
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:12,090
You will get stuck with it all night. Because I glued it.

683
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,903
Bastard!

684
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:17,310
You just love to get on my nerves.

685
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:20,060
Go up to your room wearing it.

686
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:25,820
Okay.

687
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,652
Safe ride home.

688
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,500
Bye.

689
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,370
Talay.

690
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,580
What?

691
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,250
I promise I will put my best effort into writing this movie's script.

692
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,324
Like we said.

693
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:53,920
And I'll live Tun's life to the fullest.

694
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,080
To the best.

695
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,780
With you.

696
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:08,990
Deal.

697
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,200
Your thumb, too.

698
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,260
Bye now.

699
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,908
See you.

700
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,330
See you.

701
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:20,052
[The one wearing this is cute.]

702
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,504
You're not the only one who does things secretly.

703
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,640
I've stopped for a while. When are you going to get off?

704
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,804
Let me store my things first.

705
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,460
[You're really great.]

706
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:33,150
The one who got the bouquet, are you already taken?

707
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,001
[Talay]

708
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:36,440
Actually, I'm hitting on someone.

709
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,320
But he's playing hard to get.

710
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,760
What the hell are you doing, Tun?

711
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,860
What if in order to go back, you must love someone?

712
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:45,980
What will you do?

713
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,400
Well, it depends on who that person is.

714
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,320
What if it's me?

715
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:59,140
♫ Is it you? That will change this world ♫

716
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:04,210
♫ Is it you? The person I've been searching a long time for ♫

717
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,890
♫ Have I found, Have I found ♫

718
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:14,380
♫ Someone who will be ready to walk through this side by side with me from now on ♫

719
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:19,600
♫ Is it you? That won't let me be sad ♫

720
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:25,700
♫ After a night of nightmares, making every tomorrow look bright ♫

721
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:32,290
♫ Forever, please tell me to be confident ♫

722
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:36,690
♫ That you won't go and leave me ♫
