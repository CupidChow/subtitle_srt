1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,790
Joob suddenly passed.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,920
Joob always said nothing in life was certain.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,210
Whatever I want to do, do it now.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,100
But now there's one thing I want to do the most.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,180
Can I hug you to sleep all night tonight?

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,870
Good night.

7
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,120
Guys, my condolences for Joob's passing.

8
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,814
You guys seemed so close.

9
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:08,120
Actually, you don't need to come to the meeting.

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,500
You guys can take a break.

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,190
That's all right. We're okay.

12
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,090
Are you sure?

13
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,900
Who's that?

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,920
I got you guys someone to help write the screenplay.

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,750
Someone with new perspectives.

16
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,871
It should help.

17
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:26,291
I'll get the door.

18
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,000
Guys, this is Pang, my older friend.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,760
She's a yoga instructor and an acting coach.

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,230
Hello, beautiful.

21
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,541
Hi, everyone.

22
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:56,061
Pang is going to help us with the screenplay.

23
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,670

24

25
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,260
[Episode 7 - Sunset Orange]

26
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,760
Let's start from mine.

27
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,700
The story of a group of four friends. They go to a bachelor party.

28
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,520
The story of a group of four friends. They go to a bachelor party.

29
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,200
They get wasted and lose the groom-to-be.

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,540
The rest of them must find where the groom is.

31
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,980
Hold on. That's a romantic movie?

32
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,630
It's a comedy.

33
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,060
Here. Listen to mine.

34
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,280
I want to make an indie movie. Don't follow any movie rules.

35
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,152
It's about the day before the apocalypse.

36
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:35,829
The male lead breaks up with the female lead the day before the apocalypse.

37
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,400
He tells her they should separate

38
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
and do whatever they want before they die.

39
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,080
So deep.

40
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,250
My turn now.

41
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,340
It's about a guy who falls in love with a girl, but he is sent to work on the moon.

42
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,440
So it's love between two planets.

43
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,012
They get to video call only once a month.

44
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:02,640
Clearly. Exactly like the last movie we made.

45
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:05,450
What are we going to do?

46
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,100
A comedy.

47
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,540
Make the audience laugh along with the characters' love.

48
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,500
Love isn't something funny.

49
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,660
And I would hate to see people laugh at my love story.

50
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,928
How about a romantic-not-comedy movie?

51
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,640
Up's sense of humor,

52
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,110
Aou's outside-the-box thinking,

53
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,680
Tun's romance, and Talay's seriousness mixed together.

54
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,584
They create a romantic-but-not-comedy movie.

55
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,050
The love story that seems funny, but is actually not.

56
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,470
Yes! This is cool.

57
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,930
Let's go with this concept.

58
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,584
"Romantic Not Comedy"

59
00:04:59,984 --> 00:05:02,312
Hey! Come on.

60
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,036
Friend Credits.

61
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,004
Why did you include Pang without consulting me?

62
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:40,484
I think our script should be more mellow if there's a girl on the team.

63
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,110
That's really it?

64
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,900
The truth is...

65
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,652
I'm afraid you'll die.

66
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,370
Anything that helps you go back as soon as possible,

67
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,330
I'll do it.

68
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,952
What do you mean?

69
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:31,348
Well, you said Pang is special to you.

70
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,432
I think she might be your portkey.

71
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,031
And you? Aren't you going back, too?

72
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:51,006
I will keep looking for my portkey.

73
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,500
Hasn't it ever occurred to you that I'm your portkey?

74
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,360
If you were, we'd be back by now.

75
00:07:20,304 --> 00:07:22,800
I'm done washing the dishes.

76
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,820
I'll go back to the meeting.

77
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:35,477
I think we should call it a day.

78
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:37,792
Our idea has begun to form.

79
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,060
I'll share with you guys the summary.

80
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,290
All right, guys.

81
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,774
I'm going to go home and watch a movie. To motivate myself.

82
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:46,274
I'm tired.

83
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,940
- Pang.
- Huh?

84
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,290
May I have a word with you? I need to consult you about something.

85
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,990
Absolutely.

86
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,320
Should we take it outside? It's pretty packed here.

87
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,136
Okay.

88
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,750
Do you think there's something going on between Tun and Pang?

89
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,671
Tess, do you know anything?

90
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,130
It's nothing.

91
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,790
Pang is simply nice.

92
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,232
Come on. Get your stuff.

93
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,140
There. Sleeping in.

94
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,791
Will you wake him up for me?

95
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,591
Of course.

96
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:54,948
Tun, it's late.

97
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,568
Tun, wake up.

98
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,972
Not getting up, are you?

99
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,260
Get up, Tun.

100
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,120
I'm up.

101
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,370
Hey. This is my t-shirt.

102
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,680
I don't remember you borrowing it.

103
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,400
Don't be such a hog.

104
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,770
I sleep so well wearing it.

105
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,970
When the smell is gone, I'll return it to you.

106
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,252
Wait. What smell?

107
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:27,768
Well, it smells nice.

108
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,740
The scent of you.

109
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,812
It's Tess's perfume.

110
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,400
Or maybe it's not the scent.

111
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,490
It's because I got to hug you all night that night.

112
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,380
That's what makes me sleep so well.

113
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,460
I'm going to keep sleeping.

114
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,030
Get up and take a shower.

115
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,060
Give me back my tee. Go.

116
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,280
No. I'll take it.

117
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,312
That's Tess's.

118
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:03,360
- Take it off.
- Hey!

119
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,990
What are you doing? No.

120
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,620
Will you take it off or not?

121
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,420
Take it off.

122
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,561
That's it.

123
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:19,310
Fine. I won't take the tee.

124
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,250
But can you do that again? I like it.

125
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,920
Nonsense.

126
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,720
Get up and clean yourself.

127
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,070
Come on.

128
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,160
You took my tee off. You shower me.

129
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,653
Ouch! I can choke to death here.

130
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,540
You said you didn't want me to die yesterday.

131
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,484
Sit still.

132
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,420
How is it going with Pang?

133
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,600
Do you feel anything?

134
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,336
Not at all.

135
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,100
Hey, don't be disheartened.

136
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,700
Try a little harder.

137
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,220
You can go home quickly.

138
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,020
You always shoo me away.

139
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,570
If I go back first, you're going to miss me so badly.

140
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,933
No way. Because I'm finding my own portkey, too.

141
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,188
I will not let you go back alone.

142
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,730
How is it?

143
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,990
I think it's good.

144
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,340
Just a small comment on the ending scene.

145
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,640
The dialogue is a little too plain.

146
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,248
I can't make it better.

147
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,344
My brain isn't functioning.

148
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:19,180
Should we go out and refuel ourselves?

149
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,510
You want to catch a movie? A new romantic film just hit the cinema.

150
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,400
Let's do it. How about this evening?

151
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,410
I can't wait. Let's go.

152
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,310
I'm paying.

153
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,488
Pang, do you want to join us?

154
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:37,370
I've got something to do this evening.

155
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,772
Maybe next time. I won't miss it.

156
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,813
- How sad.
- I know what you're thinking.

157
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,110
Hey, you're home.

158
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,080
Should we go drink tonight?

159
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,391
I've already got plans.

160
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,540
What?

161
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,890
Who are you meeting?

162
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,300
The screenwriting team.

163
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,472
Are you sure?

164
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,780
What are you doing anyway?

165
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,108
Sniffing like a dog.

166
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,080
It's like you're preparing for a date.

167
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,060
A date, my ass.

168
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,340

We're at the cinema. Hurry up.

I don't even have to turn around.

177

Tess, do you want people on different planets to smell your perfume or what?

Super strong.

It's a movie night with friends. Why dressed up?

Yeah? This is normal.

181
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:56,360
Maybe I put on too much.

182
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,324
It's really too much.

183
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,320
And where is Tun?

184
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,318
He called and said he needed to bail last minute.

185

He's got something to do with Pang.

Why didn't he tell us earlier? This asshole.

187
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:13,701
He left his friends. Everyone is here, but him.

188
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,332
He has his reasons.

189

And you're defending him.

Perfect balance.

So you asked me to a movie because I don't eat a lot?

203

That's all?

No.

223

If your friend does something that makes you feel bad, what would you do?

224
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,081
Tell him to stop doing it.

225
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:53,029
I can't.

226

I was the one who told him to do it.

No. I'm telling you to keep fighting.

233

Will your dad be okay with it? I'm scared.

What if we send him the full screenplay?

327
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,992
Will he even cry?

328
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,960
Next time, I'll prepare him some facial tissue.

329

I overheard him compliment our idea to his employees.

330
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:13,360
Since the result can't be a surprise, should we go celebrate?

331
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,590
Go out of town.

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,640
Good idea.

333
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,750
We've got an RV after all.

334
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,650
What do you say, Boss Tun?

335
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,470
Let's do it. Change the atmosphere.

336
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,200
Cool. Let's do it.

337
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,350
- When are we going?
- When?

338
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,920
Right now.

339
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,000
- Let's go.
- Right now!

340
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,700
Come on!

341
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,876
Take the wheel, Up.

342
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,032
Up!

343
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:47,050
I told you.

344
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,608
Don't let me get my hands dirty.

345
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:51,930
Damn! I want to play mobile games, too.

346
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,320
Why do I need to be the first driver?

347
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,270
Stop complaining.

348
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,664
I will take the wheel after you.

349
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,260
Here.

350
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,371
- What is it?
- Fried chicken.

351
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,180
I can't. I'm driving.

352
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,040
Come on. Eat something.

353
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,960
You haven't eaten all day.

354
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,880
Fine.

355
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,056
No sauce.

356
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,220
Why not?

357
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,210
Every time I see you eat it, you never dip it in sauce.

358
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,180
Don't you know eating with sauce is an insult

359
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,450
to the one who cooks fried chicken?

360
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,732
Don't you think eating without the sauce is disrespectful to the one who invented it?

361
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:40,590
Some things are just meant to be together.

362
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,510
If one is missing, the other will be so sad. Right?

363
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,620
Are we still talking about chicken?

364
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,420
No.

365
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:05,299
I'm talking about fried chicken and sauce.

366
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,201
Fine. I surrender.

367
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:11,189
Give it to me.

368
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,160
Here.

369
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,630
Oh! It's good.

370
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,890
I told you they were meant to be together.

371
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,852
One more bite.

372
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,260
Why did you take your turn so soon?

373
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,360
We haven't even reached the midpoint yet.

374
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,010
I know you like to watch the sunset.

375
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,770
So I'm going fast to get to the camp before that.

376
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,800
Why do you like to watch the sunset?

377
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,240
No idea.

378
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,347
I think no matter how bad the day is,

379
00:28:59,347 --> 00:29:05,803
there's always a beautiful moment... at the end of it.

380
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:29,310
♪ Is it you? That will change this world ♪

381
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:34,350
♪ Is it you? The person I've been searching a long time for ♪

382
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,640
♪ Have I found, Have I found ♪

383
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:44,190
♪ Someone who will be ready to walk through this side by side with me from now on ♪

384
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:49,240
♪ Is it you? That won't let me be sad ♪

385
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:57,240
♪ After a night of nightmares, making every tomorrow look bright ♪

386
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:05,572
♪ Forever, please tell me to be confident, that you won't go and leave me ♪

387
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,120
Up, are you all right?

388
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,270
Damn you, Tun. Why did you drive so fast?

389
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,261
- Let me help.
- Don't pat me or it will come out.

390
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,429
- I almost died.
- Hey. Try this.

391
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,336
Use it. It helps.

392
00:30:58,688 --> 00:31:00,320
I'm feeling better.

393
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,890
I can now go on for a while.

394
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,690
Thanks.

395
00:31:09,408 --> 00:31:11,753
Hey! What a stunning view.

396
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,450
It's worth the carsickness.

397
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,120
Aou, let's go see it.

398
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,620
Let's go.

399
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:26,512
It's so tiring to drive to see this view.

400
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,180
Better?

401
00:31:39,984 --> 00:31:41,984
Hey! Wait for me.

402
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,400
Guys, shooting stars.

403
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,600
They said it'd happen all night.

404
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,960
I read this trick on the internet.

405
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,470
They say,

406
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,320
write down 3 wishes that you want to happen this year

407
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,210
and hang them on the tree.

408
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,844
The wish that already came true, you can take it down.

409
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:12,430
Why are you smiling?

410
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,220
Hey! Don't be nosy.

411
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,441
Fine, Mr. Secretive.

412
00:32:17,441 --> 00:32:19,914
Keep your secrets to your grave.

413
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,960
What about you? What are your wishes?

414
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,100
Don't be nosy.

415
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,500
Asshole.

416
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,931
You're really getting on my nerves.

417
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,584
It's easy to guess though.

418
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,240
You wish to see your portkey soon. Right?

419
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,632
You just know it all.

420
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,532
What's your second wish?

421
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:55,050
I wish the Romantic Not Comedy project to be a success.

422
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,470
But I can't think of the last one right now.

423
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,852
I will come again when I know it.

424
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,352
You have only one wish?

425
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,930
Of course.

426
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:17,610
I just want to focus on one wish, so that it comes true very soon.

427
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,860
Sadhu. (Be blessed)

428
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,920
Right.

429
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,448
Sadhu!

430
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,560
Cheers!

431
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,890
Cheers again? All right.

432
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,224
Tess, we need music.

433
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,376
Wrong lyric!

434
00:33:40,376 --> 00:33:42,700
Don't hurt him.

435
00:33:43,664 --> 00:33:45,584
Sing it again.

436
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:48,964
You just grabbed my drink.

437
00:33:58,109 --> 00:34:01,816
I love you guys. Let me hug you.

438
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:06,084
I'm so proud.

439
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,740
Up.

440
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,907
Damn it. I need to carry you to bed again.

441
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:15,655
Get up.

442
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,848
Normally, those two will not stop fighting.

443
00:34:20,848 --> 00:34:23,880
But they love each other so much when they're drunk.

444
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,660
Do you get along well with them now?

445
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,764
So well that we just click.

446
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:38,760
How is it going with you, Fuse and Kita?

447
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,560
Ugh. Chaotic.

448
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,520
But they are both nice.

449
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,580
It's not like the only thing they do is cause trouble.

450
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,440
And... us?

451
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,244
Do we get along well?

452
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,900
I don't know.

453
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,460
What?

454
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:08,220
We've known each other for a year now.

455
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,212
How do I explain this?

456
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:17,316
Well, I like it when I'm with you.

457
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,820
When we're apart, I'm so lonely.

458
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,256
But when we're back together, you get me frustrated.

459
00:35:29,854 --> 00:35:31,980
Yeah.

460
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,344
I like it so much when you're frustrated.

461
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,340
More importantly,

462
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,010
I like it so much when you sing.

463
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,456
Can you sing for me again?

464
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,060
I want to hear it.

465
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,440
No.

466
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,720
I've been singing all day.

467
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,720
Your turn now.

468
00:36:10,316 --> 00:36:12,132
Which song?

469
00:36:13,248 --> 00:36:16,036
Any song. I like them all.

470
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:21,960
Let's go with the one you sang on the way here.

471
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,760
It's nice.

472
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,440
Wrong chord.

473
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,410
What? It's not right?

474
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,180
No. Different chord.

475
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,180
Strum again.

476
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,836
Here. Let me teach you.

477
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,136
Here.

478
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,600
Here.

479
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,472
And here.

480
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,560
Now play it.

481
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,300
Again.

482
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,576
That's right.

483
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,620
This time, I can kiss you, can't I?

484
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:22,220
What if it reaches 3 times and I can still take more?

485
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,320
If that friend of yours makes you feel that uneasy,

486
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,901
I think you should back off.

487
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,592
Are you asking me or asking yourself?

488
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:38,840
We don't have a meeting today.

489
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,284
Why don't you come inside?

490
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:45,764
I... I...

491
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,100
I think I'll withdraw from Friend Credits.

492
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,720
Huh? Why?

493
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,101
If it's about last night...

494
00:40:55,101 --> 00:41:00,437
These days... I've been spending all my time working on our screenplay.

495
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,010
If I'm still on the team,

496
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,800
I won't have time to find my portkey.

497
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,124
No, Talay.

498
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,180
What about our movie?

499
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,520
You guys are great.

500
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,350
Besides, you have Pang to help you.

501
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,430
She should be able to help with the screenplay

502
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,690
and take you back home.

503
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:38,448
Are you really leaving me?

504
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,012
Leaving Up and Aou?

505
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,741
Leaving our movie?

506
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:50,829
You're the one who is leaving me.

507
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,756
If Pang happens to be your portkey,

508
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:02,996
I don't want to be left alone here.

509
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:12,544
I've thought it through.

510
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:15,347
About the movie,

511
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,552
you can always give me a call.

512
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,164
So I really have to let you go?

513
00:42:35,047 --> 00:42:38,895
It's time we split up and find our way home.

514
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:07,100
This is the latest draft from my team.

515
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,468
I'd like you to read it first.

516
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:17,900
But if you have any comments, please contact Tun directly.

517
00:43:19,184 --> 00:43:20,784
Why?

518
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,216
Because I have withdrawn from this project.

519
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:30,098
Good then.

520
00:43:30,098 --> 00:43:34,150
Because I was about to tell you...

521
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:40,356
that our company will not do the Romantic Not Comedy project anymore.

522
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,910
Why not?

523
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,310
Please read this draft first.

524
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:51,440
I think they've improved a lot.

525
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,140
I get you.

526
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,864
But the board doesn't trust you guys.

527
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,610
They're afraid it'd be a failure like the last time.

528
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,732
I can't help you.

529
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,770
Thanks for sharing the stories.

530
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:34,360
Let's take a 15-minute break.

531
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,872
How are you holding up, Dol? Are you okay?

532
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,090
I'm better.

533
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,611
How are you? You just went on a trip with Tun, didn't you?

534
00:44:54,816 --> 00:44:56,970
Good.

535
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,956
It's a memory that I will never forget.

536
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,840
What about finding the portkey?

537
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,990
Is it clear now that it's Tun?

538
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,530
What?

539
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,450
There must be some misunderstanding here.

540
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:13,640
What?

541
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,300
You guys just went on a trip together.

542
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,850
I thought it was a honeymoon trip.

543
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:22,160
You just wait for the sign that says you guys truly match.

544
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,032
Ding! Go home.

545
00:45:24,032 --> 00:45:25,850
No.

546
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,484
Tun is Pang's portkey.

547
00:45:29,484 --> 00:45:33,201
No way. Pang keeps coming to meet new people here.

548
00:45:33,201 --> 00:45:35,481
She is just next door.

549
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,092
What happened?

550
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,488
You and Tun seem to be each other's portkeys. Right?

551
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,608
I thought so too at first.

552
00:46:00,448 --> 00:46:03,140
But after spending one day with him,

553
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,250
I knew we weren't.

554
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,790
Why?

555
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:13,928
Because Tun seems happy when he's with you.

556
00:46:13,928 --> 00:46:17,100
Can you believe that the only thing he talked about

557
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,370
when he was with me was you?

558
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,610
What's the matter? Why do you look so serious?

559
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:33,464
Do you think we're each other's portkeys?

560
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,640
Why would you ask that?

561
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,636
It's Talay. He believes we're each other's portkeys.

562
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:49,548
Because I told him it felt special when we first met.

563
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,329
I felt you were special, too.

564
00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:57,990
But that specialness was just a surprise

565
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:00,140
that you were someone I knew.

566
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:04,110
It's like when you run into your friend when you're abroad.

567
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,370
Something like that.

568
00:47:05,371 --> 00:47:07,401
Same here.

569
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,940
I just don't know how to explain this to Talay.

570
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:16,250
He wants us to spend more time together.

571
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,260
For what?

572
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,664
For me to go home as soon as possible.

573
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,580
I don't want things to go this way.

574
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,992
I want him to smile like he used to.

575
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,580
Smile for every little thing.

576
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,068
Smile like he did before.

577
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:44,465
Because Talay's smile is your smile, Puen.

578
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:48,480
You have no idea you always smile when you talk about him.

579
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,724
It's the smile I've never seen,

580
00:47:50,724 --> 00:47:53,370
whether it's when you're with Puen

581
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,250
or you're with other people.

582
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,008
Smiles don't lie.

583
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:14,820
When I saw Tun looking happier, I wanted it too.

584
00:48:15,372 --> 00:48:19,588
Someone who makes me smile every day.

585
00:48:19,588 --> 00:48:24,964
If I ever find that person and we go back together, that'd be so nice.

586
00:48:28,462 --> 00:48:30,640
I'm sure you'll find that person.

587
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,548
I believe so.

588
00:48:42,147 --> 00:48:44,296
If you ask me,

589
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,696
I think Tun is your portkey.

590
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,320
Thank you so much for today.

591
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,040
Sorry to bother you. I couldn't find a helper in time.

592
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,410
You missed the movie with your friends, didn't you?

593
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:04,257
That's totally fine. Happy to help.

594
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:11,310
Wow! Nice colors.

595
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:17,410
There are blue, orange, light blue, and pink.

596
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,730
What should I call this tone of color?

597
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,790
Talay.

598
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,600
Talay.

599
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,652
Sea palette.

600
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:31,020
No way.

601
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,360
I mean, don't you get into the habit

602
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,870
of naming Pantone after Talay?

603
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,190
Of course, there's only one person with this weird habit.

604
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,480
You know what?

605
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,400
If you unknowingly adopt a habit from someone close,

606
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,216
it suggests you like that habit.

607
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,280
Bye now.

608
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,880
See you.

609
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:10,964
I can feel Tun is thinking the same thing.

610
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,550
Aou, are you with Tun?

611
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,150
I can't reach him.

612
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,720
Me neither.

613
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,390
This morning your brother Tanin called and told us the news.

614
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,190
Tun rushed out. He said he'd talk to your dad.

615
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,170
He won't pick up my calls.

616
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,180
Okay.

617
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,272
I need to hang up now.

618
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,632
- Let me through.
- Don't you get it? You can't go inside.

619
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,160
Don't do this.

620
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,192
I'll do anything with you. Whatever it is.

621
00:50:41,192 --> 00:50:45,704
If you're making a movie, I'm making a movie.

622
00:50:49,408 --> 00:50:51,228
- Let me in.
- You can't.

623
00:50:51,228 --> 00:50:53,180
Let me through.

624
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,900
- I've been waiting all day.

625
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,030
I said you can't.

626
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,796
Why don't you get it?

627
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,511
Do as I said. Go home if you don't want to get hurt.

628
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:29,024
Because I know movies are what you want to do the most, Talay.

629
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,800
Why are you doing this?

630
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:55,930
Why?

631
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,360
Just because I want to make movies.

632
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:02,450
So you've gone out of your way to do this.

633
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:09,176
Because it's the only thing I get to do with you.

634
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:17,756
Why are you so attached to me?

635
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,700
Because I believe...

636
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:25,460
you're my portkey.

637
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,010
The only reason why I spent time with Pang...

638
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,310
was because I wanted you to be happy.

639
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,060
That night, why did you...

640
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,120
This time,

641
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,570
I can kiss you, can't I?

642
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:52,168
Are you asking me or asking yourself?

643
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:01,112
Because I didn't know if you were going to let me love you.

644
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,328
I want us to be each other's portkeys.

645
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:11,416
I don't want you to look for anyone else.

646
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:19,928
Please don't ask me to leave you again, Talay.

647
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,980
I'm sorry.

648
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:35,780
We even made a promise.

649
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,740
(We will go back together.)

650
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,376
I will go back with you.

651
00:53:55,780 --> 00:54:01,980
♫ It's like encountering a light that helps show the way ♫

652
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,350
♫ Making me feel different ♫

653
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:10,580
♫ Is it you? That will change this world ♫

654
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:15,710
♫ Is it you? The person I've been searching for a long time for ♫

655
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,170
♫ Have I found, Have I found ♫

656
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:26,070
♫ Someone who will be ready to walk through this from now on, that won't go and leave me ♫

657
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,200
Chang has a series project until next year.

658
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,414
We have no directors.

659
00:54:34,414 --> 00:54:36,060
I'll show you my directing skills.

660
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:39,530
Let's suppose this is a scene where you're thinking of someone you like.

661
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,280
My brother sent me a contact of someone.

662
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,264
He just graduated from abroad.

663
00:54:43,264 --> 00:54:45,531
He's definitely asking you on a date.

664
00:54:45,531 --> 00:54:48,265
I don't like people for their appearances.

665
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,500
I've never even seen your real face,

666
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,600
yet I like you.

667
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:00,710
♫ Is it you? That will change this world ♫

668
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:05,800
♫ Is it you? The person I've been searching a long time for ♫

669
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,290
♫ Have I found, Have I found ♫

670
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:16,010
♫ Someone who will be ready to walk through this side by side with me from now on ♫

671
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:21,090
♫ Is it you? That won't let me be sad ♫

672
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:30,040
♫ After a night of nightmares, making every tomorrow look bright ♫

673
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,840
♫ Forever, please tell me to be confident ♫

674
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,000
♫ That you won't go and leave me ♫

675
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:50,700
