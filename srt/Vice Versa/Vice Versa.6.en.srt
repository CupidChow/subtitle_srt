26

We should stop eating popped rice.

27

Better eat something else.

No.

I'd feel bad if you just paid and didn't live there with me.

Besides, the reason I want you to move in with me...

53
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:29,404
is that I'm feeling a bit lost as I won't get to spend time with you anymore.

54

Seeing you 24/7 is heartwarming.

You should spend time with someone else, too.

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,260

173
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:05,120
The song you wanted to hear. I played it.

174
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,100
I should leave now.

175
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,260
You came all the way here just to play me that song?

176
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,948
You've been gone for 9 days.

177
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:22,700
Do you have any idea how long that 12,960 minutes I waited for you

178
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,870
felt like?

179
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,860
Tun, I...

180
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,420
I freaking missed you.

181
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,990
I know.

182
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,160
Because for me,

183
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,208
it was 777,600 seconds that I spent missing you like crazy, too.

184
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,260
I have a question.

185
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,876
Why did you disappear?

186
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,672
I don't have much money left.

187
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,400
And I don't want to bother Pakorn's parents.

188
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,596
I tried to save money as much as I could.

189
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,370
I stayed in.

190
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,640
I didn't contact anyone. I didn't go anywhere.

191
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,460
I only ate at home.

192
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,572
Is it that bad?

193
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,652
Then, why didn't you answer my calls?

194
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,210
Because if you said you wanted to see me

195
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,480
or if I heard your voice,

196
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,776
I wouldn't be able to resist going to see you, Talay.

197
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,380
I tried to find a new job,

198
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,420
but there was no job I wanted to do.

199
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,140
Why not?

200
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,100
Because you were not part of it.

201
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,830
A life of doing things alone...

202
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,260
is not fun at all.

203
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:38,090
I think we...

204
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,057
Tun. Tess.

205
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:43,880
I prepared you guys some snacks. Come have some.

206
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,777
Yes, Mom.

207
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,020
Hello, Dad.

208
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,080
Hello.

209
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,532
Glad to finally meet you in person, Tess.

210
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:54,450
Ever since Tun got home, he hasn't talked about anything.

211
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,749
He seems to forget everything.

212
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:57,920
He only talked about one thing. You, Tess.

213
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,812
Really, Dad? Did he gossip about me?

214
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,500
No. He mainly said you're great.

215
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,560
You're so helpful. Like when he was put in jail...

216
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,520
Dad!

217
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,080
That's enough.

218
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,420
Have you eaten anything yet, Tess?

219
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,140
Can I make you anything? You guys can eat together.

220
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,360
Thank you, Mom. I'm hungry.

221
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,440
Okay then. Just one second.

222
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,624
Honey, come help me. Let the kids talk. Come here.

223
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:27,470
- Of course.
- Chop-chop.

224
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,200
Pakorn's parents are lovely.

225
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,180
I guess this is such a warm family.

226
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,680
So lovely.

227
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,170
They always give Pakorn the things he likes.

228
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,896
Here. Fill your stomach first.

229
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,936
Pakorn must like this very much.

230
00:19:58,904 --> 00:20:00,844
I like it, too.

231
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,790
I mean you.

232
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,800
What are you saying?

233
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,190
I like when you eat.

234
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,640
You make everything look so yummy.

235
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,156
Then I'll eat them all by myself.

236
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,450
Who is it?

237
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,620
I'll go get the door.

238
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,640
Don't bother. I just invited myself in.

239
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,670
I come to this house often.

240
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,840
How have you been? I missed you guys.

241
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,040
I brought you guys northern Thai sausages.

242
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,610
Up! What brings you here?

243
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,460
I missed your foul mouth so bad.

244
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,950
I know. I'm so proud of it.

245
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,420
Now that we're here, should we call Aou?

246
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,823
- Do it.
- Go ahead, Tess.

247
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,620
Hi, Aou.

248
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,890
Hello. Hello.

249
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,940
What did you say? I have no reception.

250
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,248
Hello. Hello.

251
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:15,477
He's probably fishing. He said he had no reception.

252
00:21:15,477 --> 00:21:17,550
Uh... okay. I just got my reception.

253
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,232
It's nice and clear now.

254
00:21:20,232 --> 00:21:22,870
- Aou!
- You and you and you!

255
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,830
Hold on. I'm lost.

256
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,350
Is this destiny?

257
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,390
There's no such a thing.

258
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,560
I destined this.

259
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,830
After you came, I called them here too.

260
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,130
Luckily, they were in Bangkok.

261
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,456
I freaking missed you guys.

262
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,860
Guys.

263
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:53,380
Friend Credits!

264
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,220
I missed this so bad. Haven't done it in a long time.

265
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,417
But first,

266
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,240
I need something to eat.

267
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,540
Stop.

268
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,732
You can't eat these.

269
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,160
They've been reserved.

270
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,620
He said he would eat them all by himself.

271
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,520
No way.

272
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,500
Stop! Stop.

273
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,912
Nobody can have them.

274
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,310
Fine.

275
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:38,172
Friend Credits!

276
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,951
What? It sparkled for a few seconds.

277
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,550
The sparkler?

278
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,250
You want more?

279
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,370
I meant us.

280
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,088
We shone for a short moment.

281
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,800
But I think we can go further.

282
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,653
That was just one failure.

283
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:05,560
Should we make more movies?

284
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,043
Make more failures.

285
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:08,443
No.

286
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
How sad.

287
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,072
Because it won't be a failure this time.

288
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:26,563
Yes!

289
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,720
What about you, Tess?

290
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,437
Would you like to work with us one more time?

291
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:40,190
Let's do it. Go as far as we can.

292
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,070
I'll talk to my dad.

293
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,530
To our brighter day.

294
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,840
Cheers.

295
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,676
Cheers!

296
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,290
You know, I missed you guys so bad.

297
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:02,520
I missed everything about you. Every personality you guys have.

298
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,700
Like what?

299
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,200
You, for example, Up.

300
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,680
I missed your friendliness so much.

301
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,320
You make people smile while they don't even have to ask for it.

302
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,430
And I missed your annoying aggressiveness and inappropriate behaviors.

303
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,360
You're picking on me, clearly.

304
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,696
Hey, but I truly missed you all.

305
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,010
What about you?

306
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,144
What did you miss about me?

307
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,500
That's tough. Can't think of one.

308
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,300
Nothing at all?

309
00:24:55,215 --> 00:24:57,980
I missed...

310
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,436
your annoyance,

311
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,910
your shyness,

312
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,312
your nice singing voice,

313
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,960
your care,

314
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,996
and lastly,

315
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,290
just you.

316
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,252
You're not sleeping?

317
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,452
I was.

318
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:39,306
But then I heard your whispering sound. It woke me up.

319
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,140
Were you talking behind my back?

320
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,144
No.

321
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,283
Nothing. Just sleep.

322
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,860
I can't anymore.

323
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,319
Take responsibility. Make me drowsy.

324
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,560
How about counting sheep?

325
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,660
I don't have any other ideas.

326
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,170
I read this from a book.

327
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,810
It says if we hear the sound of nature before going to bed,

328
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,280
we will fall asleep more easily.

329
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,530
The sound of nature? What is it?

330
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,716
Talay (The sea). I like the sound of the sea.

331
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,732
Whisper in my ear now.

332
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,510
What the heck are you doing?

333
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,510
Making the wave sound.

334
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,316
My ears are all wet.

335
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,200
Should we try patting your back and your butt?

336
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,708
I did it when I nannied my nephew.

337
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,460
I was about to say that.

338
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,592
How old are you?

339
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:31,316
I think you should just stop talking and you'll be drowsy soon.

340
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,120
That's a big yawn.

341
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,004
And now you're the one drowsy.

342
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,960
Hey. There's one last method.

343
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,720
Ear massage.

344
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,200
I'll do it for you.

345
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,528
Good night, Talay.

346
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:51,376
Signs you're falling in love.

347
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,150
There!

348
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,113
I saw that. Who are you falling in love with?

349
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,240
Speak.

350
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,730
You're wrong. I'm just doing some research for my romantic movie.

351
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,527
Is that so?

352
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:10,468
Let me know if you need a protagonist. I'm always up for it.

353
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:19,430
Now that we are talking about it.

354
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,450
I want to know...

355
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,570
how we can tell if we like that person already.

356
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,850
You've dated so many people.

357
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,948
Why being so naive now?

358
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:39,490
I just feel like...

359
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,700
I don't know love at all.

360
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,950
Are you delusional?

361
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,790
To me, to work hard for that life's person is considered liking.

362
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,880
That's it?

363
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,440
Heck, yeah.

364
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,895
Don't overthink it. Don't complicate things.

365
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,172
So... who are you feeling it with?

366
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,760
I told you, no one.

367
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,720
You think I don't know.

368
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,160
- You...
- Shut it.

369
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,760
Stop talking.

370
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,480
What are you afraid of, Tess?

371
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,968
The answer? You don't need to be afraid of failing in the end.

372
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,740
What you should be afraid of

373
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,550
is letting that person slip through your fingers.

374
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,597
What you should be afraid of...

375
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:50,407
is letting that person slip through your fingers.

376
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,930
What the hell are you playing, Tun?

377
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,870
Are you playing a sad guy in a music video?

378
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,780
No.

379
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,400
I'm just thinking about our next movie project.

380
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,537
What are you doing here?

381
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,930
I was helping my dad water the plants.

382
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,570
Then I saw you making an awkward face, so I decided to watch you instead.

383
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,220
Pleasing to the eye.

384
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,456
Get lost.

385
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,456
I said go.

386
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,560
- Hey, Tun.
- Huh?

387
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,260
Whose RV is that?

388
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,380
That one?

389
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,220
It belongs to a friend of my dad.

390
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,740
My dad told me his friend needed money.

391
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,280
He sold it to my dad for a good price.

392
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,760
Your dad bought it and left it like this?

393
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,503
He doesn't know how to make use of it. It goes at the speed of a turtle.

394
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,596
Friend Credits doesn't have an office.

395
00:32:01,537 --> 00:32:04,340
- How about we renovate it into a studio?
- What?

396
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,010
It's an RV.

397
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,170
We discuss work inside.

398
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:13,392
When ideas run out, we drive out there for more inspiration.

399
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:16,020
How do we start?

400
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,430
Go up there.

401
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,440
Remove these vines.

402
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,910
Me again?

403
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,080
Just help.

404
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,280
We'll keep the passenger seat next to the driver.

405
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,960
And get rid of the rest.

406
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,378
We'll build a table and chairs right here.

407
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:46,604
Then on the opposite side,

408
00:32:46,604 --> 00:32:52,344
there's a shelf for books... and movie DVDs.

409

410

Ouch.

411
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,250
It hurts.

412
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,730
​♫ You are the key ♫

413
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,110
Wait.

414
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,010
You're drawing like you already have an image in your head.

415
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,880
Of course, I do.

416
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,040
I've always wanted to have an RV.

417
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,650
I used to think that when I was old,

418
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,870
I'd drive my RV to places,

419
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:29,858
just like in this photo.

420
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,480
♫ In the blink of an eye, it was different. ♫

421
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,328
But I think it is missing something.

422
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,720

[Friend Credits]

429
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,230
The fridge is huge!

430
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,520
Hey, I love it.

431
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,040
Oh! So you guys disappeared because you did this?

432
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,100
The fridge is mine.

433
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,597
It's for my luxurious drinks.

434
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:25,360
Hey, guys! I got the seat in the back. It's freaking comfy.

435
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,092
Since we're all here, I have a gift for our new studio.

436
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:30,420
- What?
- What is it?

437
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,120
Wait here.

438
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,040
What do you think it is?

439
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,284
Something expensive.

440
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,730
I can't wait.

441
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,630
In a note from the tree planting class I took,

442
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,650
a tree with a very nice meaning was mentioned. So I bought it.

443
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,636
A pink trumpet tree.

444
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,723
Hold on, Tun.

445
00:34:54,723 --> 00:34:59,876
How big is a pink trumpet tree when it's fully grown?

446
00:34:59,876 --> 00:35:03,360
Around 8 to 25 meters.

447
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,172
Wait. Are you planting a 25-meter-tall tree in an RV?

448
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,500
Are you kidding?

449
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,300
Well, trim it.

450
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,790
Besides, won't you be happy to wake up and see a pretty pink tree?

451
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,097
No. I don't like pink.

452
00:35:20,097 --> 00:35:21,780
But its meaning is very nice.

453
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,520
It represents love and good wishes.

454
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,727
It fits romantic film screenwriters like us.

455
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:29,000
That's true.

456
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,169
- Aou.
- What?

457
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,796
Let's make room for our amulet.

458
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,489
Where should we place it?

459
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,836
Will it be good if we write about our life story in the screenplay?

460
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,819
I don't think so.

461
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:58,050
Why not? It should be fun.

462
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,110
A man who travels to an unfamiliar world.

463
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:05,090
He is lost and lonely, and he needs to find someone to help him.

464
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,256
At last, he finds the one.

465
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,130
Then, what's next?

466
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,660
In the end, they...

467
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,620
Guys, let's capture you all on camera.

468
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,820
Come.

469
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,583
Just move a little left.

470
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,850
Snap me, Dad.

471
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,060
Be careful, guys.

472
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,820
Time for a photo.

473
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,620
You two switch places.

474
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,752
Better colors this way. Trust me.

475
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:37,780
I bought this so long ago that I forgot. I'm glad I get to use it today.

476
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,440
Get closer.

477
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,760
Tess, closer. You don't want to be out of the frame.

478
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,260
Sure.

479
00:36:43,992 --> 00:36:46,990
In the end, they fall in love with each other.

480
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,000
What?

481
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,410
Yes, Dol?

482
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,190
What?

483
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,790
A guide video for new universal travelers?

484
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,620
Yes.

485
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,940
Do you see there're lots of new travelers here?

486
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,200
It's overwhelming for Joobjang and me to explain it over and over.

487
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,323
You graduated from film and Tun was an actor.

488
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:43,023
Help me.

489
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,200
Please.

490
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:52,260
It doesn't look nice here. Should it be from this angle.

491
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,860
See?

492
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,125
I checked every angle. This is the best one.

493
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:00,000
The video is too flat. It should be here.

494
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,700
Why are you so stubborn?

495
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,653
Don't argue. I've got so much more experience.

496
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,120
- Trust me.
- You can't.

497
00:38:10,817 --> 00:38:13,101
I have work experience.

498
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,930
When they fight, they're like boyfriends. Right?

499
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,970
Yeah.

500
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:24,380
No way. Boyfriends don't hit each other like this.

501
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,170
True.

502
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,776
Boyfriends don't strangle each other like this.

503
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,924
That's right. Boyfriends don't step on each other's feet.

504
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,924
So that's what universal travelers call "ship".

505
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,630
You go away.

506
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,200
Trust me.

507
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,300
- Let me go.
- Back to work!

508
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,480
Okay. The information part is done.

509
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,057
Now I want to interview universal travelers.

510
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:59,110
May I interview you two?

511
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,220
- Is that a good idea?
- Of course.

512
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,168
Help us. I'll pay you with fried chicken.

513
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,520
My name is Talay.

514
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,840
In the other universe, I'm a colorist.

515
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,350
My name is Tun.

516
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,950
I'm an actor.

517
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,980
How do you feel being a universal traveler?

518
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,250
At first, I was shocked.

519
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:34,564
But I'm glad sometimes because I don't have to work so hard anymore.

520
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,170
For me, I am really stressed out.

521
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,780
I just got the job I'd always wanted.

522
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,400
But then I traveled to the universe where I knew no one.

523
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:52,488
Lucky me, I met Tun.

524
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,090
It was a funny story.

525
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,990
I just traveled here.

526
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,008
I was still lost.

527
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,436
Luckily, I met Talay.

528
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,064
He's the light that saved me.

529
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,420
Thank you, dude.

530
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,130
Thank you so much, Tun and Talay.

531
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,080
I'll send fried chicken right to your house.

532
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,690
I'll prepare my stomach for that.

533
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,800
You do that.

534
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,920
Okay.

535
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,290
- Bye now.
- Bye.

536
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,510
I'll see you tomorrow.

537
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,920
See you.

538
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,720
Come on.

539
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,920
Joobjang is so nice.

540
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,572
Right. I feel like I have another mom taking care of me here.

541
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,950
Talay.

542
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,711
Thank you. I wish you to get to go home before me.

543
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,970
Okay. Let's cut to the last part.

544
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,372
Joob, you talk and end the video.

545
00:41:26,372 --> 00:41:28,072
Okay.

546
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,600
To all universal travelers,

547
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,370
I do believe

548
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:39,650
universal traveling happens for a reason.

549
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,670
What are you thinking?

550
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:48,944
What do you think we traveled between universes to learn?

551
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,760
No idea.

552
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,196
Perhaps if we stay a little longer, we'll find out.

553
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,492
Maybe...

554
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,500
Maybe?

555
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,460
I traveled between universes just to meet you.

556
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,200
What?

557
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,560
Think about it.

558
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,880
If we didn't travel here,

559
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,340
we wouldn't be eating fried chicken together now.

560
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,890
Duh!

561
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:28,292
Fried chicken is what I eat in whichever universe.

562
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:35,516
Here. Take a photo and send it to Joobjang to say thanks.

563
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,170
Come on.

564
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,190
Look at your face.

565
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,790
Smile.

566
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,780
A happy smile.

567
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,020
Like this?

568
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,556
That smile doesn't say you enjoy the food.

569
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,088
It says you're cute.

570
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,936
What should I do then?

571
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:10,600
Tell me.

572
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,304
Here. Let me help.

573
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:17,390
Hold the chicken.

574
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,580
Smile widely.

575
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,020
Smiley eyes.

576
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,790
Yes. Chicken closer.

577
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,860
Okay.

578
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,250
I know it.

579
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:37,250
Smile.

580
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,420
Smile widely.

581
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,248
1, 2, 3.

582
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:50,050
That's the happy face.

583
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:52,252
Your eyes dazzle.

584
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:57,504
I don't know if it's because of the chicken or me.

585
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,512
You didn't wait for me.

586
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:20,480
You keep talking and talking.

587
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,280
I'm hungry.

588
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,380
Here.

589
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,200
Hold it.

590
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,456
Yes, Dol?

591
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,520
What?

592
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,300
Joob suddenly had a heart attack and passed.

593
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,090
She had no history of heart disease.

594
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,880
How did it happen then?

595
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,300
This symptom has been proven.

596
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:41,280
It should be that the person in her body in the other universe died.

597
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,350
So Joob died, too.

598
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:48,640
It's normal for universal travelers.

599
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:54,160
No matter how many of us have passed, I never get used to it.

600
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,020
I get you.

601
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:02,520
Joob always said nothing in life was certain.

602
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,228
Whatever I want to do, do it now.

603
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,872
But I never succeeded in doing it.

604
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:16,270
What do you want to do?

605
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:18,508
Tell Joob I love her.

606
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,350
I was too afraid to say it.

607
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,850
I thought I had all the time I needed.

608
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,876
She didn't know I liked her.

609
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,160
She had no idea how much I wanted her to be my portkey.

610
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,040
Okay. Let's cut to the last part.

611
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,090
Joob, you talk and end the video.

612
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:59,690
Okay.

613
00:47:01,551 --> 00:47:05,520
To all universal travelers.

614
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,212
It is going to be tough at the beginning.

615
00:47:08,212 --> 00:47:10,060
Don't get discouraged yet.

616
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,910
Because you're not alone.

617
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,270
I do believe

618
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:20,360
universal traveling happens for a reason.

619
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,990
Maybe it's a lesson for us

620
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:27,880
to learn something we're missing.

621
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,180
I stand with every one of you.

622
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,062
[End of video]

623
00:47:44,306 --> 00:47:45,820
Tun.

624
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,998
Will you spend tonight with me?

625
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,380
Are you sleeping?

626
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,610
No.

627
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:17,496
Aren't you going to ask why I asked you to stay over?

628
00:48:19,136 --> 00:48:21,839
Because you're sad about Joob.

629
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,656
Partly, yes.

630
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,572
I'm starting to be scared of death.

631
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,730
Life is so damn uncertain.

632
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:39,650
I'm afraid that one day I'll wake up

633
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,310
and people around me will disappear on me.

634
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,362
You're over-thinking it.

635
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,620
What I fear the most...

636
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,300
is that it happens to someone I care about.

637
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,932
Especially, you.

638
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:36,248
I promise I won't go anywhere.

639
00:49:36,248 --> 00:49:38,428
Nothing will happen to me.

640
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,220
Someone like me doesn't die so easily.

641
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,460
Thank you so much.

642
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:10,152
There are many things I want to do before I die.

643
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,390
But now,

644
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,504
there's one thing I want to do the most.

645
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,890
What?

646
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,996
Can I hug you to sleep all night tonight?

647
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,590
Good night.

648
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,730
What are you doing? You look like you're going on a date.

649
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:15,150
I love it when you sing.

650
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,663
That's my t-shirt.

651
00:51:16,663 --> 00:51:18,690
Well, it smells good.

652
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,410
I won't let you go back alone.

653
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,040
Because I'll find my portkey, too.

654
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,238
Hasn't it ever occurred to you that I'm your portkey?

655
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:32,835
This time, I can kiss you, can't I?

656
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:58,420
♫ Is it you? That will change this world ♫

657
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:03,390
♫ Is it you? The person I've been searching a long time for ♫

658
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,970
♫ Have I found, Have I found ♫

659
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,700
♫ Someone who will be ready to walk through this side by side with me from now on ♫

660
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:18,900
♫ Is it you? That won't let me be sad ♫

661
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:24,840
♫ After a night of nightmares, making every tomorrow look bright ♫

662
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:31,500
♫ Forever, please tell me to be confident ♫

663
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,760
♫ That you won't go and leave me ♫
