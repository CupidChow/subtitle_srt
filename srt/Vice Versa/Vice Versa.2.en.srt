To return to the old universe, you must find your portkey.

- Pakorn!
Stay away from me.

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,340
I hate you.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,920
Talay, would you like to share your story?

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,809
Me?

6
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:20,099
Sure.

7
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,571
How do I start?

8
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:27,387
I woke up in a rich boy's body.

9
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:32,139
His family runs a huge filmmaking company.

10
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:34,254
It matches my career.

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,939
That sounds pretty nice.

12
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,539
It does.

13
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:44,051
But they are not my family.

14
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:47,799
I have my own family,

15
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,369
friends,

16
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:53,343
and a dream to be a colorist waiting for me.

17
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:58,823
I'll go to any length to get home as soon as possible.

18
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:03,739
Everyone here shares the same hope.

19
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:06,611
Have you found anyone who seems right?

20
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:10,459
There is one.

21
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:12,859
But there's one problem.

22
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:15,123
He's always avoiding me.

23
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:17,459
Let's put it this way.

24
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,739
It's the same as hitting on someone.

25
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:22,419
You must keep pushing and pushing.

26
00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:23,709
Come on, guys.

27
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,239
Let's transfer our energy to Talay.

28
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,649
We hope the person is your portkey.

29
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:34,319
We hope the person is your portkey!

30
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,369
We hope the person is your portkey!

31
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:43,987
We hope the person is your portkey!

[Episode 2: Forest Green]

34
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,869
Stop following me.

35
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:19,689
I told you I didn't want to talk to you.

36
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,459
But I do.

37
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,579
I will keep following you around until you agree to talk to me.

38
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:27,941
Oops! Amateur.

39
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,819
I thought you were good. You missed.

40
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,619
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:34,779
You hit the outermost ring, you get a full score.

42
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,679
Look.

43
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,303
Hit the edge and get 10 points?

44
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,468
Rules in this universe are too easy.

45
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:45,709
What's wrong with you?

46
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:48,189
Hitting the center is easy. Anyone can do that.

47
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:51,695
But if you miss the edge just a little, you get zero points.

48
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,609
I'll show you how easy it is.

49
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,109
Give it here.

50
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,059
Move. I need space.

51
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,719
There! If I competed under this rule, I'd be an Olympic gold medalist.

52
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,759
Shit!

53
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:33,363
When did he leave?

54
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,309
Hi, Pakorn.

55
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,230
You're a cameraman today?

56
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,229
I'm working. I don't want to talk.

57
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,019
Wait.

58
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:50,483
Take my photos. Do your job.

59
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,349
Yes?

60
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:02,249
Hey. Hold on.

61
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:06,199
Hey! You're here, too.

62
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,939
Didn't expect to see you here. Amm said you weren't coming.

63
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,531
I changed my mind.

64
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,651
Have you talked to Tun?

65
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,839
Not yet.

66
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,099
I don't know what the hell is wrong. He won't talk to me.

67
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:25,258
Surely, he is still mad at you.

68
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,659
I'm not surprised. What you did to him was shitty.

69
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:30,699
Huh?

70
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:34,119
Me? What did I do?

71
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,869
How dare you forget?

72
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,029
You hit on someone he liked.

73
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,911
Not just that. You even dated her.

74
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:45,109
If I were him, I wouldn't speak with you ever again.

75
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,409
What can I serve you today?

76
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:02,695
An iced latte, please.

77
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,439
Hi, Pakorn.

78
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,019
Wait.

79
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:11,421
You can't run from me today. I'm your customer.

80
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:16,943
Customer, I'm working here.

81
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,579
I won't discuss anything personal while working.

82
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,863
Just one question then.

83
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,351
Do you believe in reincarnation?

84
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,329
I do.

85
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,719
Why?

86
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:36,699
I'm a screenwriter. I must believe in anything.

87
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,299
Do you...

88
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:41,260
have any other reason to?

89
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:47,309
Not telling.

90
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:48,739
Come on.

91
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:52,699
We're alone here. No one can hear us.

92
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,919
Anything you'd like to tell me?

93
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:57,979
A secret you can't tell other people.

94
00:06:57,979 --> 00:06:59,939
I'm all ears.

95
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,819
Actually, there is.

96
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,738
Go ahead and tell, my friend.

97
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,959
This is my first day here. The coffee should taste like shit.

98
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:17,611
Damn you, Pakorn.

99
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:21,194
What's taking him so long?

100
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,979
It took you forever to come.

101
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:32,059
I'm starving.

102
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:35,579
Sorry. There's a guy messing with me a little...

103
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,164
- Forget it. Let's order.
- Hold on.

104
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:44,399
What about the screenplay you offered to 26 Pictures?

105
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,189
What did they say?

106
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,209
I... Well...

107
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,919
Um...

108
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,803
He sold it.

109
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:06,619
You.

110
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,299
Don't be confused. Your screenplay is bought.

111
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:11,059
I talked to my brother for you.

112
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:12,989
Wait a minute.

113
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:15,579
I'm so lost here.

114
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,479
Tun, when were you friends with someone from 26 Pictures?

115
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,669
Sorry, I didn't introduce myself.

116
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,339
My name is Tess.

117
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,149
The son of 26 Pictures owner.

118
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:29,199
Also, a friend of Tun's from high school.

119
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,889
- Huh?
- Huh?

120
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:33,889
Wait. You have a big connection.

121
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,819
Why didn't you tell us?

122
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,649
No. We're not close.

123
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,139
Not at all.

124
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:41,239
Come on. We are close.

125
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,939
Freakin' close.

126
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:56,959
My name is Up.

127
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,619
First name is Preeda.

128
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:00,099
Friends call me Up-Pree.

129
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:01,979
I have expertise in writing comedy plays.

130
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:05,679
If you want comedy, let me know. I'm the master.

131
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,709
And my name is Aou.

132
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:11,559
I write every genre or style.

133
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,089
How did you three become a team?

134
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:18,056
It's a very long story.

135
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:19,619
Let's make it short.

136
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:22,120
We ran into each other when trying to sell our screenplays

137
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,579
at your father's company in our freshman year.

138
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,849
We became a group since then.

139
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:32,239
Right. We tried selling our plays to 26 Pictures.

140
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,339
But we never made it.

141
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,369
- This is the first time they have been interested.
- Right?

142
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,729
Damn! I just want to cry.

143
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,499
Let's cheers.

144
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,309
To our first project being accepted!

145
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:46,609
Yes!

146
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,619
Come on.

147
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,871
You get the whole jar.

148
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,635
Cheers!

149
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:57,739
Why not raise your glass?

150
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:59,239
Come on.

151
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:13,467
Looking forward to working with you, screenwriter.

152
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:03,585
Get in. I'll drive you home. It's too late to get a taxi.

153
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,479
Hey. I'm sorry.

154
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:12,819
Sorry, I did a horrible thing to you.

155
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:18,875
What do you mean?

156
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:21,849
Pakorn.

157
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:24,559
Pramote told me everything.

158
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,059
About me stealing someone you liked.

159
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,689
Stop following me.

160
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,462
I'm trying to apologize here.

161
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:36,939
I said stop following me.

162
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:39,619
You just don't know a damn thing.

163
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:41,983
Take that stupidity to your grave.

164
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:55,749
Hey,

165
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:59,452
I'm sure Pakorn is the one I'm looking for.

166
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,519
I'm sensing he's traveled between universes like us.

167
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,731
He's just afraid to tell the truth.

168
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:09,909
The best thing to do...

169
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:14,367
You check if he's traveled between universes like us or not.

170
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:19,089
If not, you can move on and search for someone else.

171
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:20,789
Trust me.

172
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,369
Hey, can you make the light pinker?

173
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:36,339
- You got it.
- Awesome.

174
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,239
Hey, bro! Have a seat.

175
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:44,669
Are you here to appreciate the pink lighting I just put up?

176
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:46,766
It's gorgeous.

177
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,569
No. I'm here to see Tun.

178
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,119
Will he come?

179
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,289
No.

180
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:54,409
He said his screenplay was sold.

181
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:57,049
So he's taking time off to develop it with his team.

182
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:00,067
Where are they? Do you know?

183
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,469
No idea.

184
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:04,319
I think they went out of town. Some place quiet.

185
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:07,009
They do this often.

186
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:08,989
And don't bother to call them.

187
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,863
Because their phones...

188
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:15,179
are all with me.

189
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,819
They are being artists.

190
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:19,819
They said they didn't want anything to distract them from their screenplay.

191
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:26,369
And do you happen to know how much time they spend at their hideaway?

192
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:29,649
Shouldn't be that long. Around a month.

193
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:31,349
A month?

194
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,479
[One month later]

195
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,849
You keep checking your phone?

196
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,900
Whose call are you expecting?

197
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:50,209
I've been through a lot, man.

198
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:51,674
You're being dumped.

199
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:53,664
Come on. Let's drink.

200
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,219
Guys! Right there.

201
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:10,399
Who is picking a fight?

202
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,699
No.

203
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:14,115
That's your history, Tess.

204
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:16,389
Who?

205
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:19,169
You can't remember Anna?

206
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:21,870
The ex-girlfriend you bragged to us

207
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,120
that you stole from someone in high school.

208
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,259
That girl?

209
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,671
That's Anna. The one.

210
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:36,599
How dare you forget?

211
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:39,333
You hit on someone he liked.

212
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:42,789
I did?

213
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:46,839
Tess.

214
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,487
Hey, Anna.

215
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:52,799
How are you doing?

216
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:55,831
Doing okay.

217
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,191
Tess,

218
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,259
I talked to Tun.

219
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:06,939
About what?

220
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:11,115
The reason I broke up with you.

221
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:15,171
The truth is I was being selfish.

222
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:18,139
Anna, it wasn't your fault.

223
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:19,519
It was me.

224
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,959
I knew Tun liked you yet I still did it.

225
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,359
Huh?

226
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:26,609
No?

227
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:30,319
No. Tun didn't like me.

228
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,569
He likes you, Tess.

229
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:34,169
What?

230
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:40,959
This is the reason I broke up with you.

231
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,659
Not only that, we couldn't get along,

232
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:47,439
but I also felt bad for Tun.

233
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:14,089
Here. It's on me.

234
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:16,559
You've been making a sad face all alone.

235
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,359
Heartbroken?

236
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:22,379
Not really.

237
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,879
I'm just shocked to learn something.

238
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:28,720
I thought he avoided me because

239
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,470
we were both universal travelers.

240
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:36,323
But it turns out he just likes Tess.

241
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,749
Hey. Are you drunk?

242
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,322
What are you saying? I'm all confused.

243
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,209
Exactly.

244
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:51,639
- I'm sorry.
- That's fine.

245
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,419
Shit!

246
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,579
Holy shit!

247
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:58,279
Let's request a song. It might make you feel better.

248
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,599
Here. Write it down.

249
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:15,369
Dear everyone, my name is Talay.

250
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,539
If you're reading this letter,

251
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,529
that means I lost my hope to go back to my universe.

252
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:24,075
Farewell to all beings.

253
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:31,795
This is a song title? Why so long?

254
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:36,369
Pong, hello!

255
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:38,169
Hi, guys.

256
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:39,589
You're back.

257
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:41,119
Keep walking.

258
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,059
Take a look at your friend here.

259
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,559
Comfort him. He is falling apart here.

260
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,409
- Comfort what?
- Look.

261
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:50,129
Leave the job to Tun.

262
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:52,567
There he comes.

263
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,549
Is that really Tun?

264
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:09,409
Of course, he is.

265
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:11,120
I don't know what's happened to him lately.

266
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,950
The guy just keeps cool all the time.

267
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:13,970
- Right?
- Right.

268
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,270
Look.

269
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,219
I see you're finally back.

270
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:22,739
The stage is not taken. And your guitar is left in the same spot.

271
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,703
Go ahead.

272
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:25,979
Yes!

273
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,406
You've been gone for a month.

274
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:31,309
You have no idea how much I missed your off-key singing.

275
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:32,809

281
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:11,249
Let's leave that question for later.

282
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:16,039
I'm just wondering whose song this is.

283
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,049
I've never heard of it.

284
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,254

What?

295
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,799
You guys didn't finish the screenwriting because Tun had a car accident?

296
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,562
Yes. He was driving to buy things.

297
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:38,539
A cat cut him off.

298
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,529
He loved that cat more than his life, apparently.

299
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,579
So he turned the steering wheel right to the utility post.

300
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,319
He was in a hospital for days.

301
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,939
He's blessed to be alive.

302
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:47,556
- Right, my friend?
- Yeah.

303
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:50,979
After he recovered, we headed back to Bangkok as soon as possible.

304
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:52,556
We were afraid his parents would be worried.

305
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:54,256
Yeah.

306
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,599
Sorry to interrupt.

307
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,649
I'm making a new cocktail here. I need lab rats.

308
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:02,909
Anyone interested?

309
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,429
- Me.
- Me.

310
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,019
I'll go first.

311
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:24,186
You're not Tun, are you?

312
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:30,122
What are you talking about?

313
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,279
The song "Miracle" you just played doesn't exist here.

314
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:38,143
It's from our universe.

315
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:48,359
You know.

316
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,529
I'm like you.

317
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:53,420
I died and traveled between universes, too.

318
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:58,859
Damn! You don't say!

319
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,879
You traveled between universes, too?

320
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:02,379
Yes.

321
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:06,995
Shit! I'm freakin' happy.

322
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:12,759
I'm Talay by the way.

323
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:16,303
How did you die?

324
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,589
I was drunk and had a car crash.

325
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,971
Then I woke up in this body.

326
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,909
I was so stunned.

327
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:30,887
I don't even know how to go back to our universe.

328
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:33,149
Yeah. I get you.

329
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:37,407
There is a way with conditions.

330
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:41,923
I'll explain it to you when I have time.

331
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:48,975
Hey, what did you do for a living in that universe?

332
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:51,889
I was an actor.

333
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:54,230
For real?

334
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:57,235
Which company?

335
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:00,679
GGN.

336
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:03,539
Damn!

337
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,695
That's so dope.

338
00:23:05,695 --> 00:23:08,687
What's your name? I might know you.

339
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,799
I'm not telling you. I don't want a die-hard fan.

340
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,903
Oh, please. Being secretive for what?

341
00:23:16,906 --> 00:23:19,549
Like you're so famous.

342
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:21,376
I'm pretty famous.

343
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:25,819
Let's do this. You call me Tun.

344
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:30,809
And call this guy Pakorn so we don't get confused.

345
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,709
Fine.

346
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,489
Oh. How long have you been in this universe?

347
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:39,451
Over a month.

348
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,800
It might not be that long,

349
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,140
but you can ask me if you have questions.

350
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:47,213
I might have answers.

351
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:51,859
I'll just ask you now.

352
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:53,219
Shoot.

353
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:57,859
If I want to search for something, which search engine should I use?

354
00:23:57,859 --> 00:23:59,956
Judging from what you asked,

355
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:01,936
you couldn't find Google, could you?

356
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:06,002
In this universe, they use Qooqle.

357
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:10,979
What if I want to be an actor?

358
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:13,149
Don't go to the GGN building.

359
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:17,615
Because here, GGN is a company that makes toys.

360
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:20,269
Yes.

361
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:25,619
If you want to be an actor, come to my dad's company, 26 Pictures.

362
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,139
Which doesn't really belong to my real dad.

363
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:30,422
It belongs to this guy's dad.

364
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:44,129
And... what if I have problems one day?

365
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:46,215
Who should I go to?

366
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:53,239
Me.

367
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:03,011
Fine. I'm glad it's you.

368
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:06,189
Let's celebrate then.

369
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:09,059
To our universal-traveling friendship.

370
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:10,209
Drink!

371
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,409
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

372
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,339
Shit!

373
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:58,454
What happened here?

374
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:20,866
What a relief. He still has pants on.

375
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:25,096
Why are you looking at my pants?

376
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:33,767
What happened last night?

377
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:37,055
Why did you crash here?

378
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:42,399
You drank like a fish last night.

379
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:45,155
So I brought you home.

380
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:53,679
Why are we leaving?

381
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,439
I can drink more.

382
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,219
More, my ass.

383
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:59,709
Come on. I'll take you home.

384
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,209
No.

385
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:04,319
I'll stay and celebrate with you.

386
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,439
To be honest,

387
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:09,819
I'm so happy I met you.

388
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,299
Ouch! It hurts.

389
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:18,239
Stand on your feet.

390
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,709
- I'm taking you home.
- Yes.

391
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:22,689
Home.

392
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:24,509
Let's go back to our universe.

393
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,879
But how do we do that?

394
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,715
Can we go back if we kiss?

395
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:37,839
What? It doesn't work.

396
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,075
Let me try again.

397
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:47,789
What?

398
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:51,771
Damn it. We're still here.

399
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,979
Talay.

400
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,429
Talay.

401
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:06,694
I have visions of many bad things.

402
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,987
But can't remember exactly.

403
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:14,349
It's good you can't remember.

404
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:16,169
Why?

405
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:18,939
Did I hurt you in any way?

406
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:20,919
No.

407
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:28,369
But me hurting you sounds more like it.

408
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:31,743
Stop it. You're giving me goosebumps.

409
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:35,689
Why did you mention it in the first place, then?

410
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:41,767
I'm hungry. Any food here?

411
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:45,427
This room was so hot last night.

412
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,709
Wow.

413
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:04,787
It's weird they have cone bread here.

414
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:12,007
Oh, but it's pretty convenient to eat.

415
00:29:12,989 --> 00:29:14,699
Tun.

416
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:16,699
Seriously.

417
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:19,019
What's your real name?

418
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:20,819
Take a guess.

419
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:24,379
I can't even guess what happens in my life.

420
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:27,091
I can't guess yours.

421
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:29,739
Let me give you a clue.

422
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:32,419
My mom named me after a character in a movie.

423
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:34,639
It's the movie that came out the year I was born.

424
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,179
Which is the same as yours. Right?

425
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,359
Right. 1998.

426
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,469
Are you Jack?

427
00:29:43,469 --> 00:29:45,659
"Titanic" was a hit that year.

428
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:46,769
Wrong.

429
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:48,879
Rose then.

430
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:50,699
No.

431
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:56,819
Maybe you're refusing to tell me because your mom likes this movie.

432
00:29:56,819 --> 00:30:00,419
"Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters." Your name is Dang.

433
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:02,167
Dang, my ass.

434
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,649
Besides, "Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters" didn't come out in 1998.

435
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:08,919
But I think Dang Bireley is cool.

436
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,171
Don't you know the famous quote from the movie?

437
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,475
"To be my wife, you must endure."

438
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:40,909
I know.

439
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:45,649
You could've just said it normally.

440
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:47,779
No need to poke your face so close.

441
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:51,445
You bugged me first. I just got a little payback.

442
00:30:52,723 --> 00:30:55,999
Like I felt anything.

443
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:59,720
Do you know what the first thing I'll say to you

444
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,499
if we meet in our universe?

445
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:06,039
- What?
- Dang!

446
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:11,999
Dang!

447
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:14,285
Shut your mouth and eat.

448
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,000
Okay.

449
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:25,849
They said I could get a taxi here.

450
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:29,419
Where is the taxi? There's none.

451
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:30,522
Come on.

452
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:33,525
You live in a fancy condo. Don't you have a car?

453
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,399
I do. It's in the garage.

454
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,379
Tess, the owner of this body, didn't go soft on his car.

455
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:54,539
Need a tuk-tuk ride? It's budget-friendly.

456
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,648
How much to Charoen Krung Road?

457
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:02,599
Free of charge if this man agrees to have a meal with me.

458
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,399
I like you.

459
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:10,644
I'm good. I'm already taken.

460
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:15,529
Oh, come on. The excuse I've used a million times.

461
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:19,495
If you're really taken, then where is the lucky one?

462
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:26,743
Here he is, my boyfriend.

463
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:30,219
What are you freakin' doing, Tun?

464
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:33,289
No need to hide.

465
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,999
We are boyfriends. We've been together forever.

466
00:32:37,796 --> 00:32:42,589
Holding hands? Anyone can do that.

467
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:46,109
I dare you to kiss your boyfriend's cheek.

468
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:47,809
Don't do it.

469
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:50,268
Don't.

470
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,705
- Don't.
- Don't move.

471
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:56,719
Okay! I believe you.

472
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:58,619
Come on. I'll give you a special discount.

473
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:00,627
- Thank you.
- Come on.

474
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,779
See? Trust me and things will be fine.

475
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:07,549
Well, well.

476
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:10,369
I already believe you. No more sweetness needs to be shown.

477
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:12,169
Get in. Let's go.

478
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:18,339
Hold tight. My ride is fast.

479
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:20,979
If you're scared, hug each other. I don't mind.

480
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:22,879
Sure.

481
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,729
If I can make you my wife...

482
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:44,631
Your gear badge is also mine.

483
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:52,963
Shit!

484
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:56,509
There's a password, too? What is this, a spy movie?

485
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:59,019
Shut up. Get in.

486
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:01,729
Why so grumpy?

487
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,499
Ah, I get it now.

488
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:13,279
I need to dream about a place and go to that place.

489
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:15,419
Then I'll be able to go back home. Right?

490
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,499
That's correct.

491
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:25,439
You're right, handsome.

492
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:31,383
I just want the matching system we just built to match you and me.

493
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:33,969
Wait.

494
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:37,109
What matching system?

495
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:38,595
This.

496
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:40,095
Here.

497
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:44,950
You fill in your info in this form

498
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:48,650
and it will match people with similarities.

499
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,419
It might help you find the portkey faster.

500
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,755
I will go prepare it for you.

501
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,987
As for me,

502
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:04,119
any questions at all, feel free to ask.

503
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:08,823
Ask away.

504
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:12,359
Show your face.

505
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,039
Shit.

506
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:17,779
It asks about your favorite movie director.

507
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:19,489
Who should I put?

508
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:23,119
Just answer it. Pick the one who directed your favorite movie.

509
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,115
Do you like Wes Anderson?

510
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:30,139
- I do.
- Really?

511
00:35:31,149 --> 00:35:34,123
Which of his films is your favorite?

512
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:39,159
"The Grand Budapest Hotel."

513
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,619
Like you read my mind.

514
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,519
Why do you like it?

515
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:47,207
I just like it.

516
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:51,816
Have you seen "Her" by Spike Jonze?

517
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,631
I have. I like it, too.

518
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:56,689
We also match here.

519
00:35:56,689 --> 00:35:59,831
Do you like the song "Love" by Paradox?

520
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:06,311
Does it sing...

521
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:12,449
♪ Oh dear love, please look at me ♪

522
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:18,739
♪ Sometimes we meet on a heartbreaking day ♪

523
00:36:35,949 --> 00:36:37,913
Am I right?

524
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,769
Precisely.

525
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:46,459
♪ You come in and embrace me softly ♪

526
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:48,209
Yeah.

527
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:49,741
I like it, too.

528
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,619
Shit!

529
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:55,129
Do you seriously like everything I like?

530
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,339
No. I just said what you wanted to hear.

531
00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:00,319
You seem so happy when you know we share the same interests.

532
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:03,347
It's like you truly believe I'm your portkey.

533
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:06,079
Asshole.

534
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,539
I was happy for nothing.

535
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,419
Once the system completes,

536
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:32,559
we should know who has the potential to be your portkey.

537
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,299
We will meet again then.

538
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:35,839
Okay. Thank you so much.

539
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,539
Thank you.

540
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:47,111
We should go live our lives then.

541
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:51,347
I hope they find your match soon.

542
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:54,049
Me too.

543
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:56,615
I hope you find the right one.

544
00:37:58,219 --> 00:37:59,819
See you.

545
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:02,669
See you.

546
00:38:02,669 --> 00:38:04,269
Good luck.

547
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,909
Tess.

548
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:36,273
What are you standing there for? Come down here and study.

549
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:38,899
Yes.

550
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,599
Quickly.

551
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,411
Why does he look confused?

552
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:11,249
Hey.

553
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,919
I've been meaning to ask.

554
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:18,727
Why is nobody wearing a university uniform?

555
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:22,269
Where on earth have you been?

556
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:25,987
Uniforms were canceled ages ago.

557
00:39:27,419 --> 00:39:29,019
Why?

558
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:31,389
It doesn't have anything to do with studying, does it?

559
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:33,009
It's good they were canceled.

560
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:34,779
Guys!

561
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:37,999
The mid-term exam result just came out.

562
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:39,379
How is it?

563
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:42,295
Kita and I passed by a whisker.

564
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:44,979
And me?

565
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:46,679
Let me check.

566
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,109
Wow, Tess.

567
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:52,189
You're awesome.

568
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,809
Number one of the class?

569
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:56,929
2 out of 30 scores.

570
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:59,019
Damn you, Tess.

571
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:01,449
Why are you so dumb?

572
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:03,169
Just realized that?

573
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:06,359
Do your best on the final exam. You might still have a chance.

574
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:08,781
Though it's very small.

575
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:25,347
Yes, Dol?

576
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:30,263
What? The matching is done?

577
00:41:03,363 --> 00:41:07,835
Wait at the stairs in the middle. Your match will come see you.

578
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,699
Hey.

579
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:49,299
What's the matter with you?

580
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,499
The bees.

581
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:55,239
Be still.

582
00:41:57,779 --> 00:41:59,969
Stay put.

583
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:02,551
I don't want to get stung.

584
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:11,309
Eyes on me.

585
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:13,209
Don't look at them.

586
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:33,763
See? They're gone.

587
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:38,159
Right.

588
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:43,873
How about a thank you?

589
00:42:44,547 --> 00:42:47,519
Thank you, Mr. Smart.

590
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:49,795
Next time, stay still when you're surrounded by bees.

591
00:42:49,795 --> 00:42:52,409
The more you move, the bigger the chance you'll be stung.

592
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:54,009
Yeah.

593
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:02,003
Here. For you.

594
00:43:02,003 --> 00:43:04,382
Hey.

595
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:06,669
Just what I wanted.

596
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:08,369
I'll drink it now.

597
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:14,919
That's it?

598
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:16,941
You said you wanted it.

599
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:20,355
I don't want Tess's body to get fat.

600
00:43:20,355 --> 00:43:22,659
Worried about your looks, huh?

601
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:25,009
Don't use Tess's body as an excuse.

602
00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:27,249
Worried about my health.

603
00:43:27,249 --> 00:43:31,419
Besides, Tess only has a small size of clothes.

604
00:43:31,419 --> 00:43:34,349
This drink has no sugar.

605
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:36,643
Don't be afraid he'll get fat.

606
00:43:37,469 --> 00:43:38,739
Seriously?

607
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:42,071
Yes. You can drink it all.

608
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:45,019
Do it. I bought it for you.

609
00:43:45,019 --> 00:43:47,439
That's it. Drink it. Gulp.

610
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:50,199
Good job.

611
00:44:01,279 --> 00:44:03,409
Stop that.

612
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:04,909
No.

613
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:07,395
I'll keep knocking.

614
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:10,459
It's annoying.

615
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:00,989
Bye. I'm leaving.

616
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,959
Hey! Wait for me.

617
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,603
Hi, Dol.

618
00:45:13,603 --> 00:45:16,509
So is Tun my match?

619
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:20,699
Where are you guys? Your matches can't find you.

620
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:22,539
Huh?

621
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:24,455
Our matches?

622
00:45:25,397 --> 00:45:27,467
I thought Tun was my match.

623
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,599
No! You have your own match.

624
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:34,147
I just told you guys to meet at the same place.

625
00:45:43,729 --> 00:45:45,487
So no?

626
00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:49,819
No. I bet you're happy you're not my match.

627
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:51,769
Who told you?

628
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:53,149
I think...

629
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:55,223
- Hello.
- Hi.

630
00:45:58,232 --> 00:46:00,799
My name is Som. I'm Tun's match.

631
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,769
Which one of you is Tun?

632
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:07,499
That's me.

633
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:11,119
Don't use formal language with me.

634
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,209
We're friends.

635
00:46:12,209 --> 00:46:13,569
Just call me Som.

636
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:16,589
I've been here for two months already. I'm so lonely.

637
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:20,180
Lucky us, they have the matching system

638
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,440
that brought me to meet a hot guy like you, Tun.

639
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:24,739
Should we go?

640
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:26,779
Come on.

641
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:28,379
Let's go.

642
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:31,029
Good luck to you.

643
00:46:45,229 --> 00:46:47,523
And you...

644
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:50,939
Prae.

645
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,639
What?

646
00:46:54,669 --> 00:46:56,069
Prae.

647
00:46:57,475 --> 00:46:59,659
I still can't hear you.

648
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:03,619
Forget it. I'm Talay.

649
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:06,115
Nice to meet you.

650
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:09,069
Sure.

651
00:47:13,409 --> 00:47:14,909
Okay.

652
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:20,799
Well?

653
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:23,539
I saw you have fun talking to her.

654
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:25,699
She's the only one having fun.

655
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:28,169
She didn't give me the chance to speak.

656
00:47:28,169 --> 00:47:32,019
But my match didn't even say a word.

657
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:35,389
I don't think the matching system works.

658
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:37,289
Let me check.

659
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:42,769
Hello, Dol.

660
00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:45,249
Are you sure your system works?

661
00:47:45,249 --> 00:47:48,379
I don't feel like I match her at all.

662
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,499
Hey, it should work.

663
00:47:50,499 --> 00:47:53,699
I was the one who submitted the data into the system.

664
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:58,079
But I have a weird feeling. I don't think it works.

665
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:02,487
If you're not sure, there is a way to check.

666
00:48:03,504 --> 00:48:05,104
How?

667
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:07,624
People in the association have this rumor.

668
00:48:07,624 --> 00:48:10,699
If you and your match enter the maze from a different entrance

669
00:48:10,699 --> 00:48:15,667
and wind up meeting inside, you might be each other's portkey.

670
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,059
Sounds like a fantasy.

671
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:22,159
Is it reliable?

672
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:25,003
Better than not trying at all.

673
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:43,775
This is exciting. The walk to find the true match.

674
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:47,946
Tun, I hope to see you inside.

675
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:53,859
So should we start from different entrances?

676
00:48:53,859 --> 00:48:57,051
Sure. I'll use this entrance.

677
00:48:57,051 --> 00:48:58,839
Bye, guys.

678
00:49:01,379 --> 00:49:04,587
I'll go that way.

679
00:49:17,569 --> 00:49:20,539
I'll go in from here.

680
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:23,529
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

♫ It's like encountering a light that helps show the way ♫

682
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:46,280
♫ Making me feel different ♫

683
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:18,479
I'm starting to lose hope of ever finding the portkey.

684
00:52:18,479 --> 00:52:21,268
It's extremely difficult to match someone.

685
00:52:21,268 --> 00:52:24,419
When he comes, he comes.

686
00:52:24,419 --> 00:52:29,329
Don't tell me after spending time together,

687
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:32,487
we turn out to be each other's portkey.

688
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:35,099
That's not a problem.

689
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:36,829
If it's you,

690
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:38,570
I'm okay.

♫ Make today different from yesterday
It's like encountering a light that helps show the way ♫

♫ Making me feel different ♫

693
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:07,780
♫ Is it you? The person I've been searching for a long time for ♫

694
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,240
♫ Have I found, Have I found ♫

695
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:18,020
♫ Someone who will be ready to walk through this side by side with me from now on ♫

696
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:23,100
​♫ Is it you? That won't let me be sad ♫

697
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:29,390
♫ After a night of nightmares, making every tomorrow look bright ♫

698
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:35,830
♫ Forever, please tell me to be confident ♫

699
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:39,640
♫ That you won't go and leave me ♫
