1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,456
Have you seen Tun?

2
00:00:01,456 --> 00:00:02,560
Didn't he tell you?

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,360
He went out of town.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,937
He went to a beach in Aou's hometown.

5
00:00:05,937 --> 00:00:09,470
It seemed like I was surrounded by many people.

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,220
But in fact, I had no one in my life.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,263
So I always thought, I wanted to wake up

8
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:19,988
and see that someone was waiting for me.

9
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:22,400
Can you be that person for me?

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,900
Sure.

11
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,900
Pretty.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,360
Yes, it is pretty.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,300
And you're being too obsessed with the poster.

14
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,040
Hey.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,163
Here.

16
00:00:40,163 --> 00:00:42,500
I just finished the poster.

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,210
What do you think?

18
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,690
Damn!

19
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,490
Nice.

20
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,580
Of course, it is. Tess designed it himself.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,620
I don't want to compliment you two anymore.

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,240
Show your love somewhere else. It stinks.

23
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,950
How is the editing going?

24
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,050
A lot better than I expected.

25
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,280
The love scene got me biting my pillow.

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,920
As if the screenwriters were so deep in love.

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,470
Damn right!

28
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,840
If you tell me to rewrite the script now, it'd be even deeper in love.

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,020
Right, Tess?

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,420
Right, my ass.

31
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,060
Hey, the editing is almost done.

32
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,560
Can you recommend any colorist to take on the job?

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,920
There's just one person that comes to mind.

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,620

38
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,990
I bought you snacks.

39
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,590
Okay.

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,868
Wow! This scene's color grading is excellent.

41
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,550
Are you in love or something?

42
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,440
Go away. Don't distract me.

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm trying to focus.

44
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,610
Don't be so mean.

45
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,190
I bought us our favorite snack.

46
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,690
This.

47
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,960
Oh, I'm working.

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,660
Feed me.

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,560
Aw! How cute!

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,919
- You mean me?
- The film you're grading.

51
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,760
You can't sleep at night if you don't get to bug me, can you?

52
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,610
I'm kidding.

53
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,952
You're actually cuter than the colors you're grading.

54
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:46,968
When will I get to eat? I'm waiting.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,044

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,543
Feeding, my foot! You're making a mess.

59
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,920
Wait. What are you looking for?

60
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,950
A napkin.

61
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,650
No need.

62
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,520
Softer than the one from the package.

63
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,227
You've got something there, too.

64
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:44,680
I've got what?

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,890
- Come here.
- I've got nothing.

66
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,690
I have now.

67
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,540
That's my boy.

68
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,400
He's been here for a long time.

69
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
No one has shown an interest in adopting him yet?

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,411
No. No one has.

71
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,532
How are you? Did you miss me?

72
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,680
I'll leave you two be. Be right back.

73
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
- Sure.
- Sure.

74
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,830
We've been here many times, but don't know what to call him.

75
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,856
Should... we name him?

76
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,483
We better not. Or we might get attached to him.

77
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,940
Come on. Just for fun.

78
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,070
He looks a bit silly.

79
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,050
Should we call him Aou?

80
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,200
Bastard.

81
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,210
I think Fuse suits him better.

82
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,560
Nah! It sounds too handsome, rich, and charming for him.

83
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,130
What confidence.

84
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,310
We found him on the street. How about "On the Way?"

85
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,560
On the Way isn't a name.

86
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,096
- Street?
- Too blunt.

87
00:05:58,096 --> 00:05:59,530
God Save?

88
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,300
He's not saved by God. He's saved by you.

89
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,676
That's true.

90
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,380
- Lucky.
- My name is Fuse.

91
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,051
I mean his name, not yours.

92
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,872
Why Lucky though?

93
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,330
Look at him.

94
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,380
He got hit by a car, all covered in blood, but he managed to survive.

95
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,912
I think the name fits him.

96
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,067
Damn it!

97
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,700
Did I just name him?

98
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,400
Yeah.

99
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:36,840
Now we're connected, Lucky.

100
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:42,400
Actually, he's fully recovered.

101
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,100
Really?

102
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,440
You said no one has confirmed to adopt him. Right?

103
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,942
Many people reached out, but none of them has confirmed to do so.

104
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,760
Can I adopt him then?

105
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,150
Really? That's wonderful.

106
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,310
Have you named him yet?

107
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,440

may I have someone from Friend Credits up here to talk about the movie?

- You surely did.

I'm sure you'll be famous because of this.

171
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,243
Look. You like the colors I did there?

172
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,033
Do I still need to say?

173
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:04,031
They are very beautiful.

174
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,100
Thank you.

175
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,190
Guys, whether our movie is a box office success or not,

176
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,280
I'm glad we did our best to get it into theaters.

177
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,500
Right.

178
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,404
You guys are the reason I want to live long and do what I love.

179
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:53,939
And you guys make me realize what I actually love.

180
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,150
Come on.

181
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,210
It's just water, but cheers anyway!

182
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,348
Cheers!

183
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,600
What are you doing, Tun?

184
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,660
Cleaning your face. It's a mess.

185
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,110
Why now?

186
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,780
You can do it at home.

187
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,810
I've prepared it for you.

188
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,828
As I know we have lots to do today.

189
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,100
It's such a long day for you.

190
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,660
And with all the dust,

191
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,380
we should wipe it off right away.

192
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,970
Why?

193
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,052
You can't take it when I look bad just for a second?

194
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,960
It's not that.

195
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,224
I'm not cleaning it because I'm afraid you'd look bad.

196
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,372
I just want to take care of you.

197
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,200
Thank you...

198
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,492
for cleaning my face,

199
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,280
and for...

200
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,072
cleaning off my dusty heart.

201
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,752
It's now back in use again.

202
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,070
Aou!

203
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,737
Is there any stain on my face?

204
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:24,920
Where? Let me see.

205
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,120
Right here, my friend.

206
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,296
- Here?
- Yes.

207
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:29,300
Let me wipe it for you.

208
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,680
Aou, can you wipe away the dust in my heart?

209
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,730
- Why?
- I want to bring it back to life.

210
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,001
Let me clean it for you.

211
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,140
Hey, I can't hide my excitement.

212
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,120
I didn't expect many people to love our movie.

213
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,480
Don't speak too soon.

214
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,550
Wait until you read the critiques from the movie review pages.

215
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,200
It will turn out fine. Trust me.

216
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,750
The script you wrote is great.

217
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,540
No. It's because your color grading is great.

218
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,560
Because your dialogues are heartfelt.

219
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,002
Can I get a reward from you then?

220
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,960
What do you want?

221
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,870
Can I use your bathtub tonight?

222
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,340
Sure.

223
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,368
I'm not done.

224
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,690
Can I use it with you?

225
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,570
Tun, you asshole.

226
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,936
What? You already agreed to it. Don't break your word.

227
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:27,740
No!

228
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,570
I missed your bathtub so much.

229
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,018
Take a bath only.

230
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:37,420
Of course. What else do you think I'll do?

231
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,656
Be quiet.

232
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:42,110
I can't be.

233
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,910
Because I'm reading the movie feedback on the pages.

234
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,200
Let's read it together.

235
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,750
I left my phone outside.

236
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,060
Let me go grab it.

237
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,100
Hey.

238
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,067
No need. Read it with me.

239
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:03,440
Look.

240
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,890
Nung Tid Mun says that the movie has an interesting point.

241
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,240
How the story is told differs from other movies.

242
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,883
The romantic scene is fulfilling.

243
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:13,459
We get 10 out of 10.

244
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,040
It says here that the movie has a little dark comedy.

245
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,930
9 out of 10.

246
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,792
Damn!

247
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:28,510
Movie Seer says the characters and how we present the story are both outstanding.

248
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,390
It's an up-and-coming Thai movie of the year.

249
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,470
The screenwriters have done a much better job than in their last movie.

250
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,863
10 out of 10.

251
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:39,080
Holy shit!

252
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,568
We won Khai and Third's hearts.

253
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,240
You just rewarded me.

254
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,144
Can I reward you back?

255
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,252
What is my reward?

256
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,992
Thank you for everything.

257
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,852
Thank you, too.

258
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,640
Lucky, come here. Good boy.

259
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,574
I thought I adopted only one.

260
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:28,440
When did that become two?

261
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,300
Do you want to get bitten?

262
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,620
Lucky, come to Daddy.

263
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,510
Don't play with this aggressive dog.

264
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, well.

265
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,350
It's good you adopted Lucky.

266
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,820
You know I wanted to have a dog as a kid.

267
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,340
I wanted to take my pet everywhere with me.

268
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,400
But my dad wouldn't allow me to do it.

269
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,460
What a shame.

270
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,033
- Whatever!
- What?

271
00:19:52,033 --> 00:19:54,590
Who would want to take their pet everywhere?

272
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,090
A lot of people.

273
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,160
I have an example here. You!

274
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,490
You asked me to drag you everywhere.

275
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,540
No! I take you everywhere.

276
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,770
You're my dog.

277
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,729
- You're my dog!
- You're my dog.

278
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:07,185
You're my dog. Hand!

279
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:08,596
Come on.

280
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,510
Fine!

281
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,640
Here.

282
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,980
Good boy. Now, get down.

283
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,232
I don't know how to get down, but I know how to attack.

284
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,240
Fuse!

285
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,480
What are you doing?

286
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,760
Get off me.

287
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,380
- Eat this.
- You eat it.

288
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,030
Open your mouth.

289
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,030
Do it.

290
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,450
Can I get this one and this one, please?

291
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,640
Absolutely.

292
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,377
The film Romantic Non Comedy has been a huge success.

293
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,640
After only one week in theaters,

294
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,630
the film has already grossed 10 million.

295
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,352
This is an interesting miraculous event.

296
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,480
Excuse me.

297
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,800
Yes?

298
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,000
Can I get these cotton candy bread, too?

299
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,470
Sure. How many pieces?

300
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,640
All of it.

301
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,160
All of it?

302
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,320
Excuse me.

303
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,710
Yes?

304
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,030
If you have more, I'll take more.

305
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,370
Of course.

306
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,770
Thank you.

307
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,064
Mek recommended this black and white film.

308
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:29,340
You want to watch it?

309
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,260
Yeah.

310
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,950
I read the synopsis. Pretty promising.

311
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,330
Let's watch it.

312
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,830
Hey.

313
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,750
Should we guess the real colors of the film?

314
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,220
I couldn't even guess what you look like.

315
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,420
I can't guess its colors.

316
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,190
What is the color of that tree's leaves?

317
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,700
Damn you!

318
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,248
Language!

319
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,968
You can't curse at someone you like.

320
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,970
What's her shirt's color?

321
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,500
Based on my extensive experience,

322
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,644
I'm sure it's yellow.

323
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,460
Not even close.

324
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,620
It's blue.

325
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,493
Wait. How do you know?

326
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,920
There are like 100 behind-the-scenes pictures on the director's personal website.

327
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,382
You're a cheater.

328
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:36,675
I'm not. You're the only one guessing here.

329
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,280
Now try guessing the color of the building in this scene.

330
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,580
Pink.

331
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,280
Spot on.

332
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
Of course.

333
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,240
How about the girl's high heels?

334
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Pink.

335
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,833
No. They're green.

336
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,810
And her bow?

337
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,820
Pink.

338
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,072
And there, her scarf is also pink.

339
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,880
The balloon behind the kid is pink as well.

340
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,590
What is it with you and the pink color?

341
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,543
I'm just saying. It's your favorite color after all.

342
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,320
Says who? You also like pink.

343
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,880
I've told you many times I dislike pink.

344
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,412
Oh, yeah?

345
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,550
Think again.

346
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,450
You've been involving yourself with pink more often.

347
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,100
Like when you're grading the movie colors, you went with pink more.

348
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,430
For some stuff you use, you choose pink.

349
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,830
Really?

350
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,992
I didn't realize that.

351
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,530
Talay,

352
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,690
have you ever heard of the Pink Theory?

353
00:23:57,627 --> 00:23:59,070
No.

354
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,050
The Pink Theory talks about

355
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:05,210
color blending when two worlds become one.

356
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,123
When two people meet.

357
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:09,160
To give you an example,

358
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,500
I like pink.

359
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,548
When you and I start to like each other, you start to focus more on the pink color.

360
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,676
Anything in pink that you see will remind you more of me.

361
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,930
That's Pakorn's.

362
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,760
That's why I wear it.

363
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:33,650
The special strawberry smoothie from me.

364
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,980
And then, you become fond of the color without knowing it.

365
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,140
Because you see me in that pink color you see.

366
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,430
♫ It's like my room has changed color ♫

367
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:57,450
♫ It is too beautiful to be found anywhere else ♫

368
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:06,480
♫ Oh, the time has stopped moving. This city is no longer lonely ♫

369
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,080
Hey!

370
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,160
Is pink something that can take us home?

371
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,410
How?

372
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:24,810
You and I don't share the same interests at all.

373
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:29,090
But this is the first thing we both really like.

374
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:34,567
♫ Just today I have you ♫

375
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,570
To our universal-traveling friendship.

376
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,620
Cheers!

377
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,803
A pink trumpet tree.

378
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:44,303
Won't you be happy to wake up and see a pretty pink tree?

379
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,240
I don't like pink.

380
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,143
Why so much bacon?

381
00:25:50,143 --> 00:25:54,690
You keep saying you hate pink, so I gave you a lot.

382
00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,140
♫ I will hold you and never let you go ♫

383
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,920
♫ Because today is not a dream ♫

384
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:04,730
Who was that mean person you talked about?

385
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,912
The one I'm hitting on.

386
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,440
I think I found something that has linked us for a long time.

387
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,970
Just like Dol said.

388
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,224
If we're each other's portkeys, there will be something that connects us.

389
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Have we really found it?

390
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,530
You guys asked me here to just lie down?

391
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,730
No.

392
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,084
We asked you here because we have good news.

393
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:01,688
Now we know for sure we're each other's portkeys.

394
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,840
See?

395
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,980
I told you. You guys were right for each other.

396
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,640
What are you going to do now?

397
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:25,780
We'll probably live on together until we dream and go home.

398
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,450
Right.

399
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,550
We don't know when that will happen,

400
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,004
so we took this chance to say goodbye to you, just in case.

401
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,060
Joob would be so delighted if she were still here.

402
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,676
If she knew you two would return home.

403
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,500
Good luck.

404
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,650
I wish you two the best.

405
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,240
I hope to see you guys again.

406
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,212
I'm off to work now.

407
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,636
Wait, Dol.

408
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,980
I'm really grateful to you.

409
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,896
If I didn't meet you at the hospital that day,

410
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:27,530
I'd have had no idea how my life here would be.

411
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:30,300
That's right.

412
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,000
You and Joob are my great benefactors.

413
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,432
Thank you so much.

414
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,690
Why that face?

415
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,190
I don't plan to say a sad goodbye.

416
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,528
Why did you drag me to this? Come here.

417
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,700
Don't forget about me.

418
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,080
Don't forget me.

419
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,560
We promise.

420
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,900
We won't forget about you.

421
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:18,280
I submitted our film to the Kannes Film Festival.

422
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,000
I like the name so much.

423
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,960
It reminds me of the Cannes Film Festival.

424
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,480
I just hope it gets to show.

425
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,284
For once in a lifetime, our movie is part of a film festival.

426
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,570
Shit! They have replied.

427
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:46,488
What did they say?

428
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,410
It won't get to show.

429
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:04,400
Damn. No?

430
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,610
It won't get to show only in Bangkok,

431
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,630
but in Kanchanaburi as well.

432
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,359
Damn you! Did you just fool me?

433
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,550
Shit!

434
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,870
Our movie will be shown at a festival.

435
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,412
Just like you dreamed it, Talay.

436
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:48,220
You had all the time in the world, but decided to pack one night before?

437
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,580
I've been lazy.

438
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,600
Here. I'm done packing.

439
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,500
Wired charger and the portable charger?

440
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,078
- All set.
- Boxers?

441
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,938
Here.

442
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:02,024
Pakorn's favorite.

443
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,670
Nice, huh?

444
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,120
Toothbrush?

445
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,610
Hey, I forgot. It's in the bathroom.

446
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,280
Let's go brush our teeth first then.

447
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,340
Here. I'll teach you how to brush your teeth.

448
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,448
Are you a kindergarten teacher to give a lesson?

449
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,850
Hey, I'm a pro.

450
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,031
Always included in the actors with beautiful smiles poll.

451
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,050
You said people called you Solemn Face.

452
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,072
I do smile for someone I like.

453
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,290
Wait.

454
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,670
Follow my demonstration, Talay.

455
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,308
Yes, Teacher Tun.

456
00:32:15,973 --> 00:32:18,332
Now wash it off.

457
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,410
You can go to bed.

458
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,020
I'll be just downstairs. Don't wait for me.

459
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,760
Where are you going?

460
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,183
It'll be just a moment. I'll be right back.

461
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,743
I heard you guys are camping out.

462
00:33:35,743 --> 00:33:38,657
I've got you a mosquito repellent.

463
00:33:38,657 --> 00:33:42,020
Here are some snacks I bought for you.

464
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,970
Share them with your friends and have fun traveling.

465
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:50,020
Mom and I are very proud of you, Tun.

466
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,520
Thank you.

467
00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:04,779
Do you remember the days you wondered why I'd changed?

468
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,560
I do.

469
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,790
You were really awkward then.

470
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,248
You didn't remember anything about your family.

471
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
What if I say...

472
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,200
the person sitting in front of you here isn't Tun?

473
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,000
He's someone else.

474
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,416
Will you still love and feel proud of me?

475
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,032
Tun, why would you ask that?

476
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,096
Ah, the plot for your next film, huh?

477
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,879
Right. I'm trying to get some ideas.

478
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,220
If you really were someone else,

479
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,796
I'd love you and be proud of you even more.

480
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,550
Why?

481
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,120
Because you try so hard

482
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,600
even though this is not your true body.

483
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,360
You live Tun's life and give Tun's movie an award.

484
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,424
It isn't easy, son.

485
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,420
You're great.

486
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,136
So great.

487
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,712
Why are you crying?

488
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,440
Are you so into the plot?

489
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,330
Very much so.

490
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,740
In my head,

491
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,970
the one in Tun's body is returning home.

492
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,384
So he wants to say goodbye to your both.

493
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,064
I love you.

494
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:03,440
Gosh, my son.

495
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,220
You're working too hard on your screenplay.

496
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,370
You become weirder every day.

497
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:13,560
How about we share our positive energy?

498
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,140
Group hug. Come here.

499
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,503
Let's hug.

500
00:36:17,503 --> 00:36:19,550
We love you so much.

501
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,420
I love you, Tun.

502
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,733
So much.

503
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:25,070
Ever since the first day.

504
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,670
Come on.

505
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:36,440
Kannes Film Festival, I'm ready for you!

506
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,820
Ready to watch the film?

507
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,000
Ready to get an award.

508
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,110
My right hand is ready to grab the Golden Cassava Trophy.

509
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:47,630
I'll say a nice speech and walk off the stage charmingly.

510
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,050
Let me warm up my voice for now.

511
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,136
Do-do-do.

512
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,670
Hey.

513
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,220
Do you look good now?

514
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,370
No way.

515
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,868
Your suit tilts.

516
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,188
How nice it is to have you as my personal stylist.

517
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,420
Can I reward you with a kiss?

518
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,644
Kiss my foot!

519
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,830
Let's go.

520
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,200
You look good now, the protagonist.

521
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,100
Let's go inside.

522
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:41,440
You look good, too.

523
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,268
It's the truth.

524
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,650
Hey!

525
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:55,078
You two just stop flirting.

526
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:57,460
The event is about to start. Come on.

527
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,250
Come on!

528
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,010
Look at the hand that was so ready to grab the trophy, Up.

529
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,250
All I see is emptiness.

530
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,640
I thought we'd surely get it.

531
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,640
Last night, in my dream, my hand was holding a trophy.

532
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
My right hand.

533
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,932
I should have bribed the judges.

534
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,943
Just kidding.

535
00:38:24,943 --> 00:38:27,300
It's all right, guys.

536
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,550
Who knows?

537
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:32,560
In another universe, we might even get a Golden Palm.

538
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,540
Golden Palm?

539
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,984
Even bigger than a cassava.

540
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:46,332
We're so great already to make it this far.

541
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,520
That's right.

542
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,920
We might not get an award today but if I get to make movies again,

543
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,650
all the trophies from every category will be mine.

544
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,820
Sleep and dream about it, Aou.

545
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,650
Let's get back. I want to camp out already.

546
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,293
Let's go then.

547
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:08,283
Get up.

548
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,590
[Friend Credits]

549
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,400
It's time!

550
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,527
Let's take down the wishes that have already come true.

551
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:23,235
I'll go first. One of my wishes has already come true.

552
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,890
I wished for our movie to be shown at the Kannes Film Festival.

553
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:35,640
And it was a success!

554
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,532
Mine is right here.

555
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,268
My wish was...

556
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,870
to get a dog.

557
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,420
Wait.

558
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,210
When did you even have a dog, Aou?

559
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,576
He's Fuse's dog.

560
00:39:54,576 --> 00:39:56,500
He has one in his mouth.

561
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,170
Damn you.

562
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,000
He's like my dog.

563
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,790
I'm the one taking care of the dog.

564
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,510
- What?
- What's stuck in your throat?

565
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,112
Tess, what's your wish?

566
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,068
I wished to find the port...

567
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,128
Someone I like.

568
00:40:31,136 --> 00:40:35,320
And I've found him.

569
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,870
Gosh! People in love stink.

570
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,470
- Let's skip to Tun.
- Right.

571
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,380
Tun has just one wish there.

572
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,780
Go.

573
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,056
Mine has already come true as well.

574
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,280
Aren't you gonna say what you wished for?

575
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,920
Don't break the rule.

576
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,900
Tell us.

577
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,670
I won't.

578
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,350
Tess is the only one allowed to know.

579
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,220
They've got a secret.

580
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,610
Guys.

581
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,247
Pan-grilled pork is ready. Let's celebrate.

582
00:41:26,247 --> 00:41:28,689
Pan-grilled pork?

583
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:30,190
What is it?

584
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,850
I didn't know it either at first.

585
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:35,340
But Tess said it was traditional food of a tribe overseas.

586
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,650
We grill the pork on a pan until it's cooked.

587
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,400
Then we dip it in a sauce.

588
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,820
It's so good.

589
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,520
Try it.

590
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,093
You lied to them.

591
00:41:46,093 --> 00:41:48,651
It isn't tribal food.

592
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,136
I couldn't say it's food from the other universe, could I?

593
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,520
Right.

594
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,200
Guys, let's go. I'm starving.

595
00:42:00,032 --> 00:42:01,680
Come on. Time to eat.

596
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,010
Pan-grilled pork is so good. Trust me.

597
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,216
Pan-grilled pork?

598
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,904
I had no idea there was a thing called pan-grilled pork in this world.

599
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,290
It's freaking good.

600
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,920
Can we make it again some other time?

601
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,304
I'm afraid we won't get the chance to do so.

602
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,120
Why not?

603
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:38,920
I just feel like we're growing up every day.

604
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:44,248
We have our dreams and burdens to handle.

605
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,676
We might not get a chance to gather like this again.

606
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:55,092
When that day comes, will you be okay?

607
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,640
It'll be sad.

608
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,570
I don't know if we get a chance

609
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,580
to do anything like this again.

610
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,490
I just want you all to know

611
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,160
no matter how much time passes,

612
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,436
the memories we have today will remain.

613
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,190
I just hope, in the future, when you guys look back,

614
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,852
you will see us when we're happy together, just like today.

615
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,003
Clearly.

616
00:43:42,003 --> 00:43:44,983
Are you quitting this job for good?

617
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,292
It sounds like a farewell.

618
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,348
It isn't a farewell.

619
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,624
I'll be just right here, always.

620
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,320
And forever.

621
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,790
I love you all.

622
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,880
I don't know if that's a farewell or not.

623
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,860
But it's damn touching.

624
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,760
Guys. Group hug.

625
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,660
I love you all.

626
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,956
I love you all!

627
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,892
Cheers!

628
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,784
Are you secretly crying here all alone?

629
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,780
No.

630
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,972
I've just got dust in my eyes.

631
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,820
You're such a bad liar.

632
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,880
If the stars have their own color,

633
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:30,776
what color should they each have?

634
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,480
I can't think of it.

635
00:45:39,264 --> 00:45:42,160
But the color that stands out to me...

636
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,120
is the one you asked me to name in Rawi's Palette color system.

637
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,740
Have you heard of Pantone?

638
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,770
The color matching system?

639
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:54,837
Right.

640
00:45:54,837 --> 00:45:59,371
I like to see people through Pantone colors.

641
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,963
What about me?

642
00:46:01,963 --> 00:46:03,763
I don't know.

643
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,496
What should we name this color system?

644
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,820
Rawi.

645
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,740
How about Rawi's Palette?

646
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,340
Rawi's Palette?

647
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:21,128
The color system you invented.

648
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,064
I now can think of the color.

649
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,676
Its first color.

650
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,880
Really? What color?

651
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:40,960
It's the color that makes me feel the longing...

652
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,220
and the warmth.

653
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:53,404
Sometimes it makes me feel love.

654
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,468
Pink.

655
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,360
Our color.

656
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,160
Right.

657
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:10,060
I named this color "Shy".

658
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,852
Why did you call it that?

659
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:20,708
Because sometimes it's shy,

660
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,980
but so damn cute.

661
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,060
You mean you or me?

662
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,072
Thank you so much though.

663
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,532
I love the name a lot.

664
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:57,136
All of a sudden, I feel like I'm an important person in this world.

665
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,944
You're exaggerating.

666
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:13,968
Do you remember the movie's ending scene we talked about?

667
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,550
Of course, I do.

668
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:37,624
What do think our ending will be like?

669
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,204
Everyone wants a happy ending.

670
00:48:44,357 --> 00:48:51,947
But I think life isn't that easy.

671
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,760
What you said is right.

672
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,860
Even so, I like the dialogue in our movie's ending scene anyway.

673
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:09,944
"Though we aren't together tomorrow,

674
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:14,784
you're always here in my memories."

675
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:34,820
♫ There's only you here, I'm not going anywhere ♫

676
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,360
♫ With you right here by my side ♫

677
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:43,930
♫ Forever, not expecting anything more than this ♫

678
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:53,570
♫ There's only you here. Whatever happens, I won't be afraid ♫

679
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:59,170
♫ Just having you here by my side ♫

680
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:06,524
I don't know when we will get to go home.

681
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,520
But no matter where you'll be,

682
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:17,656
I promise I'll look for you.

683
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:30,010
If I tell you my name,

684
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:34,892
will you promise to name my color?

685
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,800
Before we go back,

686
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,640
I want you to know my real name.

687
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,020
Maybe you can find me first.

688
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,720
My name is...

689
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,720
Tun. Tun. Tun. Tun.

690
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,210
I dreamed.

691
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,860
Shit! I just dreamed.

692
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,980
We're going home.

693
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,680
Tun!

694
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,170
Holy shit!

695
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,930
I dreamed too, Tess!

696
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,620
We're finally back in our universe.

697
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,622
What?

698
00:52:07,622 --> 00:52:09,522
Don't tell me...

699
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,656
you're Pakorn.

700
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,780
Yes, I am Pakorn.

701
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,576
Are you Talay?

702
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,804
That means...

703
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,064
You and Tess aren't back home yet.

704
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,260
Hey! This too.

705
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,776
It tastes just like when I was filming in our universe.

706
00:53:47,776 --> 00:53:50,416
Mafia the Movie, Scene 2, Cut 1, Take 1.

707
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:53,128
And... action.

708
00:53:54,128 --> 00:54:00,888
I remember I made all the crew's mouths water.

709
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,420
Poor them.

710
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,584
You're such a cruel actor.

711
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:16,016
I'll not share it with you anymore then.

712
00:54:16,016 --> 00:54:18,810
I'm doing this for that crew.

713
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,496
Are you sulking?

714
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,960
If I get to go back to that universe,

715
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,195
I will miss this universe so much.

716
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,310
Tun hasn't told me his real name.

717
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,310
Do you know his name?

718
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:24,000
I think he's trying to tell you.

719
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,920
Just like Dol said.

720
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,850
You must dream and go to that placein order to return.

721
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:31,870
I finally found you.

722
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,210
What the heck are you doing, Pakorn?

723
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,950
Are you Tess?

724
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:39,298
Yes.

725
00:56:39,298 --> 00:56:41,098
Tess.

726
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:49,200
♫ I want you to trust me and hold onto my hand ♫

727
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:54,440
♫ From now on, the path we take is ours ♫

728
00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:01,200
♫ It's because of you that gave today meaning ♫

729
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:10,740
♫ And you just made me learn my own worth ♫

730
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,550
♫ There's only you here, I'm not going anywhere ♫

731
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:18,150
♫ With you right here by my side ♫

732
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:23,650
♫ Forever, not expecting anything more than this ♫

733
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:32,790
♫ There's only you here. Whatever happens, I won't be afraid ♫

734
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:39,750
♫ Just having you here by my side ♫
