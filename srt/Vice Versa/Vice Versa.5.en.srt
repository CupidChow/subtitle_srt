How about we fall in love with each other?

No.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,520
We can just fake it.

4

Love isn't something you can fake.

5
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,140
Will you forgive me?

6
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,443
Are you messing with me again?

I'm not messing with you this time.

The screenplay comment from Tess's dad will be here in a minute.

I edited it like 10 times.

If he wants another edit, then I won't know what to do.

11

I know!

12

There's one thing we can do.

I did it before and it worked.

Trust me. Close your eyes. Hands together.

Quickly. Why don't you do it?

The first comment.

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,560
This is his favorite of the three movie titles we proposed.

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,820
"Long Distance Relationship."

28
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,720
Damn it!

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,760
"My Dear" and "Near and Far" that I proposed were even better.

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,620
"My Dear" and "Near and Far," my ass!

31
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,220
He's right to choose that one.

What's wrong with it?

33

- I'll continue.
- My titles are cool.

The second comment.

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,040
He says it's romantic and complete. It passes.

No.

46
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:11,383
Kissing you.

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,680
It helped me improve my screenwriting so much.

48

What the heck are you doing, Tun?

49
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,020
You said you weren't messing with me.

I'm not.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,340
I kissed you because I felt like kissing you.

52

Well, well!

53
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,600
If I were the female lead and got kissed like that,

54

I wouldn't have been captivated.

Chang?

65
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,420
I heard he's funny, calm, and easy to talk to.

66
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,023
It should be an easy job for us.

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,580
Aou, are you nuts? He isn't calm at all.

74
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,141
- Polite. Nice. Friendly.
- I don't know.

75

I heard that.

That nice guy was me before I got married.

What are you doing?

173
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,940
Stop bugging me.

174
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,580
(I like your name.)

175
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,280
Dol is calling.

176
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,140
Hello.

177
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,080
What? At the association now?

178
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:11,980
Dol, hello.

179
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,420
- Hi.
- Hi.

180
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,940
It's nothing serious.

181
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,983
I just want to introduce you guys to someone.

182
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:21,300
A new member?

183
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,623
An old member. She just doesn't come very often.

184
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,100
There she is.

185
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,880
Why do I feel like she's giving familiar vibes?

186
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,020
Do you have the same feeling?

187
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,660
No.

188
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,160
Yeah?

189
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,960
Maybe it's just me who thinks she's special.

190
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:06,771
Hello.

191
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,500
Pang, these are the new guys.

192
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,420
This is Talay and that one is anonymous,but he's the body of Tun.

193
00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:20,680
Nice to meet both of you.

194
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,980
She's a yoga instructor.

195
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,363
But in the other universe, she's an actress. Just like you, Tun.

196
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:29,443
I wonder if you guys have met.

197
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,140
Don't tell me you are...

198
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,940
Pang Piyada.

199
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,940
I am.

200
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,960
Have we worked together?

201
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,980
In that series produced by Chod.

202
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,300
We had many scenes together.

203
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,640
Hold on. I'm getting something.

204
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,760
So you are...

205
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,423
Hey! Let's discuss it over there.

206
00:14:33,423 --> 00:14:35,463
I remember you.

207
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,980
How weird.

208
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,120
He doesn't want me to know his name.

209
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,500
No. I mean it's weird he's smiling.

210
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,020
He normally has no facial expression, but now he's smiling widely.

211
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,700
I think they're pretty close.

212
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,140
The series crew gave him a nickname. "Solemn Face."

213
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,880
Because he always made a cold and solemn face on set.

214
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,580
Pang, that's enough.

215
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,060
Just eat. Don't talk so much.

216
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,400
By the way, how am I doing in the other universe?

217
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,780
You've had lots of work.

218
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:28,000
As for your love, did you...

219
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,960
Did you break up with Ben?

220
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,800
Yes.

221
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,665
But not long after that, you dated someone from the same company.

222
00:15:36,665 --> 00:15:38,140
A man four years younger.

223
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,180
Oops!

224
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,320
This yoga instructor is pretty hot.

225
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,820
But that's good.

226
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,720
I've always wanted to date younger boys.

227
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,160
Come by the association more often.

228
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,560
Talay and I come from time to time.

229
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,380
I can't.

230
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,220
I scheduled more acting classes to teach.

231
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,860
Do you want to help me teach?

232
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,220
Oh, no way.

233
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,500
My acting skills are gone. All I do these days is screenwriting.

234
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,643
- Right?
- Don't be modest.

235
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:10,806
I'm serious.

236
00:16:10,806 --> 00:16:12,689
When you're free, come help me.

237
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,672
I lost my skills. I only write screenplays these days.

238
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:15,963
- I don't believe you.
- It's true.

239
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:17,863
Right, Talay?

240
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,020
You're in such a good mood.

241
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:34,360
The song is nice.

242
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,840
Don't. You've been hyped up since you met Pang.

243
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:45,051
Since you've met her, you might as well spend more time with her.

244
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,240
She's probably your portkey.

245
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,300
Why would you think that?

246
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
I don't know.

247
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,888
I just have the feeling.

248
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,020
You guys seem to get along well.

249
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,940
You have many connections.

250
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,630
You said it yourself...

251
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,120
that she's got something special.

252
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,780
Well, that's true.

253
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,800
But I don't want to pinpoint that she's my portkey just yet.

254
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,160
- Tun.
- Huh?

255
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,110
If you found your portkey one day,

256
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,240
would you go back immediately?

257
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,540
Do you want me to wait?

258
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,240
No.

259
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,300
I just want to know.

260
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,980
I don't know.

261
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,920
But if you have a chance to go back one day,

262
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,160
don't wait for me.

263
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,220
Don't throw away your dream just to wait for me.

264
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,880
That answer means you won't wait for me. Right?

265
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,520
Thanks for the ride.

266
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,560
Bye. See you.

267
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,760
(I'll wait...)

268
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,460
(to go back...)

269
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,240
(with you.)

270
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,460
Honey, I'm at the movie set working.

271
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,760
You're being silly. I'll talk to you later.

272
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Bye-bye.

273
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,120
Chang, hello.

274
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

275
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,180
Where are the other two?

276
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,260
Up and Aou will come in the next queue.

277
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,820
We are taking turns.

278
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,480
Okay. We'll worry about that later.

279
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,600
Chang, we got a problem.

280
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,200
The weather forecast says it'll be snowing in 10 minutes.

281
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,040
The weather forecast in this country is damn accurate.

282
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,580
What a day!

283
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,340
Wait a minute.

284
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,560
Snow in Thailand?

285
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,240
Of course. Where do you want it then? Mars?

286
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,220
We've always had snow.

287
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,960
Does anyone know any prayer that can get rid of snow?

288
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,300
Or we'll have to cancel the filming.

289
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,063
Calm down. It's all set.

290
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:18,940
Why don't we stick lemongrass into the ground?

291
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,143
Stick lemongrass into the ground?

292
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:22,803
It's a tradition in my universe.

293
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,660
No. It's a tradition from overseas.

294
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,580
I tried and it worked.

295
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,500
Tess and I will do it for you.

296
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,040
One second.

297
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,620
Don't cancel the movie set.

298
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,880
Come on.

299
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,760
Which state did he get that tradition from?

300
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,600
You do it.

301
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,880
Wait. Why me?

302
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:46,727
Because I'll say the prayer.

303
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:48,787
Quickly. Before it snows.

304
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:54,568
- Right here?
- Yeah.

305
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:02,692
I'm done! Do it.

306
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,940
Damn! I never imagined seeing snow in Thailand.

307
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,800
Yeah, it's the first snow in my life.

308
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,340
That means I'm the first one you've seen snow with.

309
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,660
Right. Why?

310
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,020
When you see snow again next time, you will think of me.

311
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,000
We've done everything.

312
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,297
It isn't stopping.

313
00:22:57,297 --> 00:22:59,401
- There's one more thing we can try.
- Cancel the filming?

314
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:00,700
We film anyways.

315
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,157
Change the script. The lead characters will run under the snow.

316
00:23:04,157 --> 00:23:05,440
You have a problem?

317
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,040
No. Just add the scene where they're surprised to see the snow.

318
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,743
- Prepare the cameras.
- Sure.

319
00:23:11,743 --> 00:23:13,921
Guys, set the cameras.

320
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:17,184
As for you, Tun and Tess.

321
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:19,740
Help with the blocking. Stand where it's marked lead characters.

322
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,120
Wait. Why us?

323
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,863
Just help. Look at my crew. I only have a few people.

324
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:31,320
Besides, you two understand the characters the most.

325
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,587
Help. Before it's dark.

326
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:35,880
Go.

327
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,580
Go on.

328
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,420
Quickly.

329
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,523
Sure. Sure.

330
00:23:41,523 --> 00:23:44,623
Yes, that's the blocking.

331
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,120
A little left. Yes.

332
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,360
Left. Stand on the grass.

333
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,560
Damn it. We just stopped by, but he is making us work.

334
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,340
Don't go off the character.

335
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,300
We must pretend we're lovers.

336
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,948
Hold hands and walk in the snow like he said.

337
00:24:03,948 --> 00:24:06,940
Got it, boyfriend?

338
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,560
Goosebumps. Do you have to be so serious?

339
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,080
Of course.

340
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,100
So that the cameramen knows the mood of the scene.

341
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,460
Okay, let's rehearse.

342
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,120
Excited?

343
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,680
Your first time?

344
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,660
- Hell, yeah.
- And... action!

345
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,110
♫ Look at the sky that used to be grey ♫

346
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,910
♫ But this morning there was a rainbow ♫

347
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:59,510
♫ The ordinary roadside flowers look beautiful ♫

348
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,420
♫ From someone who used to not know how to laugh ♫

349
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:09,700
♫ But right now, I'm smiling nonstop. I don't know why. I don't know why ♫

350
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,040
What the hell are you doing, Tun?

351
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,880
Kissing your cheek.

352
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,160
Why are you surprised, boyfriend?

353
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,517
It's not real filming. You don't have to be so into it.

354
00:25:21,517 --> 00:25:25,440
I'm not into it. I just wanted to kiss your cheek.

355
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,820
Your cheeks give me cute aggression.

356
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,920
Cute, my ass!

357
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,660
I just want to kick your ass.

358
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,080
You can't kick me now.

359
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,520
Because we are boyfriends.

360
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,340
Hold on. Did we say cut?

361
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,120
The dialogue ended a long time ago. They just kept on acting.

362
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,280
I just had to watch.

363
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,350
♫ Thank you for being the key to fixing everything ♫

364
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,270
♫ Nothing is the same when you're by my side ♫

365
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,220
​♫ You make every second of every day amazing ♫

366
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,660
♫ You are the key ♫

367
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,980
Okay, okay.

368
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,140
Are you being shy? You're hiding here by yourself.

369
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,940
Why would I blush?

370
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,400
It's cold and I'm thirsty.

371
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,620
I'm just here to have a drink.

372
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,420
Yeah?

373
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,920
Yeah.

374
00:26:50,815 --> 00:26:53,480
Here. Want one?

375
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,240
I dreamed of working on a movie set in a different country at least once.

376
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,360
Turns out it's a movie set in a different universe.

377
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,900
This is peak.

378
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,320
By "peak," you mean good?

379
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,740
Very good.

380
00:27:47,528 --> 00:27:49,840
But it's a little too cold.

381
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,360
I don't like this kind of climate.

382
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,700
- No!
- Don't move.

383
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,820
I noticed that you were complaining that you were cold and I'm keeping you warm. That's all.

384
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,047
No. Let go.

385
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:13,847
I won't let go.

386
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,780
I don't want you to have any dislikes...

387
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,080
right now.

388
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,960
You must only be happy, Talay.

389
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,380
At least for five minutes.

390
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,640
But you're giving me one more thing I don't like.

391
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,032
I don't like getting hugged.

392
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,860
Back to your seat.

393
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,820
Well then.

394
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,900
You can hug me instead.

395
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,780
I like to hug and be hugged.

396
00:29:18,237 --> 00:29:21,720
No. I'm not cold anymore.

397
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,120
That.

398
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,020
Won't you drink it?

399
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,820
Drink up. It's 0% sugar.

400
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,820
Your body will stay in good shape.

401
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,963
You told me that yourself.

402
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:08,080
What are you doing?

403
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,540
This is great.

404
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,140
Want to try?

405
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,800
Like it?

406
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,520
Cold?

407
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,220
No.

408
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,220
Stop it. Stop.

409
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,600
Don't. Don't.

410
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,300
Tun!

411
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,620
Are you cold?

412
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,100
Tun!

413
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,180
Here, get colder.

414
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,720
Feel the coldness.

415
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,740
Very nice poster.
[Two months later]

416
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,500
When will it come out?

417
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,320
Next week. But the premiere press conference is tomorrow.

418
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,540
It'd be nice if you could spread the word.

419
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,960
Absolutely. I'll be your big promoter.

420
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,080
Can I get a ticket to the premiere though?

421
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,260
I want to see movie stars up close.

422
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,320
I can't take it anymore.

423
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,740
Why does this happen to me?

424
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,503
Calm down.

425
00:31:23,503 --> 00:31:25,963
I know what you're going through.

426
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:27,480
I've lost everything.

427
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,523
I'm jobless. My wife left me.

428
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,560
What's happening?

429
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,880
Uncle Sak is actually a citizen of this universe.

430
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,820
He traveled to the other one.

431
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,780
And he got back.

432
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,260
But he was back just to find out he lost his house and his job.

433
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,400
That's why he's devastated.

434
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,520
How long do I need to live this life?

435
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,440
Before I traveled there,

436
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:08,540
I applied to be a senior architect in a big company.

437
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,180
I got accepted.

438
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,800
Just like me.

439
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,480
Not long after I started working, it happened.

440
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,860
I traveled to the other universe.

441
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,740
For how long?

442
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,940
Five years.

443
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,840
When I got back here, I became an AC repairman.

444
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,380
I divorced my wife.

445
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,340
My house was sold.

446
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,660
What burns the most is that the man who was in my body

447
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,120
caused huge trouble.

448
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,140
No architectural firms want to hire me now.

449
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:02,280
I hope you guys can go home quickly...

450
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,040
before it's too late.

451
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,680
What's the matter? Thinking about Uncle's story?

452
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Yes.

453
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,380
I get him so well.

454
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,440
I'm afraid Tess will ruin my job, too.

455
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,680
I get you.

456
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,600
Aren't you worried at all?

457
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,860
Pakorn might destroy your acting career.

458
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,720
I am.

459
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,340
But what can I do?

460
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,560
All we can do now is trust them.

461
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,320
Just like them who have to trust us, too.

462
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,720
Thank you.

463
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,260
And thank you for always giving me a ride.

464
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,360
Yeah. You don't need to thank me.

465
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,000
I told you my bike is fuel-efficient.

466
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:37,580
Just tell me where you want to go.

467
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,480
Yeah?

468
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,260
Then...

469
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,000
Can you give me a ride to the other universe?

470
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,740
That will be difficult.

471
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,240
Right.

472
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,827
Because if we were really there,

473
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:02,320
I wouldn't be just the guy who gave you a ride.

474
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,820
I'd be the guy who lives with you.

475
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,340
Are you going anywhere today?

476
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,660
No. Why?

477
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,300
Hop on then.

478
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,300
Sugar daddy will take you on a stress-relieving ride.

479
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,760
I just took it off.

480
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,820
Put it back on.

481
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,020
This might go big.

482
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,260
Hello.

483
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,420
Congratulations!

484
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,880
Thank you.

485
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,260
Your movie has finally come out.

486
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,040
Thank you for the tickets.

487
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,820
- Of course.
- Here.

488
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,740
Thank you guys for coming.

489
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,920
I hope you enjoy the movie.

490
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,200
- Can I get a picture with you two?
- Absolutely. Come on.

491
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,960
Excuse me.

492
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,560
A photo, please.

493
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,260
- Thank you.
- Sure. Should we get inside?

494
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,600
Yes, we will see you inside the theater.

495
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,440
- Okay.
- Good job.

496
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,720
See you.

497
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,520
Well done.

498
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,340
Guys.

499
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,440
The short-haired woman in an orange suit, who is she? Is she single?

500
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,545
She's my type.

501
00:37:00,545 --> 00:37:03,360
Come on, Up.

502
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,620
You better not. Trust me.

503
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,800
Why not?

504
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,880
Just no.

505
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,660
So why are you annoyed with me?

506
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,440
Holy shit!

507
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,360
That's Gun Atthaphan.

508
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,900
He's an actor here, too?

509
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,140
Gun, my ass.

510
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,470
That's Third.

511
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:31,580
He owns "Movie Seer Page," the film criticism page.

512
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

513
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,600
But isn't Khai here with him?

514
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,604
Whatever. He isn't an actor.

515
00:37:40,604 --> 00:37:44,100
- You're delusional.
- You're nuts.

516
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,580
Check your brains.

517
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,180
You too.

518
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,920
This universe is so unpredictable.

519
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,980
I'm nervous.

520
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,780
You're an actor. You went to many movie premieres.

521
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,560
It's different.

522
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,040
This is the first movie I actually made.

523
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,440
Don't worry.

524
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,340
Whatever happens,

525
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,800
I'll go through it with you.

526
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,040
The movie is hilarious. I laughed so hard I cried.

527
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,620
Right. And I just want to fall in love again after seeing it.

528
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,640
Excuse me. Excuse me.

529
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,340
Third!

530
00:39:48,317 --> 00:39:50,760
- I've never seen you so close.
- Yeah.

531
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,940
Are you guys on the screenwriting team?

532
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,140
We are.

533
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,623
The movie is really cute.

534
00:39:56,623 --> 00:40:00,180
I like every character. They're all charming.

535
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,620
You guys are great. I'm rooting for you.

536
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,280
Thank you.

537
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,400
Excuse me.

538
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,720
Hold on, Third.

539
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,320
Thank you so much.

540
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,180
He complimented us.

541
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,824
- Our movie will be a big hit.
- Right!

542
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:27,706
He gave positive feedback. I just want to scream right now.

543
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,180
Zip it for now.

544
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,340
Friend Credits.

545
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,940
To our first movie ever.

546
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,080
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

547
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,680
Guys,

548
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,580
should we check the feedback from the movie review pages?

549
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,340
Good.

550
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,903
- Yes.
- Let me do it.

551
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,141
Hey. Don't take a peek. I'll read it first.

552
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:10,380
Quickly, Tun.

553
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:52,360
In general, many pages say the same thing.

554
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,560
The movie could've been better.

555
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,520
Just put it back.

556
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,840
Guys!

557
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,540
I forgot to show you.

558
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,183
I just put up the new lighting. Want to see?

559
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,440
Look!

560
00:42:17,357 --> 00:42:18,600
How is it?

561
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,200
Blue tone. Deep, isn't it?

562
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,660
So deep.

563
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,920
Our sadness is really deep.

564
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,640
Easy there, man.

565
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,680
What is it? What's happening?

566
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,300
Movie criticism pages. They didn't give us very positive feedback.

567
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,860
Come on, guys. Don't be so sad.

568
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,580
I'll treat you guys to frozen beer.

569
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Interested?

570
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,863
Don't leave until you're drunk. Okay?

571
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,600
All right.

572
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,400
Let's get deeply sad.

573
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,380
Be miserable.

574
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,060
And tomorrow we will fight again.

575
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,720
I agree with Up.

576
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,500
So what if they give us negative feedback?

577
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,680
I think there must be someone who likes it.

578
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,760
Though no one here likes it,

579
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,900
there must be someone in an alternate universe who loves it.

580
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,800
We gave it our all.

581
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,080
True. We just live in the wrong universe.

582
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:19,300
Cheers!

583
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,360
Did you finish it? How many more would you like?

584
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,640
Four more.

585
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,280
Cheers!

586
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,480
Cheers!

587
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:48,770

[The Mall Lifestore]

589
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:56,210
It's such a pity that "Long Distance Relationship,"

590
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,520
a romantic comedy film by 26 Pictures, falls short of its aim.

591
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,960
Many theaters have opted to shorten their showtimes.

592
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,920
Talay.

593
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,100
Wow!

594
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,050
It's like we bought the whole cinema just for us.

595
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,380
Us?

596
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,560
Look. There are a bunch of people.

597
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,940
Excuse me.

598
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,925
Please watch your feet.

599
00:45:12,217 --> 00:45:13,880
What are you doing?

600
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,723
Be quiet. Don't bother other people.

601
00:45:17,723 --> 00:45:19,423
This cinema is full of people.

602
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,420
Follow me.

603
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,940
Shit!

604
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,520
I just stepped on this girl's foot.

605
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,520
It's okay.

606
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,580
Sorry about my boyfriend.

607
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,160
He's so clumsy.

608
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,500
Sorry about that.

609
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,120
Boyfriend, my foot.

610
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,940
What are you doing?

611
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,160
Come on.

612
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,720
Tun.

613
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,020
Which scene is your favorite?

614
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:33,120
The last scene where both of them meet again in the coffee shop.

615
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,440
Why?

616
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,780
I went there with you.

617
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,100
If this movie was aired in our universe,

618
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,760
it would make millions by now.

619
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,000
It all started with the good screenplay you wrote.

620
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,500
It's you.

621
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,780
If it wasn't for you, this movie wouldn't have happened.

622
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,840
Without you,

623
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,060
my screenplay wouldn't be this good.

624
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,240
Thank you.

625
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,540
Thank you, too.

626
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,520
We are so great.

627
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,300
Tun! Tess!

628
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,080
What brought you guys here?

629
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,860
I came to see the movie.

630
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,240
I came to say my farewell, too.

631
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,650
It should be the first...

632
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,020
and the last movie I made.

633
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,140
Why are you saying that?

634
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,860
I...

635
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,960
I think I will quit writing screenplays.

636
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,800
For real?

637
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,420
Yeah.

638
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,680
I've been thinking about it.

639
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,940
Look at us.

640
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,400
The movie aired for only two weeks and it was out.

641
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,520
Who would want to hire us?

642
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,400
I think I might help out my family's fishery business.

643
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,520
They keep calling me.

644
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,260
Me, too.

645
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,440
I will help my mom with her store.

646
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,720
She wants me home, too.

647
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,460
So you're both quitting?

648
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,300
I guess so.

649
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,280
And you, Tun? What are you going to do?

650
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,620
I'm not sure.

651
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,780
You, Tess?

652
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,500
I gave my dad a promise.

653
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,300
If this movie fails,

654
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,480
I will go back to study and graduate.

655
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,240
Then help with my family business.

656
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,940
Damn.

657
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,720
We're all going separate ways, huh?

658
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,840
I will miss you guys so bad.

659
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:48,180
But it's life to meet and part.

660
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,740
I'm so proud to work with you guys.

661
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,243
Come on. A group hug.

662
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,880
I love you guys.

663
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,340
Guys,

664
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,840
since we won't get to meet soon,

665
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,180
how about we take a selfie?

666
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,700
Let's do it.

667
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,620
Thank you guys so much.

668
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,160
Thank you guys, too.

669
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,900
Bye now.

670
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,380
Come here.

671
00:51:11,877 --> 00:51:14,620
- See you.
- Good luck with life.

672
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,603
- See you.
- See you.

673
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,980
What are you going to do now?

674
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,280
I'm moving back home.

675
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,160
Why?

676
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,520
The condo rent is pricey.

677
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,920
If I stop writing screenplays, I won't be able to cover it.

678
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,800
Actually, there's another way out.

679
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,860
Which is?

680
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,320
Find someone to share it with.

681
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,080
Talay,

682
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,340
would you like to move in with me?

683
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,220
You are so colorful.

684
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,480
You're making my room a lot livelier.

685
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,400
Not my room, actually.

686
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,940
Our room.

687
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,520
Tun, whose RV is that?

688
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,260
It belongs to a friend of my dad.

689
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,761
- Should we renovate it into a studio?
- What?

690
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:33,040
It's an RV.

691
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,960
It's been my dream.

692
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,680
This picture is missing something.

693
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,180
What?

694
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,960
Someone who's willing to walk with you for the rest of your life.

695
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:47,590
"Have I Found" - Sea Tawinan

696
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:52,800
♫ Is it you? That will change this world ♫

697
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,910
♫ Is it you? The person I've been searching a long time for ♫

698
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:00,500
♫ Have I found, Have I found ♫

699
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:08,090
♫ Someone who will be ready to walk through this side by side with me from now on ♫

700
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:13,250
♫ Is it you? That won't let me be sad ♫

701
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:19,400
♫ After a night of nightmares, making every tomorrow look bright ♫

702
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:26,000
♫ Forever, please tell me to be confident ♫

703
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,550
♫ That you won't go and leave me ♫

704
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:39,960
