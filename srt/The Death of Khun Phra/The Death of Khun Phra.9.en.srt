00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,510
This show is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to actual persons,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,650
living or dead, or real events
is purely coincidental and

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,990
not intended to offend any person,
profession, or organization.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,950
You are slaves.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,190
But you dare accuse me?

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,780
You're asking for trouble.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,520
Let me give you a clue.

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,270
Heads on pikes all over town.

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,080
Just one whiff.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,970
You helped and fed me

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,960
because you knew I didn't do it.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,990
And you were the one
who shot Khun Phra.

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,070
Muen Int and police officers
are outside.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,330
Lady Jolie must have
tipped them off.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,740
Got your weapons?

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,260
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,760
- Weapon out, sir.
- Sir.

18
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,670
Enough with the yelling.

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,610
Making sure you hear us.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,190
I ain't deaf.
And you're spooking them out.

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,100
Think.

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,980
Too late for me to run.
They're already here.

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,490
If they catch me, I'm dead.

24
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,840
Think, Sangthong.

25
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,910
You're our brain. Think, buddy.

26
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,190
Proceed.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,010
I know.

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,990
We must hide.

29
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,210
Hide. Hide.

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,070
- Where?
- Hide where?

31
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,400
Ready?

32
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,500
Where to hide?

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,310
If they resist the arrest,

34
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,770
use lethal force.

35
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,870
Hide where? There?

36
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,190
Okay, okay. Follow me.

37
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,440
Charge.

38
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,150
Fast, fast. Follow me.

39
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,450
Where?

40
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,640
Come on in.

"Mystery of the Deadly Sins"

54
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,240
What next, sir?

55
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,680
Hoy, go straight.

56
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,680
They could've left already.

57
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,190
Hon, upstairs.

58
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,970
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

59
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,520
Halt, you murderer.

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,740
Makeshift bedding.

61
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,460
Still warm.

62
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,460
Still warm.

63
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,770
Hmm...heh.

64
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,010
The evidence is strong.

65
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,980
So, they actually came here.

66
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,540
Looks like they just left, too.

67
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,300
Hide here? The room is tight.

68
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,410
If we hide here, we'll get caught.

69
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,860
I shouldn't have followed you here.

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,030
My fault?
If you're so smart, go your own way.

71
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,070
You're the smart one.
Where to hide now?

72
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,410
Focus on the problem.

73
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,750
What will we do?

74
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,520
Listen. Thongbai, hide here.

75
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,190
Maiphlong and I
will distract them, okay?

76
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,660
Hide in here? Where?

77
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,840
No place to hide.

78
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,380
No sight of them, sir.

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,830
How about you, Hon?

80
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,790
There was nobody.

81
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,770
They could be long gone, sir.

82
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,090
I'm afraid not.

83
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,890
Their beddings were still warm.

84
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,230
Meaning...

85
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,090
They're near. I know it.

86
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,920
Look around for them,
but keep it quiet.

87
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,400
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

88
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,650
- Keep quiet, sir.
- Quiet.

89
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,850
Right.

90
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,730
Let's go.

91
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,040
Hey.

92
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,060
Hide inside.

93
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,970
- Inside?
- Yeah.

94
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,520
Uhmp.

95
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,730
All soybeans. I can't get in.

96
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,570
Eat them then you can get in.

97
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,050
Got it.

98
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,500
- Come on. Wait.
- What now?

99
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,220
This isn't an eating contest.
You can't do this.

100
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,790
It's like hundreds of liters.

101
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,830
What choice do we have?

102
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,900
- Dump the beans. Come on.
- Okay.

103
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,360
They're cornered now.
They might fight to the death.

104
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,190
Hon, are you sure
they weren't upstairs?

105
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,200
Three rooms.
I checked every corner, sir.

106
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,090
Nothing suspicious, sir.

107
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Excellent.

108
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,380
Hey.

109
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:24,980
Is this

110
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,210
what I think it is?

111
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,190
- A gun.
- Whoa.

112
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,690
Ma'am.

113
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,390
She must have hidden it here.

114
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,310
No. No way.

115
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,880
She's not that type of lady.

116
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,650
It must be someone else's.

117
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,930
Sangthong.

118
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,920
Listen.

119
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,960
Evidence and motive.
You must accept the reality.

120
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,710
She's the murderer.

121
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,650
She shot Khun Phra
and hid the gun in here.

122
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,570
Get it?

123
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,040
She lured us here
and tipped off the police.

124
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,100
That noise.

125
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,770
It must be them.

126
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,030
Follow me.

127
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,070
Thongbai.

128
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,890
What will we do?

129
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,960
I know you're right there.

130
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,910
I got it.

131
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,650
I'll tell them Lady Jolie did it.

132
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,320
We'll be cleared.

133
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,970
It's no use.

134
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,410
They don't believe
a word from a slave.

135
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,170
If you don't want to die a patsy,

136
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,260
give yourself up.

137
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,300
Surrender and I'll spare your life.

138
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,850
Okay, you hide inside.

139
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,840
We'll go out to distract them.

140
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,530
Come on. Get in the barrel.

141
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,660
This is it.

142
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,990
I'm so tired.

143
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,550
No more running.

144
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,500
Thongbai.

145
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,250
Don't give up hope.

146
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,570
Thanks, you two.

147
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,110
I don't want you
to get burned for this.

148
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,980
I'm giving up.

149
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,640
If they catch you,
you'll be executed.

150
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,370
That way,

151
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,990
I alone will die.

152
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,320
You two will be safe.

153
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,010
Thongbai.

154
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,030
Death you say?

155
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,930
I'm with you
till the end of the line.

156
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,290
Poor Captain America.

157
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,560
That's wood, not vibranium.

158
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,370
Woods don't bounce bullets.

159
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,400
Hrr.

160
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,650
Listen, gents.

161
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,380
These may be my last words.

162
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,770
I appreciate you sticking around

163
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,830
when no one else did.

164
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,460
You've kept me alive so far.

165
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,120
It's time for me
to return the favor.

166
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,780
I'll face him.

167
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,600
This burden is mine alone.

168
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,530
I'm gone. You'll be safe.

169
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,410
Thongbai.

170
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,150
I'm sorry I can't save you.

171
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,590
Hey. You two did your best.

172
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,270
I love you, gents.

173
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,420
I got it.

174
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,360
When I go out there,
you two hide in here.

175
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,350
They'll take me away.

176
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,740
You come out and find Lady Jolie.

177
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,890
Get her confession.

178
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,370
Turn her in.

179
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,190
Then, I'll be acquitted.

180
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,010
Will that work?
Muen Int will get in here for sure.

181
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,900
The way I see it.

182
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,980
He could've captured you
many times before.

183
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,680
Once he captures me,
he'll stop searching.

184
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,830
You sure?

185
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,180
Can't say I count on it.

186
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,590
But I do count on

187
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,120
good friends like you two.

188
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,790
I count on you coming to save me.

189
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,180
I'm counting down from ten.

190
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,050
This is it, gents.

191
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,710
Ten.

192
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,350
- Nine.
- I love you.

193
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,450
I love you.

194
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,250
- I love you.
- Eight.

195
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,260
Seven.

196
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,430
Six.

197
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,420
Five.

198
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,640
Four.

199
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,640
Three.

200
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,260
Come on.

201
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,760
(Mimicking comedy from
a Thai movie franchise.)

202
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,560
Down to two, now.

203
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,220
One.

204
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,190
I surrender.

205
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,100
Bind him.

206
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,220
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

207
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,250
With that evidence, you will go

208
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,270
straight to
the execution ground tomorrow.

209
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,780
Muen, sir.

210
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,890
Shall we search for his friends?

211
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,030
Aren't you tired?

212
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,340
Haven't you had enough for one day?

213
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,570
Why trouble yourself so much?

214
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,410
You've got the murderer.
That's enough.

215
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,130
Yes, sir.

216
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,010
Walk.

217
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,820
Come on.

218
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,670
Watch it. My head.

219
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,200
They didn't even come in.
We didn't have to hide.

220
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,150
Sangthong. Come out.
They're gone.

221
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,550
I'm stuck. A little help.

222
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,620
- Help?
- Yeah, help.

223
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,020
Hmph.

224
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,340
You okay?

225
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,730
Argh.

226
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,940
Your feet were on my back.

227
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,340
From here, our task is
to find Ma'am.

228
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,100
No. We don't seek her out.

229
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,900
We return to Khun Phra's estate.

230
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,190
Come on, Sangthong.

231
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,920
You're still going soft on her?

232
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,160
Our friend will be executed.

233
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,390
Listen to me first.

234
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,490
Do you know where to find her?

235
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,820
Oh, yeah.

236
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,930
No idea.

237
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,690
Silly goose.

238
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,030
I'm returning there because
I want help from Lady Nuanlaor.

239
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,110
I'll tell her
everything we know so far.

240
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,690
The world turns blind
to slaves like us.

241
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,570
Our master, like Lady Nuanlaor,
might see.

242
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,170
Let me remind you
that she's a woman so young.

243
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,210
Men in badges may not
take her seriously.

244
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,060
Then dress her up like a man.

245
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,370
Hmph. Get real, will ya?

246
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
What's with you and disguises?

247
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,240
Come on. She's a woman...

248
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,680
a young woman.

249
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,310
But she's wedded
to Khun Phra, nonetheless.

250
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,730
The wife of the victim speaks up.

251
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,680
That'll get the police's attention.

252
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,170
Regardless, I don't see
why she'll help us.

253
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,100
You keep asking a lot.

254
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,450
I don't know.

255
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,180
But by my calculation,

256
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,850
this way gives us more hope
than getting Lady Jolie.

257
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,740
She may not confess,
which will only delay us.

258
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,650
Nevertheless, we must seek help
from more credible persons

259
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,560
to save Thongbai.

260
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:25,940
Okay.

261
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,820
We'll play by your game.

262
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,600
- Of course.
- Yeah, just do it.

263
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,170
- Hold on.
- Yeah?

264
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,730
It looks empty.

265
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,090
Dark.

266
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,490
Quiet.

267
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,430
They must be

268
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,500
playing hide-and-seek.

269
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,620
Sounds fun.

270
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,960
Hmph. Silly goose.

271
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,010
It's not the time.

272
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,590
It looks as though nobody's inside.

273
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,070
I got it.

274
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,350
Khun Phra came back
as an evil spirit

275
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,340
and scared everyone away.

276
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
- Whoa.
- Oh, yeah.

277
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,740
I'll tell this yarn
on The Ghost Show.

278
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,140
Might become a movie later.

279
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,940
"Cast"
I'll be the star cast.

280
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,240
Hey. Stop fooling around.

281
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,300
You three rendered my master
a widow at her wedding

282
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,220
and returned to the palace.

283
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,870
I got it.

284
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,750
Lady Nuanlaor returned
to the palace.

285
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,530
So everyone left this place.

286
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,970
What will we do now?
Who will we turn to?

287
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,700
Listen.

288
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,560
I'll try to find her at the palace.

289
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,150
You remain here
in case someone shows up,

290
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,530
Lady Rampueng, especially,

291
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,000
because she could convince
her sister to help us.

292
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,230
- Got it. I'll be here.
- Good.

293
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,360
By the way, how will you get
into the palace?

294
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,940
You're a guy.

295
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,080
Are you...

296
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,630
thinking of that?

297
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,870
Woman disguise again?

298
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,990
If you get caught,
that's double trouble.

299
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,410
You're no fun to talk to.

300
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,440
Fine.

301
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,590
I'll use my wits

302
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,680
to find a way to go in.

303
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,680
And you...just hang out here.

304
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,220
If anything, I'll come back to you.

305
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,000
Sure. No worries, buddy.

306
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,730
My visions, like that of an owl,

307
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,370
cut through the dark

308
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,290
like Xenon beam light.

309
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,660
Not one ant can escape my sight.

310
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,090
Don't worry, bud...

311
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,740
Hey.

312
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,960
When did he leave?

313
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,270
I can see even the faintest stir.

314
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,250
My eyes pierce the darkness.

315
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,970
- I thought you wouldn't show.
- Shh.

316
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,420
Do not worry.
Everything will be over soon.

317
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,840
Let's go.

318
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,210
Okay.

319
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,090
Is there actually nobody upstairs?

320
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,730
I went through one,

321
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,020
two, and three staircases.

322
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,850
I'm guarding the last.
Should I go to the second?

323
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,960
Hey.

324
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,020
Lady Jolie.

325
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,370
Who's she with?

326
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,710
Better go after them.

327
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,030
I must warn you

328
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,850
of severe penalty for sneaking in.

329
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,240
Jeez.

330
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,610
Thanks for the biting pep talk.

331
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,670
Warning someone about to
do something wrong,

332
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,970
isn't it a good deed?

333
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,640
Shouldn't we strive
for what is good?

334
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,660
What a wonderful preaching ghost.

335
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,440
I mean to hurt nobody
or commit a crime.

336
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,480
I want to help my friend.

337
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,220
Risky, yes. But I must do it.

338
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,620
Reasonable excuse.
But doing wrong is still wrong.

339
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,100
"Do you know?"
You know?

340
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,600
"I know."
I know.

341
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,710
But if you don't stop talking,
I'mma boop your head.

342
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,770
Little girl.

343
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,570
If you can't help,
just go along with it.

344
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,800
You don't heed my warning,

345
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,390
and try to make me your accomplice.

346
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,940
Great man.

347
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,350
Tch.

348
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,630
- Where're you going?
- Oh?

349
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,260
Stop. Stop right there.

350
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,420
Hold on. Uhm.

351
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,460
Lady.

352
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,120
You killed Khun Phra.

353
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,140
Now, you're kidnapping
Lady Nuanlaor's sister.

354
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,760
You play the saint,
but you're anything but.

355
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,980
How could you do this to my friend?

356
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,710
So disappointed.
Thought you were nice and all.

357
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,750
Maiphlong, how did you come here?

358
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,820
Please don't panic.
I'll help you, Lady Rampueng.

359
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,220
Come again?

360
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,960
Hey, we have no time
to play with you.

361
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,770
Go away.

362
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,140
You, go away. I'm staying.

363
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,460
Don't make me mad.

364
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,870
I don't care even if you're a woman.

365
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,360
A crime is a crime,
regardless of gender.

366
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,330
I said this isn't the time.

367
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,380
Let's go.

368
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,320
Hey, hey. Wait.

369
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,540
Oh, no.

370
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,790
What?

371
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,890
Are you pregnant, Lady Rampueng?

372
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,710
Hmph.

373
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,330
When did this happen?
And who's the father?

374
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,040
You gonna kill her and the baby?

375
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,270
Oh, my God.

376
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,340
I am not killing her.

377
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,990
You're far more impervious
to comprehension

378
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,580
than anyone I've ever met.

379
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,280
Saying I'm dumb?

380
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,330
I didn't say anything.

381
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,730
Alright, enough.

382
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,450
Maiphlong, she means no harm.

383
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,080
Actually, she saved me
from Khun Phra's wicked clutch.

384
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,890
Saved you from his wicked clutch?

385
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,110
Understand that?

386
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,960
That means...

387
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,640
I don't know what to think now.

388
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,990
Could you explain to me
as plainly as you can?

389
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,030
Short and sweet version.

390
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,300
I'm carrying Khun Phra's child.

391
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,710
What?

392
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,270
You are pregnant by Khun Phra.

393
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,890
But your sister was
just married to him.

394
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,210
When did this happen?

395
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,810
You met him just a few times
before his wedding.

396
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,260
You're like...

397
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,010
renting out your belly
for your sister's baby.

398
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,070
Enough, Maiphlong.

399
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,250
You're smart in the wrong places.

400
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,920
I'll tell you what happened.

401
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,330
It all began when

402
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,580
I came to the palace.

403
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,320
Your name?

404
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Rampueng, milady.

405
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,180
How old are you now?

406
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,610
Twenty, milady.

407
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,520
I was trained in all
household duties,

408
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,860
and prepared to become a wife.

409
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,870
A young nobleman would propose
when the time was right.

410
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,450
Which was supposed to be

411
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,810
just about now.

412
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,710
I shall now take my leave
to be married, milady.

413
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,570
Not the right time?

414
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,630
Guess I must master
culinary skills.

415
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,810
And soon afterward,

416
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,540
the day would come.

417
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,890
The day I got married at last.

418
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,910
I shall now take my leave
to be married, milady.

419
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,460
Still not the right time?

420
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,450
"Up-skill"
Guess I must up-skill handicraft.

421
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,440
For the day would come
when I get married.

422
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,830
And soon afterward,

423
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,970
the day has come.

424
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,510
The day I got married eventually.

425
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,280
I shall now take my leave
to be married, milady.

426
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,790
When's it gonna be my turn?

427
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,670
Lady Rampueng is so skilled.

428
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,410
The melon you carved is perfect.

429
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,090
I almost don't want to eat them.

430
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,100
Why? Why?

431
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,200
What's wrong?

432
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,930
Pikun.

433
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,220
I'm twenty years old.

434
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,670
Why hasn't any man come to propose?

435
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,650
Look here. I can do everything.

436
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,860
Sewing.

437
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,550
Cooking.

438
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,700
Running the household.

439
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,050
And even fruit carving.

440
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,500
I can do it all.
What's wrong with me?

441
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,850
Why don't I have a husband?

442
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,010
Lady Rampueng, calm down.

443
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,230
You're perfect in every way,

444
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,570
but maybe something is missing.

445
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,630
I don't understand.

446
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,450
I've done everything they do

447
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,530
but I'm still unlucky.

448
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,370
Is it fate?

449
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,980
Don't talk nonsense.

450
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,750
I want a husband. What should I do?

451
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,090
Might I suggest?

452
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,340
I heard that Her Highness is going
together with His Highness

453
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,810
to the coastal town.

454
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:28,040
You can request to
accompany Her Highness.

455
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,310
And as Her Highness is pleased
with your company,

456
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,850
you'll be exposed to
many handsome, young noblemen.

457
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,590
Her Highness goes along with
His Highness.

458
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,880
Wait, wait.

459
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,380
You mean I go with Her Highness
to the coastal town.

460
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,810
- Exactly.
- It's very remote.

461
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,430
Coastal towns.

462
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,380
The heat is relentless,
the ground unforgiving.

463
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,090
Carriages rattle my bones,
and boats turn my stomach.

464
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,460
I get sick.

465
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,790
Then, do your chores here.

466
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,930
I don't want to be an old maid.

467
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,930
If so, you have to fight for it.

468
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,170
Repeat after me.

469
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,410
Fight!

470
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,730
Fight.

471
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,490
Energy.

472
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,940
Fight!

473
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,030
Fight!

474
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,770
How muddy.

475
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,250
Ahem.

476
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,800
Listen good.

477
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,890
No one cares about you

478
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,680
if you don't get up

479
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,450
and fight.

480
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,450
Fight!

481
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,810
Oh, no.

482
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,530
I can't take it, Pikun.

483
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,840
Are you all right, Miss?

484
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,180
I'm not.

485
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,860
I can't fight.

486
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,710
I can't fight anymore.

487
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,380
Just a little storm, Miss.

488
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,090
Here, this is your little storm.

489
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,640
I'm soaked from head down to toe.

490
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,980
Along this trip with His Highness,

491
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,450
hundreds of beautiful girls
showed up.

492
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,250
You know?

493
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,400
From Suwanthani to this town,

494
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,040
not one man bothered
to glance at me.

495
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,780
But the dogs...

496
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,610
Glanced at you?

497
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,480
No, they looked away.

498
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,150
Once I stumbled on a rock.

499
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,290
The men cleared the area
as I fell face-first.

500
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,020
The mosquitoes and bugs.

501
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,490
The singled me out,
leaving everyone else untouched.

502
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,890
Why Pikun?

503
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,080
Why is having a husband
a big hassle?

504
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,510
Please settle down, young Miss.

505
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,040
Let's go out after you clean up
nicely after the rain.

506
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,420
Men will be pleased
to see you shine.

507
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,750
No way.

508
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,930
This is it.

509
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,490
Having a husband is
such an undertaking.

510
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,900
Pikun.

511
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,900
I will marry, instead,

512
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,790
to a pestle.

513
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,240
Oh.

514
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,750
You meant you'd marry to your duty.

515
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,560
You kicked off my other imagination.

516
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,030
Not that imagination.

517
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,840
Heh. Please carry on.

518
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,510
Go ahead.

519
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,870
Take this out.

520
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,590
- Careful.
- Oh, yes.

521
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,060
Will you really remain here?
Won't you come out?

522
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,120
Look at how sweaty I am.

523
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,960
How can I meet any men like this?

524
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,840
Go, go. Hurry up.

525
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,690
You'll regret it if I pick up
a man in your stead.

526
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,350
No man would marry a woman

527
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,560
who fills the kitchen with smoke.

528
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,660
- To repel the mosquitoes.
- Or burn the house down.

529
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,280
If I'm gonna be an old maid,
you will be too.

530
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,440
Maybe I'll quit.

531
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,630
Say what?

532
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,490
It's just not fair.

533
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,070
Hmph.

534
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,590
'The glowing moon is embraced
by its reflection.'

535
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,330
'A child in mother's arms
and father's devotion.'

536
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,070
'I alone, no hand to hold,
no soul to share.'

537
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,320
'How life is so unfair.'

538
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,070
Hmph.

539
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,290
Don't look at me with
your pretty face.

540
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,470
Take this.

541
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,200
Anything the matter?

542
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,330
Oops.

543
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,590
Uh.

544
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,290
I'm fine, sir.

545
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,560
I've been watching.

546
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,030
You looked as though
you were furious.

547
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,110
Not at all, sir.

548
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,510
I...I was just exhausted
from fixing dinner.

549
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,250
Which one?

550
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,030
Khao chae (Soaked rice).

551
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,120
Oh?

552
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,270
So, you were the one.

553
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,260
I found it so heavenly

554
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,610
that I figured the lady who made it

555
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,170
must be just as divine.

556
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,780
Heh.

557
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,590
That's flattering.

558
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,010
I am Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

559
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:04,050
My honesty extends
from thoughts to speech.

560
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,580
You hurt your hand at the railing.

561
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,880
Well, let me have a look.

562
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,740
Is it alright?

563
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,840
The pain be gone.

564
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,300
Whew.

565
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,530
That makes it alright.

566
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,060
Excellent.

567
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,800
Uhm. Did I catch your name?

568
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,870
My name's Rampueng.

569
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,410
That night was
my first encounter with him.

570
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,030
And it completely changed my life.

571
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,220
What a wonderful name.

572
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,690
Hmph.

573
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,710
Ahem.

574
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,530
Did you buy me a pain reliever
from the store?

575
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,430
Of course, Miss.

576
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,550
Medicine packets.
Look like lunch, don't they?

577
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,340
Yes, they do.

578
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:13,890
Ah. Those brown pouches
in your basket.

579
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,420
What are they?

580
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,370
Well, after I bought your medicine,

581
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,690
I swung by the palace gate.

582
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,880
And guess what?

583
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,390
A person got you this gift.

584
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,670
- A person?
- Correct.

585
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,550
Ooh.

586
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,330
Pikun.

587
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,750
How pretty.

588
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,780
Oh...

589
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,590
Pikun.

590
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,160
'My love stays true,
no fleeting, fickle play,'

591
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:58,120
'It never wanes,
but burns in bright array.'

592
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,010
'Your dimpled smiles,
they etch...'

593
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,850
'upon my soul,'

594
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,570
'My heart is yours,'

595
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,150
'dear Rampueng,'

596
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,250
'pure and whole.'

597
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,060
- Yeah, baby. Whew.
- Ah.

598
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,920
Look at her go.

599
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,980
Uhm. Could you read it to me?

600
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,860
Your reaction gave me
the thought if he wrote,

601
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,890
"No fool am I in Cupid's game
And yet his arrow holds my name."

602
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:35,930
Yeah?

603
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,980
Come on. Stop, will ya?

604
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:49,170
I think the time
you'll be wedded is near.

605
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:58,270
He was ardently courting me,
sending letters every single day.

606
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:02,240
Each one ended with a request
to meet him at the gate.

607
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,820
Excuse me, Khun Phra.

608
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,510
Uhm.

609
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:18,130
Miss Rampueng sent you
a basket of Chor Muang.
(Stuffed flower-shaped dumplings)

610
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,990
But I never went out as he asked,

611
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,660
because I was so shy.

612
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,590
Hey, doesn't your young Miss
want to meet me?

613
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,510
Oh, Her Highness requires
her services.

614
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,280
She must obey.

615
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,300
Rain or shine, holy day or not.

616
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:41,080
Even if she's in the middle of
relieving herself.

617
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,100
Alright. No need for that imagery.

618
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,700
Hrr.

619
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,770
Here you go.

620
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,150
Next time, bring her along, okay?

621
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,260
Lately, Her Highness
has been swamped with work.

622
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,580
Miss Rampueng must be
close by constantly.

623
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,870
Hmm.

624
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,890
Surely, I can't promise,

625
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,510
as I'm sure she would be
so overwhelmed.

626
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,260
I don't know what I can do.

627
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
Here.

628
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,830
Come on.

629
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,910
Will do.

630
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,810
- Promise?
- You got it, sir.

631
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,110
Excellent.

632
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,410
- Hey.
- Whoa.

633
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,610
What's with you?

634
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,790
- Thought you were a ghost.
- What?

635
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,340
- Pikun.
- Yes, Miss.

636
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,530
I'm not going.

637
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,920
Ow. We're already out.
Why turn around?

638
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:54,380
I'm not sure if this is a good idea.

639
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,090
How can I be sure?

640
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,330
It's up to you.

641
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,630
But just so you know,
he will soon be away

642
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,650
on official business
outside the city.

643
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,670
Long he will be gone
until his return.

644
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,320
Just how long?

645
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,790
I recall he said
he'd be gone so long

646
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,910
that he could forget
the one he once knew.

647
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,610
Hmm.

648
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,790
Oh, and this.

649
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,690
You made him this memento.
Give him yourself.

650
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,830
He might be your last love train
to jump on.

651
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,630
Then I've made up my mind.

652
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,700
I'm going.

653
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,260
Good job.

654
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,600
Pikun, if you weren't my servant,

655
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,200
I'd think he bribed you
for this setup surely.

656
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,600
Pikun?

657
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:48,890
Did you?

658
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,170
Let's hurry, my lady.
Someone might see us.

659
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,450
You're too suspicious.

660
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,190
Hurry.

661
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,640
Pikun?

662
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,390
Are we too late?

663
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,890
Your hesitation caused the delay.
He must have been gone.

664
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,520
Hmm.

665
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,170
Then, we go back.

666
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,920
- Alright.
- Hrr.

667
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,310
Oh?

668
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,740
Back already?
I thought you came to see me.

669
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,120
I told myself to walk away,

670
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,880
but my heart made me wait
a little longer.

671
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,050
Glad I did.

672
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,460
I was told you would travel
for business outside the city.

673
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,690
Indeed. This time, I'll be gone far

674
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,990
to the place both desolate
and harsh.

675
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:47,380
The food won't suit my taste
like the dishes made here.

676
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,680
Nights will be bitterly cold,
gripping my heart.

677
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,490
No one will care for me.

678
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,490
Don't worry.

679
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,560
Hurry.

680
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:02,910
I've made a silk blanket.
Take it with you.

681
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:05,640
May cold nights be
warm and comfortable.

682
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,930
Heh. Wow.

683
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,390
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

684
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,980
Ah.

685
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,070
Beautiful scent.

686
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,390
Uh...

687
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,930
Well, I'll return to the palace.

688
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,910
Come.

689
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,480
Wait.

690
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,320
Where are you rushing off to?
Stay with me a little longer.

691
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,630
Soon, I'll have to leave.
Stay with me.

692
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,670
Don't go anywhere.

693
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,310
Rampueng.

694
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,690
It'll be a long time
before I return.

695
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,650
Won't you stay?

696
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,520
Won't you?

697
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,470
Alright.

698
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,410
Come with me in the rickshaw.

699
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,290
Alright.

700
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,170
What are they doing?

701
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,010
"Train"
My training has been paid off.

702
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,670
Taken at last, Miss Rampueng.

703
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:25,930
After that night, I waited
with hope for him to return

704
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,050
and claim me as his.

705
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,990
But I waited.

706
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,430
Days became weeks.

707
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,520
Weeks became months.

708
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,600
Until I learned of bad news.

709
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,600
Khun Phra Bamroekrung
came to propose marriage

710
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,800
to you, Nuanlaor.

711
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,530
Excuse me?

712
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,880
It struck like a dagger, twisting
until my heart nearly gave out.

713
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,710
But I came to my senses
and realized

714
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,360
that Nuanlaor wasn't at fault.

715
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,000
She is my sister, my blood.

716
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,450
I would break before I let
harm touch her.

717
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:36,610
I could do whatever I could
to sacrifice for her,

718
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,510
even if it pained me.

719
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,080
"Fourteen days
before Khun Phra's Wedding"

720
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,670
After that, I did my best

721
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,680
to make her the woman he'll hold
above all others.

722
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,960
I asked Lady Jolie to teach her
Western pastries.

723
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,690
Today, I'll teach you how to make
a Spanish-style pastry

724
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,430
called churros.

725
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,140
The method is simple.

726
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:08,880
Bring water to boil,
then add sugar and butter.

727
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,220
Stir until they mix.

728
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,770
What's this yellow thing?

729
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,890
This is butter.

730
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,050
It's made from cow's milk fat.

731
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:23,950
Hmm?

732
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:27,890
Hmm.

733
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,230
Smells really good.

734
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:32,050
- Shall we?
- Let's make it.

735
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:34,990
Okay.

736
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,230
What are you cooking?

737
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,730
That smell is drifting
all the way outside.

738
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,440
We're making churros, Phi Rampueng.

739
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,420
Chu...?

740
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,920
"Churos," you said?
(Churos, a homophone
for a flavor enhancer)

741
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,650
No, no.

742
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,160
Churros, not Churos.

743
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,830
What a strange name for a pastry.

744
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,790
The smell is unusual too.

745
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,110
Excuse me.

746
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,390
Hrr...Ahem.

747
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,130
It must be the smell
of milk and butter.

748
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,450
What do we do next?

749
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,450
It's starting to boil.
Keep stirring until it mixes.

750
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,080
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

751
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,870
Don't let it burn.

752
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,690
Hrr.

753
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,230
How are you doing?

754
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:55,570
Hrr.

755
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,210
Lately, I've been feeling unwell.

756
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,410
Dizzy, nauseous all the time.

757
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:06,010
- For how long now?
- Several months.

758
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:09,440
And have your
monthly cycles stopped?

759
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,830
Yes, for several months.

760
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,810
Do you feel weak, sleepy,

761
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,360
and sensitive to smells
like never before?

762
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,890
These are the early signs
of pregnancy.

763
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,820
You're expecting a child.

764
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,350
Hmm?

765
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,170
Are you alright?

766
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,730
Please don't tell anyone.

767
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:43,330
Not a soul, okay?
I beg you. Please.

768
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,380
Calm down, Lady Rampueng.

769
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,370
I don't want Nuanlaor's wedding

770
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,860
to be ruined because of me.

771
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,320
Don't tell anyone about this.
My sister's wedding must go on.

772
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,590
Are you saying you're...

773
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,000
carrying Khun Phra's child?

774
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,830
I intended to give up on him
for my sister's sake.

775
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,820
But his child was growing
inside me.

776
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,820
So, I figured the father
of this child deserved to know.

777
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,070
Listen.

778
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,130
I don't like us meeting
in secret like this, Rampueng.

779
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,360
You used to send me letters
morning and night.

780
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,980
Did you not like that, too?

781
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,260
I told you many times to act like

782
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,840
we're nothing to each other.

783
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:26,680
What?

784
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,070
You want people gossip

785
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,010
about us meeting like this?

786
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,320
If it wasn't necessary,

787
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,190
I wouldn't have arranged this.

788
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,170
But you should know

789
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,090
you and I are not alone.

790
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,400
What nonsense is this, Rampueng?

791
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,450
Who else?

792
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,600
Are you insane?

793
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,250
Who else?

794
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,520
A child inside me.

795
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,340
I am pregnant.

796
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,990
Pregnant?

797
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:53,970
With whom?

798
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:58,820
You're the only one
I've ever been with.

799
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,280
Get rid of it.
Don't let it be born.

800
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,340
How can you say that?

801
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:10,850
Why not?
Don't you think it's a disgrace?

802
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,440
Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

803
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,690
- Heh.
- I can't believe...

804
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:17,250
your tongue is steeped in sin.

805
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,300
Me? Steeped in sin?

806
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,450
What sin?

807
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,320
What I told you was out of pity.

808
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,780
A man like me can take many wives,

809
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,520
and no one would bat an eye.

810
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,230
But you...

811
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,480
- Khun Phra!
- What?

812
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,980
Have you any conscience?
I'm carrying your child.

813
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,960
Heh. I tell you what?

814
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,690
It's not for men's fleeting desire,
but women's lack of wisdom.

815
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:40,920
Tch.

816
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,270
I regret mistaking
your poison for love.

817
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,050
Fine, Khun Phra.

818
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,890
I'll tell Nuanlaor everything.

819
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,810
Sure.

820
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:53,100
Go ahead. Tell her.

821
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,020
No matter what,
she'll still marry me,

822
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,190
as promised by Her Highness.

823
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:02,510
Think, first, how hopeless
she will feel.

824
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:04,950
Do it. Tell her.

825
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:10,470
And think hard about
what you'll do with that.

826
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,500
Tch.

827
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,950
From then on, I had to
hide my suffering

828
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,470
until after Nuanlaor's wedding.

829
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:35,340
Only then could I plan
my secret escape from the estate.

830
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,860
But things didn't go as planned.

831
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,020
Hmph. Huh.

832
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,850
Then what happened next?

833
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,490
What came next was

834
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,410
that he never had enough.

835
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,370
Foul mouth.

836
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,450
You slap and lecture me?

837
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,630
Suwanthani gives you a home.

838
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,950
But you show an attitude
toward the city lord.

839
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,700
If you repay me with this,
you're not welcome.

840
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,050
Out, git!
Leave.

841
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:04,300
Go on.

842
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,310
I sacrificed so much
for Nuanlaor to marry him,

843
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:12,140
but that treacherous man
never changed.

844
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,490
A man like him doesn't deserve
to go on living.

845
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:31,450
Khun Phra has been shot.

846
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,910
Those three slaves broke
from detention and killed him.

847
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,490
- Catch him.
- Oh, no.

848
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:36,590
Thongbai.

849
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,890
What about these two?

850
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:40,800
Run. Fast.

851
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:41,850
Hey, stop.

852
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,600
Are you telling me

853
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:55,150
that you shot Khun Phra?

854
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,740
Let go.

855
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,250
- Hands off.
- I didn't do it.

856
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,950
- Let go.
- Argh.

857
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:27,550
I said, hands off.

858
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,370
Will you help convince him
to save Thongbai?

859
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:34,890
Nobody listens to a word of a slave.

860
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,310
Please, Khun. I beg of you.

861
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,120
Thongbai is innocent. I swear.

862
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:43,540
Don't you swear in front of me.

863
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:48,440
No matter what,
Thongbai is executed today.
