00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,510
This show is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to actual persons,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,650
living or dead, or real events
is purely coincidental and

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,990
not intended to offend any person,
profession, or organization.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,080
Before noon tomorrow,
your head will roll.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,540
I didn't kill Khun Phra.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,350
Hands off.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,410
I didn't kill him.

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,110
If we can't get them
to release Thongbai,

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,520
we take him out.

10
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,160
So, this is it.

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,890
I will be executed.

12
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,010
Sangthong is still out there.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,330
He's trying.

14
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,000
I beg you, sir.

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,820
Thongbai is innocent.
I swear.

16
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,820
Stop right there.

17
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,390
No matter what,
Thongbai is executed today.

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,890
Stop the execution.

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,540
Don't interfere,
or you will be punished.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,720
Punished, I will be, anyhow.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,860
Because I'm the one
who killed Khun Phra.

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,280
Champi, keep watch for me, okay?

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,240
Miss Nuanlaor, are you sure?

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,510
If the master sees us,
we'll be in trouble.

25
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,950
It's fine. Don't worry.

26
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,490
Sorry, Champi.

27
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,520
It's okay. Let's hurry.

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,880
"Replica sword. Do not attempt."
Hold this for me, Champi.

29
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,430
And grab some banana leaves.

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,440
Be careful, Nuanlaor.

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,740
"Replica sword. Do not attempt."

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,580
Impressed? My sword skills.

33
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,720
Amazing.

34
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,300
What are you doing, Nuanlaor?

35
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,960
Weren't you making garlands?

36
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,690
Why are you out here?

37
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,100
I saw you sneaking out with Champi.

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,890
I knew you were up
to something mischievous.

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,250
Did you steal Father's sword?

40
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,230
You never change.

41
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,610
Well, you wanted
banana leaves, right?

42
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,500
I got some for you.

43
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,500
Phi Rampueng and I may be sisters,

44
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,460
but we couldn't be more different.

"Replica sword. Do not attempt."
Phi Rampueng, watch out.

59
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,740
I'll deal with that tiger.

60
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,830
"Replica sword. Do not attempt."
Back away, you beast.

61
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,570
Take this.

62
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,290
Nuanlaor, stop fooling around

63
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,480
and learn to behave appropriately.

64
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,300
My mother died when I was born.

65
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,690
That may be why I never
learned the grace

66
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,990
and manners of a proper lady.

67
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,670
I'm sorry, Father.

68
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,640
I just wanted to try sword fighting.

69
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,110
I'm not angry, child.

70
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,020
If you wanted to learn,
why didn't you ask me?

71
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,460
I could have taught you.

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,560
In my lack of grace,

73
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,690
I still had Father,
who understood me

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
and loved me for who I was.

75
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,890
Even without Mother,
I never felt incomplete.

76
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,840
But happiness was short-lived.

77
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,900
I don't have much time left.

78
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,880
Rampueng...

79
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,440
Hack...hack.

80
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,960
Take care of Rampueng.

81
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,690
You only have each other now.

82
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,000
Stay together.

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,490
And love each other dearly.

84
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,310
Yes, Father.

85
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,830
Especially you.

86
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,470
Don't be stubborn with your sister.

87
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,440
Don't let disagreements
come between you.

88
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,040
From now on, I'll look after
you, Nuanlaor.

89
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,340
Your name?

90
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,070
Rampueng, milady.

91
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,890
After Father's death,
our only relative, Auntie,

92
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,380
sent Phi Rampueng and me to serve
Her Highness in the palace

93
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,540
to learn the manners
of proper ladies.

94
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,260
And you. What's your name?

95
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,430
Nuanlaor, milady.

96
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,230
Phi Rampueng showed an affinity

97
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,890
for palace life more than anyone.

98
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,460
Her manners were impeccable.

99
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,320
Her household duties were perfect.

100
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,820
Nuanlaor.

101
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,020
What is that? Hmm?

102
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,260
A squirrel or a chipmunk?

103
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,710
It's a worm garland, Phi Rampueng.

104
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,550
Unlike her, I faltered in keeping
that kind of life.

105
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,940
Nuanlaor.

106
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,370
What are you carving?

107
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,980
A seal.

108
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,140
The strict palace code
allowed women no defiance,

109
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,810
but no one minded my reading habit.

110
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,050
Books revealed a great many subjects
I longed to know.

111
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,730
They were more fun
than household chores.

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,270
Ahem.

113
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,470
What is it, Phi Rampueng?

114
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,320
What do you think?

115
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,150
Put down your books.
It's time to practice carving.

116
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,630
Ugh, I don't want
to do that anymore.

117
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,700
Why not?

118
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,800
Look at this.

119
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,480
Oh?

120
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,510
Ten fingers were pricked by needles.

121
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,450
This was from a knife.

122
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,960
This burn mark was
from cooking practice.

123
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,590
Do I have to?
I'm riddled with wounds.

124
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,260
No excuses.

125
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,500
Hmph. You must practice.

126
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,190
We're fortunate to be in the palace,

127
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,640
learning to be proper ladies.

128
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,090
These skills will help you
when you marry,

129
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,640
and serve your husband.

130
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,440
But I don't want to get married.

131
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,060
We've got all we want here.

132
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,440
Why bow and serve a man?

133
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,090
You can't think that way.

134
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,540
A woman will be married
when the time is right.

135
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,820
And if the husband provides
all she needs,

136
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,300
her family will share in the honor.

137
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,900
But I don't want a husband.

138
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,940
Why rely on men to provide for us?

139
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,830
We can do that ourselves.

140
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,290
Hmph.

141
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,540
Alright.

142
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,100
And what will you do?

143
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,550
There aren't many jobs for women
outside the palace.

144
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,590
Even with a strong education,

145
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,060
a royal official job
isn't guaranteed.

146
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,330
There are plenty of jobs.

147
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,080
Shopkeeper. Chef.

148
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,170
Restaurant. Bakery.

149
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,650
So trendy.

150
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,170
I believe women can
achieve great things,

151
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,180
even rule people.

152
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,900
What nonsense you're saying.
Way, way off.

153
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,360
Do you think men will
let women surpass them?

154
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,100
Hmm?

155
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,650
Don't be a black sheep.

156
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,240
So, should I be
a white sheep like you?

157
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,250
Twenty years old, no ring, no man.

158
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,820
Maybe you're just
a different kind of black.

159
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,680
Nuanlaor.

160
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,420
I never thought
you'd say that to me.

161
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,310
Fine. Do whatever you want.

162
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,040
Read as many books as you like.

163
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,460
I won't bother.

164
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,710
Oh. I'm sorry.

165
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,690
I apologize. I didn't mean it.

166
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,150
Please forgive me.

167
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,240
You spoke out of line, didn't you?

168
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,780
Sorry.

169
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,830
I just don't want you to leave.

170
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,090
If you get married,
who will I have?

171
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,660
It's just the two of us. See?

172
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,730
We've always been together.

173
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,990
Don't go, please. Stay with me.

174
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,500
Don't be mad.

175
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,940
Hmm.

176
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,260
I'm not that angry.

177
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,690
Deep down, I realize
it's just my destiny.

178
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,030
Unlucky in love and...

179
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,650
bound with you forever.

180
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,260
- Hrr.
- Come on. It's all right.

181
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,020
You can never have enough of me
and my sweets.

182
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,260
- Dessert.
- Fat.

183
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,050
I never wanted to marry,

184
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,360
and I was glad she'd stay with me.

185
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,620
But came the day she accompanied
Her Highness to the coastal town.

186
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,490
That was the first time
we were separated.

187
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,110
Nuanlaor, help me see.

188
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,440
Do I forget to pack anything
on this list?

189
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,770
Hmm.

190
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,220
That's everything. Right, Champi?

191
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,400
Everything?

192
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,510
Of course, Miss.
I got you everything.

193
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,240
Phi Rampueng,

194
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,850
I don't understand
why you volunteered to go.

195
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,980
Remote, muggy,
laden with mosquitoes.

196
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,960
What about unkind passages
and jungle fever?

197
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,310
Huh...don't remind me of all that.

198
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,470
Wherever Her Highness ventures,

199
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,060
I'll accompany her.

200
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,000
Besides, something good
may come after this trip.

201
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,870
But I don't want you to go.

202
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,330
I'll be so lonely without you.

203
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,470
Ow? You can read
like you always do.

204
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,460
Isn't it good? No one to nag you.

205
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,150
I thought you'd like that.

206
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,280
I heard there's a play
outside the palace walls.

207
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,670
Would you like that?
Might help with the boredom.

208
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,090
No, I don't like crowded places.

209
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,310
Wow.

210
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,920
Ooh.

211
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,470
Just beyond the palace wall

212
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,560
lay experiences so eye-opening

213
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,810
that I didn't notice

214
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,520
how my sister changed
after she returned from the trip.

215
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,520
'My love stays true,
no fleeting, fickle play,...'

216
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,200
- Phi Rampueng.
- Oh?

217
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,930
Don't startle me like that.

218
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,220
What were you doing,
going like that?

219
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,740
What was that?

220
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,980
Uhm.

221
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,900
It's an old manuscript about...

222
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,680
stretching.

223
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,330
Like this.

224
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,070
For health, you know?

225
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,160
So, what brings you here?

226
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,570
Why are you hiding something?

227
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,150
- Oh...
- Hmm? What is that?

228
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,760
You wanna know?

229
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,910
This is...

230
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,880
A text from outside the palace.

231
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,500
I didn't want anyone to see it,

232
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,170
especially you, my dear sister.

233
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,680
So, if anyone knows about this text,

234
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,530
you can deny everything.

235
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,860
None can find you guilty.

236
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,330
You don't need to know, okay?

237
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,470
Is that so?

238
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,390
Of course.
Are you accusing me of lying?

239
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,510
- Hmm?
- You've been acting strange lately.

240
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,110
You've got something.

241
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,360
Nothing. Not at all.

242
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,220
Hmph. So, young lady.

243
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,340
Why are you here anyway?

244
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,410
Hmm?

245
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,460
It's about an acrobatics show
outside the palace.

246
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,790
Wanna see?

247
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,170
An acrobatics show?

248
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,500
Hmm.

249
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,150
Not interested.
You and Champi have fun.

250
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,880
Come on. Why not?

251
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,250
It's a lot of fun. Let's go.

252
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,810
Come on.

253
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,590
It'll be fun to watch with you.

254
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,290
Come with us. Please, please.

255
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,410
It'll be crowded.
I'll get a headache.

256
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,650
Hrr. Phi Rampueng.

257
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Don't forget.
I served Her Highness all day.

258
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,720
I want to rest, okay?

259
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,210
- Tired, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

260
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,310
I can help.

261
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,110
Let's see where it feels
stiff and tender?

262
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,260
Ooh. Oh.

263
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,040
- Here?
- Good, good.

264
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,170
Not there.

265
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,620
Hmph.

266
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,880
- Don't be sneaky.
- Let me see. What is it?

267
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,370
Sit here and be still.

268
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,540
I said you go with Champi.
So, go on then.

269
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,020
Lingering here, you could
miss the show.

270
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,370
- Okay, okay.
- Good.

271
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,500
I'll go with Champi then.

272
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,180
I'll bring you some snacks, okay?

273
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,340
- I'm going now.
- Okay.

274
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Ah!

275
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,760
A new bracelet?

276
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,970
Oh.

277
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,170
So many secrets lately.

278
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,380
Bye.

279
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,220
Bye.

280
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,850
What's with her lately.

281
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,060
What are you doing, Pikun?

282
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,750
Picking flowers, Miss.

283
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,320
Hey, don't pee here.
Why not use the water closet?

284
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,140
I'm really picking flowers,
look here.

285
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,970
(Picking flower,
slang for tinkling.)

286
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,370
Anything I can help you?

287
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,400
Just taking a stroll.

288
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,550
Oh, by the way, I need to ask you.

289
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,840
What is it, Your Grace?

290
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,020
What's wrong
with Phi Rampueng lately?

291
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,740
She's been acting weird.

292
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:29,220
Oh...I wouldn't say "weird,"
but she might be...

293
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,740
What, Pikun?

294
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,580
Squashing ants?

295
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,360
She's in love, Your Grace.

296
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,170
In love?

297
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,410
Yes. Head over heels in love.

298
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,010
Ow...

299
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,650
With whom did she fall in love?

300
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,250
I'm afraid I can't tell you.

301
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
What now?

302
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,720
Walls have ears.
I shouldn't tell nobody.

303
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,330
I need more jasmines.

304
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,920
In love?

305
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,330
Ooh. Wow.

306
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,720
Phi Rampueng has found love.

307
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,990
That news caught me off guard.

308
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,390
I didn't know how to
talk to her about it.

309
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,320
One thing was for sure.

310
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,290
She used to be mine,
but a man was taking her away.

311
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,720
Champi.

312
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,440
Champi.

313
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,190
Are we going now, Miss?

314
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,220
I'm about to lose my love.

315
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,380
What are you talking about?
What love?

316
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,040
Phi Rampueng is about to
leave me and get married.

317
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,610
Your Grace, I'm relieved
it's nothing serious.

318
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,150
You should be happy for her
if she's married.

319
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,670
She wanted a man for so long.

320
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,810
I meant she wanted to be married.

321
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,560
Many taunted her, saying
no man had ever looked her way.

322
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,080
Everything I say carries
double meanings, right?

323
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,940
Your Grace, please settle down.

324
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,030
Even if she got married,

325
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,600
you won't be alone.

326
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,460
You've still got me.

327
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,700
I'll be with you
and never leave your side.

328
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,470
I can't believe that.

329
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,560
A man will take you away eventually.
I'll be lonely here.

330
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,080
No way.

331
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,610
I will never let you feel lonely.

332
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,720
You can't get rid of me either.
I'll serve you until I die.

333
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,250
That I swear.

334
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,900
Don't do that.

335
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,700
Feeling better now?

336
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,650
Shall we go see the acrobatics show?

337
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,800
- So gorgeous.
- Let's see.

338
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,010
Your Grace. Over there.

339
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,740
Wow.

340
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,250
Foreign craftsmen are so skilled.

341
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,590
They can melt iron and mold it
into so many things.

342
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,460
Hmm.

343
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,670
If I grow up, I'd sail on a junk
and see foreign lands.

344
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,930
Amazing, huh?

345
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,450
- What's so funny?
- It's just that...

346
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,090
"sail on a junk" has
a double meaning.

347
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Which is?

348
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,180
(Sail on a junk was slang in plays
for sexual intercourse.)

349
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,200
- Champi, that's not what I meant.
- I know. I know.

350
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,980
I couldn't help it.

351
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,630
A graceful lady chooses
her words carefully.

352
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,160
Okay, okay. Heh.

353
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,380
Something is happening over there.
Shall we?

354
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,090
Sangthong.

355
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,150
Don't touch it.
Or you'll get whooped.

356
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,870
Thanks.

357
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,330
At last, the thrill is not gone.

358
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,010
Just one look.

359
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,250
She's a palace woman.

360
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,650
Ripe and delicious.

361
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,610
A fruit or a woman?

362
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,220
Woman, of course.

363
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,040
Dainty, radiant, and natural.

364
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,780
Wow.

365
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,200
Let's go.

366
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,330
I'll pave the way, sir.

367
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,430
Next up, our most thrilling act.

368
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,840
I recommend

369
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,860
watching closely.

370
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,810
So exciting. Never seen
anything like it.

371
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,690
Right? They're so talented.

372
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,720
Wanna see the show?

373
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,830
How about a round of applause?

374
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,120
Three, two, one.

375
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,050
Woo-hoo.

376
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,420
Where did the peels go?

377
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,100
Next is a durian. How about it?

378
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,960
Nice tricks, right?

379
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,460
But the peels?

380
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,220
Yeah, where are they?

381
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,910
Accidents don't happen
this gracefully.

382
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,290
Are you hurt?

383
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,390
Uhm.

384
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,470
I'm alright.

385
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,850
Sorry for the trouble.

386
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,240
- Ouch.
- It's nothing.

387
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,730
Champi.

388
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,150
Are you alright?

389
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,640
Let me help.

390
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,150
Here, you must be held responsible.

391
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,470
Vanishing trick.

392
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,580
Very cool.

393
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,610
I am Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

394
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,330
Could I be of help?

395
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,360
Ow. I didn't catch your name.

396
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:45,980
Young Miss.

397
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,060
What's your name?

398
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,620
So classy.

399
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,080
Just the way

400
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,540
I like it.

401
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,250
Classy or not, they're all yours.

402
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,980
Mm-hmm.

403
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,980
- Let's go.
- Sir.

404
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,790
Thank you so much, Miss.

405
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,440
I feel shameful to have my master
tend to my wounds.

406
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,670
It's nothing.

407
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,430
You and I are like sisters.

408
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,080
I don't mind.

409
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,190
Good thing you weren't hurt.

410
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,940
It was close, though.

411
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,180
Blessing or curse, I know not
what landed me in that man's arms.

412
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,130
If Her Highness finds out
a man touched you,

413
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,760
you'll definitely be punished.

414
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,430
Cute, huh?

415
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,400
Try it on, Miss.

416
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,450
Why so startled?

417
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,370
I'm not a ghost.

418
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,380
Let's go, Champi.

419
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,870
Heh.

420
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,070
- Can I see this one?
- Of course.

421
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,290
Here you go.

422
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,660
Pretty, isn't it?

423
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,200
That same Khun Phra,
but with sharper edges.

424
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,580
Let's go.

425
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,740
- Can I try coconut water, please?
- Of course, Miss.

426
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:07,620
Good time to rinse my face clean.

427
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,170
Coconut water is meant for a corpse.

428
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,750
Death may claim my body,

429
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,150
but your charm will forever
haunt my soul.

430
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,330
Why are you following me?
Such a nuisance.

431
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,600
Following you? Clearly coincidental.

432
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,260
Or better yet,

433
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,890
destiny.

434
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,190
What destiny? I've been
running around looking for her.

435
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,690
Oof.

436
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,330
- Let's go, Champi.
- Don't rush off. We just met.

437
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,210
Stay a while.

438
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,460
It's so disappointing.

439
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,540
Don't you remember?
I helped you last time.

440
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,860
I remember, and I already
thanked you.

441
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,150
What more do you want?

442
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,540
Just your name.

443
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,910
Hmm? What is it?

444
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,940
Best we're strangers.

445
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,410
Playing hard to get?

446
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,690
One day, she'll be at my feet.

447
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,300
Ugh.

448
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,740
She'll soon be, sir.

449
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,610
Heh.

450
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,360
Hahaha.

451
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,390
That man kept pestering me,
but I paid no mind.

452
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,580
My mind was on signs
Phi Rampueng was showing.

453
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,740
- Oh.
- Absent-minded.

454
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,180
Does it hurt?

455
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,390
You've been so distracted lately.

456
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,430
Feeling unwell?

457
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
It's nothing.

458
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,540
'A butterfly beast roams
the water wide,'

459
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,810
'She dwells within a cave
where whirlpools glide.'

460
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,540
'Sea monsters bow beneath
her fearsome reign,'

461
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,440
'Her form as vast
as elephants in frame.'

462
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,950
Oh, no. I can't hold it.

463
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,370
A girl's gotta go.

464
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,860
Ugh...ugh.

465
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,630
What's wrong?

466
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,440
She must've kept
something from me.

467
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,430
Are you ill? Anything hurt?

468
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,220
It's nothing.
Why are you here?

469
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,080
Hmm?

470
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,290
I was on my way to the water closet,

471
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,750
but I heard you.

472
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,240
Are you sure you're okay?

473
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,350
Probably, miang (food in wraps)
has gone bad.

474
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,290
That's it, then. I also get that.

475
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,400
My belly's been acting up.

476
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,900
Like dropping anchor.

477
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,810
You were going, right?

478
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Go on.

479
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,510
I'm worried about you.

480
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,050
Want some company?

481
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,930
No, no. Just go.

482
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,770
Are you sure?

483
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,530
Mm-hmm.

484
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,950
Really?

485
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,430
My worries over
her aberration vanished

486
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,280
when Her Highness summoned me
out of the blue.

487
00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:00,730
Guess what I summoned
you here today for?

488
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,150
Khun Phra Bamroekrung
came to propose marriage

489
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,220
to you, Nuanlaor.

490
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,120
Excuse me?

491
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,250
A marriage?

492
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,860
No, Your Highness.

493
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,990
I don't want to get married.

494
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,470
And I don't even know that man.

495
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,680
I won't marry him.

496
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,860
Then, why are you raising
your voice at me?

497
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,000
I don't want it.
No matter what, I won't marry him.

498
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,480
You have no choice.

499
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,250
A man has asked for your hand.
You must go.

500
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,540
Aren't we all equals?

501
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,860
Why do men's desires
override women's?

502
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,450
Huh.

503
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,870
Flesh and blood, yes.
Never the same worth.

504
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,110
Men will always be superior.

505
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,720
Look at the system of government.

506
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,530
Men get to choose their partners.

507
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,070
When the elders
of both families agree,

508
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,850
that's the decision.

509
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,340
Your simply must obey.

510
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
That's it.

511
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,080
And his interest in you bestows
an honor upon your family.

512
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,870
I'd rather have no honor
than be forced to marry him.

513
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,230
Huh...this girl doesn't listen

514
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,860
and retorts with aggression.

515
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,420
Are you asking for a beating?

516
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,160
Nuanlaor.

517
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,230
Prostrate yourself and apologize.

518
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,150
Who taught you to speak so rudely?

519
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,810
Please forgive her, Your Highness.

520
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,870
Apologize to her.

521
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,520
It's my fault, Your Highness.

522
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,670
My sister is so naive

523
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,990
that she spoke
without consideration.

524
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,920
Please don't punish her.

525
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,260
Huh.

526
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,610
Fine.

527
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,750
Since you're about to be married,

528
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,900
I'll let it go.

529
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,470
What happened, my lady?
What's going on?

530
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,470
"Crazy"
Ugh, I'm going crazy.

531
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,050
Why don't I have any say
in my own life?

532
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,360
Does Her Highness see me as
an object to be given away?

533
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,810
Please calm down.

534
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,890
Khun Phra might seem reckless,
but he could be a good man.

535
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,460
Excuse me?

536
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,910
Do you really think so?

537
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,120
Try to see the bright side.

538
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,430
Even if he's not a good man,

539
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,790
he has a lot of influence.

540
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,720
No matter his power,

541
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,690
he has no right to force
someone to marry him.

542
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,360
Hmph. I will not marry him.

543
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,220
I don't want to marry him.

544
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,510
You hear me?
I don't want to marry him.

545
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,000
Yes, I hear you.

546
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:00,540
But Her Highness' order
must be carried out.

547
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,150
Fine.

548
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,620
If he's so eager to marry,

549
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,170
he'll quickly realize
he made a mistake.

550
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,460
Tada.

551
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,330
Welcome home, Nuanlaor.

552
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,410
Since we'll soon be
husband and wife,

553
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,950
think of my home as your own.

554
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,950
Make yourself comfortable.

555
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:29,940
Ptooey.

556
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,930
Heh. Hahaha.

557
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,670
That's how it should be.

558
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,200
I'm glad you're not nervous.

559
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,910
Sangthong.

560
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,870
From now on, wherever she spits,
you clean. Got it?

561
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,490
Yes, sir.

562
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,020
May my exalted wife
enter our home of love.

563
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,740
But first,

564
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,190
prostrate yourself at my feet.

565
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,100
In this house, I rule.

566
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,840
How arrogant.

567
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,940
I will do that on the wedding day.

568
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,120
Unwillingly, of course.

569
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,630
Huh. Regardless.

570
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,860
Please, everything is ready for you.

571
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,580
Sangthong.

572
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,790
Help her.

573
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,540
Go ahead.

574
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,310
To celebrate your arrival
with a glorious meal,

575
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,520
I picked only the best dishes.

576
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,340
Spicy soup of secret love,

577
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,810
fried veggies of longing,

578
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,360
soup of deep affection,

579
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,690
steamed fish of care,

580
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,690
plain rice of love,

581
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,350
bitter melon soup of devotion,

582
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,160
and chili paste of tenderness.

583
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,430
Eat up, my dear.

584
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,450
Mwah.

585
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,610
Sorry. It was too flowery
for my taste.

586
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,290
It's fine.

587
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,320
A woman only hurts

588
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,950
the man she loves.

589
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,360
Okay, here comes a...

590
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,830
Please, enjoy your meal.

591
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,060
Slurp.

592
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,680
Ah.

593
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,620
Slurp.

594
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,730
Ptoo.

595
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,480
Heh.

596
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,360
Good to see you enjoy chicken.

597
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,110
Hear me!

598
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,900
Slaughter and cook
more chickens right away.

599
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,790
Hmph.

600
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,630
Eat as much as you like.

601
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Order anything you want.

602
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,550
Still smiling, huh?

603
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,060
Hmph, I'll kick it up a notch.

604
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,280
No sweet after dining
is a peasant's nibble.

605
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,300
Pick a fruit you like.

606
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,950
Might I suggest one?

607
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,220
So you don't feel missed out.

608
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,690
What?

609
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,410
Bananas.

610
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,990
So you don't go bananas

611
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,070
if you have none.

612
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,860
Not even a chuckle?

613
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,120
Help yourself to the fruits.

614
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,290
Ptoo.

615
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,170
Ptoo. Ptoo.

616
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,200
Ptoo. Ptoo.

617
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,780
Ptoo. Ptoo.

618
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,780
Ptoo.

619
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,670
Ptoo!

620
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,700
Heh. Impressive.

621
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
I like that.

622
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:00,280
Is he crazy or something?

623
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,330
Keep going.

624
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,930
What should I do, Champi?

625
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Nothing I did ever offended him.

626
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,900
And yet, the way he admired me
twisted my stomach.

627
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,170
Huh. I don't know
if he's deranged or what.

628
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,920
What should I do?
Help me think of something.

629
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,690
Pretend to be crazy?

630
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,940
Like this?

631
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,890
- Too ugly.
- Haha.

632
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,330
- Ah! Khun Phra.
- Going to bathe?

633
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,190
I'll join you. Hmm?

634
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,020
You can't show up like this.

635
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,510
Why not?

636
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,220
We're about to be husband and wife.

637
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,980
Why can't we enjoy
some innocent foreplay?

638
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,260
I am not yet married to you.

639
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,900
I only came to
prepare for the wedding.

640
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,220
You do not lay your hands on me.

641
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,580
Why not?

642
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,010
- Let me have one.
- No. Get back.

643
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,290
No. Let go of me.

644
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,270
What are you doing, Khun Phra?

645
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,540
Rampueng.

646
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,830
Whatchu doing here?

647
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,190
Uh.

648
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,690
Do you two know each other?

649
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,480
I met him after I accompanied
Her Highness.

650
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,960
I'm Nuanlaor's older sister,

651
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,170
here to help prepare
for the wedding.

652
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,470
Why have you never
told me about him?

653
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,260
We have just a passing familiarity.

654
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,990
No more than acquaintances.

655
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,080
Fine, then.

656
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:35,970
I'll bathe alone.

657
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,620
- Smells good?
- Yes.

658
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,500
What are you cooking?

659
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,100
That smell is drifting
all the way outside.

660
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,360
We're making churros, Phi Rampueng.

661
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
Chu...?

662
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,870
"Churos," you said?

663
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,240
The flavor enhancer?

664
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,330
Churros, not Churos.

665
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,320
Oh.

666
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,320
Hmm.

667
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,990
What a strange name for a pastry.

668
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
Uhm.

669
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,330
The smell is unusual too.

670
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,250
Excuse me.

671
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,720
Ugh.

672
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,250
Ahem.

673
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,810
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

674
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,900
Don't let it burn.

675
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,880
And have your
monthly cycles stopped?

676
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,280
Yes, for several months.

677
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,830
Do you feel weak, sleepy,

678
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,380
and sensitive to smells
like never before?

679
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,900
These are the early signs
of pregnancy.

680
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,720
You're expecting a child.

681
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,510
Hmm?

682
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,560
Are you alright?

683
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,260
Please don't tell anyone.

684
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,780
Not a soul, okay?
I beg you. Please.

685
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,880
Calm down, Lady Rampueng.

686
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,640
I don't want Nuanlaor's wedding

687
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,950
to be ruined because of me.

688
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,130
Don't tell anyone about this.

689
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,720
Are you saying you're...

690
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,980
carrying Khun Phra's child?

691
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,080
Khun Phra's demeanor alone
sickened me.

692
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,650
What he did to my sister
enraged me.

693
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,720
Phi Rampueng.

694
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,320
What's the matter?

695
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,130
Have you got anything to tell me?

696
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,130
Nothing.

697
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,790
I know everything.

698
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,360
You can talk to me.

699
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,420
That Khun Phra vilified you, right?

700
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,820
Tell me what he did to you.
I'll deal with him.

701
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,760
You need not do anything to him.

702
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,940
It's me.

703
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,260
My fault.

704
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,610
It's all my fault.

705
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,290
I must apologize.

706
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,610
Accept my apology.

707
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,780
Why are you apologizing?

708
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,100
I don't get it.

709
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,990
After I returned from
the trip with Her Highness,

710
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,300
I met Khun Phra.

711
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,230
I was afraid

712
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,400
to tell you, Nuanlaor.

713
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,300
I was weak.

714
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,700
I allowed him to dishonor me.

715
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,220
It's my fault.

716
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,290
Listen to me, now.

717
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,260
I, your sister,

718
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,220
never meant to steal your love.

719
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,440
I wanted to keep this a secret,

720
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,470
just for myself.

721
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,440
But now that you know,

722
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,260
I'll end this.

723
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,400
I'll end this myself.

724
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,320
Phi Rampueng, no.

725
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:05,780
Don't.

726
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,120
What is this?

727
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,030
I don't want you to suffer.

728
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,170
It'll all be over soon.

729
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:11,930
Let me do it.

730
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,260
What's in it? Tell me.

731
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,260
No. You don't need to know.

732
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,110
Don't treat me like a child.

733
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,240
Talk to me. I'll help you.

734
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:24,510
What can you do to help me?

735
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,340
What are you saying?

736
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,870
Ever since we were kids,
I have been your shield

737
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,110
and bound to Father's commands.

738
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,330
And somewhere along the way,
I lost myself.

739
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,020
Wait.

740
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,280
No life of your own?

741
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,520
What does that have to do with me?

742
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,560
You have to want it,

743
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:00,180
rather than clinging to
the quaint illusion.

744
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,770
A proper lady, waiting for
a perfect man to take you away.

745
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,010
So much for a perfect man.

746
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,280
That Khun Phra destroyed you.

747
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,860
Not only did he fail
to see your worth,

748
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,830
but you also failed
to see it in yourself.

749
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:25,980
Did you just slap me?

750
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:35,300
I am sorry.

751
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,260
I am so sorry.

752
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:42,360
Hmph.

753
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,850
I don't see my own worth.

754
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,760
I don't see my own worth.

755
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,830
Wah-wah.

756
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,250
I don't want this child to be born.

757
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,110
Calm down, Phi Rampueng.

758
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:03,660
Listen to me.

759
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,480
Don't hurt yourself.

760
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:11,150
Don't destroy your baby
because of that treacherous man.

761
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,250
If you do this,

762
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,520
I'll never forgive you
for the rest of my life.

763
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:17,920
Do you understand?

764
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,690
Your child is like my own.

765
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:25,790
I'll help you raise them.

766
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,450
Years ago,
Father entrusted me to you.

767
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,830
Now, I will return that favor.

768
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,030
You'll be all right.

769
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,930
Her truth made me
despise him more.

770
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,810
Khun Phra made my dear
and only sister

771
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,290
so broken, in body and in spirit,

772
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,720
that I wanted to kill him
with my own hands.

773
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,620
Why are we in
Khun Phra's room, Miss?

774
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,080
Keep watch.

775
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,750
Anyone coming, let me know.

776
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:09,900
Yes, Miss.

777
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,950
What are you looking for?

778
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:32,290
Let me help. It'll be faster.

779
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,400
Found it.

780
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,060
Oh, dear.

781
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,130
What's that for, Miss?

782
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,190
I am the one who killed Khun Phra.

783
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,330
- What?
- Huh?

784
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,550
- Huh?

785
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,120
Mom.

786
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,200
I've confessed. Now, arrest me.

787
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,590
Arrest me.

788
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:48,950
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

789
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,440
Everything I've said is true.

790
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,620
I've kept it for far too long.

791
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:58,070
Now, I'm here to face punishment.

792
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,930
Let Thongbai go.

793
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,790
Here comes your punishment.

794
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,020
Khun, sir.

795
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,640
Don't do this.

796
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:09,730
Don't take the law
into your own hands.

797
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,130
Zip it.

798
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,740
Step closer, and you'll get it.

799
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:41,630
Do it.

800
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:42,680
Lunge.

801
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,190
- Let me do it.
- Halt.

802
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,840
I'll do it. Let me do it.

803
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,750
Get a hold of yourself. Calm down.

804
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,050
No execution shall be carried out
without royal command.

805
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,990
Choosing death
before facing justice?

806
00:50:58,450 --> 00:50:59,450
Coward.

807
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,050
Life for life.

808
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,000
Is that justice?

809
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,200
Khun Phra had sins enough
to warrant death.

810
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,380
But who has the final say
on which sin seals his fate?
