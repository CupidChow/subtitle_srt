00:00:00,903 --> 00:00:02,510
This show is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to actual persons,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,650
living or dead, or real events
is purely coincidental and

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,990
not intended to offend any person,
profession, or organization.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,495
If men of law are yellow,

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,910
I'll paint the town red myself.

6
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,395
Why did you kill him?

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,420
Thongphiphop

8
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:21,248
is the son

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,205
of Khun Phra.

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,315
Now, we have two suspects.

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,699
Thongphiphop
and Khun Bamrungnakon.

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,515
The suspects, not just two,

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,841
but three.

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,305
From here on out,

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,828
I own Suwanthani.

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:54,148
Cross me and you are
as dead as Khun Phra.

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,180
Take this.

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,505
I'll bring you more.

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,665
Remember. Three times more.

20
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,265
You've got one week.

21
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:09,893
Fail, and I may decide
to do foolish things.

22
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:14,015
Go on. Wrap it up.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
Let's go.

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,095
Don't you dare take any out.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,785
Yes, sir.

26
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,852
Or it means your life.

27
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,130
Bang.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Bang.

"Mystery of the Deadly Sins"

42
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,110
My head hurts.

43
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,350
Why do suspects keep popping up?

44
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,115
Yeah.

45
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,570
I say everybody was motivated
to kill Khun Phra.

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Now what?

47
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:47,385
Are we to get evidence
from Muen Int, too?

48
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,510
Yeah.

49
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,320
This means

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,515
"Choice"
all choices are under consideration.

51
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,465
Each of them is a suspect.

52
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,780
We can't trust anyone.
It's best for Thongbai.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hold it.

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,705
Who's this "Choice" now?

55
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,195
(Choy, a homophone for a Thai name)
Choice, you know? Options.

56
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,945
Yeah?

57
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,225
Not a person's name.

58
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,250
An English word.

59
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,715
Ch...choice?

60
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,140
Do more reading, will ya?

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,480
Phi Sangthong.

62
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,775
Phi Thongbai nearly got caught.

63
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,890
This place may not be so safe now.

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,925
Thongbai, you shouldn't remain here.

65
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,205
What deserted temple

66
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,455
got police and Ang Yi
checked in on the same night?

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,195
Best find a new hideout.

68
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,195
I have no strength
to keep finding a place.

69
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,265
Haven't eaten for days.

70
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,265
At least, I can snatch
food from the cats here.

71
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,514
What if the new place has no food?

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,307
Hey, no worries, buddy.
I got your back.

73
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,815
Thongbai, we've arrived
at the market.

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,295
Plenty of food.

75
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,135
Hang on. Okay?

76
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,578
Give me a nod if you can.

77
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,860
No

78
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
more

79
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,180
strength.

80
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,180
He nodded.

81
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,330
Geez,

82
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,130
thanks.

83
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,140
Hey, hey. Back up.

84
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
We can't go in.

85
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,155
"Wanted: Murderer. Report if found."
His face is plastered everywhere.

86
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,180
We'll get caught.

87
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,455
No choice. We're here.

88
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,175
He's too weak to walk
with those legs.

89
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,415
We can't go too far anyway.

90
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,895
Right.

91
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,975
Zero strength.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,885
No real food for days.

93
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,305
I'm prepared to die right here.

94
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,920
- Hey, hey.
- Slow down.

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,499
They could recognize you
and give you a beating.

96
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,030
Look at your glamor shots
on those posters.

97
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,750
Don't you see?

98
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,290
I'm nearing my last breath here.

99
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,655
- Listen.
- Yeah?

100
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,035
You hide here.

101
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,375
We'll return with food.

102
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,705
Okay?

103
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,345
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

104
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,194
That's not good enough.

105
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,795
We need extra measure,

106
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,500
like a disguise.

107
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,265
Monk again?

108
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,867
Oh, no. Not a monk.

109
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,060
Whatchu thinking about?

110
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,185
Is it...

111
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,160
Sticky rice.

112
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,657
Hey, hey. Drop it.

113
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,535
Was I delusional?

114
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,175
Yeah, well. Let's make sure
no one sees you.

115
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,915
And I'll get you food.

116
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,840
I'll fetch some stuff.

117
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,020
Yes.

118
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:11,950
(Title: Wanipok, Artist: Carabao)
♪Destined to be...a vagabond.♪

119
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,063
Get real. Do I look it?

120
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:17,495
You've got that crazed hobo chic.

121
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,945
Hardly can anyone recognize you.

122
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,625
For real? Let me look in the mirror.

123
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,200
I got none.

124
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,970
Thanks. Thanks a bunch.
Much appreciated.

125
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,425
- Hey, hey.
- My money.

126
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,954
You fooled him.

127
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,455
- Right, right?
- Good job.

128
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,060
Thongbai, stay put.

129
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,175
Maiphlong and I
will get you some food.

130
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,475
Okay?

131
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,115
Sounds good, buddy. Hurry.

132
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,160
We'll be back. Save the money.

133
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,875
Just a little help for a meal today.

134
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,530
Nothing to eat for days.

135
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,799
Hey, what should we get him?

136
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,608
Before that, let me ask you first.

137
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:15,453
Do you have money
to buy food for him?

138
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,570
Money, I have none.

139
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,530
But I got what it takes.

140
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,815
- Charming women?
- Mm...yeah.

141
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,380
It takes too long.

142
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,540
Do it my way. Sticky fingers.

143
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,460
Your slimy fingers?

144
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,535
Got us neck-deep
in trouble every time.

145
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,635
The only trouble was
your silver tongue and the ladies.

146
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,345
I didn't have a heart to say it.

147
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,135
Then, stop.

148
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,955
But you always blame it on me.

149
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,410
- Because you always messed up.
- No, you messed up.

150
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,980
- No, I did not.
- Yes, girls got you in trouble.

151
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,175
Come on. Stop!

152
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,105
What are you? Five years old?

153
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,775
Gives me a headache.
Scram. Get cracking.

154
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,940
Uh...yeah.

155
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,505
- What?
- No quarrels.

156
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,995
Gives me a headache.
Scram. Get cracking.

157
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,284
- I'll do it my way, okay?
- Fine, fine.

158
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,033
- Fresh fruits for you?
- Oh, how nice.

159
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,290
Oh, my. A basket full of food.

160
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,057
From her back,
she must be really cute.

161
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,959
Hi, beautiful.

162
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,384
You're trampling on
a thing of mine.

163
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,775
What's that?

164
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,147
My aching hea...

165
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,305
Sangthong, it's you.

166
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,880
Champi, whatchu doing here?

167
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,665
Who do I steal from?

168
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,383
There. My target.

169
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,080
Easy-peasy.

170
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,520
Oh, so sorry. Let me help.

171
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:42,315
Real classy.

172
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,910
A silk cover on
a nothing-to-eat basket.

173
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,979
- I'll help.
- It's all wasted now.

174
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Maiphlong.

175
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,785
Pikun.

176
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,040
It's really you. Why are you here?

177
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,048
Hold on. Where're you off to?

178
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,415
You deserted your master.

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,204
I dare not.

180
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,875
With Khun Phra gone,
I had no reason to remain.

181
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,517
Remain you must.
His son is your master.

182
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:18,445
Running away is...

183
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,766
questionable.

184
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,534
You helped your friend escape.

185
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,780
I didn't. No, no.

186
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,435
Senseless, like an old man I know.

187
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,845
I know nothing.

188
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,830
I don't buy it.

189
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,673
You three rendered my master
a widow at her wedding

190
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,674
and returned to the palace.

191
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,195
Tell me at once where Thongbai is.

192
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,195
I'll report to the police.

193
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,155
I said I don't know...

194
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,620
Snake, snake. Whoa.

195
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
Oh, snake?

196
00:10:55,306 --> 00:11:00,298
Sangthong, you're such a...
Don't let me find you again.

197
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,520
I...

198
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,595
I don't know where Thongbai is.
I stole nothing from you.

199
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,185
I don't know anything.

200
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,670
Gotta be somewhere. See ya.

201
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,240
What was he mumbling about?

202
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,890
I didn't ask him anything.

203
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Oh, no.

204
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,015
My salt. Where is it?

205
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,280
Where have they gone?

206
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,520
It's taking too long.

207
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,680
One frog.

208
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,475
Two frogs.

209
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,675
Three frogs.

210
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,960
Four...frogs.

211
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,160
Hundreds of frogs
won't ease my hunger.

212
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,530
- Best I...
- Ahem.

213
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,380
Thongbai?

214
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,975
Oh, no. I am but a miserable pauper,
wallowing in filth.

215
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,650
You're a missionary.
Please keep out and look away.

216
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,200
I smell of garbage.

217
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,593
I recognized you a mile away,
Thongbai.

218
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:15,780
I'm just a pauper.
You must have mistaken me.

219
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,510
You ran away, right?

220
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,815
Wanna stay at
the mission station?

221
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,410
It's safe.

222
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,780
Fear not.

223
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
I'm friendly.

224
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
How...

225
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,280
can I trust you?

226
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,904
I could've screamed for help
when I saw you.

227
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,815
Come on.

228
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,815
Hungry? How about dinner?

229
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,535
Alright. But let me...

230
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,648
leave a clue for my friends.

231
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,700
They'll know where to find me
when they come back.

232
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,185
While you're at it,
whiten those fake teeth.

233
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,105
So you'll enjoy the meal.

234
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,130
Oh, yeah.

235
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,120
Hey, hey. Maiphlong.

236
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,095
Ow. Where's Thongbai?

237
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,775
I don't know.

238
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,825
You got no food?

239
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,902
Nuh-uh.

240
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,075
Where is he?

241
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,450
Oh, hey.

242
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,505
He got caught.

243
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,315
Who could recognize him
after I gave him a new face?

244
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,975
Simmer down.

245
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,824
He left you a clue to find him.

246
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Hmm?

247
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,056
Kratai said he left us a clue.

248
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,650
What's this?

249
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,860
Oh, yeah.

250
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,040
He was picked up

251
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,130
by an Ultraman.

252
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,665
Pew, pew. Their gesture.

253
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,270
Pew, pew. My foot.

254
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,170
A cross.

255
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,895
Must be the Red Cross.

256
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,898
Oh, please. It's a crucifix.

257
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,935
Crucifix.

258
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,460
Points to where?

259
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,970
What?

260
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,058
A crucifix.

261
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,750
Not on your arms.

262
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,620
Come in.

263
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,645
Should I come in?

264
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,670
Of course.

265
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,995
Oh, and my shoes?

266
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,990
Keep those on. Come in.

267
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,420
Rest here.

268
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
Okay.

269
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,770
Relax now.

270
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,620
May I sit down?

271
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Thank you.

272
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,495
Here you are in God's embrace.

273
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,785
A holy ground.

274
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,996
You are safe in God's arms.

275
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,676
In God, we trust.

276
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,305
I'll fix you something.

277
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,200
You can

278
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,379
get yourself cleaned up.

279
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,720
Will do, Ma'am.
Thank you so much.

280
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,870
Go ahead.

281
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,050
Be careful.

282
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,370
If it's too hot for you,

283
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,940
try this.

284
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,520
Sop the bread.

285
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,470
And have a taste.

286
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,215
Alright. Uh...

287
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,500
I take the bread, and...

288
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,470
Dip in the bowl.

289
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,150
Very tasty.

290
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,025
What is it? I've never tried.

291
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,175
It's a bowl of creamy corn soup.

292
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,254
I simmered corn and stirred
in cream made from milk.

293
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,220
Milk.

294
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,551
I only heard of making
whipped cream from coconut milk.

295
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,925
My homeland has no coconut milk.

296
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,345
Milk and butter can keep us warm
in cold seasons.

297
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,795
Bread also helps us
stay full longer.

298
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,933
This wisdom has been passed down
for generations.

299
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,348
And I came to share our wisdom
with the world.

300
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:19,535
Softening your heart with food
is a more diplomatic approach.

301
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,051
Full and happy, you're more open
to God's word.

302
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,535
The so-called soft power.

303
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,075
Gastrodiplomacy?
You might be right.

304
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,885
We want to share
our culture and wisdom.

305
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,575
Let it spread beyond borders,
drawing demands,

306
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,324
and filling coffers.

307
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,695
Profit is secondary.

308
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,480
My primary mission is
sharing God's word with the world.

309
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,440
How generous you are.

310
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,195
You let me hide here
and fix me food.

311
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,335
Thanks so much.

312
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,308
I don't know how to
repay your kindness.

313
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:09,476
You're welcome.

314
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,001
Thanks again.

315
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,465
But why do you trust me?

316
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,020
No one does.

317
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,030
Perhaps you know
who the real murderer is?

318
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:27,961
Uh.

319
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,015
You need some water.

320
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Enjoy.

321
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,870
I guess it's okay.

322
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,975
That Thongbai.

323
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,685
I brought him food, but he's gone.

324
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,775
Come on. Good thing you didn't
eat that on the way.

325
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,000
Come on.

326
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:41,282
Sangthong, you think he's here?

327
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,163
Of course. Don't you see the clue?

328
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,275
Not here, where? Land of Light?
(Ultraman's planet)

329
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
Oops.

330
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,775
Maiphlong.

331
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,145
Don't you look before leap?

332
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,325
Look before leap?
It was in my way.

333
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,970
Oh, yeah? That's cute.

334
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,525
Why keep the silence?
Thongbai is here.

335
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,145
The cross is our clue.

336
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,090
Quiet.

337
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,375
We don't know if he was
invited or kidnapped.

338
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,420
Got it?

339
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,969
He may have left another clue
as a cry for help around here.

340
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,750
Use your head.

341
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,835
I couldn't catch up
without your telling me.

342
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Could've asked.

343
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,510
What are you doing here?

344
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,370
Oh.

345
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,970
- We came...
- To see Thongbai.

346
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,370
Tho...

347
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,325
Sorry, Ma'am.

348
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,850
- Sangthong.
- Thongbai.

349
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,215
Thongbai.

350
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,990
- Thongbai.
- Thongbai.

351
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,610
Thongbai.

352
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,235
Thongbai.

353
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,090
Why aren't you answering?

354
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,620
Is he dead or snoring?

355
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,724
He's not dead, just fell asleep.

356
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,086
Asleep? I'd smack him dead
for making me worried.

357
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,860
Ma'am.

358
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,745
He's safe and sound.

359
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,010
Why did you hesitate
to let us see him?

360
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,795
I wanted to be sure
nobody followed you here.

361
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,656
He might get caught.

362
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,421
Did you bring him here?

363
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,735
Why is he lying here?

364
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,825
I met him at the market.

365
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,415
He looked famished,
so I brought him here.

366
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,395
He must have spent days
in the hideout.

367
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,220
Exhaustion clings to him.

368
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,645
I figured that much.

369
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,813
A lovely person like you comes
with a beautiful heart.

370
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,220
No way you wished him harm.

371
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,545
Get all that?

372
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,750
Yeah.

373
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,125
Feeling safe, he's sound asleep.

374
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,570
Thanks for your help.

375
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,255
Could you look after him
a while longer?

376
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,415
We must tend to other business.

377
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,290
He's not quite able to move about.

378
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,770
Of course. I brought him here.
I'm glad to help.

379
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,430
You possess beauty, mercy,

380
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,048
"Angel"
and all that makes you my angel.

381
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,130
Your friend.

382
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,250
Priority.

383
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,545
Better go now.

384
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,695
We'll come back to take him
off your hands.

385
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,000
Chop-chop. I promise.

386
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,455
You get going.

387
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,345
Your move, buddy.

388
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,677
Don't you see he needs our help?

389
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,085
Whoa, what? Ma'am.

390
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,485
What is it you're doing?

391
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,950
Are you gonna kill me?
No, please. I beg you.

392
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,469
Did I wake you?

393
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,905
I just finished grating coconut meat

394
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,852
and was about to cut up linens.

395
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,170
Cut up linens.

396
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,280
Get back to sleep.

397
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,910
You gave me a fright.

398
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,190
Oh, yeah. I fell asleep.

399
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,080
Did you put anything in the soup?
I saw you did it. Tell me.

400
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,275
I thought it was for seasoning.
Did you drug me?

401
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,945
- I did not.
- Knife, knife.

402
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,660
It was chamomile.
Supposed to relax you.

403
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,545
Cha...
Chamo...

404
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,160
Chamomile.

405
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,850
A chrysanthemum-like herb

406
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,975
with white flowers
and a yellow center.

407
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,225
It relieves your anxiety
and promotes a sense of calm.

408
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,225
I guess it was too much.

409
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,905
That's why you slept like a baby.

410
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,480
Well.

411
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,995
What a relief.
Sorry for thinking ill of you.

412
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,345
The first time I heard of
this kind of herb.

413
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,255
They thrive in cool temperatures.

414
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,095
I bring it along when I go abroad.

415
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,105
People I talk to
often tell me their anxieties.

416
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,905
They got me worried
and unable to sleep at times.

417
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,368
Chamomile is a great help.

418
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,602
Don't worry. It's completely safe.

419
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,145
Anyway...

420
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,530
- back to sleep.
- Ow.

421
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,950
Alright.

422
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,910
She's so good to me.

423
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,140
Is she attracted to me?

424
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,895
Sangthong, your charm is out.

425
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,175
It's time for inventors.

426
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,766
I'll soup up something for her.

427
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,800
That's done.

428
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,130
Miss.

429
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,530
May I help you?

430
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,920
I hope you stop doing it.

431
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,102
Don't make anything worse.

432
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,040
What are you saying?

433
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,110
I might not be able
to help you anymore.

434
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,141
You know what you're doing is wrong.

435
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,725
No, it was Khun Phra who wronged.

436
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,020
"Calm down"
Calm down.

437
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,410
Please control yourself.

438
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:28,095
You should not talk ill
about Khun Phra.

439
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,905
Men like Khun Phra will be punished
when the final judgment falls.

440
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,298
All I could say is a warning.

441
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,525
"You reap what you sow."
You reap what you sow.

442
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,602
Every deed is a seed.

443
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,240
Its fruit is yours to bear.
Good or bad.

444
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,510
Forgive me for my sins.

445
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
Amen.

446
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,660
Phi Muen.

447
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,945
"Green Lantern Brothel"
Welcome.

448
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,660
- Stand guard.
- Yes, sir.

449
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,195
I told you.

450
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,375
Men like him don't wander far
from a few places.

451
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,756
When I accompanied Khun Phra,
I often met him here.

452
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,758
Let's go in.
I'm dying to meet the girls.

453
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,835
Hold on.

454
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,615
Don't let lust get the best of you.

455
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,800
Our mission is to get his secret.

456
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,105
Says the man who always
messed up our plans.

457
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,820
Can't I enjoy a little dance
with the girls?

458
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,585
Oh, Ma'am. You arrive just in time.

459
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,410
Come, come. This way.

460
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,220
Maiphlong. Isn't that Lady Jolie?

461
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,860
Why's she here?

462
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,540
A missionary at
the Green Lantern Brothel?

463
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,195
You know?

464
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,990
She's a woman.

465
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,310
And a woman has just
one reason to be here.

466
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,945
Shut it, foul mouth.

467
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,995
My angel Jolie would never
stoop to that.

468
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,945
You slap my head hard.

469
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,105
What? Can't accept her
if she works here?

470
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,025
Let me school you.

471
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,545
"Sex worker"
Sex worker is straight up a job.

472
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,215
Don't ever look down upon them.

473
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,776
That's not what I meant.
Dignity exists in all lines of work.

474
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,776
- There you are, Thongbai.
- So, you're up.

475
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:46,195
I followed Lady Jolie here.
She looked suspicious.

476
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,495
I overheard her talking to a man.

477
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,916
She said Khun Phra deserved
what was coming for him.

478
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,932
You think she killed Khun Phra?

479
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,460
No way. She wouldn't.

480
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,655
Don't judge a book by its cover.

481
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,885
I didn't suspect her
until I overheard her conversation.

482
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,060
What did you hear?

483
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,730
I hope you stop doing it.

484
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,525
Don't make anything worse.

485
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,040
What are you saying?

486
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,480
You know what you're doing is wrong.

487
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,345
No, it was Khun Phra who wronged.

488
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,619
You should not talk ill
about Khun Phra.

489
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:38,362
Men like Khun Phra will be punished
when the final judgment falls.

490
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,440
Ma'am.

491
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,055
Ma'am killed Khun Phra?

492
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,110
Muen Int didn't?

493
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,035
Words aren't proof enough for me.

494
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,080
Since we're all here.
Keep an eye on both of them.

495
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,970
That's why you're the smartest.

496
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,985
How should we get in?

497
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,345
We don't look like
we have business here.

498
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,370
Yeah.

499
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,085
Come. Whatchu got in your bags?

500
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,420
My inventor's bag

501
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,105
has got nothing.

502
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,130
Just a sec.

503
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,905
- What's that?
- Uh...

504
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,370
Either a drape or women's silk.

505
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,810
Somehow, it stuck with me
on the way over here.

506
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,615
My sticky fingers.

507
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,640
- Your big bag. Give it to me.
- Here, here.

508
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,370
Why did you take it for? Mosquitoes?

509
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,370
Why not?

510
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,420
This time, you play
right into my forte.

511
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,925
Good evening, Muen Int.

512
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,555
Oh, my. Big gun.

513
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,570
- I'll keep it safe here.
- Mm-hmm.

514
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,525
Right here.

515
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,880
You're in luck for tonight's
exclusive potion.

516
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,475
Here you go, sir.

517
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,535
I call it Stud's Rack Attacks 17.

518
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,975
You'll take wild rides
from game one to seventeen,

519
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,530
and still rise,
rock-hard ready for more.

520
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:31,765
Seriously? I don't believe it.

521
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,790
But...

522
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,555
I'll give it a whirl.

523
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,615
If it's that potent,

524
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,305
give me that poison.

525
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,330
Of course, sir.

526
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,498
Uh-uh. Sh. Sh. Sh.

527
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,595
Not like that.

528
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,881
Here you go.

529
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,655
What madness?

530
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,435
You brought a big jar,
but pour me a tiny cup.

531
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,570
If you drink from that big glass,

532
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,125
900 women will shudder in fear.

533
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,115
One sip will give you pleasure

534
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,345
no man would dare dream of.

535
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,370
Yeah?

536
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,310
May I?

537
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
That is enough.

538
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,930
No weird smell.

539
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:29,181
I don't feel like a stud.
Did you overpromise?

540
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,910
Any moment now, sir.

541
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,930
Girls, come on in.

542
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,930
They are shy, yeah?

543
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,079
Lower your hand fans.

544
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,516
Angelic enchantresses.

545
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,432
Exquisitely alluring.

546
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,362
Heartbreakingly radiant.

547
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,382
Irresistibly enchanting.

548
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,455
Is he for real?
You think we got him?

549
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,595
Yeah. He's talking like a drunk.

550
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
I think not.

551
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,570
He fell for

552
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,960
"Makeover"
my fantastic makeover for you.

553
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,220
Of course, he's drunk.

554
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,260
Fleece him clean.

555
00:36:34,285 --> 00:36:37,392
"Deal"
Remember our deal, 70-30.

556
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,170
- 30 is your cut?
- 70, you silly.

557
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,120
"Do your best"
Fighting.

558
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,130
Who cut a deal with her?

559
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,820
Ladies.

560
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,840
Turn around, would you?

561
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,622
Alluring mystique.
Show your face, please.

562
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,370
Come quick.

563
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,620
Now, now.

564
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,195
Yes, sir.

565
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,480
This way.

566
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,455
- Is it good?
- Ah.

567
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,690
What do you think?

568
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,040
Right there. Just right.

569
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,055
Oh, hey.

570
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,330
I forgot to introduce myself.

571
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,420
Call me Phi Muen.

572
00:37:58,894 --> 00:38:01,560
What are your names?

573
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,815
Maiphlong. (Thai for a combat staff)

574
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,920
Your name feels like a man's foot
slamming into my hump.

575
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,305
Her mom named her for luck.

576
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,925
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh?

577
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:18,370
The name sounds tough,
so she would grow strong.

578
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,130
So I am tough and strong,

579
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,480
like a buffalo.

580
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,581
A cute buffalo, nonetheless.

581
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,020
- Grrooff.
- Grrooff.

582
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,900
- Is that how they grunt?
- Yes, sir.

583
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,220
And, oh.

584
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,195
What is your name, cute face?

585
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,855
Me, Sali, sir.
(Chinese pear)

586
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,755
Dripping with golden nectar at that.

587
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,480
May I have a taste right now, Sali?

588
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,690
Phi Muen is so naughty.

589
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,080
She's sweeter than I am.

590
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,995
And my name is

591
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,710
Thongmuan. (Sweet roll snack)

592
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,365
- Thongmuan.
- That's right, sir.

593
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,745
Are you the crispy or the soft kind?

594
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,105
Let me have a bite.

595
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,950
Argh!

596
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,665
This is frustrating.

597
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,725
I paid for pleasure.
What's with all the recoils?

598
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,035
- Oh, no. Please don't get mad.
- Yeah, yeah.

599
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,280
Actually,

600
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,770
you'll enjoy playing a game wih us.

601
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,125
Game?

602
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,265
It's called

603
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,470
Answer or Challenge. Will you play?

604
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,950
Sounds fun.

605
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,055
Let's play.

606
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,345
I'll spin this bottle.

607
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:50,780
Whoever it points to
gets to ask someone.

608
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,835
Mm-hmm.

609
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,375
And you must choose

610
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,355
to answer or to face the challenge.

611
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,855
If choosing to answer,
you must tell the truth.

612
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,128
Okay.

613
00:40:01,153 --> 00:40:05,745
Otherwise, you must complete
the challenge with no exceptions.

614
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,255
Are you game?

615
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Okay.

616
00:40:09,103 --> 00:40:11,295
This game is called

617
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,040
"Truth or Dare"
Truth or Dare.

618
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:18,285
Sali, you know of Western culture.

619
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,530
- So, shall we?
- Of course.

620
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,200
Who's the first...

621
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:27,970
Oh?

622
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,750
- Truth or Dare?
- Truth.

623
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,125
When you were ill
and had me dig the pit toilet,

624
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,400
were you actually sick,
or was that one of your tricks?

625
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Honest answer.

626
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,600
Trick.

627
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,500
- I'mma get you good.
- No, no.

628
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,995
Help me, sir.

629
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,880
I couldn't eat for days
from the stench.

630
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,825
- Calm down.
- You.

631
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,975
- Calm down.
- Okay, okay.

632
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,530
Girls should keep their manners.

633
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,680
- Let's keep this going.
- Yes, sir.

634
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,240
Oh, that.

635
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,925
Here's our chance.
Ask if he killed Khun Phra.

636
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,685
- Now?
- Now or never.

637
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,845
Would a drunk give an honest answer?

638
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:25,550
May I ask
what you girls are whispering?

639
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:27,715
It's the heat, Phi Muen.
We're fanning.

640
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,280
Hmm? What's this?

641
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,000
Ah.

642
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,910
I'll ask...

643
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,641
Before that,

644
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:47,415
you'd be excited to know
Stud's Rack Attacks 17

645
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,575
is kicking like a wild stallion.

646
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,995
Ah...I have a thing for
grace in glasses, too.

647
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,240
Could I be so bold just for once?

648
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,500
That's it.

649
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,145
I'm out of here.

650
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,620
Get off.

651
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,200
Ugh, heebie-jeebies.

652
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,950
Thongbai. Wait.

653
00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:23,155
Don't run. We need his secret.

654
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,905
Forget it. Didn't you see
he almost kissed me?

655
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,950
I'mma wash my face.
Totally grossed.

656
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,815
Hey, come here.

657
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,530
Is that Lady Jolie?

658
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,200
Who else?

659
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,130
She has a knife.

660
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,215
I'll follow her.

661
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,795
You go back to Maiphlong
and complete our mission.

662
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,630
Wait, let me follow her.

663
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,690
No, he gave me creeps.

664
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,500
You left me with him. How dare you?

665
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:05,060
Where did you run off to, ladies?

666
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,455
You take Phi Muen back in the room.

667
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,925
I'll be there shortly.

668
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:15,330
Gotcha, Nong (Endearment term) Sali.
Hurry back.

669
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:18,220
Of course, sir. I'll be right there.

670
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:22,540
- Let's go, Phi Muen.
- Don't be a naughty baby.

671
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,350
Ma'am.

672
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,480
What are you doing?

673
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:46,770
How did you get here, Thongbai?

674
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,130
Who's Thongbai?
I'm Thongmuan.

675
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,172
Nice try.
But you can't fool me.

676
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,254
Lower your veil.

677
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,350
Why kill the courtesan?

678
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
Ugh.

679
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,745
Who's that?

680
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,995
Ugh.

681
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,485
What's that?

682
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,510
Ouch.

683
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,060
Ow.

684
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,775
Ghost.

685
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,305
Help me. It's a ghost.

686
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,755
Not funny.

687
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,170
Just a cramp.

688
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,925
Ghosts don't look pretty.

689
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,325
A ghost?
It'd be you, ugly duck.

690
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,350
Me?

691
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:28,930
So, uhm.

692
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,730
The blood stain all over you?

693
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,715
Menstrual fluid.

694
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:40,266
I showed her that coconut peat wads
absorbed the stain really well.

695
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,333
So, nobody's dead.

696
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,224
Should someone must die

697
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,130
it'll be you.

698
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Ma'am.

699
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,870
You gonna silence me for this?

700
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,255
That's not what I meant.

701
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,855
I said you deserve to die

702
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,965
because you emerged from hiding

703
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,984
while being under
an execution order.

704
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,849
If someone sees you, you're dead.

705
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,505
Here you go. A sanitary pad.

706
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,730
Give it a try.

707
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:40,075
Sanitary pad.

708
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:43,247
Put it down. Not a toy.

709
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,220
Excuse me.

710
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,750
Police frequent here all the time.
Doesn't it occur to you?

711
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,905
And you brought the knife

712
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,220
to make these pads for these women?

713
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,460
Yes.

714
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,935
They deserve proper treatment
like all the rest.

715
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,655
When they're ill, no doctors
come to their aid,

716
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,375
not even to educate them
on health warnings.

717
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:22,235
They are entitled to the fundamental
right to health like others.

718
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,745
You know?

719
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:28,210
Countless of them died,
consumed by men's insatiable desire.

720
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,780
Health service is their right,
as befits them as equals.

721
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,270
I wanted them to have welfare.

722
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,280
But my hope was short-lived

723
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,440
as Khun Phra was killed
before he could act.

724
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:48,195
So, you had no reason
to cause him harm.

725
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,310
No.

726
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:53,495
For men like him,
death would come as a reckoning.

727
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,181
My only regret is that my fight
for women's rights died with him.

728
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,370
Men rarely listened,
let alone cared.

729
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,915
But who knows?

730
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,130
He could've broken his promise

731
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,386
just like every governor before him.

732
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,080
Pray tell.

733
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,117
Did you wish Khun Phra dead or not?

734
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,338
Words are easy.
I can answer just about anything.

735
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,420
But you really think I did it?

736
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,460
I overheard your conversation

737
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,370
with a foreigner
at the mission station.

738
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:48,633
Down to three of us,
we can't play anymore.

739
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:54,170
So, wise guy, now what?

740
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,950
The game's not over yet, sir.
You didn't give us any answer.

741
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,855
Your friend's gone.
She didn't ask anything.

742
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,175
Let's drink through the night.
Forget her.

743
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,695
But I was told

744
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,925
a man is only as good as his word,
for without it, he is nothing.

745
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:25,095
A man of your stature,

746
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,382
once promised to speak the truth,
betrays that honor in the end.

747
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:33,775
Spot on.

748
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,595
My ego has grown so much now.

749
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,620
Come.

750
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:42,725
Whatever burns in your mind,
ask it now.

751
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:45,625
Throughout your long career
in the force,

752
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,580
have you ever taken a life?

753
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,455
Hmm? You should have asked
if he killed Khun Phra.

754
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,203
Be quiet. We must be subtle.

755
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,209
I am a police officer.

756
00:49:00,234 --> 00:49:05,015
Killing the criminals is just
another line in the day's report.

757
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,525
- Oh...
- Heh...

758
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,110
What if it's not a criminal, sir?

759
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,685
All dead.

760
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:18,995
Whoever wants to kill me
will end up dead, too.

761
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,730
No mercy. No exceptions.

762
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,855
Ooh. Wow.

763
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,880
You like?

764
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,570
You're so cool.

765
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,655
That's how you like it, Sali?

766
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,785
Very much so, sir.

767
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,035
I like macho men like you, too.

768
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:59,974
You were shot,
but why weren't you injured?

769
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,650
I was unscathed

770
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,210
because I

771
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,370
had sacred protection.

772
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,785
Khun Phra Bamroekrung also had that.

773
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,215
How could he be shot dead so easily?

774
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,455
Hey!

775
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,010
You dare put me next to him?

776
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:25,925
I own only the real ones,
for they protect real men like me,

777
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:31,375
unlike frauds and scoundrels
like him.

778
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,987
Now, I'm mad.

779
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,750
Ahem.

780
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,455
- Oh, my dear, Muen.
- Tch.

781
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:45,255
I did not intend to compare you
and that man.

782
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,605
I couldn't help feeling curious.

783
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,620
You both own sacred amulets.

784
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,420
But why did you have
the immunity to bullets

785
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,705
but not him?

786
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,905
Pray tell, sir.

787
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:02,764
No amulets protect
treacherous men like him.

788
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,185
Treacherous how, sir?

789
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:07,450
Extremely selfish.

790
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,608
He only takes and takes.

791
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:14,915
Men like him are better off dead

792
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:20,095
so no one will be threatened
by him again.

793
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,195
- He's such an evil man.
- Yes.

794
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,055
- Him gone, you're number one.
- Yes.

795
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,669
- So, you shot him, dead and gone.
- Yes.

796
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,675
We came to get
the truth out of you.

797
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,745
You killed Khun Phra
and blamed it on us.

798
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:02,125
If you take me
to apprehend Thongbai,

799
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:06,855
I might forgive you two.

800
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,305
How about that?

801
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,240
Khun Phra dishonored Lady Jolie.

802
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,055
A single incident

803
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,685
hardly gives reason
for murder, right?

804
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,415
Not just once.

805
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,240
- What?
- Huh?
