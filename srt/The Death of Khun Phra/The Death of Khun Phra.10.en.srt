00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,510
This show is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to actual persons,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,650
living or dead, or real events
is purely coincidental and

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,990
not intended to offend any person,
profession, or organization.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,810
I surrender.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,890
With that evidence, you will go

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,890
straight to
the execution ground tomorrow.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,450
The world turns blind
to slaves like us.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,760
Our master, like Lady Nuanlaor,
might see.

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,950
Short and sweet version.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,210
I'm carrying Khun Phra's child.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,700
Get rid of it.
Don't let it be born.

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,800
I can't believe...

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,940
your tongue is steeped in sin.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,650
Are you telling me

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,290
that you shot Khun Phra?

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,020
Sir, I didn't kill Khun Phra.
Please believe me.

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,470
- Shut up.
- Believe me.

18
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,810
Get down.

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,630
Ungrateful slave.

20
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,510
He gave you food
and a place to live,

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,830
but you repaid him with murder.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,370
Mark my words.

23
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,910
Before noon tomorrow,
your head will roll.

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,980
I didn't kill Khun Phra.

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,540
I didn't kill him.

26
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,430
What's wrong with you?

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,020
You turned yourself in,
and now you're spouting nonsense.

28
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,440
I'm telling the truth.

29
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,480
Lady Jolie killed Khun Phra.

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,630
Come again?

31
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,090
Listen to me, sir.

32
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,610
I've investigated,
and I know that she killed him

33
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,890
because he dishonored and hurt her.

34
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,050
Is that true?

35
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,630
Yes, sir.

36
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,710
The gun.

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,660
The gun I was holding was hers.

38
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,850
She hid it at the mission station.

39
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,060
Oh, my.

40
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,210
So, you believe me now?
Go arrest her.

41
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,320
Thongbai.

42
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,560
Thongbai.

43
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,070
Muahaha.

44
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,540
I don't believe you.

45
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,380
Hey.

46
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,920
Death's terror drove you mad.
And now, you're accusing her.

47
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,380
Hrr. Pathetic.

48
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,040
But fine.

49
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,870
Since your life is hanging
by a thread,

50
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,510
I'll let your ramblings slide.

51
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,200
Make every last moment count.

52
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,810
Breathe in.
Breathe out.

53
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,580
Make every breath count.

54
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,540
Bye, bye, bye.

55
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,500
Sir, wait.

56
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,470
- What?
- Please believe me.

57
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,460
I didn't kill Khun Phra.
She did it.

58
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,630
- Wait.
- Tch.

59
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,720
That should knock
some sense into you.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,010
Ugh. Hack.

61
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,180
Muen! You rotten police.

62
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,810
If I ever get out,
you'll pay with your blood.

63
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,470
Oh, so you're
threatening me now?

64
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,780
You think you can take me on?

65
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,690
You're the one who's going
to lose your head.

66
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,370
Anything else?

67
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,240
You...corrupt police.

68
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,670
This country is in such disarray

69
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,430
because of scum like you.

70
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,020
Barking dog.

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,850
Your words can't save you.

72
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,750
You rotten filth. Bastard.

73
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,070
- Keep barking.
- Wait till I get out.

74
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,430
Sangthong.
Maiphlong.

75
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,870
I'm going to die.

76
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,970
Phi Thongbai.

77
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,890
Phi Sangthong will come to save you.
I promise.

Kratai.

92
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,500
Do you have

93
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,920
some kind of magic

94
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,010
to make me invisible or something?

95
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,970
Seriously, did you ever see me

96
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,570
do anything like that?

97
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,520
Tch.

98
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,830
Seriously,

99
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,680
why do I keep you around?

100
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,990
Can't help me none.

101
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,010
I always warn you
of things to come,

102
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,690
but you don't heed my warnings.

103
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,770
Tch.

104
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,250
- The coast is clear. I must go.
- Hold on.

105
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,030
If you go in now,
you'll get stabbed for sure.

106
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,380
Men aren't allowed in there.

107
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,300
Tell you what.

108
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,420
Hide in that cart over there.

109
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,540
Good thinking.

110
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,260
The sweets I gave you
weren't wasted after all.

111
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,870
Good luck, Phi Sangthong.

112
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,060
"See you later"
See ya.

113
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,830
Hmm?

114
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,760
What's it doing there?

115
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,010
It must've slid out.

116
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,350
Dangers can't touch me
because I'm always a do-gooder.

117
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,670
Hmph.

118
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,720
Stop the cart.

119
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,050
Uh-oh.

120
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,500
Now, I know the truth, Sangthong.

121
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,360
Thongbai...I'll save you.

122
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,100
What do you have in the back?

123
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,770
Rice, as usual.

124
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,060
What's the tarp for?

125
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,990
Smuggling opium?

126
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,700
No way. I wouldn't risk my life.

127
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,090
- I'll have to inspect it.
- Of course.

128
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,010
This is a disaster.

129
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,650
Hmph.

130
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,570
Pretty close.

131
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,510
Got lucky.

132
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,390
Still lucky.

133
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,650
Go away. That almost got my nose.

134
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,130
Anyway, I'll check the top as well.

135
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,700
Oh, heavens, help me.

136
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,180
Hey...Oof.

137
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,700
Phi Khiew.

138
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,320
Oh, Nong Champi.

139
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,500
Hoo.

140
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,230
Inspecting the cart?
You're so diligent.

141
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,270
It's only my duty, beautiful.

142
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,710
By the way, why are you out so late?

143
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,850
Watch out for the vermin.

144
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,070
Champi?

145
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,130
Is that her?

146
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,640
Well, uhm.

147
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,810
I just came to check on
the supplies

148
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,510
for tomorrow's menu.

149
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,000
Maybe I'll make
some chili paste for you.

150
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,640
Sure thing, Champi.

151
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,030
Heh.

152
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,470
What are in those other carts?

153
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,830
Lady Nuanlaor.

154
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,640
May we have a look?

155
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,130
Of course, Nong Champi.

156
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,640
Lady Nuanlaor.

157
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,600
Hold on. Hold, please.

158
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,080
Lady Nuanlaor.

159
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,980
Please hear me out. I mean no harm.

160
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,170
I just want your help with Thongbai.

161
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,880
He's in prison now.

162
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,870
He'll be executed tomorrow.

163
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,080
But I know
he didn't kill Khun Phra.

164
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,410
I know who did it.

165
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,250
Huh?

166
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,680
You know, really?

167
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,640
Lady Jolie killed him.

168
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,180
We found the gun
that she shot him with.

169
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,880
Would you help us save Thongbai?

170
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:34,770
You see?

171
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,990
My words as a slave mean nothing,

172
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,580
but yours as a noble
and Khun Phra's wife...

173
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,610
will carry weight with the police.

174
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,410
Please save Thongbai.
He's innocent.

175
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,760
Please.

176
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,020
I implore you, Lady Nuanlaor.

177
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,230
Please save Thongbai.

178
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,830
He didn't kill anybody.

179
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,400
Sangthong?

180
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,960
Why are you bothering Lady Nuanlaor?

181
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,460
Go away this instant.

182
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,510
I was pleading with her
to save Thongbai.

183
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,400
Don't bother my master.

184
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,250
If you don't leave now,
I'll call for help.

185
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,430
- Champi.
- Help...

186
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,620
Help. A slave deceives my mistress.

187
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,960
- Help.
- Champi? Do you need help?

188
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,150
You're heartless.

189
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,360
Oh, uhm.

190
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,340
False alarm, Phi Khiew.

191
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,500
Miss Nuanlaor. Excuse me.

192
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,220
Champi.

193
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,690
Thongbai is going to be executed.

194
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,980
You can't save him, my lady.

195
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,430
It's breaking dawn.

196
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,660
We have our priorities.

197
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,630
Maiphlong, what's taking you
so long?

198
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,040
I know the truth now.

199
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,650
Sangthong.

200
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,770
You're back alone?
Did you not find Lady Jolie?

201
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,980
I did, but...

202
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,920
She must've killed
Lady Rampueng, right?

203
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,890
- No, but...
- With her gone...

204
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,180
Who's going to save Thongbai?

205
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Come on.

206
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,030
Stop guessing.

207
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,600
And listen, will ya?

208
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,450
I was talking,
but you kept interrupting.

209
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,540
Okay...I'll listen.

210
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,820
- Shut up and listen, okay?
- Uh-huh.

211
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,400
Here's what happened.

212
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
- Where're you going?
- Oh?

213
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,870
You killed Khun Phra.

214
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,710
Now, you're kidnapping
Lady Nuanlaor's sister.

215
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,400
- Hey, hey. Wait.
- Oh, no.

216
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,930
Are you pregnant, Lady Rampueng?

217
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,100
Short and sweet version.

218
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,570
I'm carrying Khun Phra's child.

219
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,300
She is pregnant with
Khun Phra's child.

220
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,740
So, the person with a strong
motive to kill Khun Phra

221
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,800
could be Lady Rampueng,
not Lady Jolie.

222
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,310
Oh, my goodness.

223
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,080
Why is this story...

224
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,330
so full of twists?

225
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,730
That's the same expression I made
when she told me,

226
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,710
but, in the end, she got me
totally flipped.

227
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,320
More twist?

228
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,810
Wait.

229
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,160
If she killed Khun Phra,
why was the gun with Lady Jolie?

230
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,110
That's the key to this whole mess.

231
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,440
The gun ended up with Ma'am

232
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,380
because of Lady Rampueng.

233
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,330
After Khun Phra was shot,
a commotion erupted, right?

234
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,190
Mm-hmm.

235
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,970
Thongbai.

236
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,300
Those three slaves broke
from detention and killed him.

237
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,460
- Oh, my.
- Hey.

238
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,290
This is not my gun.

239
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,870
I didn't do it.
You must believe me.

240
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,360
Believe me, I didn't.

241
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,500
Execute him.

242
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,130
Oh, no. No, no.

243
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,180
Thongbai.

244
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,330
What about these two?

245
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,390
Run. Fast.

246
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,390
Hey. Halt.

247
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,280
Lady Rampueng decided
to pick up the gun

248
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,780
when Thongbai caught
everyone's attention.

249
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,500
There she goes.

250
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,910
Did you catch them?

251
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,160
They ran faster than The Flash.
Who could catch them?

252
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,940
Then I'll take my leave.
I won't disturb the police.

253
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,650
Wait, nobody leaves.

254
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,260
All day, I've been with the dead.
What now?

255
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,590
Since the gun is missing,
we must search everyone here.

256
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,540
I say we start with you, Khun.

257
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,470
I am a Khun.

258
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,830
You're just a Muen.

259
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,500
Lower rank than me.

260
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,030
What authority do you have
to frisk me?

261
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,370
No one is immune to wrongdoing.

262
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,470
If you are deemed suspicious,
you must cooperate.

263
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,800
Don't think I'm unaware

264
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,350
that you also had
quarrels with him.

265
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
Shall I speak of them?

266
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,120
Try that after I pry
your mouth open?

267
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,180
And you'll see I'm
no stranger to a fight.

268
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,230
Afraid of being searched,

269
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,750
so she faked fainting.

270
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,190
What's wrong? Phi Rampueng.

271
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,810
Phi Rampueng.

272
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,330
Rampueng.

273
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,040
Pulse is normal. Nothing serious.

274
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,500
She probably fainted from a panic.

275
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,660
Lady Nuanlaor summoned a doctor,

276
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,360
who confirmed
Lady Rampueng was fine.

277
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,150
I have something else to tell you.

278
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,720
What is it?

279
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,900
She's awake.

280
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,310
Phi Rampueng.

281
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,390
How are you feeling?

282
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,000
What happened?

283
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,850
You fainted from a panic.

284
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,720
The doctor said you're fine.

285
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,010
What were you about to say, doctor?

286
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,590
- Well, um...
- Nuanlaor.

287
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,870
Let me speak with him alone.

288
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,720
But Phi Rampueng.

289
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,170
Please do as she asks.

290
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,160
Do you want to talk to me?

291
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,530
Were you going to tell them
about my pregnancy?

292
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,790
Mm-hmm.

293
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,730
I already know.

294
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,700
That's good.

295
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,330
I'll prepare some medicine

296
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,550
to nourish both you
and the baby.

297
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,590
- Hmm?
- It's all right.

298
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,570
That's not necessary.

299
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,560
Thank you, doctor,
but I'd like to rest now.

300
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,610
Alright.

301
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,590
- Please, see yourself out.
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,510
Guess what she planned
to do with that gun.

303
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:46,490
"Viewer Discretion Advised"

304
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,300
Hmph.

305
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,240
Stop that.

306
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,140
"Viewer Discretion Advised"
What are you doing?

307
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,830
Step back.

308
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,970
- Let me do it.
- No way.

309
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,470
You will not do it.

310
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,390
Give it to me.

311
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,830
Hrr. Huh.

312
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,200
I have nothing left.
Why can't you understand?

313
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,750
You still have your child.

314
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,980
If you kill yourself,
you're not just ending your life.

315
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,570
You're ending
your child's life, too.

316
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,050
The child has done nothing wrong.

317
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,580
Don't you want to see their face,

318
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,560
watch them grow,

319
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,190
or hear them call you "Mother"?

320
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,530
You're about to become a mother.

321
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,670
Your child will love and
be loved by you unconditionally.

322
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,950
It's okay.

323
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,590
With love and the name of the Lord,

324
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,490
I will help you.

325
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,280
Then, Ma'am hid the gun from her

326
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,620
to prevent another suicide attempt.

327
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,190
- It's that gun we found.
- Hold on.

328
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,610
I'm processing.

329
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,870
Lady Rampueng is pregnant
with Khun Phra's child.

330
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,170
Right.

331
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,650
But she didn't shoot him.

332
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,160
Affirmative.

333
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,070
After Khun Phra's death,
she wanted to die.

334
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,140
Betcha.

335
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,950
- Lady Jolie saved her just in time.
- Astounding, huh?

336
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,860
Then who shot Khun Phra?

337
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,850
"I don't know."
Dunno.

338
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,610
Hrr...stop playing for a second.

339
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,990
Every lead we follow
hits a dead end.

340
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,650
How will we save Thongbai?

341
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,990
What about Lady Nuanlaor?
Any luck?

342
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,890
Nothing?

343
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,070
She refused to help?

344
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,590
Even if she wanted to,
it's pointless.

345
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,510
Since Lady Jolie is cleared,

346
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,170
Lady Nuanlaor has nothing to stop
Thongbai's execution.

347
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,630
Are we forgetting
anybody, Phi Sangthong?

348
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,010
Who else? Just say it already.

349
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,300
Sangthong.

350
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,590
I don't hear
what you and Kratai talk about.

351
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,710
But keep your cool.

352
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,380
Everyone is frustrated.

353
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,650
We'll figure it out.

354
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,590
The moon is setting.
Not much time left.

355
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,310
Ma'am, let me wait

356
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,280
until the first light
appears on the horizon.

357
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,330
Okay?

358
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,750
This might be the last time

359
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,690
I see my sister's face.

360
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,850
You understand, don't you?

361
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,330
I believe Nuanlaor will
make it in time.

362
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,020
She has to.

363
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,030
Here she comes.

364
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,610
Nuanlaor.

365
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,690
Thank you for all your sacrifice.

366
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,870
Phatcharaburi is a remote town,

367
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,440
but you and your child
can start anew there.

368
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,490
And you won't have to
endure anyone's judgment.

369
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:52,520
Come along with me.
Leave everything behind.

370
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,250
I have some unfinished business.

371
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,850
When it's all over,
I'll come to you.

372
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,510
Promise me.

373
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,130
It's almost dawn.

374
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,510
You should go now
before anyone sees you.

375
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,970
Remember to always
put your child first.

376
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,000
Then take care of yourself.

377
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,370
Understand?

378
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,360
You must take care of yourself.
I'm so worried about you.

379
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,180
You, too.

380
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,920
Miss Nuanlaor.

381
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,950
You go ahead. She'll be fine.

382
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,270
Hey.

383
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,770
Any special request for this meal?

384
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,330
I'll take care of it.

385
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,830
It's your last meal.

386
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,790
Hey.

387
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,060
Eat some.

388
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,870
Can't you hear me?

389
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,350
Hey, are you deaf?

390
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,570
I said eat.

391
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,740
Eat.

392
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,320
Hey, can't you hear me?

393
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,220
Ah. Ugh.

394
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,840
- I didn't kill Khun Phra.
- Let go.

395
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,690
Hands off.

396
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,540
- I didn't kill Khun Phra.
- Hands off.

397
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,640
- I didn't kill Khun Phra.
- Let go.

398
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,370
I didn't kill Khun Phra.

399
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,850
I didn't kill Khun Phra.

400
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,910
"Violence should never be imitated."
- Let go. / - Argh.

401
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,970
You killed Khun Phra,
and you're gonna kill me?

402
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,210
Beat me to death,
and I still won't admit it.

403
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,470
I didn't kill Khun Phra.

404
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,080
"Violence should never be imitated."

405
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,280
Enough.

406
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,630
If he dies here,
it's trouble for us.

407
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,230
Fine, let him starve.

408
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,180
Hrr.

409
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,070
Sangthong, figured anything yet?

410
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,970
I was up all night thinking.

411
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,290
Nothing yet.

412
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,040
- Sangthong.
- Hmm?

413
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,880
I just thought of something.

414
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,250
What is it?

415
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,610
If we can't get them
to release Thongbai,

416
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,490
we take him out.

417
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,090
Like how you just took my dipper.

418
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
What?

419
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,670
Busting a prisoner out
is a serious crime.

420
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,800
Ow. What am I supposed to do?

421
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,840
Hmm?

422
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,130
Sit on my thumb
while watching him be executed?

423
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,860
I can't do that.

424
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,570
He is my friend. I'll do anything...

425
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,740
to save him.

426
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,170
- Going somewhere?
- Gotta do something.

427
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,490
Good. Let's split up.

428
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,600
Two heads are better than one.

429
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,880
Pick a target.

430
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,810
Nice silk.

431
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,550
Watch out, kid.

432
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,270
Sorry, sir.

433
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,580
"Viewer Discretion Advised"

434
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,990
"Viewer Discretion Advised"
Ring. My ring.

435
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,660
Got a ring, got the money.

436
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,330
- Thirsty. One shot of liquor.
- Coming right up.

437
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,000
How much?

438
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,040
Hey?

439
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,130
Beans?

440
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,980
Who did this?

441
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,790
My ring. Where is it?

442
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,450
Wow.

443
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Gold belt.

444
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,510
Ooh.

445
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,040
Yes.

446
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,850
Wow.

447
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,450
Thongbai, you're safe.

448
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,930
With all this stuff, I can save you.

449
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,290
Money talks.

450
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,770
Are you playing? Can I join you?

451
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,830
He was cutting up cake
with Lady Nuanlaor here.

452
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,850
Oh. Mapping out the crime scene.

453
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,810
Looks serious.
I won't bother you then.

454
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,420
Lady Rampueng stood to the side.

455
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,630
Here.

456
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,100
Muen Int was across from him.

457
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,630
Thongphiphop.

458
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,530
Sangthong.

459
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,950
Maiphlong.

460
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,170
Thongbai.

461
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,150
Where's the blind spot?

462
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,990
Oh, no.

463
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,940
Kratai, be careful.

464
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,670
Sorry. I didn't mean to.
Did it hit you?

465
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,230
Lucky I dodged it.

466
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,110
Don't make me yell at you.

467
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,530
Kratai, thanks a bunch.

468
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,070
Really.

469
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,490
Clear this up.

470
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,560
"Thank you."
Thank you.

471
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,500
- Hiya.
- Oh?

472
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,460
Wait, wait.

473
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,490
I'm not here to mess with you.

474
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,180
- Just a talk.
- Thief talk?

475
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,300
No, sir.

476
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,570
Hey, hey, hey. Slow down.

477
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,150
Weapon?

478
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,870
"I love you."
An I-love-you gesture.

479
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,670
Think I'm your friend?

480
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,250
Just teasing ya.

481
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,750
Here, here.

482
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,500
- Everything.
- Hey.

483
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,350
I want you to have these.

484
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,520
Once you take them, you just...

485
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,530
accidentally drop the prison keys

486
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,080
and take a walk somewhere.

487
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,690
So long as it's far from the cells.

488
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,590
Jewelry on the desk
and in my bag...

489
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,290
- yours.
- All?

490
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,610
Of course.

491
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,240
Like them?

492
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,480
Real things.

493
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,190
Hmm...wait.

494
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,010
Did you steal them?

495
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,270
Uh...of course not.

496
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,640
I earned money from trades
and bought these.

497
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,170
- Not stolen?
- No, sir. Positive.

498
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,720
So, is this a bribe

499
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,650
to release a prisoner?

500
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,730
I didn't say that.

501
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,950
- Oh...hmm.
- So, how about that?

502
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,520
Well, you came...

503
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,410
just in time, buddy.

504
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,090
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay, okay.

505
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,380
- Put all these back.
- Yeah.

506
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,350
Don't worry.

507
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,960
If you want more, just say so.

508
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,150
No problem.

509
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,380
Khun.

510
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,830
Khun.

511
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,380
Sir.

512
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,850
Whatchu doing here? Out.

513
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,530
I have to talk to him.
Please let me talk to him.

514
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,400
I need his help.

515
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,390
He has no time for reckless slaves.

516
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,430
And you are aiding a murderer.

517
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,310
- Thongbai is not a murderer.
- Shut up.

518
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,370
Or you want to be thrown out?

519
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,120
Oh, no. No, Phi Jom.
Let go.

520
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,910
There you are, Khun.
I know the truth, sir.

521
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,270
- Sir, Thongbai is not...
- Jom.

522
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,460
Let go of him.

523
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,600
Yes, sir.

524
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,930
Sir.

525
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,170
I can prove Thongbai's innocence.

526
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,710
- Get in.
- Whoa.

527
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,490
Hey.

528
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,980
Bribing an officer
lands you in jail.

529
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,970
Come on. You all do it all the time.

530
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,600
Drop the act.

531
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,910
Hey. Not all the police.

532
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,790
Some are fed up
with the rotten system.

533
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,600
But it starts with you

534
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,390
looking to bend the rules
by bribing officials.

535
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,640
Enough bends and the whole
justice system snaps.

536
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,160
So, who's at fault?

537
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,040
You say I'm the crook.

538
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,130
But you took the jewels
with a smile.

539
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,890
Both you and me, of course.

540
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,050
But today, you are guilty.

541
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,310
Stay in there and cool off.

542
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,180
Hey, you took the bribe.
At least, let me out.

543
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,530
- Where's your evidence?
- What?

544
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,670
- Maiphlong.
- Hey, you're here.

545
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,700
How did you end up here?

546
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,050
My plan failed.

547
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,250
I wanted to bring you out.

548
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,890
Silly me.

549
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,620
Your coming here means
you found Lady Jolie?

550
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,930
Did she confess?

551
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,740
Thongbai. Listen carefully.

552
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,070
She didn't shoot Khun Phra.

553
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,720
Thongbai.

554
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,690
So, this is it.

555
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,890
I will be executed.

556
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,380
Hey, don't give up just yet.

557
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,620
Sangthong is still out there.

558
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,940
He's trying.

559
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,850
Don't give up.

560
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,610
Trust me. He'll save you.

561
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,490
Show me your proof.

562
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,040
Here it is, sir.

563
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,630
I mapped out the crime scene.

564
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,660
Here's where everyone was.

565
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,810
I was here.

566
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,350
Maiphlong.

567
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,840
Muen Int.

568
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,570
Ma'am Jolie.

569
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,640
You.

570
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,240
Miss Rampueng.

571
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,420
Pikun.

572
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,670
Miss Nuanlaor.

573
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,770
Khun Phra lying lifeless here.

574
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,030
Thongbai. He was here.

575
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,580
Sir.

576
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,780
Had he shot Khun Phra,

577
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,150
the bullet would've hit
the cake first.

578
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,480
But you were there.
You knew the cake was intact.

579
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,520
So, the bullet couldn't have been
fired from his direction.

580
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,970
Can you see that, sir?

581
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,770
Thongbai is innocent.

582
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,930
He couldn't have shot Khun Phra.

583
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,810
Will you acquit him, sir?

584
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,770
He's about to be
wrongly executed today.

585
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,990
Will you speak out for him?

586
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,250
This is not proof,

587
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,330
but your recollection.

588
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,450
Not enough to exonerate Thongbai.

589
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,160
Based on what you said,

590
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,810
I could just as easily claim

591
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,300
that he could've shot him
from there

592
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,900
and walked to admire his glory
right here.

593
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
But...

594
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,210
he didn't kill
Khun Phra for sure, sir.

595
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,850
If not him, then who?

596
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,690
My investigation

597
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,420
has failed to build
an airtight case, sir.

598
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,170
So, that's why
Thongbai is the murderer.

599
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,230
Dear Khun, please listen to me.

600
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,280
Throughout my investigation,

601
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,270
I've discovered several suspects
with motives.

602
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,730
Thongphiphop, crippled by Khun Phra.

603
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,410
Muen Int, obstructed
in his duties by Khun Phra.

604
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,040
Miss Rampueng, impregnated
with his child.

605
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,890
Ma'am Jolie, dishonored by him.

606
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,980
And even you, sir.

607
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,280
You were demoted
because of Khun Phra.

608
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,310
Hey!

609
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,270
It's the truth, sir.

610
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,170
And the truth is
Thongbai is innocent.

611
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,830
Khun.

612
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,490
I beg you, sir.

613
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,430
Thongbai is innocent.
He swore to me himself.

614
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,490
I swear.

615
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,330
Don't you swear in front of me.

616
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,370
I did you a favor
by listening to you.

617
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,750
No matter what,
Thongbai is executed today.

618
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,690
Jom.

619
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,250
- Yes, sir.
- Take him away.

620
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,390
Yes, sir.

621
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,720
Sir, please.

622
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,410
Whatever you came up with
is nonsense.

623
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,420
No one would believe
the words of a slave.

624
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:40,330
Sir. Thongbai is truly innocent.
He didn't do it.

625
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,520
- Go.
- Khun.

626
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,660
My friend is innocent.

627
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,720
- Go.
- Khun.

628
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,420
Please help my friend.

629
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,240
I would never harm my friend.

630
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,240
Thongphiphop, wake up.

631
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,790
Son, wake up.

632
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,620
Uh...what's the matter?

633
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,470
Today is the day.

634
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,490
Go watch the man
who killed your father face justice.

635
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,300
Then forgive him,

636
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,130
and ask for forgiveness
for your father, too.

637
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,570
Let it all end.

638
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,630
Forgive him

639
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,970
so your next life won't be bound
by this hatred.

640
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,610
Nothing will go wrong.

641
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,150
Your murderer

642
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,450
will face execution.

643
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,450
Justice will be served.

644
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,760
Don them neatly,

645
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,920
and in order.

646
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,460
How about it, you two?

647
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:16,310
Do I look the part
for today's promotion?

648
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,700
No matter how you stand, sir,
just impeccable.

649
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,480
You've captured the criminal
in a high-profile case

650
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,490
that has gripped
everyone's attention.

651
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,650
You'll surely be praised
and promoted, sir.

652
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,630
Heh. Very well.

653
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,950
After the execution,

654
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,640
you two will address me as

655
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,510
Khun Int.

656
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,020
Our Father,

657
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,840
who art in heaven,

658
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,360
hallowed be Thy name.

659
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,160
Deliver us from evil.

660
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,110
And if Thongbai is truly innocent,

661
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,460
let the truth be revealed.

662
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,720
Amen.

663
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,160
Thongbai.

664
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,550
Thongbai.

665
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,350
Hey, Thongbai.

666
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,470
Thongbai.

667
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,610
Eat this. You need your strength.

668
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,450
I snatched this from the guards.

669
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,020
Eat.

670
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,280
No, thanks.

671
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,630
Ow.

672
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,670
You'll die if you don't eat.

673
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,070
Eat, eat.

674
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,940
I'm going to die anyway.

675
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,190
People eat

676
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,400
to survive.

677
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,930
But I'm about to die.

678
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,750
I don't see the point.

679
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,010
You eat it.

680
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,810
Thongbai, you have to eat.

681
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,770
Don't give up yet.
There has to be a way out.

682
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,470
I'm sure help is coming.

683
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,710
Eat.

684
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,770
Eat.

685
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,080
There is no way out.

686
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,890
No one's coming to save me.

687
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,370
Everyone must strive

688
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,310
for their own justice.

689
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,790
I am but a slave.

690
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,630
My words carry no weight
for anyone to hear.

691
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,000
Born a slave,

692
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,080
destined to die a slave.

693
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,240
I get that.

694
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,440
Guilty or not, it doesn't matter.

695
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,690
They treat us the same.

696
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,750
The harder we struggle,
the harder they stomp us.

697
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,370
Only power rewrites the rules,
wrong to right,

698
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,180
and no one dares to object.

699
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,930
Because we're just slaves,

700
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:51,100
we don't get the chance
to prove our innocence like they do.

701
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,410
Thanks, buddy.

702
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,600
All my life, I'm grateful

703
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,570
to have you and Sangthong
as friends.

704
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:49,510
Lady Nuanlaor.

705
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,950
Would you like breakfast?

706
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,810
No.

707
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,740
I'm not hungry.

708
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,100
If you don't eat anything,

709
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,400
you'll be weak.

710
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,370
Help me get dressed today, Champi.

711
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,380
Make me look beautiful.

712
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,880
Are you going out?

713
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,760
Mm-hmm.

714
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,460
May I ask where?

715
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,190
Where I should be.

716
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,980
There has to be a way.

717
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,480
We'll get out of this. Trust me.

718
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,810
Where there's a will,

719
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,090
Thongbai,

720
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,710
there's a way.

721
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,680
Okay?

722
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,200
We'll get out and have a big meal.

723
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,140
Hey.

724
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,490
Whatchu doing?

725
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,210
- Hey.
- Come on.

726
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,090
Let him go.

727
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,290
Whatchu doing?

728
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,440
Stay out of this.

729
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:46,490
Thongbai...Thongbai.

730
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,490
- Back off.
- You back off.

731
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,610
Where are you taking him?

732
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:53,860
Thongbai.

733
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,630
Thongbai.

734
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,780
It's not the time.
Where're you taking him?

735
00:45:58,830 --> 00:45:59,830
Stop yelling.

736
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:05,380
Soon, you'll be out to witness
your friend's execution.

737
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,180
Don't worry, I'll let you out.

738
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,560
You can't execute him.
He did nothing wrong.

739
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,490
Your friend is as good as dead.

740
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,650
If you're letting me out,
where's my bag?

741
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,450
And all my belongings?

742
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,990
That's evidence of bribery.

743
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,970
All confiscated. Forget about it.

744
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,340
The truth is, you pocket it
and still preach virtue.

745
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,590
- Pfft. Police scum.
- Ugh.

746
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,270
Hey, you.

747
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:37,390
Ugh.

748
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,630
Aye...you deserve this.

749
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,770
Whatchu staring at?

750
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,760
Nothing.

751
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:48,970
Uh.

752
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:53,210
If you're letting me out,
could you remove these chains?

753
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,720
Oh, yeah.

754
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,490
Sorry about that.

755
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,450
Oh, nothing.

756
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,270
- Stiff.
- Oh, stiff. Okay, okay.

757
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,210
- Huh?
- Nothing.

758
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,080
- Despicable slave.
- You deserve to die.

759
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,200
Scum. You deserve this.

760
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,030
You monster.

761
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:20,310
- Do it.
- Execute him.

762
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:21,930
Execute him.

763
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,190
Vile scum.

764
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,710
Only death.

765
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,200
Curse this slave.

766
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,530
Better off dead.

767
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,530
He deserves to die.

768
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,570
Behead the murderer.

769
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,600
Listen up.

770
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,440
Settle down, folks.

771
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,090
That's enough. Step back.

772
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,190
The end is near.

773
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,780
Poor slave about to die.

774
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:04,340
Meanwhile, I'll soon be
promoted to Khun.

775
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:06,280
I almost feel sorry for him.

776
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,690
I forgive you, Khun Phra.

777
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,560
- Thongbai. Thongbai.
- Thongbai.

778
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:52,450
- We're here.
- Thongbai.

779
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,850
- I'm here.
- I'm here.

780
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,090
You're gonna be all right.

781
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,140
After two practice swings,

782
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:17,820
the third one will be real.

783
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,550
Stop the execution.

784
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:33,230
Lady Nuanlaor, you're supposed
to be in the palace.

785
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:36,990
Step back.

786
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,120
Don't interfere,
or you will be punished.

787
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,450
Punished, I will be, anyhow.

788
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,530
Because I'm the one
who killed Khun Phra.

789
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,660
- What?
- Huh?

790
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:50,870
- Huh?

791
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,430
Mom.

792
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,740
What's going on?

793
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:00,900
Who knows?

794
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:25,770
Khun Phra Bamroekrung
came to express the desire

795
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,860
to take your hand in marriage.

796
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,800
Best we're strangers.

797
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,580
Playing hard to get?

798
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:37,060
One day, she'll be at my feet.

799
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,430
May my exalted wife enter.

800
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:40,850
But first,

801
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,860
prostrate yourself at my feet.

802
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,070
- Let me have one.
- No. Step off.

803
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,560
I am not yet married to you.

804
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,910
You do not lay your hands on me.

805
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,780
I don't want you
to suffer, Nuanlaor.

806
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,930
It'll all be over soon.

807
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,130
Oh, dear.
