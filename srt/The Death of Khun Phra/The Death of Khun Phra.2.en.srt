This show is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to actual persons,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,480
living or dead, or real events
is purely coincidental and

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,900
not intended to offend any person,
profession, or organization.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,480
They take advantage of you.
Why let them?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,375
"Treat"
They treat you badly.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,295
You have the skill sets

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,835
to stand up and be on your own.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,160
We're just slaves.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,760
One little mistake, one wrong move,

10
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,160
and they order beatings
like we're cattle.

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,920
Aren't we all equals?

12
00:00:27,604 --> 00:00:29,606
Where is the justice?

13
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:31,880
You all shouldn't go to the wedding.

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,970
I have a bad feeling.
Something terrible will happen.

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,120
Khun Phra (Nobility title)
has been shot.

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,520
Who dared shoot Khun Phra?

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,010
Huh.

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,426
I told them not to come.

19
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:58,680
It's all downhill from here.

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,960
Thongbai.

21
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,880
Those three slaves broke
from detention and killed him.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
- Oh, my.
- Hey.

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,640
Hold on? He has a gun.
Are you nuts?

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,108
Then just let me die.

25
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:20,175
No more orders and whipping.
There'll be no more pain.

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I've served his boys faithfully.
Suffering is what I earn.

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,920
Where is the justice?

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,800
Thongbai.

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,880
Did you really kill him?

30
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,775
No, I did not.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,165
This is not a real gun.
It is my invention.

32
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,400
It's not a real gun.

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,840
Really, it's not a real gun.

34
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,560
It's not a real gun.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,015
I know now. I know.

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,280
Stop. Stop.

37
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,100
If you don't believe me,
I shall demonstrate.

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,120

39
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,490

and surely reward me for this.

I didn't do it.
You must believe me.

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
I didn't do it.
Believe me, I didn't.

44
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,691

Don't stand there like a dolt.

"Mystery of the Deadly Sins"

65
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:20,735
Hey, why did you follow me?

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,535
We all could get caught.

67
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,360
Yeah. Why did we run?
We didn't pull the trigger.

68
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:28,940
We broke out of detention.

69
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:30,480
They think we're all in it anyway.

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
True.

71
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,095
Thongbai, you didn't
shoot him, did you?

72
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,531
Seriously, do not lie.

73
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,015
Come on, how could
someone like me kill anyone?

74
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,562
Is that the truth?

75
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,640
Ever since you two knew me,

76
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:56,218
you think I had it in me?

77
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,757
I believe you.

78
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,065
Then, for now,...we split up.

79
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,405
Maiphlong and I will be
decoys to confuse the police.

80
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,110
We'll then find a way
to prove your innocence.

81
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:25,613
Thanks for believing in me.

82
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:28,278
And you...do not get caught.

83
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,307
Hoi and Hon, those slaves
are over there.

84
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,729
- What now?
- Rud and Rid.

85
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:36,360
I go this way. You that way. Go.

86
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,480
Rud and Rid.

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,960
What about me?

88
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,631
There they are.

89
00:05:41,656 --> 00:05:42,717
Halt.

90
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,660
Halt.

91
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,475
They're gone.

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,905
Whom should we follow?

93
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,720
Oh, for heaven's sake.
All three of them.

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,440
Catch the shooter.
Or his friends if you can't. Go.

95
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

96
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:01,420
Alright. You, come with me.

97
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,420
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:03,680
Carry on.

99
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:05,180
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

100
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:06,897
Run!

101
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,520
- Hey, go.
- Yes, sir.

102
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,160
Now, I can hear the birds.

103
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,010
Rud.

104
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,560
I told you to run off,
not run along.

105
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,880
I did not know which way.
I've been running aimlessly.

106
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,000
Just go anywhere I'm not going.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,120
Which one then?

108
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,240
Jeez.

109
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,010
- Are they over there?
- Hey.

110
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,960
Get in. Quick.

111
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,320
In there. Just get in.

112
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,767
- I thought I saw someone.
- It's just you and me.

113
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:06,845
I saw someone's back.

114
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:09,585
- So?
- Well, go that way.

115
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,610
Alright.

116
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:12,480
Achoo.

117
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,767
Sangthong.

118
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,400
You know I cannot handle dust.
It's so dusty here.

119
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,000
You two.

120
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:35,236
Nowhere to hide.

121
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:48,485
Let's see my magic bag.

122
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:52,821
Huh...what is this thing for?

123
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,920
Hey, the invisibility cloak.

124
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,800
It's not functional yet.

125
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:01,800
What is this?

126
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,000
Maiphlong stuffed trash in my bag.

127
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,768
So many things in here.
Like Doraemon's bag.

128
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,320
This is it.

129
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,970
Where did your murderer friend go?

130
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:27,345
- Not telling ya.
- Don't know.

131
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,120
So you don't know
or you won't tell?

132
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,449
- Don't know.
- Not telling ya.

133
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,975
Hey, come on.

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,960
Don't tell them.

135
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,375
I don't know.

136
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,240
Not cooperating with the officers.

137
00:08:38,377 --> 00:08:39,965
You want that on you?

138
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,625
We did nothing wrong.

139
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,340
What charges can you put on us?

140
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,325
Aiding a fugitive is a crime.

141
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,240
No matter what we say,
you will find us guilty.

142
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,040
Mm-hmm.

143
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,440
- Power abusers.
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,993
- Ain't afraid of you.
- Mm-hmm.

145
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,595
Why provoking them?

146
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,267
I may be stupid
but I am not smart.

147
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,040
That's...

148
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,615
"Independent"
So indie.

149
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,259
Eat clay flasks, would you?

150
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,920
Ha ha, I've dodged bullets before.

151
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,835
A little flask is child's play.

152
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,579
Haha.

153
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,160
- Hey.
- Stop it.

154
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,925
Hey.

155
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,680
Hey.

156
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,745
You wanna help? Why watching?

157
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,040
Hey, they're coming.

158
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,000
My fingers are stuck
from the glue.

159
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,680
Come on.

160
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,128
Hey, surrender yourself.

161
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:04,251
Running just adds to your rap sheet.

162
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:09,120
Surrender, I won't,
for I did not shoot him.

163
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,105
Four-eyed slave, stop your lies.

164
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,160
Who would believe a slave like you?

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,680
Just because I'm a slave,
you don't care what I say?

166
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,600
Get him.

167
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,240
- Go.
- Hey.

168
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,920
Muahaha.

169
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,400
Rud, help me out.

170
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
- I don't know, Rid.
- Help.

171
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,667
- Hurry.
- He said to get him.

172
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,280
Hey.

173
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,480
- Oh, no.
- Hey.

174
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,440
Muen Int, help us, please.

175
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,400
Amazed at my cutting-edge invention?

176
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:38,200
Sticky glue sends chills
right through.

177
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,600
Gotcha. You fools.

178
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:42,845
Catch me if you can. Little Int.

179
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,267
Think you're so brave, Muen Int?

180
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:46,960
Whatcha waiting for?
Afraid of getting stuck?

181
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,015
Did you call me Little Int?

182
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
You.

183
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:54,760
Come on.

184
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,715
A four-eyed slave
can never outrun me.

185
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,640
This guy's really obsessed.
I'm out of here.

186
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:08,555
Hey, stop.

187
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,640
Ow, he didn't bother
checking on us.

188
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,720
Hey. Hey.

189
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Whoa.

190
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,470
Hey, take it easy.

191
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,320
Why so many flasks?

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,475
- Oh, no. We're all out.
- All out.

193
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,560
Now, we fight back. Come on.

194
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,580
Go.

195
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,880
Ow. Ow. Ow.

196
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:39,054
Maiphlong, are you alright?

197
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,734
That was nothing. Piece of cake.

198
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:52,832
Is he drunk?

199
00:11:52,857 --> 00:11:54,765
Come and get it.

200
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,400
Come on.

201
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,240
There's an opening. Let's go.

202
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,210
Come and get it.

203
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,520
- You go first, Rid.
- You get them.

204
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,080
- Come and g...
- Go through.

205
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
- Hey.
- Oh, no.

206
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,460
Ow.

207
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,280
What now?

208
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,360
- Let's go.
- Okay.

209
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Hey.

210
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:17,080
You can't outrun me four-eyes.

211
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,800
- Hey. Argh.
- Gotcha.

212
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,800
Now. I got you.

213
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,360
What? Wanna fight?

214
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,080
Taste my sparrow punch.

215
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
Come on.

216
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,260
You dodged that.

217
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,160
Whew.

218
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,920
Okay.

219
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,000
What?

220
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,980
Ouch.

221
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:36,673
I've got tricks up my sleeve.

222
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,079
The awesome ostrich punch.

223
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:44,640
Four-eyes.

224
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,819
Hmm?

225
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,730
Darn it. The glue got my lip.

226
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,880
See ya.

227
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
Four-eyes.

228
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,160
- Follow me.
- I'mma kick their...

229
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,960
Yeah. This way, tough guy.

230
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,920
Come on, chickens.

231
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,080
This way.

232
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,840
You...hey...
Why's Maiphlong so drunk?

233
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,363
What happened to your hand?

234
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:04,945
I'll tell you later.

235
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,240
Ooh.

236
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,840
My mouth.

237
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,360
My mouth.

238
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,160
Come here.

239
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,720
- Maiphlong, let go.
- You first.

240
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:15,574
Hey, don't let them escape.

241
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:16,500
What...

242
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,000
What did you say?

243
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,800
Ow, ow.

244
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,603
I found the way out.

245
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,240
Where did they go?

246
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:31,087
Hoy, did you see them?

247
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:32,506
They were here.

248
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,978
Hey, I heard splashing.

249
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:38,415
I believe they're in the water.

250
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,480
For sure.

251
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,760
I think they're...right there.

252
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:45,015
I'm going there
by the woods edge.

253
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,120
- Stay if you want.
- After you.

254
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,931
Huh, that got me sober.

255
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,704
My hands are unglued now.

256
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,196
- What was wrong with it?
- I'll tell you later.

257
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,134
Sangthong, I commend
your brilliance.

258
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,576
Did you catch them?

259
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:29,650
They ran faster than The Flash.
Who could catch them?

260
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:33,745
Alright. You search the place.
Collect all evidence.

261
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,770
- Yes.
- Yes.

262
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,279
That ungrateful Thongbai.

263
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:41,269
Khun Phra provided him
food and shelter

264
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:42,950
yet he repaid him with death.

265
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:49,525
It's a pity
Khun Phra died like this.

266
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:54,105
Champi, say no more.
Take the children away from here.

267
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,060
Quickly.

268
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,520
- Yes, ma'am.
- Don't cry.

269
00:14:57,136 --> 00:14:58,080
We should go.

270
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:01,040
I'll stay and keep
Nuanlaor company.

271
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:02,780
Yes, Miss.

272
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,120
Follow Champi and I, please.

273
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:25,135
Then I'll take my leave.
I won't disturb the police.

274
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,320
Wait, nobody leaves.

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,885
All day, I've been with the dead.
What now?

276
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,990
Since the gun is missing,
we must search everyone here.

277
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,120
I say we start with you,
Khun (Nobility title).

278
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,240
I am a Khun.

279
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,215
You're just a Muen.

280
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,370
Lower rank than me.

281
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,255
What authority do you have
to frisk me?

282
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,961
You can't intimidate me
with rank and power.

283
00:15:56,986 --> 00:15:59,455
No one is immune to wrongdoing.

284
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,478
If you are deemed suspicious,
you must cooperate.

285
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,620
Ah.

286
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,980
Or perhaps you conspired
with Thongbai to kill Khun Phra.

287
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,564
The one conspiring is
more likely you.

288
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,285
Think about it.

289
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,548
It's suspicious.

290
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,260
You had many police officers
chasing a few criminals

291
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,345
who conveniently escaped.

292
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,298
What else if you're not
in cahoots with them?

293
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,143
This slave.

294
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:31,480
He's your man, isn't he?

295
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,100
Watch your mouth, Khun.

296
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,915
Insulting police is
a serious offense.

297
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,775
Isn't murder a more serious charge?

298
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,360
You resented Khun Phra
as much as anyone.

299
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,814
If conspiring with his murderer,

300
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,939
you'll die like Khun Phra.

301
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,795
Well,

302
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:56,495
Aren't you perceptive?

303
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,622
Don't think I'm unaware

304
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:03,731
that you also had
quarrels with him.

305
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,760
Shall I speak of them?

306
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,200
Try that after I pry
your mouth open?

307
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,819
And you'll see I'm
no stranger to a fight.

308
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:12,780
Bring it.

309
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,075
Oh, Phi (Endearment title) Rampueng.

310
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,615
Rampueng.

311
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,920
She fainted. Get a doctor quick.

312
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,255
Rampueng.

313
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,720
It could be the heat.

314
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,370
Oh, hey.

315
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,935
I say we let him go for now,

316
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,160
as our evidence is insufficient.

317
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:39,840
I'll find a chance to
extract the truth from him.

318
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,670
Yes, sir.

319
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:51,376
Pulse is normal. Nothing serious.

320
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,837
She probably fainted from a panic.

321
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,696
What a relief.

322
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:03,621
I have something else to tell you.

323
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:04,946
What is it?

324
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:10,579
She is awake.

325
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:14,954
Phi Rampueng.

326
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:17,388
How are you feeling?

327
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:18,946
What happened?

328
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,649
You fainted from a panic.

329
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:24,404
The doctor said you're fine.

330
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:28,535
What were you about to say, doctor?

331
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,040
- Well, um...
- Nuanlaor.

332
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:35,767
Let me speak with him alone.

333
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:38,885
But Phi Rampueng.

334
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,001
Please do as she asks.

335
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,583
A rest would do good. I'm exhausted.

336
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Sangthong.

337
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:28,135
Give him a good smack, would you?

338
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,255
What?

339
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,120
Wait, why beating me?

340
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,240
Why not? What were you thinking?

341
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,655
Why bring a gun to the ceremony.
Guns aren't toys.

342
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,240
You made it look real, too.

343
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:44,695
A wedding gift for Khun Phra.

344
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,634
Look what trouble you got us in now.

345
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,681
I apologize to both of you

346
00:19:56,972 --> 00:20:00,100
for getting you into
this mess with me.

347
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,447
I never intended for this to happen.

348
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,330
Hmm.

349
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:11,028
How did your fake gun
turn into a real one anyway?

350
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,712
When darkness fell,

351
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,036
A ruckus erupted from villagers,
firecrackers, and guns.

352
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:25,095
That's when I...

353
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,915
sneaked up to Khun Phra's quarters.

354
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,485
Someone was there

355
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,685
and bumped into me.

356
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,404
My fake gun slipped from my hand.

357
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,716
I groped around for it.

358
00:20:35,995 --> 00:20:38,775
When I found it, I picked it up.

359
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,505
I didn't realize
that it wasn't my gun.

360
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,975
When I pulled the trigger,
it was too late.

361
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,160
I think...somebody switched my gun.

362
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,840
What rotten luck.

363
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
Who would believe such a tale?

364
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:56,480
That's true?

365
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,059
When Muen Int came after me,

366
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,730
I told him the same thing,
but he wouldn't believe me.

367
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,640
But I believe you.

368
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,017
I believe you wouldn't
commit a murder.

369
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,575
He believes you. And I do, too.

370
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,880
We believe you.

371
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,079
But nobody else does.

372
00:21:21,683 --> 00:21:24,261
I think Muen Int didn't believe him,

373
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:27,394
not because it sounded made-up,

374
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,091
but because it came
from his mouth.

375
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:31,116
True.

376
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:34,246
Because I'm just a slave.

377
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:37,142
Low-life slave.

378
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:42,556
What I say carries no bearing

379
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:45,924
for those of higher status to heed.

380
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,110
If I rose to power over them,

381
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:53,751
they'd believe every word
I say, even lies.

382
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,080
In the end,...

383
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,820
only slaves bleed for
the sake of other slaves.

384
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,180
What now?

385
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,350
I'm not sure.

386
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,640
But we should rest for the night.

387
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:27,495
We need a hideout.

388
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,564
I know of an abandoned temple
not far from here.

389
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,800
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

390
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,935
You know the way, Maiphlong?

391
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
No.

392
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,615
- That way.
- Oh.

393
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,314
Why did you lead? Come.

394
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:59,314
This is it. The abandoned temple.

395
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,680
Come quickly.

396
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,495
Why is it so eerie?

397
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,240
Well, this will do.
No one will find us here.

398
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,280
We should pay our respects.

399
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Yeah.

400
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,806
We ask to spend the night.

401
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:55,892
Please protect us.

402
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:01,298
We are truly innocent.

403
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:06,634
You must believe us.

404
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:13,103
I think the Buddha
has acknowledged us.

405
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:16,478
Look how he's smiling at us.

406
00:24:20,851 --> 00:24:22,880
Araham samma sambuddho bhagava.

407
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,255
Buddhang bhagavantang abhivademi.

408
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Bow. Bow.

409
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,640
Svakkhato bhagavata dhammo

410
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,760
dhammang namassami

411
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,500
Suppatipanno bhagavato savakasangho

412
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,640
sanghang namami

413
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:44,400
Sadhu, please help our poor souls.

414
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,280
Thongbai, it's alright.

415
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,640
- We're safe tonight
- Yes.

416
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,520
I found it.

417
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,255
We won't be cold tonight.
These are surely warm.

418
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,360
Thank you so much.

419
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
- Hmm?
- What?

420
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,010
Whatcha doing?

421
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,250
Let me take this.

422
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,335
Hey, wait, I...

423
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,840
Whoa.

424
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Here.

425
00:25:40,882 --> 00:25:41,880
Have some bananas.

426
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:45,520
You want bananas, so you
kicked down the whole tree.

427
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:49,182
- Yeah.
- Why not pull just the bunch?

428
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:52,120
Oh? People do this, don't they?

429
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,065
Well, that's so typical of you.

430
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,090
Just eat.

431
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:04,120
Since Thongbai insisted

432
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,502
he didn't do it,

433
00:26:05,527 --> 00:26:07,655
there must be a real culprit.

434
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,743
We just need to find that person

435
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,758
so we won't have to keep running.

436
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:14,800
How are we going to do that?

437
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
Good question.

438
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:24,745
Hey, aren't you eating bananas?

439
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,239
I'm sorry, you two.

440
00:26:34,742 --> 00:26:37,237
You shouldn't have run away with me.

441
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,275
I've made you fugitives like me.

442
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,829
Three of us have always been
solid since whenever.

443
00:26:43,461 --> 00:26:45,335
We shared laughter.

444
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,515
How could we leave you in disaster?

445
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,680
Right?

446
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:52,626
Seelfit?

447
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:55,142
Selphis?

448
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:57,297
Shellfish?

449
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:58,955
What do you mean?

450
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,925
He's saying he can't
spell "selfish."

451
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,950
You silly thing.

452
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,353
I was explaining to him.
You always stole my thunder.

453
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,239
You won't eat? I won't eat either.

454
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,320
Ow, Maiphlong, spit it out.

455
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,040
I won't.

456
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,035
Spit it out.

457
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,150
Wait, wait.

458
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,035
Okay. Okay.

459
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,060
I get it. I'll eat.

460
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,140
- Take mine.
- Okay.

461
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:35,570
Between the three of us
and these bananas,

462
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,224
let's toast with them.

463
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:38,120
Come.

464
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,400
Hurry.

465
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,735
Okay.

466
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,920
Cheers, my friends.

467
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,625
Can't sleep, Phi Sangthong?

468
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,495
Don't creep me out like that.

469
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,785
How did you get in here?

470
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,020
Aren't you afraid of the Buddha?

471
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:44,200
Why should I?
The Buddha looks so kind.

472
00:28:45,341 --> 00:28:47,101
See? He's smiling at us.

473
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:53,115
I'm a good ghost.
You don't mind, right?

474
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,140
Heh.

475
00:28:55,044 --> 00:28:57,215
What are you thinking about?

476
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,040
About how to help Thongbai.

477
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:04,215
Oh, yeah. Did you see
who killed Khun Phra?

478
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,945
How would I?

479
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,125
What kind of ghost are you,
not knowing anything?

480
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,840
I'm a ghost, not Detective Conan.

481
00:29:15,606 --> 00:29:19,135
I only see what you all see
and know what you all know.

482
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,360
Hmm.

483
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,023
How can we help Thongbai?

484
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,689
Phi Sangthong, you served
Khun Phra closely.

485
00:29:33,714 --> 00:29:36,966
You were his entourage everywhere.

486
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:39,975
You should know
more about him than I do.

487
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,135
Think carefully.
Who would wish him harm?

488
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,995
Come look. This man is a murderer.

489
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,255
"Suwanthani Market"

490
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,120
He's so evil. He killed Khun Phra.

491
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,415
Yes, he's wicked.

492
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,560
Report to authorities
if you see him.

493
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,240
Yeah.

494
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,320
- Killed his master.
- He's so heartless.

495
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,360
Yes, he must be executed.

496
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,600
Death for death.

497
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,670
"Wanted: Murderer. Report if found."
Evil must be stopped.

498
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,690
Right.

499
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
Wake up. Time to wake up.

500
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,600
Yes, okay.

501
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,215
I'm up. I'm up.

502
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,600
Let me get my glasses.

503
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,185
Wake up, Maiphlong.

504
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,805
Is Khun Phra calling?

505
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,280
You all go first.
I need more sleep.

506
00:30:33,404 --> 00:30:35,655
Why did you push me?

507
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,160
Open your eyes and look around.

508
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:41,407
Khun Phra is not with us anymore.

509
00:30:42,838 --> 00:30:45,945
Oh, right. He is dead now.

510
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,440
And we're on the run.

511
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,295
Wake up to the truth.

512
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
Hey.

513
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,935
I know how to find the culprit.

514
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,040
How?

515
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,100
Ahem.

516
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,555
As I was Khun Phra's trusted slave

517
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,635
and followed him everywhere,

518
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,640
I thought about how to round up

519
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,200
some suspicious people
who might be the culprit.

520
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Who?

521
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,480
First, we need to return to
Khun Phra's estate.

522
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,100
See...he's teasing us.

523
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:24,900
Hmm.

524
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,155
Why go back?

525
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,685
Yeah, why go back?
We could get caught.

526
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,765
We'll sneak around,
not making an entrance.

527
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,855
You, too. We'll be like spies.

528
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,135
Oh, right.

529
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,160
We'll reclaim your innocence.

530
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:45,711
They might be holding his funeral
at the estate today.

531
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,600
And by my calculation,
the suspect will not show up.

532
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,280
Oh.

533
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,405
And if that person doesn't show up,

534
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,680
that person must be the culprit.

535
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,680
That's enough.

536
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:06,776
Enough.

537
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:11,085
Enough, I said.

538
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,090
Get out.

539
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,960
Blast it.

540
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,535
Come, mother.

541
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,632
I'll take you to rest inside.

542
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,515
Where are you going?

543
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,874
To his funeral.

544
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,435
Don't worry, mother.

545
00:34:29,863 --> 00:34:30,863
Our secret

546
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,079
has died along with him.

547
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:43,504
Mother.

548
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,039
Go inside. I'll help you.

549
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,984
My lady Nuanlaor,

550
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,687
please don't be sad.

551
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:27,874
The arc of life
and its demise are natural.

552
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,624
But those who live
must carry on, my lady.

553
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:41,320
My lady.

554
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,140
Don't cry. You won't look pretty.

555
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,304
Don't cry, my lady.

556
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,510
Come in.

557
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,900
What is it?

558
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,160
I came to fetch you.

559
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,012
The funeral may need extra hands
to service the guests.

560
00:36:23,037 --> 00:36:25,295
Now you want me?

561
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,593
You've never bothered
about me before.

562
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,990
I'm sorry. I truly am.

563
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,678
Don't apologize to me.

564
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:43,727
It's too late after
what you have done.

565
00:37:09,288 --> 00:37:12,525
Heh.

566
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,550
Finally...

567
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,200
I have...

568
00:37:17,227 --> 00:37:18,307
Opium, sir.

569
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,415
Just its name gives me bliss.

570
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,120
I'll smoke all day
until I'm soaked in it.

571
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,375
Hey.

572
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,615
Why aren't you stopping me?
What's wrong with you?

573
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,575
A welcome back gift for
the great return of Muen Int, sir.

574
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,680
Hmm.

575
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,035
"Tester"This is just a tester.
Plenty more in the chest, sir.

576
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,280
Hmm.

577
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,812
Hrr...try to keep things discreet.

578
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,328
Has the news reached Ang Yi?
(Chinese secret society)

579
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,535
Yes, sir. They're all so pleased

580
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,400
that the nuisance is gone now.

581
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,130
Heh.

582
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,945
From now on, things
will be much easier, sir.

583
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,443
Now that business is done,
you can disappear.

584
00:38:08,468 --> 00:38:11,907
If anything else, I'll contact you.

585
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:14,695
Don't return here. Remember that.

586
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,187
Of course, Muen Int.

587
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,600
"Next"
About the next opium shipment,

588
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,085
remember our deal.

589
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,601
Ahem.

590
00:38:25,744 --> 00:38:29,835
Is this outfit too much
for the job?

591
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,800
Not at all.

592
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,625
We need to be low-profile.

593
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,220
Khun Phra's house is just
up ahead. Don't go around.

594
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:40,789
Won't we get arrested
for impersonating monks?

595
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,040
No, we won't.

596
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,902
If anything, monks who
eat pork barbecue at night

597
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:51,480
or massage patients with their feet
are the real destroyers of religion.

598
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Hmm.

599
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:54,200
Ahem.

600
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:57,360
Luang Por, I'd like to
make an offering.

601
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,030
Hey.

602
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:05,543
Today, I have a sore throat.

603
00:39:07,069 --> 00:39:09,717
I can't give you blessings.

604
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,800
I think that didn't go so well.

605
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,820
See that?
The whole market is watching.

606
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
Oh.

607
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,380
Um...

608
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,660
Move back, back.

609
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,855
More, more.

610
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Oh,...

611
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,260
What's this?

612
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,670
Hey.

613
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,040
You heartless murderer.

614
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:33,470
Hey.

615
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,110
You look better in
the poster than in person.

616
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,110
Hey.

617
00:39:38,532 --> 00:39:40,640
Come to think of it,
you look like Usopp.

618
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,775
But in the poster, it's all me.

619
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,591
You two don't need
a disguise anymore.

620
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:49,840
Hey, so I'm off the hook?

621
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,040
Maiphlong, put it back.

622
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,920
Put it back. Hurry.

623
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,645
People are watching.

624
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,385
Maiphlong, no.

625
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,600
It's not on properly.

626
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,992
If you expose us, I'll whack you.

627
00:40:03,772 --> 00:40:05,360
You two are not wanted.

628
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,280
Sticking around me

629
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,335
would only get you in trouble, too.

630
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,046
No, we're gonna get through this.

631
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:17,664
Sangthong, my dear friend.

632
00:40:18,758 --> 00:40:22,215
If you get caught, we'll
likely go down with you.

633
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,615
Darn, I thought you were
touched by our friendship.

634
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:28,025
Of course, we're friends.

635
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,095
But this is a charge they can
pin on us, too, you know?

636
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,730
What I really want is

637
00:40:33,755 --> 00:40:37,197
to find the truth to
clear you from this case.

638
00:40:37,222 --> 00:40:40,420
We can't let them
frame slaves like us.

639
00:40:40,445 --> 00:40:41,352
- Right.
- Yeah.

640
00:40:41,377 --> 00:40:43,195
What's wrong with
being born a slave?

641
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,352
- Totally.
- You betcha.

642
00:40:44,377 --> 00:40:46,500
Slaves are humans, too.

643
00:40:46,525 --> 00:40:47,480
- Indeed.
- Preach.

644
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,865
I'll die for justice.

645
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,275
Defi...

646
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,650
Die, you said? I don't want that.

647
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,600
Neither do I.

648
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,095
Just say aye.
I was trying to boost morale.

649
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,150
- Oh.
- Morale.

650
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,360
- Well then, Maiphlong.
- Yeah?

651
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,540
Will you come with me,

652
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,984
"Dear friend"
dear friend?

653
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,720
In my friend's arm,
how could I refuse?

654
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,885
I'll go so far as you take me.

655
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,680
I have but two of you,
friends in need.

656
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,164
Thank you so much.

657
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,490
Ahem.

658
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,800
Maintain monk composure.

659
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:24,125
Ahem.

660
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,315
Whenever you're ready,
let's pilgrimage.

661
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,340
- Go.
- Let's go.

662
00:41:29,758 --> 00:41:32,105
- Rising...
- Rising.

663
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,455
- Falling...
- Falling.

664
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,405
- Rising...
- Rising.

665
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,440
- Namo...
- No chanting.

666
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,720
- Just walk.
- Okay.

667
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,850
- Rising...
- Rising.

668
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,820
No smiles, Thongbai.
I can't help but smile, too.

669
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,742
I can't quite see
who's at the funeral.

670
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,765
Hey, why don't we move closer?

671
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,855
Hey, do you want to get caught?

672
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,415
Haven't you learned anything?

673
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,751
We're too far. How can we see them?

674
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:33,200
Of course, we can...with this.

675
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,680
Hey, that's Phi Jung
and Cullen's favorite snack.

676
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,285
Straight from Nong Mon.

677
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,495
No,...it's not
bamboo sticky rice.

678
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,455
You got me going.

679
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,235
This is my greatest invention.

680
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,179
I call it the remote peeping tube.

681
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,720
- Remote peeping...
- ...tube.

682
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,750
Mm-hmm.

683
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,485
"Not get"
I did not get it.

684
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,720
Hey, Sangthong.

685
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,105
You're the smartest one.
Don't you get it?

686
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:08,290
This tube helps us see
farther and clearer.

687
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,000
Use it like this?

688
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:15,990
Oh, uh...

689
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,415
I see nothing.
Are you pulling my leg?

690
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,720
Are you fooling me?

691
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,685
Ow.

692
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,330
Ooh.

693
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,411
Look through this side.

694
00:43:27,436 --> 00:43:28,436
- What?
- Here.

695
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,773
Just as I thought...like this.

696
00:43:36,335 --> 00:43:37,695
Crystal clear.

697
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,055
Hey.

698
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,585
Let me try.

699
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,200
- Through here?
- Yeah.

700
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,600
My word.

701
00:43:48,352 --> 00:43:49,702
Indeed, clearer than 8K.

702
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,975
Lady Nuanlaor's attire is...

703
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,930
classy.

704
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,640
Is that true? Let me see.

705
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,000
Hey, hey.

706
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,560
You keep watch of
who comes to the funeral.

707
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:05,200
And I shall mark down their names.

708
00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:07,935
For I believe

709
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,950
the absentee is the suspect.

710
00:44:11,975 --> 00:44:12,910
What?

711
00:44:13,725 --> 00:44:16,573
The killer would be absent.

712
00:44:16,598 --> 00:44:17,725
Why's that?

713
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,880
Have you ever heard?

714
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,805
Some people keep distant,
seething till the end.

715
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:27,270
Whoever despises Khun Phra the most
won't attend his funeral.

716
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:31,885
How clever you are.

717
00:44:32,811 --> 00:44:35,215
- I'm so lucky to be your friend.
- I know.

718
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,400
I'll be saved.

719
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,013
If you're so clever,

720
00:44:40,038 --> 00:44:42,919
pray tell, who is the killer?

721
00:44:42,944 --> 00:44:47,638
If you already know, we can stop
this spying and end this.

722
00:44:47,663 --> 00:44:50,493
I dare not make an accusation
without evidence.

723
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:54,374
I shall prove it today.

724
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,605
Who the real killer is.

725
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,670
You'll see.

726
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,920
Hey, write this down.

727
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,920
Mm-hmm.

728
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,080
I see Lady Nuanlaor.

729
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,200
Lady Rampueng.

730
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,440
Rampueng.

731
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,095
Pikun, Champi.

732
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,480
And other servants.

733
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,200
Let me see.

734
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,625
Champi, help attend to the guests.

735
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:54,650
Yes, my lady.

736
00:46:02,212 --> 00:46:05,620
Phi Rampueng, everyone is staring.

737
00:46:09,175 --> 00:46:10,505
Pikun, carry on.

738
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,540
Yes, my lady.

739
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,080
Listen.

740
00:46:22,597 --> 00:46:25,277
My condolences, Lady Nuanlaor.

741
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,760
But your tone sounds pleased.

742
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,328
Is it that obvious?

743
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,562
I have no reason to
rejoice in someone's death.

744
00:46:37,718 --> 00:46:39,118
Satisfaction, perhaps.

745
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,840
Thongphiphop.

746
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
- Thongphi...
- Wait.

747
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:54,249
I sense something's off about him.

748
00:46:56,763 --> 00:47:00,575
I feel as though he showed
no grief for Khun Phra's death.

749
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,475
He seems to be smirking

750
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,040
as if taking pleasure in it.

751
00:47:06,013 --> 00:47:07,483
But he still came.

752
00:47:08,574 --> 00:47:13,804
True, but who wears a satisfied
expression at a funeral?

753
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:15,239
Don't you find it suspicious?

754
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,080
I agree.

755
00:47:19,238 --> 00:47:20,278
Let's do this.

756
00:47:21,803 --> 00:47:23,866
Don't cross out his name yet.

757
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,165
Alright, I shall circle it for now.

758
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,335
Okay. There are a few left.

759
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,140
Soon, we'll know
who the real murderer is.

760
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,735
You must help me.

761
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,830
Sure, we're helping.
We are friends.

762
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,655
Indeed.

763
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,730
- If you see anyone else, tell me.
- Alright, I'll keep watch.

764
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,030
Nuan, I'll help the servants
serve water to the guests.

765
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,860
Oh, ma'am.

766
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,930
You have just arrived.

767
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,295
I had something to attend to,
hence my tardiness.

768
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,710
May I ask what seemed
to be that important?

769
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,623
That's not your concern.

770
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,415
Oh? Are you suggesting
I am being nosy?

771
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,440
"Sorry"
Sorry.

772
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,083
You and ma'am seem pretty close.

773
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,800
I apologize if I have offended you.

774
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,165
Nuan, do not speak to her that way.

775
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,440
It is not becoming.

776
00:49:40,086 --> 00:49:42,778
I've never been becoming
in your eyes anyway.

777
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,651
Ma'am, I apologize
for my little sister.

778
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,758
I understand how she feels
at a time like this.

779
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,360
Maiphlong.

780
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,375
Maiphlong.

781
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,400
Maiphlong.

782
00:50:19,915 --> 00:50:23,772
Sangthong asked us to keep watch,
but you fell asleep.

783
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,095
The karma has finally
run its course.

784
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,522
What did he do to you, you drunkard?

785
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,159
None of your business,
you crooked officer!

786
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,150
Crooked?

787
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,480
Did you just call me crooked?

788
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,975
If I'm crooked,
then you're a wretch!

789
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,085
- How dare you?
- Enough.

790
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:01,595
Why must you quarrel at a funeral?

791
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,545
Let bygones be bygones,
and forgive each other.

792
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,356
Averena ca sammanti.

793
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,295
Vengeance ends when grudges cease.

794
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,015
I feel calmer now, sir.

795
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,574
My apology, Thanh Chao Khun Palad
(Ecclesiastical title).

796
00:51:26,997 --> 00:51:29,095
Better watch yourself, wretch.

797
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,704
I'll be sure, one day,
you're charged with a crime.

798
00:51:35,857 --> 00:51:39,981
So, Lady Jolie and
Muen Int just arrived.

799
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:42,282
That makes everyone, yeah?

800
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,270
We're missing one person.

801
00:51:45,765 --> 00:51:46,935
- Huh?
- Look closely.

802
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,301
Hey.

803
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:58,189
Khun Bamrungnakon isn't here.

804
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,790
Is it the person
you're thinking of?

805
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,320
Sangthong,

806
00:52:14,471 --> 00:52:15,561
don't tell me that

807
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:18,086
Khun Bamrungnakon...

808
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,360
You broke the vow you made to me.

809
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,790
And for that, you had to die.

810
00:52:26,453 --> 00:52:27,453
Yes.

811
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:32,720
I believe Khun Bamrungnakon
is the murderer.

812
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,055
I'm not surprised

813
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,440
if Khun Phra Bamroekrung died at
the hand of Khun Bamrungnakon.

814
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:56,930
- Hey.
- Hey.

815
00:52:58,533 --> 00:53:00,560
Officers, find him.

816
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,320
I'm doomed.
They'll get me for sure.

817
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,340
Hey!

818
00:53:05,026 --> 00:53:06,562
The soldiers are here, sir.

819
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:07,807
Hear the command.
