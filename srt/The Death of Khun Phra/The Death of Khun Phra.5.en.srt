1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,710
This show is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to actual persons,

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,850
living or dead, or real events
is purely coincidental and

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,190
not intended to offend any person,
profession, or organization.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,950
We need to get
Khun Bamrungnakon to confess

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,650
to murdering Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,650
Then, Thongbai will be acquitted.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,250
Keep them under close watch.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,520
I took them in because

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,450
I wanted to know where Thongbai was.

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,550
Don't lose hope.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,020
Sangthong is trying to
get the confession.

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,870
At the wedding,

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,120
I saw you put something

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,970
in the liquor you gave to Khun Phra.

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,300
You poisoned Khun Phra,
didn't you?

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
Admit it, Thongphiphop.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,270
Confess to your guilt
that you poisoned him.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,870
Did you poison him?

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,350
Tell the truth.

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,220
You conspired with Thongbai
to kill Khun Phra.

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,470
He poisoned Khun Phra?

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,380
Everyone knows Khun Phra died
from a gunshot.

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,550
Poisoned him?

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,090
Absurd accusation.

25
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,920
Then at the wedding,

26
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,140
as the police went after Thongbai,

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,040
didn't you get away, too?

28
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,420
What about these two?

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Run. Fast.

30
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,800
I'll deal with them.

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,900
He's dead.

32
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,020
I was panicking.

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,100
I didn't know what to do.

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,020
Everyone was panicking
but no one ran like you did.

35
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
I didn't run away.

36
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,590
Where did you disappear to?

37
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,070
Answer me. Tell the truth.

38
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,060
I was afraid of stray fires,
so I rushed home.

39
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,350
Ask the villagers. They saw me.

40
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,650
I don't believe
the testimony of a drunkard.

41
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,420
I have no reason to kill Khun Phra.

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,250
You and Khun Phra were
at odds for some time.

43
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,000
Now, he's shot dead.

44
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,750
Why aren't you under suspicion, too?

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,010
Don't push your luck.

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,950
If I wanted to kill him,
I would've done it long ago.

47
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,920
That's it. You wanted him dead, too.

48
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,370
So, you're eager to
catch the shooter.

49
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,850
The one who benefits the most
from his death is you.

50
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,970
- Shut your mouth.
- Ain't that the truth?

51
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,960
Deny if you must.

52
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,010
You're a Khun.
You possess great power.

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,430
People believe your words.

54
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,820
You got the power to do good

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,800
but you use it to crush
little people like me

56
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,380
who did nothing wrong.

57
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,000
Proud of yourself?

58
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,640
I didn't do it.

59
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,630
Want to use force?

60
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,690
Let's get brutal.

61
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,410
Come on.

62
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,200
My face. Punch it.

63
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,920
It's gonna get ugly.

64
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,800
Sangthong, we're leaving.

65
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,070

Sangthong. Sangthong.

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,590
Sangthong, you fool.

81
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,290
Khun, so you've woken up?

82
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,550
Woken up?

83
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,860
Why didn't you answer?
I hollered many times.

84
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,110
Uh, I passed out, sir.

85
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,910
Don't you know your limit?

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,010
What a non-stop, foolhardy drinker.

87
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,710
Serves you right.

88
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,060
Let's go back.

89
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,270
Yes, sir.

90
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,790
Hurry up. Don't waste my time.

91
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,290
Right behind you, sir.

92
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,070
Hrr, what's the rush, sir.

93
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,530
We haven't had any
quick little toast.

94
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,750
I won't drink with a man
that insults me.

95
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,260
Was he chewing you out?

96
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,330
How dare. I'll deal with him.

97
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,010
Stop.

98
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,500
I instigated him.

99
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,140
Oh,...so you backed out?

100
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
What, sir?

101
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,300
Can't stand his...

102
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,690
guts, sir?

103
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,260
I'm not that illogical.

104
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,970
Then why, sir?
Why riling him up?

105
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,580
To find out

106
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,150
if he was involved
in Khun Phra's death.

107
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,900
Why so eager to catch the murderer?

108
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,300
First, you went after my friend...

109
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Oops.

110
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,160
Thongbai isn't my friend.

111
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,490
Everyone deserves justice.

112
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,690
And Khun Phra was...

113
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,130
Was what, sir?

114
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,240
My dear friend.
He deserves justice, too.

115
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,880
Thongbai is also my dear friend.
He deserves justice, too.

116
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,870
A second ago, he wasn't your friend.

117
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,310
Now, he's your dear friend.

118
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,860
Were you really drunk?

119
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,370

Silly goose.

127
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Let's go.

128
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,800
Sangthong.

129
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,870
Wake up. Now.

130
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,820
Hey.

131
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,330
If you don't, I'll leave you here.

132
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,580
Pfft.

133
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,730
Bunmi, have Jom drag him
to his quarters.

134
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,120
Hey, anybody there?

135
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,840
Hey, Jom.

136
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,770
Where are you, Jom?

137
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,690
Why isn't anyone answering?

138
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,850
Yes, sir.

139
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,010
Ow.

140
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,180
Sangthong?

141
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,090
What happened to him, sir?

142
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,320
He passed out.

143
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,880
- From riding the rickshaw?
- Alcohol, fool.

144
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,130
Look how miserable he is.

145
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,020
Sir, please forgive his
unruly drinking behavior.

146
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,720
I ordered him to drink in my place.

147
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Where is Jom?

148
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,450
Phi Jom?

149
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,500
I'm afraid he's
quite miserable also.

150
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,020
What now?

151
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,950
Uhm.

152
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,940
Phi Jom's gonna yell at me
if he catches me at this hour.

153
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,750
What am I to do?

154
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,750
Oh, perhaps...

155
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,040
I use the shrimp paste again?

156
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,200
No. Don't.

157
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Is somebody there?

158
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,820
Is it Phi Jom?

159
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,930
- Spare me, please.
- It's just me.

160
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,570
Maiphlong.

161
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
I can't stay here.

162
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Go away.

163
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,600
Maiphlong. The one you
yelled at a lot.

164
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,710
Go away.

165
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,000
If you don't go,

166
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,770
I will.

167
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,170
He's not quite alright

168
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,110
as if he got spooked by a ghost.

169
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,570
Ghost? Where from?

170
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,080
An abandoned temple.

171
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
What temple?

172
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,400
Oh, uhm.

173
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,330
I mean, maybe a temple.

174
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,280
I don't know where he went
and got spooked from.

175
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,880
- I'll ask him for you.
- Enough.

176
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,060
Better get Sangthong down quick.

177
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,530
He's about to drool
all over the seat.

178
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,750
Yes, sir.

179
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,840
Sangthong.

180
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,170
Sangthong, wake up.

181
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,550
What? You had a thing for me?

182
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,280
Are you okay?

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,080
Come to our quarters.

184
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,770
- Can you walk?
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Hold it in.

186
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,970
If you puke, I'll have you lashed.

187
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,950
Choke back. Gulp it down.

188
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,300
You don't want the whipping, do you?

189
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,950
You can puke in our room.
Go, go.

190
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,390
Real sorry, sir.

191
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Sangthong.

192
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,540
Wait, wait.

193
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
Come in.

194
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,180
Sit down. Sit.

195
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,430
Whoa, just a sec.

196
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,590
Here, spittoon.

197
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,390
No puke?

198
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,150
I swallowed it.

199
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,370
I should've whacked you.

200
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,620
Sorry, Ajarn Beer.

201
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,580
- No need for this?
- Mm-hmm.

202
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,200
Hey, hey.
Get up, get up.

203
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,360
Sangthong,, listen.

204
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,170
Did you get his confession?

205
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,940
That smile.

206
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,780
And that expression.

207
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,860
You got his confession?

208
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,710
I learned of a...

209
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,500
more thrilling
and frightening bit than that.

210
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,170
What is it?

211
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,070
I got to sit

212
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,380
on a rickshaw.

213
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,500
Your breath reeks of alcohol.

214
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,930
Would you stop clowning?

215
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,750
Riding a rickshaw is thrilling
and frightening, is it not?

216
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,500
I don't care about that.

217
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,220
So? The confession?

218
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,370
Did you get it?

219
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Ho, yeah.

220
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,410
Spill it.

221
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,200
Hey.

222
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,550
It's blood.

223
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,900
You put a hex on somebody?

224
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,970
Look. Who?

225
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,690
Whoa.

226
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,540
Khun Phra.

227
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,000
Sangthong, you put a hex on him?

228
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,840
He's already dead, man.

229
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,640
Not me, idiot.

230
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,060
Thongphiphop.

231
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,980
- Thongphiphop.
- Yeah.

232
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,130
He put a hex on him?

233
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,990
A hex on a dead?
What for?

234
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,960
Zombie, you know? The Walking Dead.

235
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,410
Seriously, would you think
before spouting stuff?

236
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,970
Bloody face.

237
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
If not for a hex,

238
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,300
why would he put
blood stains all over it?

239
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,490
Because he...

240
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
he

241
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,580
he

242
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,160
He what?

243
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,070
- He...
- Yeah?

244
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,200
Hey, Sangthong.

245
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,810
Don't fall asleep.

246
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,590
Now, I really want to know.

247
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,280
Hrr.

248
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,720
As is, he'll be out cold.

249
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,700
Just don't slip.

250
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,880
Why did Thongphiphop do this?

251
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,210
Someone knew I poisoned him, Mom.

252
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,580
But I don't care.

253
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,600
I'm just afraid you'd be alone
if they put me away.

254
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,210
I won't leave you, Mom.

255
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,630
Thongphiphop.

256
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,620
You can let me be.

257
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,850
What did you say?

258
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,220
You don't have to look after me.

259
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,670
Let me be.

260
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,970
So you can live your life.

261
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,490
Don't hang on to me.

262
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
No, Mom.

263
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
I won't.

264
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,410
Nobody gets to choose
where to be born.

265
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,210
I'll choose where to die

266
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,240
for myself. Okay?

267
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,440
I won't let you, Mom.

268
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,670
Are you doing this
for me or yourself?

269
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,340
For us, Mom.
I want you to stay with me.

270
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,010
I won't desert you.

271
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,290
Are you up?

272
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
Mm-hmm.

273
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,060
Then, get up.

274
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Up.

275
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,170
My leg is numb.

276
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,610
Not feeling a thing.

277
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,460
Get up, will ya?

278
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,380
Ow, ow. My body aches all over.

279
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,230
Thongphiphop makes some good booze.

280
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,740
Not sober yet?

281
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
I guess.

282
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,610
It's okay.

283
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,010
I got just the thing.

284
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,060
A bolus, so bitter
it'll wake you up.

285
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,010
It's in my bag.

286
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,260
Your hand.

287
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,210
It'll soothe your throat
and refresh you.

288
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,300
"Hangover"
Hangover killer.

289
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,470
Instant headache cure.

290
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,170
Hey, is it good?

291
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,780
Water, water. Give me water.

292
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,780
Water?

293
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,760
Water.

294
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,410
Here, here. Your water.

295
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,930
Feeling better?

296
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
You were saying?

297
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,080
Tell me already. I'm dying to know.

298
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
Come on, now.

299
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,260
But my whole body is tense.

300
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,170
Wish I could get a massage.

301
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,390
Where is it tense?

302
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,100
Arm, too.

303
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,490
Better?

304
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,520
Head, too.

305
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,180
Head?

306
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,720
- Head, too?
- That hurts.

307
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,180
You think you can fool me?

308
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,140
"Hangover"
I still got the hangover.

309
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,780
It's gone.

310
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Cured, yeah?

311
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,620
Continue your story.
It kept me up all night.

312
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,720
Thongphiphop could be
our new suspect.

313
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,390
Thongphiphop?

314
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,420
Yeah, yeah. Simmer down.

315
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,940
Keep it down. Okay?

316
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,950
- Thongphiphop?
- Yeah.

317
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,480
I'm lost.
How's he mixed up in all this?

318
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,820
I forgot to tell you
one thing last night.

319
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,860
In fact,

320
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,320
he also held a grudge
against Khun Phra.

321
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,570
He approached Khun Phra

322
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,900
right after Khun Phra's speech
at the election.

323
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,700
Everyone, come get one.
Spread the word.

324
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,020
Khun Phra, sir.

325
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,360
Thank you so much for

326
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,440
your policies for
local liquor makers.

327
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,720
It's nothing. Glad to be of help.

328
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Khun Phra, sir.

329
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,800
If you become the city governor,

330
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,340
will you abolish the law

331
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,580
forcing hundreds of workers
into liquor factories?

332
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,420
If so, a small maker
like me can thrive.

333
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,100
Uhm. Yes, yes.

334
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,940
Promise me, sir.

335
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,240
Promise, sir.

336
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,760
Yes, I promise.

337
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,340
Once I'm elected, yeah?

338
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,880
I must go to see my friends.

339
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,820
Vote for me.
Khun Phra Bamroekrung, number 1.

340
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,600
Tell your brothers, relatives,
slaves, and master,

341
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,860
the one and only,
Khun Phra Bamroekrung, number 1.

342
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,700
Yay.

343
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,740
Here, here. Take this.

344
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,980
Thanks.

345
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,520
Mom, this is it.

346
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,140
Our new hope.

347
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,700
Good news, Mom.
We'll make more money soon.

348
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,740
No more hanging our lives
on the unfair produce prices.

349
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,560
Come again. I'm not following.

350
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,300
I mean to make pricier products
from the produce.

351
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,960
Liquor. We make liquor with them.

352
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,400
We won't make for ourselves anymore.

353
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,480
Home-distilled liquors we make,

354
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,480
once legalized, we can sell them.

355
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,480
- Really?
- Yes, Mom.

356
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,840
The law favoring big capitalists
will be repealed.

357
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,840
Small folks like us will
finally be able to sell liquor.

358
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,840
Who told you?

359
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,740
One of the governor candidates.

360
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,700
The previous lord was
never our backer.

361
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,160
He said the taste can't compete
with the imports.

362
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,940
But, this candidate I met
would change that.

363
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,820
He truly supports local liquor.

364
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,520
He promised me he'd enact
laws to help us.

365
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,140
A verbal promise is
like the wind to them.

366
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,420
Don't be fooled, child.

367
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Mom.

368
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,620
That great man has done
a great many things for people.

369
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,620
He was just saying
what you want to hear.

370
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,760
Anything to get your vote.

371
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,120
But Mom,

372
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,220
he's like no other.

373
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Here he is.

374
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,620
Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

375
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Look.

376
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,970
"Khun Phra Bamroekrung,
Number 1"

377
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,740
Umph, you must be hungry.

378
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,820
Sure, Mom.

379
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,340
- One water coming up.
- Mm-hmm.

380
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,260
See, Mom?
A decent man, right?

381
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:26,040
On election day, you must vote
for Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

382
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
Mm-hmm.

383
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,620
So, do you think he's a good man?

384
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,260
Whoa.

385
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,640
Hail...God of Thunder, Thor.

386
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,820
Here comes the lightning.

387
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,040
Hey, I recall Khun Phra
won the election.

388
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,520
He became the governor.

389
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,060
Yes, a sweeping victory.

390
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,360
He couldn't make
heads or tails of it.

391
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,980
Why?

392
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,800
And,...

393
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,690
I adjourn to scrubbing the floor.

394
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,040
Pick that up.
Follow me.

395
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,240
Hey, finish your story
after that, okay?

396
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,480
More, more.

397
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,600
Hey, this is enough.

398
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,580
Will you finish your story?

399
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,200
Or shall I finish you for?

400
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,900
Okay, okay.

401
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,980
Thongphiphop was among the first
to visit Khun Phra.

402
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,220
I love your work.

403
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,660
Such a tiny nameplate
for my city lord position.

404
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,660
It's already three times larger
than the late governor's, sir.

405
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
Yeah? Show me.

406
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,220
"Phraya Mahapradit, Governor"
"Khun Phra Bamroekrung, Governer"

407
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,500
Well, no complaints there.

408
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,820
Okay, great job.

409
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,380
And make three more of these.

410
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,340
I'll use them at my office.

411
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,300
Of course, sir.

412
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,520
Mm-hmm.

413
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,060
- Thanks.
- Yes, sir.

414
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,820
Hmm.

415
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,490
"Khun Phra Bamroekrung,
Governor"

416
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Sangthong.

417
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,060
How's this?

418
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,720
Whoa.

419
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,540
So grand, so spectacular,

420
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,510
Michelangelo might praise,
"Oh, Daddy."

421
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,170
Picasso might cry,
"Mommy, what a paint job."

422
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,760
Such magnificence worthy
of adorning your manor, sir.

423
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,190
I like the way you think.

424
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,330
And you're here for?

425
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,780
Oh, someone would like to meet you.

426
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,570
Who?

427
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,080
Thongphiphop, sir.

428
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,320
Thongphiphop? Do I know him?

429
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,110
He looks familiar.
But I can't place him.

430
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,580
He said he brought you some liquor.

431
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Perhaps...

432
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,390
to celebrate your
new height of success.

433
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,440
Sure. They all want to
benefit from my authority.

434
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,420
Well, I will see him.

435
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,680
Right away, sir.

436
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,920
Khun Phra granted you an audience.

437
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,570
Thanks a bunch.

438
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,660
Will you lead the way?

439
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,750
Shoes off.

440
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,640
Keep your steps hushed.

441
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,460
On the left that way.

442
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,280
Not leading the way?

443
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,340
Pick you up, too?

444
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,970
- Hmm?
- No, thanks.

445
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,910
Good day, sir.

446
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Hmm.

447
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,840
I present you with one of my best.

448
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,300
It is made chiefly
from fresh sugarcane.

449
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,040
It's a single-origin liquor
that reflects our local identity.

450
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,630
Its sweetness...

451
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,800
Okay, okay. I get it.

452
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,530
I have priorities.

453
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,780
If nothing else, you're dismissed.

454
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Okay? Thanks a lot.

455
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,920
By the way,

456
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,270
when will you enact the law
to reduce monopolies?

457
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,140
Monopolies?

458
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,090
What monopolies?

459
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,170
It's...

460
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,120
the liquor monopoly
to just big distilleries.

461
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,850
Oh, about that.

462
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,930
Easier said than done.

463
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,360
But you said
after becoming the governor,

464
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,910
you'd repeal that law

465
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,860
and support small liquor makers.

466
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,810
Small makers can't maintain quality.

467
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,840
And the excise tax is just puny.

468
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,940
If hundreds of small makers
sprang up,

469
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,090
how will officials handle them?

470
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,310
Hmm?

471
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,060
Aside from taxes,
a lot more problems will surface.

472
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,300
Allowing big players lets
the officials work with ease.

473
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
Hold on, sir.

474
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,640
Small makers can maintain quality

475
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,130
just as good as the big ones.

476
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,310
How can I trust that
all them can do a good job?

477
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,760
Even their puny stillhouses
don't meet our standards.

478
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,460
Quality comes from skill,
not square footage.

479
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,610
New laws can enforce that
in all stillhouses.

480
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,960
Meet quality or close down.

481
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:09,940
Hrr.

482
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,960
You listen.

483
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,050
Don't add laws to our city
that already has too many.

484
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,600
Besides, the ruling officials
has me all backed up now.

485
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,310
I'm not buying that.

486
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,160
Favoring big makers, as usual.

487
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,440
Don't you want small makers

488
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,680
to make ends meet?

489
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,080
Hey.

490
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,780
Why flood the market with liquor?

491
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,520
No indulging in intoxicants.

492
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,490
One of the Five Precepts. Okay?

493
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,060
Why encourage more to break it?

494
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,350
Discourage drinking?

495
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,060
Why tax alcohol, then?

496
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,590
Why not wipe it off the market?

497
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,160
You talk and preach,
but lie and cheat.

498
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,580
Whatever.

499
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,490
Whatcha gonna do about it?

500
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,780
Hypocrite.
You break your word.

501
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
Hey.

502
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,120
Stop your brash mouth.

503
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,020
I am a Khun Phra and the governor.

504
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,890
You can't talk to me that way.

505
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,680
You're but flesh to me.

506
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,850
You've wronged, so rebuke is due.

507
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
Hmph.

508
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,040
Sangthong. Ming.
Whoever hears me.

509
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,020
Haul this insolent trash
out of here.

510
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,650
Sangthong, quick.

511
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,480
Kick him out before I have
the police put him away.

512
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,850
- Get him out. Now.
- You made a promise, sir.

513
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Hold on.

514
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,390
Take your horrendous liquor back.

515
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,640
My esteemed guests could mistake it

516
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,920
for tarnish on my prestige.

517
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,220
Sangthong.

518
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,660
Sir.

519
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,230
You overstay your welcome.

520
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Sangthong.

521
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,960
Next time more discretion
before letting anyone in.

522
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,860
Don't show loathsome hobos
to my door.

523
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,120
- Yes, sir.
- That's it.

524
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,960
- But, we shook hands.
- Out.

525
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,780
Don't dawdle.
Drag him out.

526
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,920
- You promised me, sir.
- Not one word. Out.

527
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,160
- Khun Phra, sir.
- What a drag.

528
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,360
"Khun Phra Bamroekrung,
Governor"

529
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,160
Get off me.

530
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,090
Quit fighting.
Walk.

531
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,090
- Let me talk to him.
- Walk.

532
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,610
Go.

533
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,700
Ahem.

534
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,390
From now on,

535
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,150
get out of my face.

536
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,790
Got it,...lousy crumb?

537
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,090
Your horrendous liquor.

538
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,110
Take it back.

539
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,520
Come on. Please.

540
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,920
Don't come back, okay?

541
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,850
Please...do as I say.

542
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,570
Go on, go, go.

543
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,570
Shoo, shoo. Shoo, shoo.

544
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,810
There you go. Get lost.

545
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:19,870
What?

546
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,260
Acting?

547
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,520
Real good.

548
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Yeah? What?

549
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Want a piece?

550
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,790
Hey.

551
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,820
Look. I'll leave you here.

552
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,390
Don't come back, okay?

553
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,540
I will support local industries,

554
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,360
such as local liquor makers.

555
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,100
Promise me, sir.

556
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,240
Yes, I promise.

557
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,260
Our new hope.

558
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,780
Whatcha gonna do about it?

559
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,970
Hypocrite.
You don't keep your promise.

560
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,920
Kick him out before I have
the police put him away.

561
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,560
Take your horrendous liquor back.

562
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,650
Treacherous man.

563
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,920
I'll show you

564
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,220
how a man with nothing to lose
can fight back.

565
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,480
And how hard I'm gonna crush you.

566
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,630
Good day, sir.

567
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,460
The name's Rit,
the owner of Lertruedi Distillery.

568
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,510
Here to meet Khun Phra as arranged.

569
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,090
Khun Phra Bamroekrung's residence
welcomes you, sir.

570
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,960
He's expecting you upstairs.

571
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
This way, sir.

572
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,490
Please leave your shoes
right there, sir.

573
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,900
I appreciate your cooperation, sir.

574
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,910
What a long talk they're having.

575
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,730
I'll take more naps under the house.

576
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,980
Hey, hey.

577
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,780
Go back the way you came.

578
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,140
I'm here to talk to the man.

579
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,680
Step aside, or you'll be sorry.

580
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,800
Sure, sir. Go on in.

581
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,420
Better safe than sorry.
Live to fight another day.

582
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,910
Live to fight another day.
Better safe...

583
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,220
What a nut.

584
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,130
For your superb liquor,
I'll advise the tax officer.

585
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,250
Surely, you'll be
the big player in the market.

586
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,360
- You used the barrels.
- Yes, sir.

587
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,690
- Hey.
- Hey?

588
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,680
Just as I thought.
You favor the capitalists.

589
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,600
- I'll get you good.
- Hey, hey.

590
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,350
- Step off.
- Hey, not me.

591
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,350
- So, step off.
- Oh, no.

592
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,070
You, too. Don't come near me.

593
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,850
Catch him. Quick.

594
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,840
Catch him.

595
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,970
Sangthong, that's sharp.

596
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,710
Give me that.

597
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
Oops, no.

598
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,210
A promise means nothing to you.

599
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,450
Throw him out. Out, out.

600
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,290
You don't keep your word.
You, hypocrite.

601
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,910
My hand.

602
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,380
Sangthong, don't let him in.
He's mad.

603
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,360
- Go after him.
- Yes, sir.

604
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,410
My hand got cut.

605
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,280
- How's your hand, sir?
- It's fine.

606
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
Get off me.

607
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Walk.

608
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,160
Fool! You injured my hand.

609
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,650
You assaulted me
in my own home.

610
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,080
How dare you, commoner.

611
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,150
Push him. Put him down.

612
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Yeah.

613
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,080
Remember this.

614
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,610
Yeah.

615
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:54,970
Sangthong.

616
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,940
Sir?

617
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,200
Give him a lesson.

618
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,120
I think he already passed out, sir.

619
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,620
And you think I'm all right?

620
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,420
- Toss him out of my house.
- Yes, sir.

621
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,060
It's quite high, sir.

622
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,590
Sangthong.

623
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,900
Is he dead?

624
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
Leg.

625
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,130
My leg.

626
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,690
It's broken.

627
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,200
Karma hits hard
if you try to cross with me.

628
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,580
Muahaha. Hahaha.

629
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,920
Hey, hey.

630
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,320
That's how he wailed in pain

631
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,220
lying helplessly on the ground.

632
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,810
Luckily, he didn't fall head first.

633
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,920
He's had a disability since then,
as you see him now.

634
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,400
He was betrayed
on the promise and...

635
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,240
- got a broken leg to top it off.
- Mm-hmm.

636
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,060
That's his motive

637
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,640
for the murder.

638
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,060
According to your sleuth formula,

639
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,010
we need two more things,

640
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,970
the murder weapon
and his confession.

641
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,920
Well, maybe not.

642
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,820
Last night, I was out
with Khun Bamrungnakon.

643
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
I eavesdropped on them talking.

644
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,300
At the wedding,

645
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,030
I saw you put something
in the liquor you gave to Khun Phra.

646
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,810
Speak up, Thongphiphop.

647
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,330
Confess to your guilt

648
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,190
that you poisoned him.

649
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,540
It's the least of what you deserve.

650
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,890
Did you poison him?

651
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,000
Tell the truth.

652
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,910
You conspired with Thongbai
to kill Khun Phra.

653
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,240
From what I overheard,

654
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,710
Thongphiphop might have
poisoned Khun Phra.

655
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,250
Poison? How could he do that?

656
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,010
Khun Phra was shot dead.

657
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,450
We saw it, and so did
everybody else at the wedding.

658
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,440
What you saw was but the surface.

659
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,200
The truth lies fathoms below.

660
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
What now?

661
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,620
As I was saying,

662
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,090
Khun Phra might have been
poisoned before shot dead.

663
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,570
Oh, my.

664
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,770
See? See?

665
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,690
- You're right.
- Yeah, see?

666
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,900
Thongphiphop might have
poisoned Khun Phra.

667
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,530
The gunshot wound

668
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,960
could've been from

669
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,850
a stray bullet during the commotion.

670
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,310
Oh, no.

671
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Wow.

672
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,610
What a mystery.

673
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,480
Now, you're getting it.

674
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,920
So, whoever held the gun
that day was a patsy.

675
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,060
Yeah, Thongbai was a patsy.

676
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,220
He didn't know that gun was real.

677
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,020
What a shame for him.

678
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,540
Rotten luck.

679
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,760
Now, we only need one thing.

680
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,780
If we get Thongphiphop's confession,

681
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,480
Thongbai will be acquitted.

682
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,940
Thongphiphop is our man.

683
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,610
Yeah.

684
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,630
At Khun Phra's funeral,
I saw him with a big smile.

685
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,210
It's because he killed Khun Phra.
Am I right?

686
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,090
You're sharp.

687
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,260
- What was the slap for?
- Just teasing.

688
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,850
I knew of his motive,
but I didn't suspect him.

689
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,700
I was so focused on
Khun Bamrungnakon.

690
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,690
Listen up.

691
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,410
We barged in
to force his confession.

692
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,490
Brute force?

693
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,470
One good leg,
but he fights like a made man.

694
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,790
We'd better not be hasty.

695
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,090
No. Use haste. Use force.

696
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,390
End this game.

697
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Trust me.

698
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,150
No business. None is welcome today.

699
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Vile.

700
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,870
- Hey.
- Whoa.

701
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,450
Watch it,...gimpy.

702
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,690
What?

703
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,970
He's glaring at me.

704
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,180
Hoy. Hon. Somebody's glaring at me.

705
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,130
And my feet are itching.

706
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,540
My mistake, sir.

707
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,240
Are you all here for a drink, sir?

708
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,810
Welcome, sir.

709
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,340
So, you do have manners.

710
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,100
We're here not for drinks

711
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,440
but to perform our duties.

712
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,720
Don't run your mouth recklessly.

713
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,300
We're here today

714
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,620
to collect excise tax
on your liquor.

715
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,560
Tax? Collect from big distilleries.
My small business has none.

716
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,780
Big or small, you all must pay.

717
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,480
So shut it and pay up.

718
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,020
Don't make me repeat it.
I have a sore throat.

719
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,270
I have no money. I won't pay up.

720
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,860
Why are you, a salaried official,
milking from the people?

721
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,820
You got some mouth on you.

722
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,410
One more charge for you,

723
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,840
verbal harassment.

724
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,010
Officers are supposed
to enforce the law justly,

725
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,260
not crush the people with it.

726
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,570
Shut your mouth,

727
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,800
you nosy meddler.

728
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,250
Who are you to tell me
how to do my job?

729
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:15,330
All citizens must render
their taxes. It's your duty.

730
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,140
- What say you?
- I can't.

731
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,080
I have no money.

732
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,610
I can't. I have no money.

733
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,920
What are we to do
if a man can't pay tax?

734
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:24,770
What?

735
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,880
Seize his property?

736
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,000
- Hoy. Hon.
- Yes, sir.

737
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,090
Carry on.

738
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,060
Hey, stop.

739
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,070
Stop what?

740
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,690
Ow, that hurts.

741
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,550
So what?

742
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,560
Stop. I sell them at my shop.

743
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,160
- Give me back.
- Your shop?

744
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,810
Nobody wants to set foot in here.

745
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
Get it?

746
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,040
Hoy. Hon.

747
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,480
- Hurry. Show them to me.
- Yes, sir.

748
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,780
Your products, though worthless,
are seized,

749
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,970
so you know better than to
meddle with a law enforcer like me.

750
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,210
Muahaha.

751
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,200
- Hahaha.
- Haha.

752
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,010
- More.
- Hahaha.

753
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,250
Let's go.

754
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,370
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

755
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
Here I come.

756
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,150
What's the holdup?

757
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,330
Get the things
to catch Thongphiphop.

758
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,420
Rope to tie him up.

759
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,430
Hey, you're thinking.

760
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,690
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

761
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,250
One sec.

762
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,330
- You cold?
- Yeah. I don't wanna catch a cold.

763
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,390
Hey, no.

764
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,020
Once I catch him, I stuff his mouth
with this rag so he can't scream.

765
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,450
Whoa.

766
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,680
"Make sense."
Make sense.

767
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,330
Right?

768
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,160
- We go.
- Hold on.

769
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,790
- Hmm?
- One more.

770
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,110
Weapon.

771
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,120
If he fights, we've got a leg up.

772
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,370
Whoa.

773
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,730
- Good thinking again.
- Of course.

774
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,260
More?

775
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:25,800
No.

776
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:26,610
Positive?

777
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:27,660
Totally.

778
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,190
Sure?

779
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,050
100%

780
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,180
Absolutely?

781
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,360
Of course.

782
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,170
So, let's go.

783
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:34,420
Hold on.

784
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,560
That's it.

785
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,170
I'm staying. You go.

786
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,740
I'm done with your hold-ons.
Just take everything.

787
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,190
Well, sorry.

788
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,460
I just feel...

789
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,050
something is amiss.

790
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,690
What is it?

791
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,900
The last green banana.

792
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,250
How delicious.

793
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,730
Hrr.

794
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:05,180
Maiphlong, you said you'd return.

795
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,910
Where are you now?

796
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,810
If I ever see you again,

797
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,840
I'll whoop your butt a few times.

798
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,880
Maybe nothing.
I just think too much.

799
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,400
Let's go.

800
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:19,780
You lead.

801
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,300
I can't stand
anymore of your hold-ons.

802
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,730
Why are you like this? Come on.

803
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,650
Can I eat this?

804
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,340
Better not.

805
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,140
I'm afraid I must resort
to squirrels again.

806
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,330
Maiphlong, you.

807
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,710
I'll get you back.

808
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,050
Ow.

809
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,280
Maiphlong.

810
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,660
Hey.

811
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,350
Ang Yi. Why are they here?

812
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,820
They can't find me here.

813
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,240
Do it.

814
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,640
Gotta hide.

815
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:19,120
There?

816
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,300
Muen (Nobility title) Int.
Why's he here, too?

817
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,330
Rut. Rit.

818
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,190
You two stand guard over there,
in case they got cute.

819
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:39,910
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

820
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,200
Muen Int and Ang Yi
are here to get me?

821
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,160
This is it for me.

822
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,180
Are you sure this is the way
to Thongphiphop's house?

823
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
Yes.

824
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,640
I came here with
Khun Bamrungnakon.

825
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,570
Heh.

826
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,610
Hahaha.

827
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:18,090
This is it, Thongphiphop.

828
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,520
I've come to get your confession.

829
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,340
Let's go.

830
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,990
- No, no.
- What?

831
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,530
This way.

832
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,500
That way?
Why didn't you say so?

833
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,980
Because you didn't ask.

834
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,720
Why are you packing?
Why in a hurry?

835
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,660
Son.

836
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,430
- Are we going somewhere?
- I'll tell you later.

837
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,080
Hey, Thongphiphop.

838
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,640
Shh.

839
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,770
Pipe down.
He could hear you.

840
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,020
Someone's yelling outside.
You hear?

841
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,180
Nobody.
Don't mind that.

842
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,910
You go that way.

843
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,470
I go this way.

844
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,150
Hurry, Mom.

845
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,320
Let's go.

846
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,530
Is it really all right?

847
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,100
It's fine. You go out back.

848
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,600
- Nobody there.
- Did you look?

849
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,640
Of course.

850
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,580
Hey, Thongphiphop.

851
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,480
Maiphlong.

852
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:50,320
How could he hide in there?
Check behind the counter.

853
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:53,980
Ow, I saw them do this
in the movies.

854
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,420
Fine.

855
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,420
Hey, Thongphiphop.

856
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:00,770
Not there, either.

857
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,370
Maiphlong. Look here.

858
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,800
Simmering medicine pot.
They can't be off too far.

859
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,120
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

860
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,800
- Hurry. Go, go.
- Yeah.

861
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:13,780
I'll get you.

862
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:17,390
- Tell me where we're headed.
- Later, Mom.

863
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,280
Watch out.

864
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Mom.

865
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,520
Are you okay?

866
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:31,690
We must go.

867
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,960
- Hey, Thongphiphop.
- Stop yelling.

868
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,700
Shh, shh.

869
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:39,990
He could hear you.

870
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,090
Good, so we could see him.

871
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,940
No. We want to catch him.

872
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,060
I'll go that way.

873
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:48,060
You going that way?
Then, we go this way.

874
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:48,760
We?

875
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,300
- That mean you and me, then.
- Yeah, better follow me.

876
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,300
Shh, shh.

877
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,570
Hurry, Mom.

878
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,570
Thongphiphop.

879
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:57,540
Come on, Mom.

880
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,540
Hey, Thongphiphop.

881
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,960
Hey, hey. We've gotchu.
Stop, stop.

882
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,720
Don't move.
Or I'll get your crutch.

883
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,090
Come and get it.

884
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,250
Come on.

885
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,530
Watch out. He could punch you
as you snatch his crutch.

886
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,570
He's as burly as Buakaw.

887
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:24,170
I know.
Well, just don't move.

888
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,270
Did you kill Khun Phra?

889
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:28,030
And you're getting away.
You bastard.

890
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,360
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

891
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,330
You have a strong motive.

892
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:37,880
Your grudge after he broke his word
and threw you to the ground.

893
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,440
Hence, your bad leg.

894
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,460
So, you murdered him.

895
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,460
Right?

896
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,360
Son.

897
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,840
What is it?

898
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,450
You didn't tell me
the reason you escaped

899
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,650
because you killed Khun Phra?

900
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,440
How could you kill your father?

901
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:00,620
- Father?
- Father?

902
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,570
Khun Phra Bamroekrung
was your father?

903
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:31,840
I'm but a commoner,
not of a privileged family.

904
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,380
I got nothing to
grease your palms with,

905
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,100
so now you look down on me?

906
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,340
Get this. My words are
sacred as scripture.

907
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,520
Your fate in prison

908
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,740
or even death

909
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,260
is all up to me.

910
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,940
We've got two suspects now.

911
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,490
Thongphiphop and Khun Bamrungnakon.

912
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,280
Not two, but three.

913
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:59,390
Step outta line, and you'll meet
the same fate Khun Phra did.
