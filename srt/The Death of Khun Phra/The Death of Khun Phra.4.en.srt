00:00:00,976 --> 00:00:02,710
This show is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to actual persons,

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,850
living or dead, or real events
is purely coincidental and

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,190
not intended to offend any person,
profession, or organization.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,050
Answer me.
Where is your friend?

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,950
Thongbai disappeared
since the ceremony, sir.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,710
I'll take them in at my estate.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,040
Khun Bamrungnakon had the chance
to shoot Khun Phra that day,

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,370
and many other chances.

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,600
Why wait until the wedding day?

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,775
Hey, perhaps
Khun Bamrungnakon didn't shot him?

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,204
What you said gave me
a second thought.

12
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:41,230
Which room is it?

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,110
Maybe this room.

14
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,269
Must be this room.

15
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,330
Ouch.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,235
Whatcha doing here?

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,175
Eavesdropping.
I wanted to know what you found.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,600
They could've seen you
and we'd be in trouble.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Come in.

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,020
Did you open the door
because you found something?

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
Hey.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,040
This is a gun.

23
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,680
So, he hid the gun.

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,255
What shall we do?

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,035
Sangthong. Sangthong.

26
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,500
Hey,...Phi Jom's voice.

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,660
Are you done already?

28
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,220
Something's fishy.

29
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,340
Sangthong, have you finished?

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Stack these back on.

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,595
Tell him you're busy
so he won't come up.

32
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,780
Not finished yet, Phi Jom.

33
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,435
Yeah?

34
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,525
See? Now, he won't bother us.

35
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,870
My brilliance shines under pressure.

36
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,125
I'll come up to help you.

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,600
So much for your brilliance.

38
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,020
It's alright, Phi Jom.
I'm about done.

39
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,260
Just a sec.

40
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,900
Are you working hard
or hardly working?

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,995
- What'll we do?
- Oh, no.

42
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,855
If he found me in this room
with you, we're finished.

43
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,350
Hide under the table.

44
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,750
No, he'll see.

45
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,635
- In the drawer.
- No, I'm not Doraemon.

46
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,795
Window.

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,925
No. Not the window.

48
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,655
It's the only way to get down.

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,105
No. I'm afraid of heights.

50
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,145
Jump now, or Phi Jom will
crush us both to a pulp.

51
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,130
Why haven't you answered me?

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,635
What if I broke my leg?

53
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,975
I'll splint your leg.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,125
- You know how?
- I did it for a dog once.

55
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,885
What a relief you did it once.

56
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,085
For a dog?

57
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,145
Don't dawdle. Close your eyes.

58
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,015
- It'll be quick. I promise.
- What promise?

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,725
He's not answering. It ain't right.

60
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,130
Better check it out.

61
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,640
You can do it.
You can do it.

62
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,635
No, I can't.

63
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,375
Afraid of height?
It should be fearful of you.

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,420
Go. Go.

65
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,530
On three.

66
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,235
One.

67
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,815
Sangthong.

68
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
Shoes.

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,020
Have you finished
for real, Sangthong?

70
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,195
I was finished just ask you entered.

71
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,420
Where's Maiphlong?
Did he come here?

72
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,480
Haven't seen him.

73
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,575
That slacker better not
be lying down somewhere.

74
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,175
My morning's call was useless.

75
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,485
Well, anything you want from him?

76
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,760
He didn't finish his task.

77
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:14,522
What took you so long
to answer me anyhow?

78
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,145
Phi Jom,

79
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,670
I didn't wanna do a sloppy job.

80
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,775
Every spot, every corner must shine.

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,345
What if the boss got
an itch or rash?

82
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,195
I don't want you to bear the fault.

83
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,200
No, I can't have you yelled at.

84
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,570
Yeah, thanks.

85
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,160
Finish cleaning here.

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,885
Get your friend back
to water the plants.

87
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,170
Of course.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Good.

89
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,130
Ouch.

90
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,800
Maiphlong, anything broken?

91
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,770
None. But your neck will be.

92
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,220

"Mystery of the Deadly Sins"

106
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,930
You said, "On three."

107
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,460
But you butted me out
the window on one.

108
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,055
I was sure you wouldn't break a leg.

109
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,545
- Because you're built thick.
- What?

110
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,840
Correction. Built tough.

111
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,970
- Making fun of me?
- No, my friend.

112
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,235
You're fine, and
we fooled Phi Jom.

113
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,685
We're both off the hook.
Lighten up, will ya?

114
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,995
Fine. What about the gun?

115
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,020
Shush.

116
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,530
Pipe down.

117
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,135
So, what about the gun?

118
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,725
Should we report to the police
that we found the evidence?

119
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,890
Not so fast.

120
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,930
We need more to get
the police involved.

121
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,615
According to my studies,

122
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:48,262
a murder investigation

123
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,370
necessitates three things
to arrest the murderer.

124
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,970
- Three things?
- Mm-hmm.

125
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,590
What are they?

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,080
First.

127
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,200
Motivation.

128
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,860
Pfft.

129
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,910
Calm down.

130
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,485
We've nailed it down.

131
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,435
We know Khun Bamrungnakon
despised Khun Phra to the core.

132
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,515
Khun Phra's message to
the palace got him demoted

133
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,420
from Khun Phra to mere Khun.

134
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,020
Second.

135
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,984
The weapon of murder.

136
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,440
We found it well hidden and locked

137
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,520
in a box that belonged
to Khun Bamrungnakon.

138
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,530
Three.

139
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,680
Confession statement.

140
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,145
Ooh.

141
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,015
That's the hardest part.

142
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,745
What criminal goes,
"Oh, I'm the shooter."

143
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,395
"I killed the man. Arrest me."?

144
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,275
Are you crazy?
Motivate and evidence are enough.

145
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,945
Don't forget we're slaves.
Police would never believe our story.

146
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,970
True.

147
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,145
The confession from the murderer
is an absolute must.

148
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,120
We need to get
Khun Bamrungnakon to confess

149
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,510
to murdering Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

150
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,310
Then, Thongbai will be acquitted.

151
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,930
It's too hard for us.

152
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,080
Nothing is too hard for me.

153
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,130
Let me think.

154
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,455
There you are.

155
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,170
Oh, no, no.

156
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,545
I didn't disobey.
Nor did I slack off.

157
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,615
It's just I took a dump
in the woods.

158
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,150
I can prove it
if you want to smell it.

159
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,150
No.

160
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,815
I let you slide this time because
your friend completed your task.

161
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,775
All good.

162
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,415
His tone is fuming.

163
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,305
Uh, any more task
for us, Phi Jom?

164
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,035
Khun has returned.

165
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,480
He summoned all slaves
to the residence.

166
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,130
Hmm.

167
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,220
Summoned all slaves.

168
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,680
What's up with that?

169
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,375
Oh, he may have learned

170
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,475
that his box was searched.

171
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,700
Don't be alarmed.

172
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,255
Perhaps it's nothing.

173
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,605
I say...

174
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,155
you go up and keep quiet.

175
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,945
Don't utter a word.

176
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,550
I'll handle it.
Let's go.

177
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,555
- Hey. Get up.
- Yeah.

178
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,135
Let's go.

179
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,615
Still hurts back here.

180
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,880
Come on, big guy.

181
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,750
You butted me down.
Look after me.

182
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
Go, go.

183
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,335
Here they come. My new slaves.

184
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,760
Chinese sweetmeats for you.

185
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,820
My estate is unlike others.

186
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,945
No need for groveling.
Walk humbly to him.

187
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,250
Get up and walk here.

188
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,650
- I'm not an arrogant man.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,460
A noble presence commands respect
without exerting power. Correct?

190
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:09,839
Speak your mind.

191
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,933
Should you object, pray do so
with sound reasoning.

192
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,065
Correct, sir.

193
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,615
The abuse of power compels
people to cower in fear,

194
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,295
not respect.

195
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,570
Just as you suggested.

196
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,505
Correct, sir.

197
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,135
Khun Phra used to
give us commands.

198
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,635
We carried out every one of them.

199
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,810
Because we feared him.

200
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,585
Come.

201
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,860
Your Chinese sweetmeats.

202
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,360
I bought them from
a Chinese merchant

203
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,320
in Talat Noi.

204
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,750
Enjoy.

205
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,330
- Bless you, sir.
- Your grace.

206
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,690
Hand them all out to
whomever wants it.

207
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,370
- Then, come to my room.
- Yes, sir.

208
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,245
Have plenty.

209
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,075
Yes, sir.

210
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,945
Take more.

211
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,240
Yours is almost out.

212
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,545
What's with the tears?

213
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,570
Does your leg hurt?

214
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,050
No.

215
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,535
Tears of joy.

216
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,975
You know?

217
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,740
Of all my slave life,

218
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,215
this is the first thing

219
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,960
given to me without
anything in return.

220
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,440
What a generous Khun.

221
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,425
I've never dreamed of the day

222
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,078
I treat myself to
such a pricey dessert.

223
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,440
Umm.

224
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Sangthong.

225
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,720
Do you think it's possible?

226
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,875
What is?

227
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,880
That we may have gotten
him all wrong.

228
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:26,207
How could a generous man
like him kill someone?

229
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:31,680
Surprise.

230
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,525
- Hey.
- What?

231
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,455
Again? Don't trick me like that.

232
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,560
Can I have some?

233
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,761
You wish.

234
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,015
Why are you here?

235
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,095
I told you to stay with Thongbai.

236
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,065
Whatcha doing here?

237
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,535
I have news about Phi Thongbai.

238
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,120
Ow, what happened to him?

239
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,800
Phi Thongbai wants...

240
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,615
wants

241
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,715
wants

242
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,505
wants

243
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,880
Want what? Tell me.

244
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,815
- wants the sweets for me first.
- Huh.

245
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,410
Please, I came a long way.
So hungry.

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What?

247
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,180
Here.

248
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,815
Satisfied?

249
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,505
Will you tell me already?

250
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,135
Hungry.

251
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,490
So, you have my snacks.

252
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,825
Quick. Tell me about him.

253
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,790
I said, "Hungry."

254
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,095
Come now, be a good girl.
I gave you treats.

255
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,895
Hungry.

256
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,745
I meant he's so hungry
that he snatches food from cats.

257
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,490
Nuansri, where are you?

258
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,040
I've got your food.
I'll leave it here.

259
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,930
Come get your food.

260
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,619
Forgive me, Nuansri.
I promise I'll pay you back.

261
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,226
My friends haven't
deserted me, have they?

262
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,480
When will they come and get me?

263
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,875
Or is it my fate to be
accused of murder

264
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,480
and condemned to death?

265
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,470
You should've said that sooner.

266
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,275
I didn't want him ill or anything
so I rushed here to tell you.

267
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,145
What happened to him?

268
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,425
Kratai said he was starving.

269
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,450
So starving.

270
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,895
He needs us, then.

271
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,875
Hold on.

272
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,030
I have a plan to acquit him
more quickly.

273
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,260
We must split.

274
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,455
- Split?
- Mm-hmm.

275
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,675
Split how?

276
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
Look.

277
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,225
You go to him with food.

278
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,265
So he won't have to
snatch food from cats.

279
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,325
As for me.

280
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,495
I'll find a way to get close
to Khun Bamrungnakon

281
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,280
and extract a confession from him.

282
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,540
How will you do that?

283
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,745
I don't know yet.

284
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,075
However, we must do something.

285
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,485
You bring food to him.

286
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,875
We must free him of the charges

287
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,665
so he won't have to be hiding.

288
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,955
Okay.

289
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,640
Your task is to get the confession.

290
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,680
Mm-hmm.

291
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,460
Huh. Thongbai.

292
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,330
My...

293
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,360
Hmm.

294
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,970
Hmm.

295
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,890
I can't believe
this room is all dirty.

296
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,050
Ahem.

297
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,460
What are you doing out there?

298
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,860
Oh...

299
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,215
I just...

300
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,105
wait out here
in case you need me for anything.

301
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,195
If I need you, I'll summon you up.

302
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,940
You needn't linger.

303
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,610
Yes, sir.

304
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,684
I'll be downstairs, then.

305
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Hold it.

306
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,515
Hurt, didn't it?

307
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,570
You should've waited
at the door

308
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,800
before I allowed entry.

309
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,060
Serves me right, sir.

310
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,105
But how may I be of assistance, sir?

311
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,491
None.

312
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,946
But a question to ask.

313
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,935
A question, sir?

314
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,625
What is it?

315
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,030
Today, you cleaned
my room, correct?

316
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
Yes, sir.

317
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,515
Phi Jom's command, of course.

318
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,018
Anything unsatisfactory, sir?
I'll clean more. Anything, sir.

319
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,505
Nothing more.

320
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,610
But a kudos.

321
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,820
Every inch of the room sparkles.

322
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,400
Thank you, sir.

323
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,210
Your praise is a sustenance
I dare not dream of.

324
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,455
None can rival your magnificence.

325
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,615
I commend your work.

326
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,695
I stated how I felt honestly,

327
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,228
so you keep up the good work.

328
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,155
My, what a kind man you are.

329
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,265
I am but a forgotten slave that
no master would value my service.

330
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,037
If anything, sir, anything at all,
just give me a holler.

331
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,305
None.

332
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,835
I do spotless laundry.

333
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,745
My attires are always clean.

334
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,770
Relaxing massage?

335
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,580
My body is always fit,
never tense.

336
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,130
Thirsty, sir?
I'll fetch it instantly.

337
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,085
I always keep water in my room.

338
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,110
Bye-bye.

339
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,130
Please forgive my manner, sir.

340
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:48,245
A funny guy, I see.

341
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,170
You're growing on me.

342
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,060
But I fail to find
what to use you for.

343
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,695
Yes, sir.

344
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,150
Then, I won't bother you, sir.
I'm off.

345
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,260
Unless...

346
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,780
you want to company me outside.

347
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,040
Wh...where to, sir?

348
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,250
All clear, sir.

349
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,450
So, where are we off to, sir?

350
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,290
You'll see.

351
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,780
Change of heart?

352
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,000
I live to serve you, sir.

353
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,030
"I am going out with him."

354
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,000
"You"
You mean me?

355
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,135
"hide-and-seek"

356
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
"eat food"

357
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,910
"there"

358
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,440
What's the holdup?

359
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:02,850
Hrr.

360
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,835
♪ I'm...leaving ♪

361
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,735
♪ He's...leaving ♪

362
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,515
♪ We're...leaving. ♪

363
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,570
♪ All...leaving ♪

364
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,025
At your service, sir.

365
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,635
He signaled me to
give Thongbai food.

366
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,957
Gosh, I'm just that dang good.

367
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,980
Sit up here.

368
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,913
Oh, no. I wouldn't sit
by my master, sir.

369
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,405
I don't treat slaves with disdain.

370
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,545
Why walk?

371
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,925
Even so, sir.

372
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,109
I wouldn't dare.

373
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,785
That's an order, then.

374
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,550
Sit here or consequences.

375
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,035
Aye, sir.

376
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,230
Time to go.
Thongbai's in trouble.

377
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,065
Oh.

378
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,605
Frightened?

379
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,775
Follow me.
A task for you.

380
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,165
Hold on.
You mean now?

381
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,180
Why?
Gotta be somewhere?

382
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,335
Oh, not in a rush, nowhere to go,
Ready for some task.

383
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
Hmph.

384
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,410
Hold on.

385
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,665
But I'm not done here yet.

386
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,284
Why? Got problem?

387
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,675
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
So sorry.

389
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,915
I'm done.

390
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,640
- After me.
- Right behind you.

391
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,265
Where is it?

392
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,600
- This way.
- Okay.

393
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,630
Take a seat.

394
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,210
May I, sir?

395
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,260
Of course.

396
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,660
What now?

397
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,540
Feeling the bliss, sir.

398
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,750
I'd always been the coolie,
never the passenger.

399
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,205
"Could Maiphlong be right?"

400
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,000
"How could a decent man
commit murder?"

401
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,520
Don't get soapy.

402
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,490
Go, Bunmi.

403
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,005
Once you finish with that,

404
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,935
store the firewood in the kitchen.

405
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Sure thing.

406
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,085
Oh, but...

407
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,275
What now?

408
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,075
I got a number two coming up.

409
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,395
Could I go to the meadow?
It'll get ugly real soon.

410
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,520
I couldn't hold it.

411
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,155
Fine, fine.

412
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,650
- Go.
- Thanks.

413
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,195
One moment.

414
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
Hrr.

415
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,770
He fell for that easily.

416
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,670
Phi Jom.

417
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,760
Going out?

418
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,795
Well,...

419
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,820
I...

420
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,450
I'm having my lunch in the meadow.

421
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,095
Eating and dumping at the same time?

422
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Yeah, yeah.

423
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,344
Lame excuse, you slacker.

424
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,035
You'd better finish your task,

425
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,969
or I'll report the boss.

426
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
Okay, sure.

427
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,857
Put that down.

428
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,728
Go. Now.

429
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,955
Finish it.

430
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,980
Yeah.

431
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
What now?

432
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,900
- Get to work.
- Yeah, yeah.

433
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,155
He's eyeballing me the whole time.

434
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,120
How am I supposed to get away?

435
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,750
Oops.

436
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,990
He's always around.
How should I shake him off?

437
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,220
Shrimp paste?

438
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
This is it.

439
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
Hey.

440
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,995
What a clumsy kid.

441
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,300
I'm sorry.
I tripped on something.

442
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,955
Oh, my lord.

443
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,120
It's shrimp paste.

444
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,290
It stinks.
It stinks like this.

445
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,745
Wash it out. Go.

446
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,045
- Where do I go?
- That way.

447
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,990
I can't stand it. I'm leaving.

448
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,550
Phi Jom. I need help.
Oh, please.

449
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,700
The smell is so foul.

450
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,615
So foul.

451
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,195
It smells bad.

452
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,580
So ba...bad.

453
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Bad.

454
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Bad.

455
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
Finally.

456
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,435
The smell is so bad.

457
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,600
Horrible, real bad.

458
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,680
A lantern.

459
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,355
Finally, I got my foot clean.
Now, is he here?

460
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,905
Phi Maiphlong.

461
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,655
Yay. Phi Thongbai is saved.

462
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,709
Thongbai, hang on.

463
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Wait a second.

464
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Hey.

465
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,600
Somebody followed him here.

466
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,435
Keep them under close watch.

467
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,055
- Why's that, sir?
- I took them in...

468
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,227
because I wanted to know
where Thongbai was.

469
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,930
I'm sure they're bound to meet.

470
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,025
Sangthong is smooth as butter.

471
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,795
I'll keep him close to me.

472
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,295
And Maiphlong is
a delusional half-wit.

473
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,985
If he even hints at
wanting to go out, let him go.

474
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,600
Then, you shadow him.
He'll lead you to Thongbai.

475
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,370
So, this temple must be the hideout.

476
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,905
Phi Maiphlong.
Phi Maiphlong.

477
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,555
Somebody is on your tail.

478
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,420
I bring food for you, Thongbai.

479
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,010
Can't he really see or hear me?

480
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,825
A ghost's gotta try harder.

481
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,850
Hmph.

482
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,880
Brrrr.

483
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Brrrr.

484
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,255
Brrrr.

485
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,050
Can't he see me, too?

486
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,000
You'd better focus, girl.

487
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,775
Brrrr.

488
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Oh!

489
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,485
Oh, no.

490
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,510
A ghost.

491
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,015
Yeah!
Girl ghost power for ya.

492
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
Hey.

493
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,150
What ghost?

494
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Who said it?

495
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,235
Oh, no, Phi Maiphlong.

496
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,050
Ghost, ghost.

497
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,985
It's just me, Kratai.

498
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,010
Eh?

499
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,260
Argh.

500
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,165
Ghost, ghost.

501
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,135
Please, please. Don't spook me.

502
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Spare me.

503
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,450
Maiphlong, my buddy.

504
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,130
You bring me food.

505
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,520
- Hey, it's you.
- Yeah.

506
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,730
What was that white sheet?

507
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,960
Oh, it was my invention.

508
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,025
I'm starving.

509
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,875
So starving.

510
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,000
These bananas aren't ready yet.

511
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,110
But I could try.

512
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,335
Hmph.

513
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,360
Vile bitterness.

514
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,200
These could give me constipation.

515
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,100
Luang Por, give me blessing.

516
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,360
Squirrels.

517
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,370
Watch out.

518
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,100
- Whoa.
- Arggh.

519
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,980
- Whoa.
- What, what?

520
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,020
It's hot.

521
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,615
Stop being jumpy.
It's already dark and eerie.

522
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,810
Here it is.

523
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,105
I've got you covered.

524
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,485
Eat it.

525
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,635
And spare those poor squirrels.

526
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,795
- Okay?
- Thanks a bunch, buddy.

527
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,040
You're welcome, buddy.

528
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,015
You know what I had to do

529
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,095
to slip through Phi Jom's
evil fingers?

530
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,675
Who's Jom?

531
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,145
Just some guy.

532
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,865
I used a lot of tricks with him.

533
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,275
Shrimp paste.

534
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,100
Urgent nature's call in the meadow
and a lot of other stuff.

535
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,286
I had to fend for myself, too.
Almost ate green bananas.

536
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,860
Hey, gently.

537
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,895
- Choking.
- Gently.

538
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,080
Swallow slowly.

539
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,460
- What about Sangthong?
- Him?

540
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,955
Sangthong.

541
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,935
I don't know
where Khun took him.

542
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,355
It's good, though.

543
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,125
He planned to get close to him

544
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,490
so he could extract
a confession from him.

545
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,015
A confession?

546
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,255
Yeah.

547
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,735
Here's the thing.

548
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,170
Before I came to you,

549
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,480
he and I found a gun
in Khun Bamrungnakon's room.

550
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,160
- A gun?
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,595
This means he killed Khun Phra.

552
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,665
I am free of the crime. I'm free.

553
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,505
No, not yet.

554
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,005
Listen up.

555
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:02,065
We found a gun.
We know his motive.

556
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:06,395
But if we can't get
a confession from Khun,

557
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,555
nobody would believe a word
from slaves like us.

558
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,375
That said,

559
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,920
you remain a suspect.

560
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,985
But...

561
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,815
don't lose hope.

562
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,855
Sangthong is trying to
get the confession.

563
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
So, stay hidden.

564
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,415
I hope Sangthong gets it.

565
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,475
Mm-hmm.

566
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,900
Trust us.

567
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,630
We can do it.

568
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,480
Thanks a bunch.

569
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,394
- Eat up.
- Hmm.

570
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,780
Eat. Don't choke on it.

571
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,065
Eat plenty, but gently.

572
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:56,055
I'll keep you from starving.
Don't worry.

573
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,725
- Okay?
- Yeah, it almost got me.

574
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,995
Take it slow. I'll come again.

575
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,270
Hmm.

576
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,490
Pull over here.

577
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,495
We must continue on foot.

578
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,035
It's just up ahead.

579
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,845
Are we here?

580
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,490
Could I sit out here?

581
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,690
Quite comfy.

582
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,495
Sure. Sit.

583
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,580
I'll walk, sir.

584
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,885
Sit if you want.

585
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:33,910
Yeah?

586
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,270
I liked pulling the rickshaw, too.

587
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,460
What are we doing here, sir?

588
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,130
Do you know a man
named Thongphiphop?

589
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,454
Khun Phra permitted your audience.

590
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,845
He came to meet Khun Phra

591
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,940
about some local distillery.

592
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,740
Hmm.

593
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,740
You must have known him, yeah?

594
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,520
Uh, it's in that vein, sir.

595
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,540
Is your liver made of iron?

596
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,910
Quite so, sir.

597
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,755
Very well.

598
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,450
Here's a task for you.

599
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:50,575
I need to talk to Thongphiphop.

600
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,305
He'll bring me his liquor.

601
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,865
Since I'm not well-seasoned,

602
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,000
I'll let you drink it.

603
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,790
You must talk him
into drinking with you.

604
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,205
Why must he drink, sir?

605
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,180
A loaded glass fires off
the truth untold.

606
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:18,265
"Then, if I get Khun to drink,

607
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:23,705
I could get him to confess, too."

608
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,680
"Alright, I'll give it the world."

609
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,585
Are you dozing off or what?

610
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:33,520
Yes, I'm coming, sir.

611
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,297
Who do we have here?
Khun Bamrungnakon himself.

612
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,100
An honor for you to visit
my humble little distillery.

613
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,300
Will you do me the good grace
of consulting with me?

614
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,685
Gladly, sir.

615
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,325
The place doesn't look like much.

616
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,820
I hope freshly crafted liquors
will do nicely.

617
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,764
I'm afraid liquor could
upset my stomach tonight.

618
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,670
Would you mind so much

619
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,330
if my entourage has the drinks
you're serving instead?

620
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,350
Hey, weren't you Khun Phra
Bamroekrung's slave?

621
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,575
Yes, sir.

622
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,845
But since he was shot,
I couldn't go back there.

623
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,705
Other slaves would kill me.

624
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,295
Fortunately,

625
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,142
Khun's generous hand

626
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,954
extended mercy unto me.

627
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,992
A disloyal slave, you are.

628
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,890
Not a double agent slave, I hope.

629
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,435
I present you this first jar.

630
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Palm wine.

631
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,645
Made from coconut
and palm fruits from Amphawa

632
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,895
The coconut sap is fermented
into a sweet liquor.

633
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,460
One sip and you'll find
its sugary flavor

634
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,225
and the warmth
that spreads deep inside.

635
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,340
Have a taste, would you?

636
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,400
Here, sir.

637
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:44,635
I am used to imported liquor.

638
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,025
Domestic ones are just as good.

639
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,170
Do not let the label deter you

640
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,885
from appreciating our great culture.

641
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:58,355
Honestly, local resources
and wisdom

642
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,360
are the heritage worth preserving.

643
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,550
Too bad for my uneasy stomach.

644
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,250
Sangthong, you try.

645
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,260
You first, sir.

646
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,700
Now is the perfect time.

647
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,450
I don't dare drink
from your cup, sir.

648
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,460
You are permitted so.

649
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,580
I'm a slave, sir.

650
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,015
I insist.

651
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
Hmph.

652
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,070
Real good stuff, sir.

653
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,840
Lushly sweet and scented, sir.

654
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,794
I say you must try.

655
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,940
"I must get him drunk."

656
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,580
I'm afraid not.

657
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:28,295
"Why is he not drinking?
Next cup, then."

658
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,920
Woo.

659
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,525
Sweetness isn't to your liking?

660
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,270
Might I suggest?

661
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,825
Sato, jar-fermented liquor

662
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,875
made from premium sticky rice
from Isan.

663
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,645
It is fermented with loog-paeng
(fermentation starter)

664
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,550
enhanced with my secret blend
of four unique herbs.

665
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:57,150
The flavor is sweet, refreshing,

666
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,045
and tingling, with a sharp,
penetrating warmth.

667
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,720
A fine drink. Simply a can't-miss.

668
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,320
You should try.

669
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,070
His secret blend will get you

670
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:28,225
tingly warmed and exhilarated, sir.

671
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,650
Great. After you, then.

672
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,370
"Fine.
One more round, and that's it."

673
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:47,695
This is Merai, made from premium
in-season mulberries

674
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,295
blended with passion fruit
for sweet and tangy flavors.

675
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,325
It's mixed with white liquor
for a slightly astringent taste.

676
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,420
Guaranteed to go down smoothly, sir.

677
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
Cheers.

678
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,250
"This cup is mine. Next is his."

679
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,225
You keep resisting, sir.

680
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,820
If you don't prefer sweet taste

681
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,575
or a tingly refreshing feeling,

682
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,320
you won't say nay to this.

683
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,884
Corn liquor.

684
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:27,825
Made from corn grown in Pak Chong,
harvested during the rainy season.

685
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,948
The locals call it rainwater corn

686
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,807
because it is cultivated for
the rain and good air.

687
00:42:33,832 --> 00:42:37,132
Natural water gives it
the defining touch.

688
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:42,577
You may pass on other liquors.
But I truly wish you would try this.

689
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,700
"History"
So intriguing its history is.

690
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,670
"Crank up some more, Thongphiphop.
More, more."

691
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,733
Its main ingredient is corn.

692
00:42:52,758 --> 00:42:55,525
Completely unadulterated
40% alcohol content.

693
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,670
Bold and strong,
yet deeply sweet and fragrant.

694
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,570
Please.

695
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,370
Fragrant.

696
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,895
"Come on. Come on.
Bottom up."

697
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,400
I know you'd like that.

698
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,660
Here.

699
00:43:54,322 --> 00:43:55,572
Again, mate?

700
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,050
Bamrungnakon, good lad.

701
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:08,775
You have me drinking solo all night.

702
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,000
Hah! Bah!
Hah! Bah!

703
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,600
I'm talking to you, stiff face.

704
00:44:13,552 --> 00:44:15,032
You got the time?

705
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:23,220
- You are drunk.
- Me drunk? No, no.

706
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:31,600
Just a lonesome man who's
so thirsty.

707
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,775
Hey, Khun. Khun.

708
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,620
How about a back hand?

709
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,470
Go throw up outside.

710
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,275
You've produced respectable liquors.

711
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,550
Sangthong was wasted,
lost in the blur.

712
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,795
You shouldn't have
let him keep babbling.

713
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,425
I'm sure you'll give him
brutal lashings.

714
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:59,520
As the old adage goes,

715
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,345
never quarrel with the mad
nor trifle with the drunk.

716
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:05,570
I knew he was drunk.
I couldn't blame him.

717
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,020
You're too kind.

718
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,350
I wish all the officials
were like you.

719
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,025
I'm flattered.

720
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:19,650
I appreciate your visit
to my modest distillery.

721
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,995
It's nothing.

722
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,745
I'm so glad I came.

723
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:28,550
I'm astonished by
your genius collection.

724
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,045
I want you to see.

725
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,095
My modest distillery operates

726
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,345
with fair business practices.

727
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:40,120
So, I hope you will support
local liquor makers.

728
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:44,591
Khun Phra Bamroekrung
proposed that policy.

729
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:47,175
The law should soon be enacted.

730
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,445
Lousy Khun Phra,
and so were his promises.

731
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:53,495
Once he got the position,
he didn't do anything.

732
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,150
He said it was just a campaign
to run the election.

733
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:01,241
I was so resentful.

734
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:05,120
You were resentful,
but what can you do?

735
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:08,076
After he made a promise,

736
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:11,575
I came up with many formulas
to show off.

737
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,545
But he died
before I could do anything.

738
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:19,595
What a pity.
He shouldn't have gone so soon.

739
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,125
Not at all.

740
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,988
He had what was coming for him.

741
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,125
His existence was
a disgrace to the land.

742
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,900
He should've never assumed
any authority at all.

743
00:46:39,938 --> 00:46:44,058
How could you say things
like that about him?

744
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,225
I said that because I wish you,
Khun Bamrungnakon,

745
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,070
would become governor.

746
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:58,050
You are more just to us
than that greedy nobleman.

747
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,520
You call him a greedy nobleman.

748
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,775
Your resentment must
have been so deep-rooted.

749
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,650
Deep-rooted is generous, sir.

750
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,225
He praised merchants
but trampled us, the drudges.

751
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,525
He bleeds the upright dry

752
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,745
while lining his pockets
with bribes.

753
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,950
A man like him deserves to die.

754
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,175
You shouldn't speak of
a dead like that.

755
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,000
I did because I knew
you were once his rival.

756
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,645
You should know what he had done.

757
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:15,775
And I think you have a chance
to become the new governor.

758
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,695
Whence you do,

759
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,670
I hope for your support
for local liquor laws.

760
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,320
Before we discuss that subject,

761
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:31,770
I have questions to ask you.

762
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:33,745
Anything, sir.

763
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,795
After Khun Phra died,

764
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:40,650
I had the hospital
examine his body before cremation.

765
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,900
The autopsy results came out today.

766
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,546
We already know who killed him.

767
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:50,075
What else is there to investigate?

768
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,420
There are some questionable things.

769
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:57,070
That's why I must see you
this very night.

770
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,500
What does it have to do with me?

771
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:08,700
You think I don't know what you did?

772
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:12,825
At the wedding,

773
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,350
I saw you put something

774
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,720
in the liquor you gave to Khun Phra.

775
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:51,800
I thought it was your
special formula, so I paid no mind.

776
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,175
But I know better now.

777
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,050
You poisoned Khun Phra,
didn't you?

778
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,820
Speak up, Thongphiphop.

779
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,100
Oh, no.

780
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,500
Thongbai.

781
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,900
What about these two?

782
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,970
Run. Fast.

783
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,020
I'll deal with them.

784
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:35,325
The finest spirits in all of
Suwanthani, as I told you.

785
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:36,370
Finest, you say?

786
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,120
Indeed, sir.

787
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,750
He's dead.

788
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,520
He's dead.

789
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,520
Admit it, Thongphiphop.

790
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,975
Confess to your guilt

791
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,525
that you poisoned him.

792
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,400
Did you poison him?

793
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,225
Tell the truth.

794
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,350
You conspired with Thongbai
to kill Khun Phra.

795
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,970
He poisoned Khun Phra?

796
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,525
Thongphiphop is our man.

797
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,220
You're an arrogant fool.

798
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,395
I'll make you see

799
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,775
how a man with nothing
to lose fights back.

800
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,070
Why are you, a salaried official,
milking from the people?

801
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:58,145
All citizens must render
their taxes. It's your duty.

802
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,345
Let's go.

803
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:00,866
Stop, stop.

804
00:52:00,891 --> 00:52:01,900
Did you kill Khun Phra?

805
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,413
You didn't tell me
the reason you escaped

806
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:06,250
because you killed Khun Phra?
