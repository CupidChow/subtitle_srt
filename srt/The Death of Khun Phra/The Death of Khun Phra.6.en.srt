This show is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to actual persons,

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,850
living or dead, or real events
is purely coincidental and

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,190
not intended to offend any person,
profession, or organization.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,050
Ang Yi. Why are they here?

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,200
Muen Int. Why's he here, too?

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,476
Muen Int and Ang Yi
are here to get me?

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,050
This is it for me.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,070
Thongphiphop...

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,945
Karma hits hard
if you try to cross with me.

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,820
could be our new suspect.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,260
Hey, hey. We've gotchu.
Stop, stop.

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,035
Did you kill Khun Phra?

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,842
And you're getting away.
You bastard.

14
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:40,297
You killed Khun Phra?

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,290
How could you kill your father?

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
- Father?
- Father?

17
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,955
Mom, this isn't the time.
We must escape.

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,600
Maiphlong, get the rope.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,635
- Rope, rope.
- Yeah, get it.

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,370
It got tangled up.

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,340
Mom, we must get away.

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,633
I'm not going anywhere

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,232
until you tell me

24
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,437
why you killed your father.

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Got rope?

26
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,420
- Not yet.
- Come on.

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,690
Hear me, Mom.

28
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,160
I didn't want him keep
betraying other people.

29
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,760
Quit fighting.

30
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,010
Get off me.

31
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:31,635
Fool! You injured my hand.

32
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,325
You assaulted me
in my own home.

33
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,995
How dare you, commoner.

34
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,020
Put him down.

35
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,745
Serves you right.

36
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,770
Yeah.

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,290
Toss him out of my house.

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
Oof.

39
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,975
Karma hits hard
if you try to cross with me.

40
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,770
Curse it!

41
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,510
What happened, child?

42
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,215
Are you badly hurt?
Try to get up.

43
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,985
Let's go inside.

44
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,675
Who did this to you?

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,870
Watch your step.

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,435
What happened to you?

47
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,345
Is your leg okay?

48
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,505
It's broken.

49
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,025
Broken?

50
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,265
Who did it?
What happened?

51
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,868
Khun Phra had his slaves
toss me down to the ground.

52
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,310
Khun Phra?

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,642
Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

54
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,001
Why did he do it?

55
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,790
Did you do anything to him?

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,200
I told him to keep his word

57
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,875
about supporting local liquor.

58
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,925
But he waved me off.

59
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,342
His slaves hurled me to the ground
at his command.

60
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,948
He broke his promise.

61
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,595
One day, I'll make him pay.

62
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,755
His pain will be
a hundred times mine.

63
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,855
Try to settle down.
You're in a lot of pain.

64
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,430
Okay, son?

65
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,175
Take me to the police station.

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,935
What for?

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,775
To file a report.
Khun Phra nearly killed me.

68
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,425
Men like him

69
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,797
belong in prison.

70
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,060
Don't go. Okay?

71
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,785
It'll be in vain.

72
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,945
We're just commoners.

73
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,515
The police won't help us
and press charges Khun Phra.

74
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,415
Khun Phra, then what?

75
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,875
Whoever wrongs must be punished.

76
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,439
If everyone's negligent like you,
they'd all go free.

77
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,075
Justice isn't for everyone, son.

78
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,625
Or haven't you heard

79
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,658
prisons are made for the poor?

80
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,235
Am I supposed to do nothing

81
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,955
after a man put me through pain?

82
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,215
You saw what he did to me.

83
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,995
Be my witness before the police.

84
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,025
It'll be pointless.

85
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,361
Why, Mom? Are you afraid of him?

86
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,560
- Uh...
- Mom?

87
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Mom.

88
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,240
Are you hiding something from me?

89
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,860
If you're not afraid
and feel you must do something,

90
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,776
you can go alone.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,975
Fine.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,209
If you don't help me,
I'll go there myself.

"To serve and protect people"

108
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:32,208
I'll get you thrown in jail.
You'll see.

109
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:35,035
Anybody there?

110
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,660
Anybody?

111
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:48,575
Why are you here at this hour?

112
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,775
There's been an incident.

113
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Come up here.

114
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,105
So, Khun Phra Bamroekrung's slaves

115
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:59,525
tossed you down the ground
at his residence.

116
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,550
Yeah.

117
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,880
And your leg was broken, huh?

118
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,730
Yeah.

119
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,675
I bet this drunkard
tripped down some stairs.

120
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,135
And he's pinning it on someone.

121
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,370
Of all Suwanthanians,
he picked Khun Phra,

122
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,069
as big as they come.

123
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,041
All I said was the truth,
not an ounce of lie.

124
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,905
Every word you said reeked of alcohol.

125
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,048
Heh...hardly a word of truth.

126
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,355
You're accusing
Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

127
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,795
If he is made aware of this,

128
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,540
you'll be in trouble.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,635
You best go home.

130
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,060
We'll forget about this

131
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,595
on account of you being
as drunk as a silly goose.

132
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,799
My head is clear.

133
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,345
That's what all drunkards say.

134
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,500
Get lost, will ya?

135
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,215
We have priorities.

136
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,795
No time for your trifle.

137
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,015
Don't you know your duties?

138
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,348
Protect the honest
and fight the corrupt. Right?

139
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,815
I'm but a commoner,
not of a privileged family.

140
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,255
I got nothing to
grease your palms with,

141
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,750
so now you look down on me?

142
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,675
Hey.

143
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,245
Verbal harassment
on police officers.

144
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,945
All you do is accusing him
and not a shred of evidence.

145
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,785
See?

146
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,335
Here's your evidence.
My leg.

147
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Don't you know?

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,122
We receive hundreds
of incidences daily.

149
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,875
We must respond
even if they're fake.

150
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,955
If you can't see clearly,
there are two officers.

151
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,867
Lots of work for peanuts.

152
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,235
A badge doesn't pay the bills.

153
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,225
You dread him
just because he outranks you.

154
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,814
Tucking your tails?

155
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,545
How about a slammer, big mouth?

156
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,160
Don't you know your place?

157
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,405
I thought he'd smack you.

158
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,746
I thought so.

159
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,380
Your hand shaking?

160
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,570
Not me, fool.

161
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,967
He took the chair.

162
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,370
"To serve and protect people"

163
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,255
- Hey.
- Stop it.

164
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,695
Stop. Whatcha doing?

165
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,515
To serve and protect people?

166
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,560
Hey, no.

167
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,960
Cheap scrap to mask
the deceit behind badges.

168
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,345
"Violence should never be imitated."

169
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,210
Help. Help.

170
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,375
Police brutality.

171
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,790
My leg.

172
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,395
"Violence should never be imitated."

173
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,420
Ugh.

174
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,930
- Let me go.
- Get in there, punk.

175
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,850
Let me go.

176
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,137
Why put me in here?
I did nothing wrong.

177
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,055
Khun Phra wronged me.
Arrest him.

178
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,160
Let go.

179
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
And relax.

180
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,665
Stay put and cool off, you crazy.

181
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,455
You are crazy.
You've locked up an innocent man.

182
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,591
Where're you going?

183
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,416
Let me out of here.

184
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,935
I learned that

185
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,410
the police wouldn't dare touch him.

186
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,515
If men of law are yellow,

187
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,940
I'll paint the town red myself.

188
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,185
For the next lot,
you can produce as discussed.

189
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:25,058
The more liquor,
the merrier for Suwanthanians.

190
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,455
Of course.

191
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,600
Good night, sir.

192
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,840
Do it fast.

193
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,395
No room for slow movers
in this business.

194
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,105
Fierce competition.

195
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,725
Okay?

196
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,760
There's quick rewards for you.

197
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,570
Good luck.

198
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:42,728
Hey.

199
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,220
What the...

200
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,545
Sangthong. Sangthong.

201
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,650
Yes, sir.

202
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,400
At your ser...

203
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,425
Hey, whoa. What's that?

204
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,555
You tell me.

205
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,905
Throw that rotten thing out.

206
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,360
Quick. Pick it up.

207
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,360
Quick, I said. It stinks.

208
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,930
How did it fall down here?

209
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,320
What're they doing
around my rickshaw?

210
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,545
Sangthong.

211
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,428
Tell them to step back
before they tarnish the finish.

212
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,580
Yes, sir.

213
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,083
Listen up, people.

214
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,955
Got nothing else to do?

215
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,305
It's not a public exhibit.

216
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,275
Watch out before you smudge
the paint job.

217
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,907
Keep distance or get lost.

218
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,030
Scram.

219
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,487
Put a motor on it, rubbernecks.

220
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,460
This rickshaw...

221
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,650
pulls...

222
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,340
- Khun Phra.
- Yeah?

223
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,830
What's up?

224
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,275
Hmm?

225
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,575
This rickshaw pulls a dog.

226
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,455
That's you, sir.

227
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,035
Shut up. I already know.

228
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,975
- Afraid you couldn't read.
- Of course, I could.

229
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,180
"This rickshaw pulls a dog."

230
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,834
Still going to the brothel, sir?

231
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,304
No, not in the mood, now.

232
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,240
You know how hard to brush
the stain off that rickshaw?

233
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Yeah.

234
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,135
Phi Sangthong, help me.

235
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,010
Shh, shh, shh.

236
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,555
We're in the middle of
getting a confession, Kratai.

237
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,120
But it's a big deal.

238
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,035
Shh. Go away.

239
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,450
Waving me off again. Fine.

240
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,075
Hey, still wanna hear my story?

241
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,430
Of course.

242
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,080
- Kratai came, didn't she?
- Yeah.

243
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,187
Go on, sir.

244
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:41,050
"Treacherous Bamroekrung"

245
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Sangthong.

246
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,370
- Sangthong.
- Here, sir.

247
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,285
Get the police.

248
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,775
Come again, sir?

249
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,290
Bring me the police.

250
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,615
For what purpose, sir?

251
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,045
Because I want them.
Didn't you see what's outside?

252
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,780
Whoever did it wants to
besmirch my good name.

253
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,475
- Right away, sir.
- Don't ask. Just go.

254
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,745
Get them.

255
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,995
Insolence!
What fool pulled this stunt?

256
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,020
Blast!

257
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,731
Collect all traces
of evidence thoroughly.

258
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,464
I'll get the testimony.

259
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,695
So, who did it?

260
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,035
We're gathering the evidence.

261
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,545
When will you know?

262
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,900
It'll take a little time, for...

263
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,500
I asked when you will know.

264
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,085
I'll talk to my officers.

265
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,110
Hurry up.

266
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,450
Uh.

267
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,985
Please, sir. Keep your bearing.

268
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,450
I'll make this my top priority

269
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,925
to appease you.

270
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,230
But...

271
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:04,425
I must inquire
if you suspect anybody, sir.

272
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,915
If I had,

273
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,410
would I have summoned you?

274
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,705
You're the police.

275
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,425
Isn't it your job?

276
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,881
Understood, sir.

277
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,392
I recall someone
who vilified your name, sir.

278
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:22,022
Anybody there?

279
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,505
Why are you here at this hour?

280
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,225
There's been an incident.

281
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,505
Let me go.

282
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,400
Why put me in here?
I did nothing wrong.

283
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,395
Khun Phra wronged me.
Arrest him.

284
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
Who was he?

285
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,195
Thongphiphop, sir.

286
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,649
He runs his farm
and a liquor shop from his home.

287
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,585
All this was his doing?

288
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,355
Just a suspect, sir.

289
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,285
Must be his revenge
for when I threw him out.

290
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:01,730
Oh...no wonder he reported
you caused his injury.

291
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,135
So what if I did?
Would you dare pursue me?

292
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,050
I outrank you.
Know your place.

293
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,115
Perhaps, it's your queue, sir.

294
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,375
Fools, shut your blowhorn

295
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,995
before you got me sacked.

296
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Alright.

297
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,595
Forget the whole thing.

298
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,315
I rescind my report.

299
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,595
Oh, uhm.

300
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,625
Won't you pursue him?

301
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,650
Hrr.

302
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,945
My patience wears thinner
than your process.

303
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,660
What will you do, sir?

304
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,352
Wanna walk out?

305
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:38,345
Or get kicked out?

306
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,067
We bid you good day then.

307
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,655
Go on. Git.

308
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,185
Get outta here.

309
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,790
- That way, sir.
- Yeah, yeah.

310
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:50,964
Let's go.

311
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,611
Sangthong.

312
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,138
Clean it good or get whooped.

313
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,490
Yes, sir.

314
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,700
Go on. Seize all bootleg liquor.

315
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
What's this?

316
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,805
A closure order
and bootleg liquor confiscation.

317
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,815
I did nothing illegal.

318
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,545
I never advertised or overproduced.

319
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,445
I just follow orders.
You may appeal to the officials.

320
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,795
This is wrong.

321
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,855
There was no investigation,

322
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,875
nor was my argument heard.

323
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,014
This order was unjust.

324
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,517
The order was just

325
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,385
- so was it duly.
- So, it's you.

326
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,175
The order was just
because I said so.

327
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,785
You, scoundrel.

328
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,355
Says the man who kept harassing me.

329
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,142
Rotten animal. Slanderous graffiti.

330
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,855
Have you the evidence?

331
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,350
None that proves you did it.

332
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,075
But if I want one, I can make it up.

333
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,190
And when I do,
you'll answer to the law.

334
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,210
But you won't be judged,
for I am its hand.

335
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,672
I thought you were just despicable.

336
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,785
You really are...evil.

337
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,740
- Hmph.

338
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,530
Hey.

339
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,840
All you can do is curse me.

340
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,115
But not much else.

341
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,573
Get this in your head.

342
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,865
My words are
sacred as scripture.

343
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,825
Your fate in prison

344
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,105
or even death

345
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,290
is all up to me.

346
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,735
If you believe
fate is what you make,

347
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,665
you're unhinged.

348
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,155
You got diddly.

349
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,665
No name, no power, no worth.

350
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,665
Swaggering fool.

351
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,495
Always taunting people
with your untouchable name.

352
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,855
You were born into it,
not made of it.

353
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,890
Jealousy runs deep.

354
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,575
No one chooses where they're born.

355
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,695
But with great power, you chose ill.

356
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,415
Stop it.

357
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,675
A shutdown and nothing more.
Appreciate that.

358
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,775
But if you persist,

359
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,400
one word from me

360
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,655
will snuff the life out of you.

361
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,469
- Leaving you with nothing.
- You...

362
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Pfft.

363
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,705
Carry on. Take them all.

364
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,730
Do it.

365
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,380
Stop it.

366
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,800
Let go of me.

367
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,580
Stop it.

368
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,655
He broke my leg,
shut down my business,

369
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,040
and threatened my life.

370
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,675
Are we supposed to stand idly by?

371
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,995
You want to keep your badge?

372
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,140
If so, use prudence.

373
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,015
How wise you are, Muen Int.

374
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,065
No hope for this crooked town.

375
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,767
Good men break, then burn.

376
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,370
Should anyone die,
make it him, not me.

377
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,010
Oh, yeah.
Here comes the murder weapon.

378
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:13,195
And here comes my rope.

379
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,900
- Bring rope to a gunfight?
- Ow.

380
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,855
Save it.

381
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,440
Uhm...continue your story, sir.

382
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,980
"Climax"
It's reaching its climax.

383
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Go on.

384
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,293
After I got a gun,
I waited for the waning moon.

385
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,120
What's that gun for?

386
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,170
Son, where did you get it?

387
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,744
He slammed me against the wall.

388
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,749
If I don't fight back,
I'm nothing but a barking dog.

389
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,964
If he's dead,
no one else will suffer as I did.

390
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,115
Calm down.

391
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,745
Whom did you have a fight with?

392
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,945
Khun Phra Bamroekrung, of course.
I'm gonna kill him.

393
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,345
No, don't you do that to Khun Phra.

394
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,555
Don't call him by the title.

395
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,811
A man like him deserves none.

396
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,635
Son, if you kill him,
you'll go to prison.

397
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:21,945
So what?

398
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,295
Don't do it.

399
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,570
- Mom. Let go.
- No, I won't allow it.

400
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,250
- Let go, Mom.
- You let go. I won't.

401
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,780
- I said let go.
- Argh.

402
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,880
Khun Phra is your father.

403
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,340
Put him down.

404
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,360
Toss him out of my house.

405
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Hey.

406
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,515
Watch where you're going.
Got my clothes filthy.

407
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,615
But if you persist,

408
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,361
one word from me

409
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,660
will snuff the life out of you

410
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,440
What did you just say, Mom?

411
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,040
Why have you kept it from me?

412
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,354
I can raise you alone.

413
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,535
We've been doing fine.

414
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,495
Khun Phra should never know.

415
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,440
Will you stop calling him Khun Phra?

416
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,825
Do not destroy him.
He is your father, no matter what.

417
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,971
He deserted you.
Why are you protecting him?

418
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,067
I was a slave.

419
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,100
Khun Phra was an elite.

420
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,235
Even a glance from him blessed
my lowly existence.

421
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,345
Don't breathe a word of this
to anyone.

422
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,364
And don't tarnish his name.

423
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,095
Let him be and let us move on.

424
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,695
If we can't sell liquor,
we can do something else.

425
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,422
Don't sin,
and karma shall not seek you.

426
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,370
I put no faith in karma.

427
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,975
The guilty have never
answered for their sins,

428
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,335
yet they flourish with power.

429
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
They must have.

430
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,455
It's a matter of time.

431
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,880
He will answer for his sins.

432
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,785
But you must listen.

433
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,855
Listen to my plea.

434
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,015
Don't harm him.

435
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,495
Please?

436
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,195
Let him be. I ask of you.

437
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,243
Please.

438
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:56,640
- Mom.
- Please listen.

439
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,185
Stop doing this.

440
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,768
My whole life, I've lived
with your lie.

441
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,095
From now on,

442
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,740
I won't listen to you.

443
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,435
I won't wait
till he answers to his sins.

444
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,375
I'll make him do it.

445
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,760
His life ends with me.

446
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,185
Mom. Mom.

447
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,295
Mom. Mom.

448
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,535
I'm sorry.

449
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,975
Mom. Mom.

450
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,555
Can you hear me?

451
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,265
Mom, I'm so sorry.

452
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,520
I love you, Mom.

453
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,225
My life was marred by a selfish man.

454
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,395
He's not meant to be a father,
let alone a husband.

455
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,465
Life's got nothing good left for him

456
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,480
except the death I'm bringing.

457
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,680
"One day before Khun Phra's death"

458
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,155
Hey, hey.

459
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,820
Don't come close. I'm scared.

460
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,562
I'm here to apologize
for the wrongs I did.

461
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:34,018
What now?

462
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,625
Please forgive me.
What I did was wrong.

463
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,354
I clearly see it now.

464
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
At last.

465
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,602
You recognize your place and mine.

466
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,475
I do, sir.

467
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,825
I possess no status nor power,

468
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,830
unlike your imposing prestige.

469
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,889
I beg your forgiveness
and swear my undying obedience.

470
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,881
Very well.

471
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,675
But I can't accept your apology
so suddenly like this.

472
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,368
You invaded my house,

473
00:29:18,393 --> 00:29:20,720
frightened me,
and almost cut my hand off.

474
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,450
Please, sir.

475
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,801
Anything to make it up to you.
Name it.

476
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,347
Anything?

477
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,464
Yes, anything.

478
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,601
Well, how about your life?

479
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,635
It's worth nothing
to someone like you.

480
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,060
But my liquors are beyond price.

481
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,623
Suwanthani's finest is
what I can offer you.

482
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,905
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,250
You name it, sir.
It'll appear before you.

484
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,915
You'll love it at your wedding.

485
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,385
That way...

486
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,450
not one cowrie
shall leave your pocket.

487
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,995
With such generosity,

488
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,135
I might grant you redemption.

489
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,515
Really, sir?

490
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:30,235
Of course, my word is my bond.

491
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,840
Don't forget your offer.

492
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,345
Thank you, sir.

493
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,970
I am graced by your magnificence.

494
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,850
"Two hours before Khun Phra's death"

495
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,890
This is the end, Khun Phra.

496
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,300
Thank you, sir.

497
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,850
Khun Phra, sir.

498
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Hmm?

499
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,335
The finest spirits in all of
Suwanthani, as I told you.

500
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Finest, you say?

501
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,690
- Indeed, sir.
- Excellent.

502
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,700
Hmm.

503
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,650
- Very good.
- More, sir?

504
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,340
May I?

505
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,380
I'll fetch you a fresh one.

506
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,900
Rich flavor.

507
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,795
One more, sir?

508
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,135
That's all.
I might lose my footing.

509
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,375
Much obliged.

510
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
I'm open.

511
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,835
Did you really kill your father?

512
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,825
Hmm?

513
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,955
- Why did you do it? Why?
- Mom.

514
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,335
- How could you? Your father.
- Mom. Listen.

515
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,945
I didn't kill him.

516
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,250
I did not poison him.

517
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,530
Mom. Mom.

518
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,055
Sangthong, now's the time.
Catch him.

519
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,625
Time? You don't know the time.

520
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,595
Of course I do.

521
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,960
Around midnight.

522
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,995
I meant the time to use tact.

523
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,440
Hurry. Come on.

524
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,740
Don't hurt me, okay?

525
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,770
Mom. Mom.

526
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Can you hear me?

527
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:35,717
She won't wake up that easily.

528
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,975
What am I supposed to do?

529
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,875
I upped and ran. No medicine.

530
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,933
Oh. Should've told me sooner.

531
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,520
Just a sec.

532
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,530
Smelling salts.

533
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,795
I lend it to you free of charge.
I stole it.

534
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,290
Just wake her up.

535
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Take it.

536
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,770
For your mom.

537
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,160
Your mom. Mom.

538
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,625
- Sangthong.
- Hmm?

539
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,995
What are we to do now?

540
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,915
Should we capture him
with his guards down?

541
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,715
How could you think of that
at a time like this?

542
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,305
His mom is unconscious. Look.

543
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,155
Well, that's his mom.

544
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,665
We came to capture him.

545
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,695
It's now or never to save our humps.

546
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,555
Hey, we can catch him later.

547
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,895
Think about it.

548
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,980
A criminal got sick.

549
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,740
The doctor would still treat him.

550
00:34:50,704 --> 00:34:55,131
Doctors care for the sick,
but none care for us.

551
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,865
And what if he got away?

552
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,203
Then what? We'll be in trouble.

553
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,875
What is nobler?
Order or mercy.

554
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,538
That is the question.

555
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,450
- Hrr.
- Oh, hey.

556
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,530
Let's shoot for it.

557
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,335
The winner talks, and the loser walks.

558
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,755
- It's on, buddy.
- Yeah, yeah.

559
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,105
Think you'll win?

560
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,520
- Just shoot.
- Okay.

561
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,825
- Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- Rock-Paper-Scissors.

562
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:33,850
Mom.

563
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,380
Mom, be careful.

564
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,450
Paper beats rock.

565
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,363
Mom, are you okay?
Sorry for what I put you through.

566
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,955
I'm a horrible son.
Punish me.

567
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,535
Slap me. Do it, Mom.

568
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,575
I'm not doing that.

569
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,509
That makes me even more ill.

570
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,960
Listen, Mom.

571
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,065
No poison. I didn't use it.

572
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,635
I didn't kill Khun Phra.

573
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:08,934
What did you put in the pitcher?

574
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,678
An herb.

575
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,346
To stop him
from ruining other people.

576
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:19,426
But it did kill your father.

577
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,060
Death wasn't my intention.

578
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,678
Just impotence.

579
00:36:26,165 --> 00:36:27,289
- Impotence?
- Impotence?

580
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,570
Yeah.

581
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,335
I put an herb in the pitcher.

582
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,573
According to the seller,
a small amount numbs the pain.

583
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,956
Overdose causes impotence.

584
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,675
I wanted Khun Phra
to stop ruining people's lives

585
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,537
as he did ours.

586
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,535
Twist after twist...after twist.

587
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,875
So who killed Khun Phra?
I'm lost, now.

588
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
Me too.

589
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,659
If not you, then who?

590
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,399
How the heck should I know?
I was frightened just as you were.

591
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,043
- Take him to execution.
- Oh, no.

592
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,065
What about these two?

593
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,810
- I'll deal with them.
- Run. Fast.

594
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,320
He's dead.

595
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,100
He's dead.

596
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:49,415
Didn't you actually kill
Khun Phra Bamroekrung?

597
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,920
I can hardly believe it.

598
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,575
Who's the murderer?

599
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,415
Will you tell me once and for all?

600
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,755
What I said was the truth.
No matter when or to whom I say it.

601
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,655
Wait a minute.

602
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,585
The gun you bought.

603
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,107
Where is it?

604
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,800
I threw it away.

605
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,990
The man's dead.
What's the gun for?

606
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,420
I beg to differ.
That's suspicious.

607
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,025
That's it.

608
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,015
You threw the murder weapon
and ran with your mom.

609
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Did you say all that to soften us?

610
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,675
Yeah?

611
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,843
Don't be ridiculous.
I just don't want to remain here.

612
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,553
This town?

613
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:50,895
Blessed with resources, trades,
and everything to keep us safe.

614
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,762
What's so bad about it?

615
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,569
I'm done playing blind
and being exploited.

616
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,364
Alright.

617
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:03,615
I'll take you somewhere better.

618
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,785
Every town has its own troubles.

619
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,495
You judged this town's flaws
by the virtues of another.

620
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,274
Of course, you'd find
paradise elsewhere.

621
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,236
Whatever virtue you see in this town
can be even better.

622
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,533
Why settle for what is
or what has been?

623
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
You know what?

624
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:30,922
I want the best for what is,
and better.

625
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,415
You are free to go.

626
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,480
I'll be here until the day I die.

627
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,225
Mom.

628
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,475
Cut, cut. Don't get so dramatic.

629
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,855
Alright, nobody goes anywhere.

630
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,380
Maiphlong, step in their way.

631
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:47,939
Step aside.

632
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,145
Step we must.

633
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,955
So long as you can't prove your innocence,

634
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,160
Thongbai remains a goat...

635
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,985
Hey?

636
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,855
Scapegoat, I mean.

637
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,631
What goat?
Now what?

638
00:40:00,861 --> 00:40:01,861
Let me think.

639
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:06,610
Phi Sangthong, you wanna listen
to me while thinking?

640
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,655
Hey.

641
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,425
I told you to go away.

642
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,595
Phi Thongbai is swarmed
by the police at the temple.

643
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,335
Huh? Why didn't you say so, Kratai?

644
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,735
I tried many times,
but you told me to get lost.

645
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,895
Whom do you keep talking to many times?

646
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,025
None of your business.

647
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,595
You...stay put.

648
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,295
- I don't take your order.
- Not an order.

649
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,555
I suggest you don't abandon her.

650
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,420
She'll carry the weight
of your suspicion alone.

651
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,815
We must hurry. Thongbai needs us.

652
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,108
Come on.

653
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,250
Strangely quiet.

654
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,850
Kratai said Thongbai was here.

655
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:03,235
Hey, did they capture him?

656
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,826
Oh, no. My buddy.

657
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,035
- Thongbai. Are you here?
- Thongbai.

658
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,995
Where are you?

659
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,785
I'm here.

660
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,810
Hey, hey.

661
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,130
Here.

662
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,745
Behind the Buddha.

663
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,428
- Where? Thongbai.
- Thongbai.

664
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,535
Thongbai.

665
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
Thongbai.

666
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,315
I am here.

667
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,705
Where here?

668
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:38,225
Here, as in down here.
Listen to my voice.

669
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,440
- Where is he?
- Down.

670
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,030
Where're you looking?

671
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,050
Down here beneath
the Reclining Buddha.

672
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,970
Hey.

673
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,460
Whatchu doing there?

674
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,890
Ouch. My stomachache.

675
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,443
Maiphlong. You.

676
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,320
Ang Yi. Why are they here?

677
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,155
They can't find me here.

678
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,450
Gotta hide.

679
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
There?

680
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,940
Muen Int. Why's he here, too?

681
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,495
Rut. Rit.

682
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,705
You two stand guard over there
in case they got cute.

683
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,730
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

684
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,396
Muen Int and Ang Yi
are here to get me?

685
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,330
This is it for me.

686
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,040
I need a good hiding spot.

687
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,155
They could be out there.

688
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,585
Track back?

689
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,355
Bad idea.

690
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,560
Out this door, then.

691
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,960
Oh, no.

692
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,370
They're approaching.

693
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,915
Oh, no. I'm toast.

694
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,020
What should I do?

695
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,945
Not that way. Not this way.

696
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,395
There's no way out.

697
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,305
Phi Thongbai.

698
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:39,330
Yoo-hoo.

699
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,495
Should I climb up?

700
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,985
Couldn't he see me?

701
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,575
Oh, no. This is it.

702
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,135
Phi Thongbai.

703
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,480
Down there.

704
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,220
Down, down. Just look down.

705
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,425
Down. Beneath the statue.

706
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:59,656
Is this the end?
Are they gonna catch me?

707
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,000
Hrr...he can't hear
even if I'm yelling.

708
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,820
I must fetch Phi Sangthong.

709
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,555
The Dhamma is my fortress.

710
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,760
Bless me, the Buddha.

711
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,435
- Come out. They're gone.
- No...

712
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,943
You like it in there? Come on out.

713
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,530
No...

714
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,785
No, I can't come out.
I'm stuck.

715
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:51,995
Oh.

716
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,020
Alright.

717
00:44:54,106 --> 00:44:57,055
You just got it? Pull me out.

718
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,080
Hang on.

719
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,170
Hurry.

720
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,620
Hold your breath. On three, okay?

721
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,240
Three.

722
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,980
Didn't you say, "On three"?

723
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,500
We skipped to three to save us time.

724
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,675
So, stand up.

725
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,475
I doubt that.

726
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,770
Pulling me out like that
must have messed up the nerves.

727
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:30,920
I can't feel my legs.

728
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,920
You think?

729
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,320
Numb.

730
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,075
He didn't see me,
yet he found the spot by chance.

731
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,140
Heh.

732
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,680
Thongphiphop

733
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,860
"Khun Phra, Thongphiphop, son."

734
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,690
is the son of Khun Phra.

735
00:45:52,121 --> 00:45:54,887
Is that true? What's going on?

736
00:45:56,746 --> 00:45:57,746
You got me...

737
00:45:59,010 --> 00:45:59,905
totally baffled.

738
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,385
Baffled, huh?

739
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,265
Because I can't read it.

740
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,105
You know we both can't read.

741
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,180
Show-off.

742
00:46:08,261 --> 00:46:09,905
Now, we have two suspects.

743
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,855
Thongphiphop
and Khun Bamrungnakon.

744
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,025
We must find out who the murderer is

745
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,450
before the police find Thongbai.

746
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:22,780
Not two.

747
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,075
Huh?

748
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,450
What are you saying?

749
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:35,755
The suspects, not just two,
but three.

750
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:39,854
Three? Who else?

751
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:45,860
Him.

752
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,810
Huen. (Thai for sex pervert)

753
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,967
Huen? How could you
think about sex now?

754
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:54,055
- I wrote Huen?
- Yeah.

755
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,995
I wanted to write Muen.
Guess I missed it.

756
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,020
Muen?

757
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,460
Muen who?

758
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,970
Muen Int. Our third suspect.

759
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,700
Hiding underneath the Buddha statue,

760
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,334
I overheard a juicy bit.

761
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,220
What have you got to say?

762
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:38,700
A little something to appease you.

763
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,880
This isn't enough.

764
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,138
I want three times more.

765
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,105
Three times? That's not a cut.
It's a shakedown.

766
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,705
Hey.

767
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,305
Missed the news?

768
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:20,835
The ruling officials reinforced
audit measures this year.

769
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,615
It's harder for me to keep the heat off,

770
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,625
meaning you gotta keep me happier.

771
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,260
Can't you do it?

772
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:35,443
Or have you what it takes
to do times?

773
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:39,450
Hey.

774
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,870
Is that a threat?

775
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:48,455
What you're doing is
downright extortion.

776
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,575
You should be grateful

777
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,255
that I made the law in this town
look the other way.

778
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,749
But instead,
you're threatening me.

779
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,740
We sacrificed for what we have,

780
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,259
but you only know how to take it.

781
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,505
Watch my lips.

782
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:12,905
I don't give diddly-squat
about you, Ang Yi.

783
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:13,695
Pfft.

784
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,834
- Dead meat.
- Come on.

785
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,860
Heh.

786
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,465
Do you know

787
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,212
what took the life

788
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,850
of Khun Phra Bamroekrung?

789
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,900
Bang!

790
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,303
Bang!

791
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:36,810
Bang!

792
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:45,715
From here on out,

793
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,785
I own Suwanthani.

794
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:55,446
Cross me and you are
as dead as Khun Phra.

795
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,130
My head hurts.

796
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,985
Why do suspects keep popping up?

797
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,095
Yeah.

798
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,460
I say everybody was motivated
to kill Khun Phra.

799
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,185
Here you are in God's embrace.

800
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,570
A holy ground.

801
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,065
You are safe in God's arms.

802
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:54,835
Men like Khun Phra will be punished
when the final judgment falls.

803
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,790
Ma'am killed Khun Phra?
