This show is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to actual persons,

00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,650
living or dead, or real events
is purely coincidental and

not intended to offend any person,

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,300
Khun Phra Bamroekrung
came to propose marriage

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,180
to you, Nuanlaor.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,940
Tada.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,840
Welcome home, Nuanlaor.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,920
Since we'll soon be
husband and wife,

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,200
You do not lay your hands on me.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,510
Why not?

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,390
- Let me have one.
- No. Get back.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,880
Found it.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,110
Oh, dear.

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,830
I've confessed. Now, arrest me.

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,260
Arrest me.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,650
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,310
Everything I've said is true.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,650
I've kept it for far too long.

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,880
Now, I'm here to face punishment.

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Let Thongbai go.

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,940
Here comes your punishment.

22
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,170
Champi.

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,270
Champi.

24
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,430
Champi.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,970
Champi.

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,340
Why did you kill the one I loved?

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,730
One he loved?

28
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,580

"Mystery of the Deadly Sins"

42
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,270
Why must you wrench my heart away?

43
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,380
Ugh.

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,920
What gave you the right, Nuanlaor?

45
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,770
Oh, hey, hey.

46
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,060
Are you all right?

47
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,830
Can you stand, Nakorn?

48
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,030
I'm alright.

49
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,420
I wasn't used to a new rickshaw.

50
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,050
I thought you were shy
about your new title.

51
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,550
Right, Khun Phra?

52
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,270
Stop teasing me.

53
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,080
You're a Khun Phra, too.

54
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,050
Hey...seeing you like this,

55
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,210
I want to pinch your cheeks.

56
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,310
Heh.

57
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,450
Nonsense.

58
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,360
His Majesty is expecting.

59
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,560
It was one-sided love.

60
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,800
But I never regretted it.

61
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,650
He was such a vile person.

62
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,030
Haven't you heard?

63
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,530
Love...

64
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,390
Love knows no reason.

65
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,850
No matter how cruel he treated me,

66
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,910
I was willing to forgive him.

67
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,980
My mind struggled to leave him.

68
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,080
- Hahaha.
- Heh.

69
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,960
"Love poem for
Khun Phra Bamroekrung, My Dear."

70
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,560
But my heart dictated surrender.

71
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,170
Pain was love's cruel gift

72
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,300
only for hearts to endure.

73
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,750
Blast it.

74
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,200
Then it dawned on me.

75
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,050
If I love someone,

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,950
I must love them for who they are.

77
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,410
Until...

78
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,830
they are no more.

79
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,310
Nothing to hold on to.

80
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,700
Everyone deserves justice.

81
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,720
And Khun Phra was...

82
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,960
Was what, sir?

83
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,100
My dear friend.
He deserves justice, too.

84
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,470
Dear

85
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,430
friend?

86
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,340
Now, I understand that.

87
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,300
You don't deserve to live, Nuanlaor.

88
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,800
Hold on, Khun.

89
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,890
You two, restrain him.

90
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,890
Nuanlaor!

91
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,840
- Let me do it.
- Halt.

92
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,450
I'll do it. Let me do it.

93
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,480
Champi. Get out of here.

94
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,340
Do you want to be executed, too?

95
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,930
Champi.

96
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,850
The one to be executed

97
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,040
is me.

98
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,620
Champi.

99
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,930
I was the one who shot Khun Phra.

100
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,730
Huh?

101
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,650
My head is spinning.

102
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,730
My mind just melted.

103
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,650
Champi.

104
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,500
Why take the fall for me?

105
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,800
Milady.

106
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,500
It's all over here and now.

107
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,190
I'll tell the truth.

108
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,320
I've served my lady
since we were children.

109
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,910
Lady Nuanlaor.

110
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,860
What have you been doing?
Why are you so dirty?

111
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,060
I climbed trees to pick rose apples.

112
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,870
My lady always treated me
like a friend,

113
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,120
never as a servant.

114
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,050
We double the taste this way.

115
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,920
Her kindness left
a lasting impression

116
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,770
on someone as lowly as me.

117
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,150
From now on, I'll look after
you, Nuanlaor.

118
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,990
After that,

119
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,670
my lady moved into the palace
with Lady Rampueng.

120
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,330
Here, this is for you.

121
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,460
What is this, my lady?

122
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,850
A welcome gift.

123
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,700
A caterpillar garland.

124
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,160
A caterpillar?

125
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,660
Like this.

126
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,090
- Wriggle, wriggle.
- Ew.

127
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,090
My lady, it is ticklish. Please, no.

128
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,230
Here, for you.

129
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,620
Thank you, my lady.

130
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,450
Tired from the trip?
I'll fetch you cool water.

131
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,490
- I'll do it myself.
- Stay there.

132
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,040
I was summoned to accompany her.

133
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,750
She became more than a master
but someone I devoted my loyalty to.

134
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,470
I don't want you to be married.

135
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,620
You're all I've got.

136
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,160
I'll be so lonely without you.

137
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,740
I understood how much my lady
loved Lady Rampueng.

138
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,510
After all, they were sisters.

139
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,260
But sometimes, when my lady
said she had no one left,

140
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,020
she never turned to look my way.

141
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,650
I had always been by her side,

142
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,870
serving her faithfully.

143
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,010
But it's alright.

144
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,120
Her kindness is more than enough

145
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,150
for someone like me.

146
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,410
I'm about to lose my love.

147
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,280
What are you talking about?
What love?

148
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,960
Phi Rampueng is about to
leave me and get married.

149
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,830
Your Grace, please settle down.

150
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,940
Even if she got married,

151
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,380
you won't be alone.

152
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,120
You've still got me.

153
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,600
I'll be with you
and never leave your side.

154
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,260
I can't believe that.

155
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,770
A man will take you away eventually.
I'll be lonely here.

156
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,690
No way.

157
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,900
I will never let you feel lonely.

158
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,890
You can't get rid of me either.
I'll serve you until I die.

159
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,410
That I swear.

160
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,070
Shall we go see the acrobatics show?

161
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,220
I meant every word I said.

162
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,900
I would never betray my lady.

163
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,500
She was practically
the only family I have.

164
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,370
No one will take
my lady away from me.

165
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,800
Oh?

166
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,640
Something is happening over there.

167
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,710
Shall we?

168
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,950
But the peels?

169
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,950
- Oh, no.
- Oh?

170
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,170
Hey, hey.

171
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,770
Are you hurt?

172
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,490
Uhm.

173
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,570
I'm alright.

174
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,150
Sorry for the trouble.

175
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,060
- Ouch.
- It's nothing.

176
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,130
Champi.

177
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,920
Are you alright?

178
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,210
Let me help.

179
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,850
Gently.

180
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,390
If Her Highness finds out
a man touched you,

181
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,270
you'll definitely be punished.

182
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,980
If I don't tell,
and you don't tell,

183
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,140
who will know?

184
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,380
Then came the day everything began,

185
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,500
the day my lady was betrothed.

186
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
My lady?

187
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,620
What's wrong?
Did Her Majesty scold you?

188
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,230
I hate her.
She forced me to get married.

189
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,230
To whom, my lady?

190
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,940
You've never met a man,
let alone a suitor.

191
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,090
That shameless Khun Phra

192
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,870
came to ask for my hand.

193
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,050
and Her Majesty agreed.

194
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,180
I knew she didn't want to marry.

195
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,420
As a servant,

196
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,970
I couldn't defy
Her Majesty's order.

197
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,050
All I could do was accept it,

198
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,410
as my heart bled for my lady.

199
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,710
Welcome home, Nuanlaor.

200
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,790
Since we'll soon be
husband and wife,

201
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,340
think of my home as your own.

202
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,270
But first,

203
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,680
prostrate yourself at my feet.

204
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,590
In this house, I rule.

205
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,460
How arrogant.

206
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,260
I will do that on the wedding day.

207
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,680
Unwillingly, of course.

208
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,200
This way, Champi.

209
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,330
Finished bathing, have you?

210
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Stand back.

211
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,940
I just bathed, too.
I wanted to see...

212
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,890
who smells better, you or me.

213
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,300
No, you can't do this.

214
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,420
Shut your mouth, servant.

215
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,710
Say one more word
and your back is raw from the lash.

216
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,950
Step off.

217
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,850
Step off.

218
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,910
Tch.

219
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,720
Hmph.

220
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Step closer, and you'll get it.
Do it.

221
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,810
Lunge.

222
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,460
Cool it.

223
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,180
Heh.

224
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,790
Flinch all you want.

225
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,900
In a few days, you'll be docile,

226
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,290
whispering, "Oh, honey baby."

227
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,450
Tsk.

228
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,980
His womanizing ways were well-known.

229
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,960
Watching him take liberties
with my lady

230
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,230
set my blood boiling.

231
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Champi.

232
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,960
Tonight, I'll be sleeping
with Phi Rampueng.

233
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,810
I only have a few days
left with her.

234
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,930
Yes, my lady.

235
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,960
Since you've already made the bed,

236
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,960
why don't you sleep in it tonight?

237
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,710
No sleeping on the floor.

238
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,410
Is that alright?

239
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,170
Why not?

240
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,300
At the palace, we often slept
in the same bed.

241
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,120
It was never a problem.

242
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,750
That was the palace.
This is Khun Phra's house.

243
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,270
It doesn't matter.

244
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,970
This room is ours now, understand?

245
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,330
Yes, my lady.

246
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,340
I'll go now.

247
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,090
- Get to bed.
- Yes, my lady.

248
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,450
Goodnight.

249
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,010
- Who the...!
- Oh? Hey.

250
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,320
Quiet.

251
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,850
Where's Nuanlaor?

252
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,220
Argh.

253
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,950
I said, Queit.

254
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,400
- You want this?
- Argh.

255
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,430
My lady is sleeping
with Lady Rampueng.

256
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,910
Please, just leave.

257
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,440
Please.

258
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,730
Don't do this to me.

259
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,360
Looking at you up close, I think...

260
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,550
you're not too bad.

261
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,800
Get off.

262
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,890
Hmph.

263
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,250
Be grateful

264
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,590
I even look at you.

265
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,870
Hmph.

266
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,550
Wanna be thrown out of my house?

267
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,600
Listen carefully.

268
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,530
You're a servant in my house

269
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,650
You must do whatever I want you to.

270
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,140
If not then pack up
and say goodbye to your lady.

271
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,640
Then you can rot in prison.

272
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,200
Don't think you won't end up there
when you did nothing wrong.

273
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,830
I am the hand of law,
the arm of authority.

274
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,570
I can put anyone in prison,

275
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,290
even your mistress.

276
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,710
If you make a sound,

277
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,790
you're dead.

278
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,740
Huh?

279
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,580
You should've made this fun.

280
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,340
Tch.

281
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
No.

282
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,430
Quiet.

283
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,710
Don't even think
about a word to anybody.

284
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,890
Every woman in this house
is mine anyway.

285
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,090
Even I was violated
and left broken by him.

286
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,600
I was too ashamed to tell anyone,

287
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,390
especially my lady.

288
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,320
He was the bane of humanity.

289
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,800
He deserved to die!

290
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,230
What shocked me even worse was

291
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,110
my lady also wanted to kill him.

292
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,640
But I couldn't let her
commit such a sin.

293
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,610
Nuanlaor! What are you doing?

294
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,970
- Ugh.
- Let go.

295
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,250
Nuanlaor.

296
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,980
Nuanlaor. You.

297
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,500
Why are you doing this?

298
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Huh?

299
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,810
In the chaos, we picked up
the wrong gun.

300
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,090
I had no choice but to let
Thongbai take the fall for it.

301
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,700
I didn't mean to.

302
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,040
But if I had confessed,

303
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,120
my lady would've been implicated.

304
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,510
Soon, I began to dread
the consequences.

305
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,370
So I threw the gun into the water
to destroy the evidence.

306
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,340
I was scared.

307
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,390
I was confused.

308
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,570
I didn't know what to do.

309
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,890
The days of fear haunted me.

310
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,770
The nights of terror tormented me.

311
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,270
Are you alright, Champi?

312
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,200
It's nothing, my lady.
Just a bad dream

313
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,420
Are you okay?

314
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,340
I'm fine.
Go back to sleep, my lady.

315
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,140
But in the end,

316
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,270
I couldn't bear the weight
of my guilt.

317
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,960
I decided to confess my sin.

318
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,590
My lady.

319
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,040
If I'm no longer with you one day,

320
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,360
please take good care of yourself.

321
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,280
What are you saying?

322
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,740
It's nothing, my lady.

323
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,150
It's just

324
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,550
hypothetically speaking.

325
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,690
Life is uncertain, after all.

326
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,560
Anything can happen.

327
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,900
It all started with me.

328
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,690
It should end with me.

329
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,240
It's all right, my lady.

330
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,720
My lady.

331
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,580
You must've known
what I wanted to do.

332
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,790
So, you came forward
to take the blame for me.

333
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,270
Stop now.

334
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,100
She confessed. Arrest her!

335
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,640
Take her to execution.

336
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,950
Muen Int.

337
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,960
Why standing there like a fool?

338
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,670
Arrest her.

339
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,090
Arrest her!

340
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
Khun, sir.

341
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,270
Get a hold of yourself. Calm down.

342
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,710
No execution shall be carried out
without royal command.

343
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,510
Guards.

344
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,550
Cage her at the execution ground
for all to see.

345
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,820
I'll return from the palace

346
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,700
with the execution order tomorrow.

347
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,840
Yes, sir.

348
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,780
Champi.

349
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,330
- Get up.
- No.

350
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,820
Don't do it.

351
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,050
Champi.

352
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,510
Execute her.

353
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,570
Walk.

354
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,840
Take her. Execute her.

355
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,780
- Hey, Thongbai is saved.
- Thongbai is saved.

356
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,270
Hey, Thongbai.

357
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,310
You're saved.

358
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,660
Oh, your hands are all red.

359
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,380
Hey, I'm saved.

360
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,770
Thongbai is innocent.

361
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,900
Hooray.

362
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,570
I'm free.

363
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,630
My buddy is a good man

364
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,860
and did not kill anybody.

365
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,910
Get that.

366
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,980
Ah? Speechless?

367
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,770
Cat got your tongue?

368
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,110
You, in the middle.
Weren't you boohooing?

369
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,700
Hmph...that Champi.

370
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,620
Bad servant!

371
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,360
- Yeah, bad Champi.
- Very bad.

372
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,730
Hey...stop cursing.

373
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,050
All you did was curse.

374
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,900
Didn't you have enough?

375
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,420
Tsk.

376
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,400
He's right.

377
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,410
Now that we're innocent.
No apology from you.

378
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,120
Not even feeling ashamed.

379
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,140
Tch.

380
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,500
Were you mistaken?
We were boohooing Champi.

381
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,850
Not you.

382
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,050
Ooh.

383
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,120
Recklessly spitting on people

384
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,770
even when you have no clue.

385
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,150
Yelling and cursing,
feeding on your own fury.

386
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,910
But when the truth is out,

387
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,210
do you look back and see

388
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:46,080
how shattered he might have been.

389
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,500
Yeah.

390
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,880
You.

391
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
All of you.

392
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,410
Ever stopped to think?

393
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,800
Ever tried to understand
how I felt?

394
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,060
Yeah, it's conscience.

395
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,770
Any conscience?

396
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,090
I can't believe this.

397
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,340
You mess up. But no apology.

398
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,980
Like those in power do it.

399
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,830
You think that makes it right?

400
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,570
Cowards.

401
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,770
But honestly, I was rooting
for Thongbai in secret.

402
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,900
I just didn't dare to speak up.

403
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,330
- Afraid of the backlash.
- Yes, yes.

404
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,960
Standing up for what's right

405
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,290
is never easy.

406
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,800
You're just a lowly slave.

407
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,310
You murderer.

408
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,040
Just die already.

409
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,220
A wicked slave

410
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,390
like you deserves to die.

411
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,270
You evil, vile creature.

412
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,440
Stop, stop. Enough.

413
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,150
Go home.

414
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,240
You're way too much into it.

415
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,910
She's so wicked.

416
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,450
Hrr.

417
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,680
Huh. Huh.

418
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,120
Ugh. Ugh.

419
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,550
Lady Nuanlaor.

420
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,370
Why are you here?

421
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,870
Some medicine for you.

422
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,040
To heal your wounds.

423
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,230
Actually,

424
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,780
you don't have to do this.

425
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,920
My wound doesn't need tending

426
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,050
as tomorrow, I will...

427
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,590
Talk nothing of tomorrow.

428
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,670
I'm so grateful to you, Champi,

429
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,980
for always taking care of me.

430
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,470
It was my greatest joy to serve you.

431
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,440
From now on,

432
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,040
I won't be around to serve you.

433
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,040
I hope you will

434
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,230
live the life you've always wanted,

435
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,300
free from anyone's control.

436
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,030
I'll strive for it.

437
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,690
My lady, please go back.

438
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,220
It's very dark now.

439
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,280
The damp, cold air
will make you sick.

440
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,270
Please go back.

441
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,910
Champi.

442
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,460
Sangthong.

443
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,880
Maiphlong.

444
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:14,900
Thongbai.

445
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,750
Am I seeing things, or is this real?

446
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,720
At least, you're toughing it out.

447
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,390
I'm glad to see you three.

448
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,090
Thongbai.

449
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,300
Thongbai.

450
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,310
Could I ask your forgiveness?

451
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,410
I cannot forgive you.

452
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,080
Make way.

453
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,770
An order from
the royal administration.

454
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,050
Execute the prisoner today.

455
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,380
Get the murderer out.

456
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,590
Carry on.

457
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,820
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

458
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,490
Hey.

459
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,490
Hey.

460
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,630
Check on her.

461
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,680
Not getting up.

462
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,070
Uh.

463
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,180
She's not breathing, sir.

464
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,360
What?

465
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,270
Champi is dead, sir.

466
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,320
Huh.

467
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:18,520
Choosing death
before facing justice?

468
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,020
Coward.

469
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,910
Fine.

470
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,240
You two, take her body
for the vultures.

471
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,370
Hurry, before it stinks.

472
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,950
- Quick.
- Yes, sir.

473
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,120
Grab that.

474
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,500
Hey, hey.

475
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,870
Hey, easy.

476
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,810
- Right here?
- Yeah, yeah.

477
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,630
Put it down.

478
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,860
Get the stick out.

479
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,610
- Huh.
- It stinks.

480
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,020
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

481
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,130
Champi.

482
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,570
It's me.

483
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,770
Champi.

484
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,450
Champi.

485
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,090
Champi.

486
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,750
Champi.

487
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,090
Champi.

488
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,540
Wake up.

489
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,510
Wake up.

490
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,580
Champi.

491
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,720
Champi.

492
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,120
Argh.

493
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,090
Champi.

494
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,350
Ugh. Ugh.

495
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,200
Champi.

496
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,430
You've woken up.

497
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,790
- Champi.
- Not too close, milady. I'm filthy.

498
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,640
So glad you're back.

499
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,890
See?

500
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,900
Told you it'd work.

501
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,910
Yeah.

502
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,720
I didn't say it wouldn't.

503
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Hey, buddies.

504
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,390
Here you go.

505
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,360
Time to celebrate.

506
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,280
Bananas.

507
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,340
A load of bananas to celebrate?

508
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,100
Whatever happens to a real feast?

509
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,810
What feast?
You think we can afford meat?

510
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,340
Besides,

511
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,780
no more sticky fingers.

512
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,950
Bananas will do.

513
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,670
Fine.

514
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,610
No more charming women
for food, too.

515
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,010
I can appreciate bananas.

516
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,180
Loving it.

517
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
I'm nuts about it.

518
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,450
One finger? You're overreacting.

519
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,340
I was facing execution,

520
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,760
but now I'm free.

521
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,940
One banana fills me with joy.

522
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,300
It's delicious.
Enjoy them, gents.

523
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,580
Let's dig in.

524
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,370
Hey.

525
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,270
Let's have banana toast.

526
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,640
Heh.

527
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,130
Here we go.

528
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,810
Three, two...

529
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,630
How's that?

530
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
The best.

531
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,480
I say this again.

532
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,380
I love you, gents.

533
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:58,880
Me too, buddy.

534
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,920
Me, too.

535
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,840
I can't help but feel sorry
for Champi, too.

536
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,930
Why do you feel sorry for her?

537
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,810
You almost died because of her.

538
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
It's true that

539
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,610
I almost died because of her.

540
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,120
But she shot Khun Phra

541
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,110
because of what he did, right?

542
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,810
Forcing Lady Nuanlaor to marry him.

543
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,380
Raping Champi.

544
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,660
And neglecting Lady Rampueng
and their child.

545
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,080
All that said,

546
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,550
he easily tops the chart

547
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,870
of the worst man ever.

548
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,090
Yeah.

549
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,500
I feel sorry for Champi, too.

550
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,440
She's a slave like us,

551
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,940
loyal and so protective
of her master.

552
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,050
She didn't mean to frame you.

553
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,500
But if she confessed,

554
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,980
Lady Nuanlaor would've
been implicated.

555
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,500
She had no choice.

556
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,290
Look.

557
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,230
I get why you two
feel sorry for her.

558
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,030
I feel bad for what Khun Phra
did to her, too.

559
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,730
But in the end,

560
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,440
Champi was the one who shot him.

561
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,980
It is a fact.

562
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,550
She did it for a reason.

563
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,700
I wish there was
a better way to judge her.

564
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,900
The voice of the accused
should be heard.

565
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,070
Let the arguments
or reasons be heard.

566
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,650
Not just rush into execution,

567
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,650
an eye for an eye, like this.

568
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,380
Think about it.

569
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,220
Thongbai almost died for nothing.

570
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,710
The gun fell into his hand.

571
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,500
Is that fair?

572
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,390
Of course not.

573
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,990
But what can we do?

574
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,680
Hmm?

575
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,140
Champi's going to be executed
no matter what.

576
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,530
Hard as we might,

577
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,250
slaves like us
can't change the system.

578
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,690
Hrr.

579
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,020
Life for life.

580
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,220
Is that what's right?

581
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,120
Champi's going to die
from protecting someone she loves.

582
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,560
What about Khun Phra?

583
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,760
If you asked me,

584
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,660
Khun Phra had sins enough
to warrant death.

585
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:51,170
But who has the final say
on which sin seals his fate?

586
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,730
Is that what justice is?

587
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,270
What say you?

588
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,800
Can you find a way

589
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,960
to make her fate less tragic?

590
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,340
Phi Sangthong.

591
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,370
Remember where we first met?

592
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,470
That place was full of knowledge.

593
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,540
What's in there could

594
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,820
"Second chance"
give her a second chance.

595
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,190
- Listen up.
- Hmm?

596
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,080
I have an idea.

597
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,300
- Come, come.
- Hold on.

598
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,700
No more prison.

599
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,880
Yeah. No prison.
Chop-chop.

600
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,100
Hey. Whatchu doing?

601
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,450
You're not helping.

602
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,830
Help how? I can't read.

603
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,840
Found it.

604
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,530
You found it?

605
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,320
The Butterfly Beast's
capturing Phra Aphai Mani.

606
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,400
Oy.

607
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,540
Come on, now.

608
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,600
We're here to research
medical texts, not literature.

609
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,270
Medi...cine.

610
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,450
M...O...R...

611
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,630
T...A...L.

612
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,270
Mortal's...

613
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,760
Ugh. I can't read well.

614
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,650
Phi Sangthong, help me with this.

615
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,050
Excuse me.

616
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,340
Found it?

617
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,430
Mortal's Repose.

618
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,180
Master Sithikariya took this formula

619
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,330
to slow the heartbeat

620
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,730
until the pulse
became undetectable.

621
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,750
Suitable for deep meditation.

622
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,770
This is it!

623
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,120
We found it. Great.

624
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,530
To be sure, bring the text.

625
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,940
- Let's go.
- Hey, wrong one.

626
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,230
- That one.
- Oh, okay.

627
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,880
Thongbai.

628
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,030
Could I ask your forgiveness?

629
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,060
I cannot forgive you.

630
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:58,730
Because

631
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,680
you will not be executed.

632
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,560
There's no stopping it.

633
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,840
Comes tomorrow,

634
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,370
I will face execution.

635
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,040
Unless, of course,

636
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,840
you die here and now.

637
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,120
The boat is approaching.

638
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,410
- Where are we going?
- To Phatcharaburi.

639
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,360
Phi Rampueng is waiting there.

640
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,230
We'll start a new life there.

641
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,500
Can you get up?

642
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,730
I'm so grateful to you
for saving us.

643
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:07,850
And...

644
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,940
Even though she has to flee now,

645
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,020
I believe that in the future,

646
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,550
Champi, you three,
and the rest of us

647
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,740
will stand as equals.

648
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,920
We understand that...

649
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,590
change won't happen overnight.

650
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:30,910
But in your words,
we are seen as equals.

651
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,950
That is an honor, my lady.

652
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,800
Keep this.

653
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,180
For me?

654
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,320
Mm-hmm.

655
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,390
Take it.

656
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,830
Am I worthy?

657
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,710
Come on.

658
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,120
It's a reward
for saving me and Champi.

659
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:13,730
And from now on,
since I won't be here anymore,

660
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,700
I grant you your freedom.

661
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,280
You no longer have to serve anyone.

662
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,790
Live your life.
Find happiness.

663
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,400
Thank you, my lady.

664
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:35,240
Uh, may I ask something?

665
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:38,470
Where you came from,
they have things like this?

666
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,130
It exists everywhere.

667
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,070
Power is like a double-edged sword.

668
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:48,690
What happened to you was
because those in power

669
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,080
abused it to oppress others.

670
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,200
When the powerless are wronged,

671
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,680
they have no one

672
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,340
to turn to for help.

673
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,710
Even if everyone has
access to justice,

674
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:07,170
once inside the system,
they're treated unequally,

675
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,800
forcing them to take matters
into their own hands.

676
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:13,980
If we perceive each other as equals,

677
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,670
things like this will not happen.

678
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,100
That's true.
But will that day come?

679
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,440
It may never arrive.

680
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,050
I think not.

681
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,720
I believe our efforts

682
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:31,200
and demand for our rights

683
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:34,480
will lead to the day

684
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,740
when we're all equals.

685
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,230
Yeah.

686
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,440
I never stood up against power.

687
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:45,030
But I've realized we're all equals.

688
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,130
At least, we slave no more.

689
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,170
Hooray.

690
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,390
Woo-hoo.

691
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,320
Thank you so much.

692
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:57,980
Thank you, my lady.

693
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,520
Better hurry before someone sees us.

694
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,370
Champi.

695
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,270
I forgive you.

696
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,620
And so the mystery is solved.

697
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:35,800
Good news, everyone.

698
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,560
By royal decree,

699
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,080
the King abolished slavery.

700
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:40,800
- How about that?
- Hooray.

701
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,490
Woo-hoo.

702
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,460
Mom. You there, Mom?

703
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,140
We've got it.

704
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,820
What's all this noise?
Come here, come here.

705
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,890
Look here.

706
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:56,730
The fruit of our labor.

707
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,080
The license to legally open my shop.

708
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,500
"Thongphiphop Distillery"
Is this possible?

709
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,120
- It is possible, Mom.
- Great work, son.

710
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:11,250
Some of us choose to move on
from a painful memory.

711
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,370
Forgive each other, won't you?

712
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,830
You really did some terrible things.

713
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,750
Some choose to honor it.

714
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:38,290
Everyone resumes their lives
and starts anew.

715
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,670
No one decides another's fate.

716
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,700
No one owns another's life.

717
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,570
We have a choice now.
What'll you do?

718
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,410
Have you dreamed of
achieving great things?

719
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,130
Never.

720
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,550
I take commands and carry them out.

721
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,910
Dream, huh?

722
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:59,570
I stand idle like a soldier
after the endgame.

723
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,830
My dream?
Run my inventor's shop.

724
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,870
Hey, you can take my commands
at the shop.

725
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,250
I'll command you till you drop.

726
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,080
Well, well. Thongbai.

727
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,770
So quickly you forgot
I saved your life.

728
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,220
Pay me back first, buddy.

729
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,520
- Argh.
- Hold on.

730
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,100
Watch out for my wound.
Would you?

731
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,800
Of course, I was teasing.

732
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,700
And you, Sangthong?

733
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,070
Dreams I have none.

734
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,210
But I might have found a calling.

735
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,170
What, Sangthong?

736
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,950
Call me Detective Sangthong.

737
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,800
- Oh, please.
- Hrr.

738
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,070
Detective?

739
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,520
My, my.

740
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,890
You detected, all right.
Just all the wrong people.

741
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,410
I was a rookie. Hmm?

742
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,810
Now, I'm seasoned.

743
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,300
A child's skeleton was found.

744
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,090
Dead body?
Excuse me, sir.

745
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,410
Sir, you were saying?

746
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,010
An exhumed child's skeleton

747
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,990
by the temple,
north of the market.

748
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,120
Looks like a murder, hidden away.

749
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,120
I'm going there.

750
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,410
- Thanks.
- Okay.

751
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,300
A child's skeleton.

752
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,370
Hey.

753
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:16,720
You think?

754
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,860
- Kratai, are you here?
- What's up?

755
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,860
Did you hear what he said?

756
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,400
Is it you?

757
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,260
I told you.
I remember nothing.

758
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,300
Do you want to know?

759
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,220
I'll jump right in.

760
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,410
Is it a good idea?

761
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:35,620
Hmm.

762
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,970
What say you?
Ready for a ride?

763
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:41,800
Ready.

764
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:44,470
You give command. I'll carry out.

765
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,520
Ride or die, buddy.

766
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,080
What are friends for, gents?

767
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,340
Let's take a ride.

768
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,300
A murderer has struck again!

769
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:56,240
Let's go.

770
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,270
Detective, detective.

771
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,660
Let's do it.

772
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,110
Huh.

773
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,640
I sense they'll have
a tougher nut to crack.

774
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:14,340
One good story always
leads to the next.

775
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,410
Until next time,

776
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,160
"See you later."
see ya.

777
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,460
We appreciate your tuning in for

778
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,250
"Mystery of the Deadly Sins"

779
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,240
until the big reveal.
