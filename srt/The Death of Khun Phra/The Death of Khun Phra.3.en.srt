1
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:02,710
This show is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to actual persons,

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,850
living or dead, or real events
is purely coincidental and

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,907
not intended to offend any person,
profession, or organization.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,280
I've made you fugitives like me.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,880
Three of us have always been
solid since whenever.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,225
We shared laughter.

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,294
How could we leave you in disaster?

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,555
Don't think I'm unaware

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,240
that you also had
quarrels with him.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,800
Is it the person
you're thinking of?

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,480
Yes.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,930
I believe Khun (Nobility title)
Bamrungnakon is the murderer.

13
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:42,545
Oh, this is a rickshaw.

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,455
Whose might this be?

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,938
My, it's like a supercar.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,360
"Touch"
Please let me touch.

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,701
Wanna touch? Wanna feel?
Don't be so brazen.

18
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:59,035
This is a gift from the noble Lord
to my master.

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,470
"Touch"
Your unworthy hands shall not touch.

20
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:05,358
And who might he be?

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,760
I am.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,260
The Lord honored my rank
elevation with this gift

23
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,455
from Khun to Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,465
This is one of the five
in existence.

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,855
"Number"
There, the serial number.

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,420
"003"

27
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,735
Every part...

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,295
"Limited edition"
is limited edition.

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,645
I admire the brilliance
of a man of status.

30
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,575
Not too close,
lest you mar my rickshaw.

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
I shall polish it
to a gleam for you.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,963
Goodness, another supercar.

33
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:52,085
Well, well.

34
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,975
Thought you own
the only rickshaw in town?

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,175
The Lord granted me one as well.

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,105
But should you notice,

37
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,225
"Number"
mine has a serial number...

38
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,866
002.

39
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,845
Yours are all original parts,
unlike mine.

40
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,355
Your cheap gold ring isn't worth
one of the swag parts

41
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,135
Custom parts, huh?

42
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,695
Too many of those, the rickshaw
could fall apart at your feet.

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,509
Are you taunting my rickshaw's
speed and muscle?

44
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,140
It's on.

45
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,630
Me, sir?

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,175
Not you, then who?
Me, pulling, and you up there?

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,465
- Nonsense.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,400
- Quick.
- Okay.

49
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,960
Take us around, Jom.

50
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,765
The fast needn't overtake.
The furious needn't boast.

51
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,040
But I say...

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,875
Easy with the stacks of swags,
Fast it flies, the haters lag.

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,900
Go, Jom.

54
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,035
Yes, sir.

55
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,120
Go, Sangthong.

56
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,295
Quickly.

57
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,070
Go.

58
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,800
Yes, sir.

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,845
Why does misfortune
always find me?

60
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,960
Go quickly, Jom.

61
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,635
Sangthong, speed up.

62
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,000
Are you trying?

63
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,760
I'm flooring like Vin Diesel, sir.

64
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:05,275
Speed up at the curve.

65
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,240
Go.

66
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,720
Almost there.

"Mystery of the Deadly Sins"

79
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:18,475
I am not surprised
if Khun Phra Bamroekrung

80
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,620
died at the hands
of Khun Bamrungnakon.

81
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,175
Since I became Khun Phra's entourage,

82
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,375
I'd seen the two locked in fierce competition.

83
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,280
Be it about...

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,435
food.

85
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,655
This is mala soup.

86
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,587
A gift from a Chinese tycoon.

87
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,615
Afraid of the spice?

88
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,392
I get it. A mild gent like you
can't handle the burn.

89
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,760
Bland broth.

90
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,250
Brisk, smooth going down.

91
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,120
Ah-hmph.

92
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,640
"Flavorful"
It's full of flavor.

93
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:24,805
Good for you.

94
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,630
But my tongue...is numb.

95
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,870
Music.

96
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,855
And even...women.

97
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,907
From Khun Bamrungnakon, my lady.

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,860
Ahem...

99
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,280
A token of affection from
Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

100
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,215
No matter what,
they'd always been rivals.

101
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,059
Over trivial pursuits?

102
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,365
They can't be a murder motive.

103
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,695
Don't jump to
conclusions just yet.

104
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,515
There's more to it than you think.

105
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,085
What I told you

106
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,420
"Intro"
was just the intro.

107
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,235
And another thing.

108
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,575
They didn't start as rivals

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,400
but as...the best of friends.

110
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,465
A friendship turned sour.

111
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,170
Can that even be?

112
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,240
Now, poor Thongbai has to
bear the brunt of it.

113
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,030
Where should I begin?

114
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,485
Ah, listen up.

115
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:00,333
It began when Khun Bamrungnakon
first met Khun Phra.

116
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,091
"Wild Boar Gang"

117
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,466
Who is the Tua Hia (leader) of
the Wild Boar Gang?

118
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,880
I am the leader.

119
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,935
You barged in, shouting
and annoying me. Who are you?

120
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,346
I am Khun Bamrungnakon,
from the City Department.

121
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,095
I owe no courtesy

122
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,455
to a law-breaking Ang Yi
(Chinese secret society) like you.

123
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,765
What law have I broken?

124
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,405
Selling opium and running
an unregulated opium den.

125
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,575
The law states it's illegal.

126
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,385
Anyone smoking or trading opium

127
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,815
must face three rounds of flogging,

128
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,955
forfeit all property,
bereave of wife and children,

129
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,027
and feed grass to
official elephants.

130
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,055
Citing the law to the letter.

131
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,499
Your demeanor tells me you're
a new official in town.

132
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,725
And so, you don't know

133
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,194
this joint does nothing
against the law.

134
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,554
They buy opium because
smoking it eases their pain.

135
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,499
The pain vanishes after smoking it.

136
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,775
It's no cure.
It only numbs the pain.

137
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,265
Once it wears off, the pain returns.

138
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,785
Heavy dose gets them hooked
and unable to work.

139
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,815
In the end, they'll commit a crime
to afford it.

140
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,145
It disrupts the peace.
How could that be good?

141
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:41,018
Hey, the fault lies with those
who misuse it, not me.

142
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,916
Don't stand in my way of business.
The world has evolved.

143
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,615
Coarse ruffians like you

144
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,615
won't budge until knocked down.

145
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,395
You are under arrest.

146
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,225
Here, arrest me. Come on.

147
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,245
Oh, sir. There you are.

148
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,795
You suddenly disappeared.

149
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,120
Say, do you know this
Khun blockhead?

150
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,175
Of course, I do.

151
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,800
Why, he's my dearest friend.

152
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,345
Right, buddy?

153
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,680
-Hmm?
- No, I don't know.

154
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,120
What is it?

155
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,575
What's the matter?

156
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,280
See?

157
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,180
Don't say you're sulking
about last night.

158
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,550
Ah, I knew it.
Last night ticked you off.

159
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,365
Come on, buddy.

160
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,955
Well, last night,
we fought over a woman.

161
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,979
I won. He went mad.
Same old habits, old routines.

162
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,860
He just moved to Suwanthani

163
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,855
and must wise up of going-on here.

164
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,800
I hope you won't
hold it against him.

165
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,470
Now, let me take him away
and set him straight.

166
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,455
Big training day, yeah?

167
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,560
Alright, let's go. Walk.

168
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,500
"See you soon"
See you soon.

169
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,079
What did you do?

170
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,050
If I hadn't stepped in,

171
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,155
your guts would've been
all over the floor by now.

172
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,615
If I must die, then so be it.

173
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,903
As a royal official,
I serve the people.

174
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,725
Look.

175
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,944
I commend your courage.
Truly admirable.

176
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:19,754
Judging by your demeanor,
you must be new here.

177
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,885
Let me tell you in good faith.

178
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,415
Don't throw your life away.

179
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,945
Use prudence. Don't act so bold.

180
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,855
Learn to discern
the situations first.

181
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,815
That way, you won't
die in vain. Okay?

182
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,615
Who are you to lecture me like this?

183
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,375
I'm a Khun, just like you.

184
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,810
Khun Bamroekrung,
under the City Department.

185
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,135
You still have a lot to learn.

186
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,386
If you don't mind,
why not join me at my residence?

187
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,421
Here I am, sir.

188
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,335
High carbs or low, sir?

189
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,729
Whatever.

190
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,560
Come, please.

191
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,415
Let's enjoy this meal.

192
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,225
See if it's to your palate.

193
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,748
If anything, let me know, sir.

194
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,600
It tastes excellent, sir.

195
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,015
What a grand, spacious
residence you own.

196
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,902
And such flavorful food you enjoy.

197
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,662
I assume your fine wife
manages it all.

198
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,654
No, I don't have a wife.

199
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,723
Are you an ascetic type, then?

200
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,075
Not quite.

201
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,135
I've had 99 wives.

202
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,240
Ninety-nine wives?

203
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
Mm-hmm.

204
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,387
Figures.

205
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,505
Ahem.

206
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,530
Indeed.

207
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,480
Jealous, are you?

208
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,245
Not at all.

209
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,215
But I've often wondered.

210
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,855
When a man takes many wives,

211
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,695
it's seen as enviable,
as you suggested.

212
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,065
But when a woman takes many husbands,

213
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,935
it's considered disgraceful.

214
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,335
Well, men like us have
wealth and power.

215
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,535
We ensure our women
are well provided for

216
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,495
and lack nothing.

217
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,135
It's only natural.

218
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,155
So a wealthy woman could
have 99 husbands, too?

219
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,665
Well...she could, so long as
her men agree to that.

220
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,600
Certainly not me.

221
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,895
And there it is.

222
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,775
So, is the fault in
being born a woman?

223
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,373
Or is it in men, narrow-minded
and self-centered?

224
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,925
Let's just agree to disagree.

225
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:33,425
I say we...don't delve into trifle.

226
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,575
No need to quarrel.
Let's eat instead.

227
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,041
So, you're new in town, all alone,

228
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,650
and attempted a head-on arrest
at the Ang Yi den.

229
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,260
You like playing with fire?

230
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,795
Sir, we're serving
as royal officials.

231
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,535
We must be loyal to the kingdom

232
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,230
to ensure the nation's progress.

233
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,748
All for it.

234
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,330
I see.

235
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,015
But you shouldn't have
recklessly stormed in like that.

236
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,936
I'm all ears.

237
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,105
There's a way they,
the Ang Yi, can't anticipate.

238
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,135
"Wild Boar Gang"
My friend's new in town,

239
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,175
so he didn't know who's who.

240
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,913
But I've explained
everything to him.

241
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,445
Last time, I didn't
understand the system here.

242
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,095
My apologies, Tua Hia.

243
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,825
As a token of my heartfelt apology,
a basket of auspicious oranges.

244
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,150
Hey.

245
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,856
We play it cool to build trust
so they'll lower their guard.

246
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:02,057
Something auspicious.

247
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,002
Eat it, and you'll be prosperous.

248
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,655
If you're ready to befriend me,

249
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,735
I'll gladly overlook
your rookie mistakes.

250
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,816
I've got something
good for you, too.

251
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,760
What's that?

252
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,795
Trusting us, they'll want
to show off their opium.

253
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,938
That's the evidence
to arrest them on the spot.

254
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,780
What's the matter?

255
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,040
I'm in a good mood.

256
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,320
Shall I compose a verse
for the leader?

257
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,375
- Sure.
- Okay?

258
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,175
Go ahead.

259
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,405
So begins the tale of
the opium laced with gold.

260
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,025
A smoke that brings cheer
with no ill will to hold.

261
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,512
A generous Tua Hia, keeping me lit.

262
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:07,240
A pile of evidence
that proves our wits.

263
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,527
Buy-bust operation is a success.

264
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,490
Evidence, you say?

265
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,680
Uh...huh.

266
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,035
Are you baiting me
with a sting operation?

267
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,640
That's right, Di (little brother).
Sting, ain't it?

268
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,530
Is that so?

269
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,791
Then, here it comes.

270
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,420
Halt.

271
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,755
You're under arrest for trading opium,

272
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,930
a dangerous narcotic.

273
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,705
Get him.

274
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,825
Go.

275
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,570
Hey, hey.

276
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,745
Go.

277
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,015
Walk.

278
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,305
Are you alright, sir?

279
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,135
Wake up, wake up.

280
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,520
Enough. It hurts.

281
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
I'm fine.

282
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,350
It got the opium bundle.

283
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,640
What a relief.

284
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,120
I thought you were done for.

285
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,926
Why did you have
an opium bundle on you?

286
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,575
Well...it's evidence, you know?

287
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,800
Since we both came,
we get it done like a pro.

288
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,935
- I'm so grateful to you.
- Easy with the hand.

289
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,615
I shouldn't have been
impatient, as you said.

290
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,135
You've gotten hurt because of me.

291
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,120
Hey, don't mention it.
Anyone would've done the same.

292
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,975
Finally, the Wild Boar Gang
was dismantled.

293
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,175
The opium trade was
completely eradicated.

294
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,520
Painter, take this pose.

295
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,575
After that, they were promoted
from Khun to Khun Phra.

296
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,055
And personal rickshaws
as rewards from their superiors.

297
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,375
Take this pose. Ready?
Three, two, one.

298
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,640
- Best friends.
- Best friends.

299
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,815
I am Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

300
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,615
I am Khun Phra Bamrungnakon.

301
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,470
- I swear.
- I swear.

302
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,444
- We'll be lifelong friends.
- We'll be lifelong friends.

303
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,975
I prepared a fine liquor
for the occasion.

304
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,405
I am deeply moved.

305
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,200
Wait, what are you doing?

306
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,375
For a blood oath.

307
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,800
Hey, do we have to?

308
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,215
Don't we have to?

309
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,360
No need to go that far.
The liquor is enough.

310
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,874
- No? Really?
- Uh-uh.

311
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,080
And so, they became sworn brothers.

312
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,495
From your story, Sangthong,

313
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,105
I fail to see Khun's motivation
to kill Khun Phra.

314
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,175
Exactly, from what you've told me,

315
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,085
these two would've died
for each other.

316
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,670
As the plot thickens,

317
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,535
a turning point is revealed.

318
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Oh...

319
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,510
Ah? Ah?

320
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,610
Know what that means?

321
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,365
- No
- Ow.

322
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,160
What does "turning point" mean?

323
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,815
A turning point means

324
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,635
an irreversible moment of change.

325
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,960
- Care for a visit?
- Stop by, my dear.

326
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,820
- We're here, sir.
- Thanks.

327
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,705
- Dokrak, he's here.
- Oh, Khun Phra.

328
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,655
Hello. Hello.

329
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,575
Suwanthani's staple.
Everyone visits this place.

330
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,132
"Relax"
Relax.

331
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,560
I'm fine.

332
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,055
Yeah. Don't get nervous.

333
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,840
- Inside, sirs.

334
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,640
Boss gets all the fun,
and again leaves me none.

335
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,880
Go easy on him. He's still shy.

336
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,520
Ahem.

337
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,015
- Evening.
- Evening, Phraya Mahapradit.

338
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,925
No need for formalities.

339
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,255
I'm here for the same
pleasures as you all.

340
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,685
Did you receive a reward from the Lord?

341
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,960
Is that the occasion here?

342
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,285
Well, I'm sure you've heard
about dazzling ladies here.

343
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,913
A little.

344
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,345
Khun Bamrungnakon,
you just posted here recently,

345
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,615
yet have taken down
a large opium gang.

346
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,475
You know? Everyone in town is
talking about your arrest.

347
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,205
Team effort, sir.

348
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,398
Khun Phra Bamroekrung helped me.

349
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,050
Hmm.

350
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,095
You two get along very well.

351
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,795
Well, how about this?

352
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,735
Soon, my term will be over.

353
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,815
Would you two run for
city governor in my place?

354
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Uh.

355
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,085
Is that a good idea, sir?

356
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,375
We've just been promoted
not long ago.

357
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,835
Of course, it's a good idea.

358
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,285
If you help govern
the city in my place,

359
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,055
I wouldn't mind.

360
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,401
Okay, sir.

361
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,600
- Nong (Endearment term) Chaba.
- Yes?

362
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,735
Let's go.

363
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,240
Hurry.

364
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,815
I miss you.

365
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,525
Please, have a seat.

366
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,725
Thank you.

367
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,135
Hey.

368
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,595
When his term ends,

369
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,180
you should run for city governor.

370
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,695
It'd suit you.

371
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,985
Someone like me? No way.

372
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,215
You're more suited for it.

373
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,055
Come on. You're bold and reliable.

374
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,175
When the villagers have problems,
you solve them quickly.

375
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,375
They like that.

376
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,459
They need a fast-acting governor.

377
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:36,875
Nah. You're more suitable.

378
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,775
You tackle problems head-on.

379
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,655
You call out things others avoid.

380
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,775
I think, nowadays, the villagers

381
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,055
would want a governor who's
bold and righteous like you.

382
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
Nonsense.

383
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,155
You should run.
You'd definitely win.

384
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,530
- You do it. Don't encourage me.
- You do it.

385
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,800
- You.
- You do it.

386
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,443
My Lord!

387
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,535
Phraya Mahapradit's death
started the chain of events.

388
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,340
His vacant position

389
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,763
needed a new man to rise
and take control.

390
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,740
Such power had broken apart
the two friends.

391
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,974
How did they break?

392
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,013
How did the jar break?

393
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,765
It must be...Kratai.

394
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,705
No throwing shards.

395
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,635
It wasn't me.

396
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,015
Many people are out there.

397
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,760
People are coming?
Quit eating, will you?

398
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,349
Check it out. Get out there.

399
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,763
- Wait for me.
- Hurry up.

400
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,565
The slave from the wanted poster

401
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,895
and his friends came here.

402
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,935
Are you sure they're in here?

403
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,591
You'll be punished otherwise.

404
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,800
I'm sure, sir.

405
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,713
Officers, find them.

406
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

407
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,135
We're doomed.

408
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,520
How did they find us?

409
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,215
I'm doomed.
They'll get me for sure.

410
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,540
Thongbai, we'll buy you some time.

411
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,700
You find a hiding spot. Go, go.

412
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,440
Wait, wait. Get our things.
They'll know someone's here.

413
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,990
You go that way, I'll go this way.

414
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Clear?

415
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,841
Wait, Thongbai went that way.

416
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,000
We must hurry.

417
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,320
Oh, where are my glasses?

418
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,970
Sangthong, he's in trouble.
What do we do?

419
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,065
Ouch. Sangthong.

420
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,880
We're here.

421
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,840
Hey, Sangthong.

422
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,388
We're here.

423
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,160
There you are.

424
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Arrest them.

425
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,065
We've done wrong, sir.

426
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,055
Don't arrest us.

427
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,458
Who are you to give me orders?

428
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,615
We're sorry, sir.

429
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,345
We wouldn't dare give you orders.

430
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,720
We had nowhere to go
but this abandoned temple.

431
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,775
If we return to Khun Phra's estate,
we'll surely be punished.

432
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,215
Please have mercy on us, sir.

433
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,026
You...look up.

434
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,535
Sangthong.

435
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Maiphlong.

436
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,213
Answer me.
where is your friend?

437
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,729
Thongbai disappeared
since the ceremony, sir.

438
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,805
We fled for fear of being captured
by the authorities.

439
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,635
We found this hideout.
Just us, sir.

440
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,695
Sir, we really have nowhere to go.

441
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,465
Please have mercy.

442
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,620
Don't stand there like a dolt.
Arrest them.

443
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,000
Stop.

444
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,760
Don't arrest them.

445
00:27:44,508 --> 00:27:45,969
Why, sir?

446
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,768
I'll take them in at my estate.

447
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,335
But...that is against the law.

448
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,120
They belong to Khun Phra's
descendants, should they not?

449
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,799
You dare defy my order?

450
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,445
I said I would take them.

451
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,151
Any protest?

452
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,640
It is my greatest honor, sir.

453
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,680
I shall follow you
for the rest of my days.

454
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,335
Glory to you, sir.

455
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,975
Now and forever, sir.

456
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,080
Glory to you, sir.

457
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,880
Now and forever, sir.

458
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,060
- Uh...glory to you, sir.
- Glory...

459
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,200
- Now and forever, sir.
- Now and forever.

460
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,700
- Glory to you, sir.
- Glory...

461
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,335
Why become his slave?

462
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,575
We'd get closer to him
and gather more evidence.

463
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,130
If anything incriminating,

464
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,215
Thongbai might be
cleared of the charges.

465
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,920
Hey, that's clever.

466
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,205
Of course, it is.

467
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,790
What?

468
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,855
We've reached my house.
Thanks, officers, for escorting us.

469
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,065
You're dismissed.

470
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,090
- Yes, sir.
- My Lord.

471
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,400
Bye.

472
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,880
This is my estate.

473
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,200
I allow the two of you to enter.

474
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,380
Wow, this house is huge.

476
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,735
Hey, you heard what he said.

477
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,465
He didn't invite you,
so you're not allowed in.

478
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,575
Then who will I play with?
I'll be so lonely.

479
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,135
Stay with Thongbai for a while.

480
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,104
If anything happens, let me know.
Go on.

481
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,720
Fine,...geez.

482
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,150
What's the hold-up?
Come in.

483
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,720
Yes, sir. Right away.

484
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,560
Jom. Hey, Jom.

485
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,760
Welcome back, sir.

486
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
These fools.

487
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,895
I've taken them
from Khun Phra's estate.

488
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,620
Task them.

489
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,041
- Feed and shelter them.
- Yes, sir.

490
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,965
Thank you, sir.

491
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,000
Thank you, sir.

492
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,745
The name's Sangthong.

493
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,721
And this...Maiphlong.

494
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,803
Yeah, I remember your face.

495
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,510
The rickshaw-pulling lad.

496
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,448
After me.

497
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,055
Go ahead.

498
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,085
Wow...roomy.

499
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,830
Look, a queen-sized bed.

500
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,120
Bed? It's a canopy.

501
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,505
You two stay here.

502
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,120
Work begins at dawn.

503
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,360
- Yes.
- Sure.

504
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,665
Be diligent.
Come running to master's call.

505
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,735
He's kind and merciful.

506
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,120
But if you don't behave,
punishment is severe.

507
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,140
Understood?

508
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,080
- Understood.
- Yes.

509
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,520
So fierce.

510
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,400
We survive another day.

511
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,080
But now...

512
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,700
I'm famished.

513
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,735
I haven't eaten all day.

514
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Hungry?

515
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,510
Come here.

516
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,545
Here,...I snatched these
along the way earlier.

517
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,375
Wow, when did you do that?

518
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,215
Just now. Want it or not?

519
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,640
Yes, yes.

520
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,020
Hey, Sangthong.

521
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,760
Does this place feel eerie,
unlike Khun Phra's house?

522
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,495
At first, I thought
there'd be many slaves.

523
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,960
Turns out, there are
only three or four.

524
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,920
Ever since the election for
the new governor began,

525
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,560
this estate has been like this.

526
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,960
Please welcome Khun Phra Bamroekrung,

527
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,000
the first candidate for
the position of governor,

528
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,760
to present his policies.

529
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,400
Louder, louder!

530
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,750
A good man with clean hands
and fine manners.

531
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:10,510
Number 1,
Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

532
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,480
Thank you.

533
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,520
What are you waiting for?
Cheer, cheer!

534
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,000
Brothers and sisters.

535
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,080
Brothers and sisters.

536
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,855
I, Khun Phra Bamroekrung,
grew up here.

537
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,675
I know your joy and grief.

538
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,427
I know what we've all been through.

539
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,095
Hardship and poverty are things
we never wish to face.

540
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,885
I want all of you to be
happier than this.

541
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,150
Happier than this.

542
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,575
The time has come for you
to find happiness.

543
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,325
I, Khun Phra Bamroekrung,
promise here and now

544
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:07,240
that the livelihood for common folks
and slaves will improve.

545
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
Improve our lives.

546
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,455
Slaves will toil for fewer hours

547
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,400
and find more joy in restful hours.

548
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,725
Most importantly, I will
support local industries,

549
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,880
such as...local liquor makers.

550
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,760
- Local liquor.
- Yeah, local liquor.

551
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,275
Please keep Khun Phra Bamroekrung
in your hearts.

552
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,920
- Number 1.
- Number 1.

553
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,480
- Yeah. What a sport.
- Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

554
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,795
Here, take one. Take on.

555
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,160
Everyone, come get one.
Spread the word.

556
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,545
Khun Phra, sir.

557
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,125
Thank you so much for

558
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,120
your policies for
local liquor makers.

559
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,000
- Thank you, sir.
- It's nothing.

560
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,725
- Glad to be of help.
- Yes, yes.

561
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,105
Khun Phra, sir.

562
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,515
If you become the city governor,

563
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,720
will you abolish the law

564
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,535
forcing hundreds of workers
into liquor factories?

565
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,775
If so, a small maker
like me can thrive.

566
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,360
Uh...yes, yes.

567
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,740
Promise me, sir.

568
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,120
Promise, sir.

569
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,280
Yes, I promise.

570
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,360
Once I'm elected, yeah?

571
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,055
I must go to see my friends.

572
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,095
Vote for me.
Khun Phra Bamroekrung, number 1.

573
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
Number 1, okay?

574
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,475
- Yes, sir.
- Help me out.

575
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

576
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
Sangthong.

577
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,190
Tell your brothers, relatives,
slaves, and master,

578
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,360
Khun Phra Bamroekrung, number 1.

579
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,840
Only number 1.

580
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,640
Thought you'd run away.

581
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,815
You know if you compete with me,

582
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,215
you'll end up
losing to me, like always.

583
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,575
Because I knew you'd come
spouting nonsense like this,

584
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,330
I didn't want to waste my time.

585
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,800
But after some thought,

586
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,240
when a dog barks,

587
00:36:15,097 --> 00:36:17,235
if you don't stare it down,

588
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,775
it won't know who's in charge.

589
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,120
Told you many times not to.

590
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,135
Hey, you're next on stage.

591
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,615
Any interesting policies to win votes?

592
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,560
Or is it just empty,
like your hollow head?

593
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,595
Even before you're in power,

594
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,215
you already look down on everyone.

595
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,960
I don't see the man to lead society
coming from you.

596
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,110
Hey...

597
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,815
The kind of man I am is irrelevant.

598
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,125
I hold up the front of
a good person.

599
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,985
The image of the man
they want to see.

600
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,240
That's enough for me to win.

601
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,455
Remember this.

602
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,925
The people don't want
to hear the truth.

603
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,645
They want to hear lies
that give them hope.

604
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,110
But today, you will lose.

605
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,040
Your old tricks can't fool
anyone anymore.

606
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Today...

607
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,080
it's about ideas,

608
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,520
hope,

609
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,680
and a shared vision for the future.

610
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,320
I'll make them see their better lives

611
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,120
so clearly they'll forget
your good-man masquerade.

612
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,080
They'll focus on
the better future ahead.

613
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,200
Dream on.

614
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,550
Hey...

615
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,120
Only fools believe
in your empty hopes.

616
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,680
Just wait and see.

617
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,655
The power doesn't lie in
you or me to decide.

618
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,745
But the people

619
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,640
through their votes.

620
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,880
Let's meet the second candidate
for city governor,

621
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,640
Khun Phra Bamrungnakon, number 2.

622
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,320
With that attitude,
you set out to lose.

623
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,840
Everyone here is of low status,

624
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,670
not by choice,

625
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,800
but by force,

626
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,840
even though we're
all born as equals.

627
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,600
Why must there be masters,

628
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,083
those who place themselves
above us,

629
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,779
and press us into
a lower class for life?

630
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,162
I, too, was of the lower class.

631
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,708
Through hard work,
I rose to become Khun Phra.

632
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,000
Seared in my heart is
that same pain you endure.

633
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,905
My candidate make empty promises.

634
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,615
Higher wages.

635
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,099
Thriving market.

636
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,960
But has anyone recognized the truth

637
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,280
that the core problem is inequality.

638
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,530
Slaves carry out hard labor

639
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,145
for absurdly poor livelihoods

640
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,820
because the masters
take cuts from their wages.

641
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,805
They abuse them
and unjustly exploit them.

642
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:34,060
Their income through
trade are seized.

643
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,200
All because they're slaves.

644
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,120
But today...

645
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,530
everyone deserves a better life.

646
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,200
Choose me as the city governor

647
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,320
and I'll ensure Suwanthani
has no slaves.

648
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,430
Suwanthani has controlled slaves
for generations.

649
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,841
The royal laws are written as such.

650
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,216
Do not speak of what is impossible.

651
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,575
Everyone will live as free individuals

652
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,360
no longer bound by class divisions.

653
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
I promise

654
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,290
no one will have to be
a slave ever again.

655
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,900
Slavery ends now.
Free the slaves.

656
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,320
No more slaves.
No slaves. No slaves.

657
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,680
No slaves!

658
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,640
to drugs.

659
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,800
His policy is a disaster, sir.
I take pride in being a slave.

660
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,885
Slave no more.
No more slaves.

661
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,015
Slave no more.

662
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,195
Slave no more.

663
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,175
Slave no more.

664
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,255
Slave no more.

665
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,145
Slave no more.

666
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,485
Slave no more.

667
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,615
Slave no more.

668
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,575
Slave no more.

669
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,835
Slave no more.

670
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,055
Slave no more.

671
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,175
Slave no more.

672
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,000
Slave no more.

673
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,320
I'll tell you.

674
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,175
Today is one of the proudest days
of my life.

675
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,655
I revealed my heart to the people.

676
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,255
It is important.

677
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,420
- At first,...
- Yes, sir.

678
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,045
No one applauded for me.

679
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:17,385
But after my speech,
the applause was thunderous.

680
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,625
Truly, sir.

681
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,000
This old woman, at first,

682
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,060
glared at me
as if she wanted to kill me.

683
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,130
But in the end, she brought me
a cart full of fruits and produce.

684
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,080
Down there.
Make sure everyone gets some.

685
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,140
Really, sir?

686
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,680
You will for sure become
the governor, sir.

687
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,415
What's going on outside?
Check it out.

688
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Yes, sir.

689
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,405
- What is it, sir?
- Is Khun Phra Bamrungnakon here?

690
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,920
- He is, sir.
- There is a royal decree.

691
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Alright.

692
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,080
Soldiers are here, sir.

693
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,600
- Who's here, Jom?
- Soldiers, sir.

694
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,680
Why are they here?

695
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,680
I don't know, sir.

696
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:23,175
Was he arrested? On what charge?

697
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,709
For earning public favor
through speech?

698
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,560
Khun Phra Bamroekrung
relayed to the palace,

699
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,680
stating Khun Phra Bamrungnakon
plotted treason,

700
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,155
seeking to change the royal law

701
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,440
and abolish
the abiding system of slavery.

702
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,305
Khun Phra Bamrungnakon
was to be executed.

703
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,465
But due to his past merits,

704
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,788
the death penalty was commuted.

705
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,741
Instead, his property was seized,
his rank stripped,

706
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,665
and he was demoted from
Khun Phra to merely Khun

707
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,640
from then on.

708
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,380
Why is he like this?

709
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,605
- Vile scoundrel.
- Horrible man.

710
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,295
- A wretch.
- He's a hopeless trash.

711
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,240
Wicked man.

712
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,365
"Disloyal"
Banish him. Get him out.

713
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,815
- Drive him out.
- Get out.

714
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,590
A wretch.

715
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,215
You ungrateful, arrogant fool.

716
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,100
Banish him.

717
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,510
Do not follow his example.

718
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,800
- Get out.
- Get out.

719
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,040
- Get out.
- Get out.

720
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,330
After that,

721
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,760
the governor's election was canceled.

722
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,520
Khun Phra Bamroekrung was
appointed as the new governor.

723
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,800
Close friends became bitter enemies.
All for power.

724
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:46,955
If it were me, I wouldn't
have let it slide.

725
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,680
I would've shot him that very day.

726
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,250
Hmm?

727
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
What did you say?

728
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,510
I said I would have shot him
that very day.

729
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,207
Ah, I agree with you.

730
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,840
Khun Bamrungnakon had the chance
to shoot Khun Phra that day,

731
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,530
and many other chances.

732
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,085
Why wait until the wedding day?

733
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,640
Yeah.

734
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,134
Why wait until the wedding day?

735
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,919
Hey, perhaps...
Khun Bamrungnakon didn't shot him?

736
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,785
What you said gave me
a second thought.

737
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,760
Well, if you're unsure,

738
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,600
I'll force a confession out of him.

739
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,720
That'll settle it.

740
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,880
What?

741
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,095
You're always so quick
to use force.

742
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,175
If you do that, you'll be punished
and thrown in jail.

743
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,500
Who will uncover the truth?

744
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,705
All this mystery

745
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,040
makes my head hurt.

746
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,781
I'm in no mood to eat.
Let's hit the sack.

747
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,025
But in Khun Bamrungnakon's house,

748
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,970
we could investigate further
and find something crucial.

749
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,520
Alright then.

750
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,960
Let's go to sleep.

751
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,710
You guys should sleep now.

752
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,400
Uh,...thank you.

753
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,600
Goodnight, Phi Jom.

754
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,070
What's with his yelling?

755
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,814
- Here, put it away.
- Okay.

756
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,674
Hey, pretty good pillow.

757
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,080
Wake up, wake up.

758
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,935
Wake up, wake up.

759
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,355
Don't make me mad.

760
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,800
Wake up, wake up.

761
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,480
Get up already.

762
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,430
- I'm getting up.
- I'm up.

763
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,120
Get off me so I can get up.

764
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,695
No more sleeping.

765
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,800
Get up.

766
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,655
Fill the buckets with water.

767
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,295
Sangthong, follow me upstairs
to clean Khun's room later.

768
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,600
- You...
- Yes.

769
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,964
water the plants.

770
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,440
- Got it.
- Got it.

771
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,840
He's riding on us.

772
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:25,631
I couldn't sleep at all.

773
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,440
First day, I get to clean
Khun Bamrungnakon's room.

774
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,470
Hey, Sangthong.

775
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:35,600
Khun may be testing your loyalty.

776
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,935
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

777
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,925
Don't forget why we're here.

778
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,520
Why are we here?

779
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,000
Wait...why are we here?

780
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,070
Water the plants well.

781
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,405
You're so slow.

782
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,655
Here...Khun Bamrungnakon's room.

783
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,702
Make it sparkly clean.

784
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,000
Come on.

785
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:25,822
Do a good job.
I must go for something.

786
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,195
I'll come back to check.

787
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,440
Yes, sir, Phi Jom.

788
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,520
Ugh,...there's nothing.

789
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,760
Nothing but this box is locked.

790
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:43,800
Whatcha doing here?

791
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,720
Eavesdropping.
I wanted to know what you found.

792
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,745
They could've seen you
and we'd be in trouble.

793
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:50,785
Come in.

794
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,040
Did you open the door
because you found something?

795
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:03,640
I was right to follow you.

796
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,855
Do you know this is a special lock?

797
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,655
Imported from the West.

798
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,225
Made of steel, with brass
and bronze mechanisms.

799
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,515
Guaranteed, unpickable.

800
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,640
Gosh.

801
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,240
I hate to say it,
but I can pick it.

802
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,100
Do it.

803
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,055
Et voilà.

804
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,345
That easy?
It's just a regular lock, isn't it?

805
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,420
You don't believe me?

806
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,683
It's a special lock.
Don't believe me?

807
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,225
Here, I wasn't bragging.
Try it yourself.

808
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,760
Why lock it again?
I want to see inside.

809
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,695
Because you think you can
pick it yourself. Go ahead.

810
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,320
- Maiphlong.
- What?

811
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,895
Why did I befriend you?

812
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,655
Oh, Maiphlong, help me.
Help Thongbai, please.

813
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,515
The most majestic lock-picker
in the world.

814
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,490
Yeah? Yeah?

815
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,560
- Most supreme in the universe.
- Quit your flattery.

816
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,920
Okay, I'll do it again.

817
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,720
Done. Easy as pie.
Open it.

818
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,080
This is the gun.

819
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,400
The same one used to
shoot Khun Phra.

820
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,320
So Khun Bamrungnakon
did shoot Khun Phra.

821
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,455
Abused power makes
people bow in fear,

822
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,960
not respect.

823
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,295
I'll find a way to get close
to Khun Bamrungnakon

824
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,615
and extract a confession from him.

825
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,950
Before I came to you,

826
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:42,865
Sangthong and I found a gun
in Khun Bamrungnakon's room.

827
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:46,515
This means he killed Khun Phra.

828
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,215
I am free of the crime. I'm free.

829
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,535
Who do we have here?
Khun Bamrungnakon himself.

830
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,928
An honor for you to visit
my humble little distillery.
