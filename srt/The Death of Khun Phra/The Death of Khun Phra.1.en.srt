00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,550
"Suwanthani"

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,480
My name's Kratai.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,290
Cute name, right?
My face? Even cuter.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,840
How old am I? Not telling ya.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,320
Whom do I like? Classified.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,550
I've got sharp instincts.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,900
My hunches never miss.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,600
Right now, I'm feeling
that my brothers

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,400
are gonna be in trouble somehow.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
Who are my brothers?

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,680
Over there.

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,560
What's on sale today?

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,560
Thongyip, Thongyod,
and Foi Thong, dear.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,920
Oh wow, so many Thongs.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,480
I'm something of a Thong.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,400
Sangthong is the name.

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,960
I say fate brought us here.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,880
That's one. He's Sangthong,

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,580
a smooth talking heart drop
with a hobby of charming ladies.

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,620
And are these sweets super sweet?

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,240
Of course, they are.

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,120
Over there is Maiphlong,

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,560
always acting like a macho.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
All muscles, not the gray cells.

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,880
His light-fingered tricks
keep his thefts unseen.

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,320
Your betel nut stain is
oddly tempting.

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,020
But your smile fills me
up to the brim.

28
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,010
If you're full,
I'm even fuller, dear.

29
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,760
My my. So gorgeous, sharp,
and hunk handsome.

30
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,880
Chiseled nose, jet-black hair.

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,520
That stylish jong kraben.

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,280
They all scream perfection.

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,840
So, are you taken?

34
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,880
How about your IG?

35
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,080
Hey, thief!

36
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,890
See? I said something bad was coming.

37
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,320
You two know each other?

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,120
- Nope.
- Yep.

39
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,720
We came together.

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,990
He's just a friend,
but you are a darling.

41
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,160
- Hurry up.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,600
No.

43
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,240
Catch the thieves.

44
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,120
Pfft. And you.

45
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,950
Help me. Catch the thieves.

46
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,980
No.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,640
Oh, I forgot to mention.
I'm not human.

48
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,290
Go, go, go.

49
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,430
- Don't you run.
- Hey, Thongbai.

50
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,390
- Let's go.
- Quick.

51
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,190
Run.

52
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,240
Let me see.

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,120
That's Thongbai, our inventor.

54
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,490
Whoa.

55
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,160
Witness my greatest invention.

56
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,200
Chili powder bomb.

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,880
Bet your eyes are burning now.

58
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,120
Good job, Thongbai, but...

59
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,700
our eyes are burning too.

60
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,360
- Water, water.
- I'll take you to water.

61
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,660
- This way.
- Hey, where are you?

62
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,960
- This way.
- Which way?

63
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,640
Don't push too hard.

64
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,390

Ow...

85
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,960
Thanks to you, Thongbai
for saving our humps.

86
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,240
It's nothing.

87
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,000
Hey...

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,200
- But you...
- What?

89
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,725
Botched our plan again.

90
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,700
Come on.
You were flirting with the girl.

91
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,760
I was enjoying that,
so I stole this.

92
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,580
Who told you to listen?

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,300
We planned it.
Don't blame it on me.

94
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,320
Enough.

95
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,680
Quit arguing.
Wash your face quick.

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,960
- Can I have some of those sweets?
- No.

97
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,000
And you.

98
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,200
Didn't you see it coming?
You should've warned us.

99
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm keeping you around
for this exact reason.

100
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,040
You never listened to me.
Even made fun of me.

101
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,100
Guard your tone, little girl.

102
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,400
Go on. Leave.
Let go of me.

103
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,290
- Let go.
- Always bringing up favors.

104
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,800
- Fine. I'm gone.
- Oh.

105
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:00,560
Tch.

106
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,015
Get Lost. Shoo.

107
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,120
Ok. I'm leaving.

108
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,640
I wasn't talking to you.

109
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,080
Hey, fighting with her again?

110
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,160
Yeah, now she's sulking
and disappeared.

111
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,985
Little Kratai never helps us anyway.

112
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,860
You helped her out,
and now we're stuck here.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,680
You're supposed to be responsible
for the things you buy.

114
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,215
I didn't buy her.

115
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,855
Just kidding.

116
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,720
Really, how much?

117
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,880
Twenty Tamlung.

118
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,320
- What?
- What now?

119
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,110
Oh, man.

120
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,175
Forget it.

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,680
How did that happen?

122
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,280
Clean up when you're done, yes?

123
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,617
Yes, Luang Por

124
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:39,700

Sangthong, write them all out.

132
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,840
My kid must get into medical school.

133
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,420
No sloppy copy
or I'll get whipped again.

134
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,040
Maybe a quick nap won't hurt.

135
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,910
Just five minutes.

136
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,360
Oh, no.

137
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,370
Looks like two hours flew by.

138
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,560
I'm doomed.

139
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,640
Why am I this unlucky?

140
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,880
I'm leaving now.

141
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Hey, kid…

142
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,040
Why are you crying?

143
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,135
Where are your parents?

144
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,610
I don't know.

145
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,375
I can't remember anything.

146
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,960
I only know my name is Kratai.

147
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,680
I've been wandering
around here for so long.

148
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,780
Remember nothing?

149
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,360
Where are you going?
Can I come with you?

150
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,940
I uh...

151
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,855
I'm just a servant.

152
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm in trouble and I must go.

153
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,975
Please, I've been here so long.

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,495
No one ever talks to me.

155
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,415
You're the only one who
sees me and talks to me.

156
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,860
Take me with you, won't you?

157
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,445
Please,
my cool, handsome brother.

158
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,520
Pretty please?

159
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,360
Cool and what?

160
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,750
Striking.

161
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
Oh, well.

162
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,600
Your words do melt icy rocks.

163
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,120
Alright.

164
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,560
This dark place is kinda dangerous

165
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,730
and full of mosquitoes.

166
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:39,315
Why don't you come with me?

167
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,825
Just tonight.
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

168
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay.

169
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
- Look here.
- Ow.

170
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,705
Why'd you smack me?

171
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,940
A huge mosquito.

172
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,560
You hurt me worse than its bite.

173
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,365
Sangthong.

174
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,660
Goofing off again?

175
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,320
Khun Phra (Nobility title)
has been calling for you.

176
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,475
Shh...

177
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,230
No, I didn't.
Just a little accident.

178
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,080
Oh, and I found a lost kid.

179
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,730
Poor thing, she can't
remember a thing.

180
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,970
Might have hit her head.

181
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,480
It's late, so I let her come along.

182
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,240
Safer that way.

183
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,400
Keep an eye on her, okay?

184
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,035
I'll rush these medicine scrolls
I copied for Khun Phra.

185
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,250
Don't change the subject.

186
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,360
Were you off flirting
with girls again?

187
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,785
Flirting? She's just a kid.

188
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,835
What kid?

189
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,860
This kid.

190
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,600
Where?

191
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,960
Right here.

192
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Where?

193
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,520
This is Kratai.

194
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,460
- Where?
- Where?

195
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,160
- I see nobody.
- Yeah.

196
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,615
Stop with the creepy talk.
It's dark.

197
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,360
You are the ones messing with me.

198
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,040
- You started it.
- Hey, I didn't.

199
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,640
Oww, the mosquito's gone.

200
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,960
Let's go see Khun Phra.
Hurry up, Sangthong.

201
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,640
No shadow at her feet.

202
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,885
I didn't think she'd stick around.

203
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,590
She won't leave.

204
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,160
But back on you.

205
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,480
We could've enjoyed snacks
if you had waited for me a little.

206
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,480
You ruined it.

207
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,675
Quit your thief habit already.
Where'd you get it from anyway?

208
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,600
Sweet talker to girls

209
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,120
but barking dog to friends.

210
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,035
You bet.

211
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,815
You wanna go?

212
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,030
- Bring it.
- Think you're tough?

213
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,320
- You. Bring it.
- Me.

214
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,320
Your flirting got us in trouble.

215
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,850
There you all are.

216
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,320
Khun Phra is calling for you.
Move it.

217
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,800
- Snacks.
- I'm off.

218
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,305
We're coming too.

219
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,760
Hey, what about the snacks?

220
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,280
What're you doing? Wipe it quick.

221
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,680
Hurry.

222
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,815
Where are they?

223
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm here, sir.

224
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,320
Well? Where?

225
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,075
I ordered auspicious dessert sets.
Where are they?

226
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,295
Almost time for invitation cards.

227
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,535
Do you hear me?

228
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,760
- Yes, sir.
- Of course.

229
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,160
Then show me.
Or there'll be some whipping.

230
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,560
- No, sir.
- Please. No.

231
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,960
Auspicious dessert sets.

232
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,490
What?

233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,720
Blissfully sweet, sir.

234
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,760
The dessert is sweet,
unlike our soon-to-be bitter lives.

235
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,680
Watch me rise to be
his favorite servant.

236
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,255
You've been warned.

237
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,960
That shining light is lifting me up.

238
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,520
Your desserts, sir.

239
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,895
Hey, can anyone hear me?

240
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,435
Tie them. Whip them. Now.

241
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,510
- What did I do?
- Oh, no.

242
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,400
Please, Khun Phra.

243
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,510
- Take them all.
- It's all Maiphlong, sir.

244
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,585
Why didn't you warn him?

245
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,330
- Did you?
- It's all on you.

246
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,560
Whip them. This instance.

247
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
- Please, Khun Phra.
- We apologize.

248
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,040
Come here.

249
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,920
Come here, now.

250
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,655
Tie them. Whip them.

251
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,535
Until they know better.

252
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
not to mess with me.

253
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,960
What do you take me for a fool?

254
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,545
Not at all, sir.

255
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,120
Even from Uranus, it's obvious
your auspicious sweets are fake.

256
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,855
Khun Phra, it's all my fault.

257
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,680
- Enough.
- I'm truly sorry.

258
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,440
Where's Ming? Ming.

259
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,730
- It's your fault.
- Oh man.

260
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,240
Don't chicken out.

261
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,870
Look at him.
He can barely stand.

262
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,200
How many whips
could he deliver?

263
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,240
Ming, carry on.

264
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,980
Still think he couldn't hurt us?

265
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,720
Listen to that sound.
So sharp.

266
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,720
Just the wind.
No strength behind it.

267
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,360
You go first, Sangthong.

268
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,360
Yeah, you.

269
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,880
- Wind, huh? Prove it.
- Fine then. Bring it on.

270
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,395
Ming, start with him.
Hard.

271
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,270
Yes, sir.

272
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,680
- Go on.
- Go on, buddy.

273
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,720
Give him a taste.

274
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,440
Alright, give me your best whip.
Show us.

275
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,080
Didn't hurt.

276
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,360
Feels like an ant bite.

277
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,250
Like a scorpion sting.

278
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,610
Keep at it, Ming.

279
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,830
More.

280
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,560
Not yet.

281
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,880
Not yet?

282
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,880
Still not yet?

283
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,320
Not done with me yet, Ming?

284
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,120
Ming, their turn.

285
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,480
- Khun Phra, please.
- Please don't. I beg you.

286
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,680
- I was wrong.
- Please don't whip me.

287
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,485
"Respect."
It's pronounced ri'spekt.

288
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,280
It means honor.

289
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,335
Im, who's screaming?
I can hear it from here.

290
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,655
Sounds like Sangthong,
Maiphlong, and Thongbai.

291
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,250
They probably upset Khun Phra
and got punished.

292
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,515
Everyone, let's continue the lesson.

293
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,960
The next words are

294
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,280
Right and Liberty.

295
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,960
Privilege and freedom.

296
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,385
"Right" means lawful
power to act freely.

297
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:20,535
"Liberty" means
personal freedom to do something

298
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,960
per a person's status and the law.

299
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,800
Suwanthani also has laws, Miss.

300
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,080
But they're for nobles, not slaves.

301
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,840
How can slaves have freedom?
Nobles must be above them.

302
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,520
Otherwise, how would they rule?

303
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,260
Rule or oppress?
Think about it.

304
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,920
Please teach nothing
beyond language.

305
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,550
Today, you may not understand me.

306
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,720
But if one day you rise to power,
remember this.

307
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,680
When you see people as equals,

308
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,360
then you'll be loved by people.

309
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,440
Come. Let's go watch them
getting punished.

310
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,160
I beg you.

311
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,800
Whip till they learn.

312
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,800
Hit harder!

313
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,585
Did you order these slaves
to be whipped?

314
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,335
Yes. It's their lesson.
Break the rules and be punished.

315
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,495
Merciless whipping
is not punishment.

316
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,360
It's barbaric.

317
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,590
The most barbaric!

318
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,455
Barbaric? They're slaves.

319
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,955
They're mine to command.

320
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,040
Slaves they are,
yet flesh and blood they remain.

321
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,175
They feel pain
just like you and me.

322
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,085
What if it were you
being mercilessly whipped?

323
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,330
Would you approve?

324
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, it's no use to explain
to a foreigner like you.

325
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,760
Fine. Since you've spoken up.

326
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,680
- Hmm, Ming.
- Yes, sir?

327
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Untie them.

328
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,980
- Hurry. Untie us.
- Quick.

329
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,470
Ah...it stings.

330
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,375
- Thank you, Miss.
- Thank you, Lady.

331
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,160
Get out of my sight.

332
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,640
"Get out of my sight."

333
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,170
Go on, now.

334
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,360
Yeah, go.

335
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,020
We were in pain, he wouldn't budge.

336
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,765
One word from her, he flipped.

337
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,570
Don't dawdle. I said go.

338
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,860
- Going, sir.
- Yes, sir.

339
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,840
Maiphlong, have you found it?

340
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,295
The round, wavy leaf.

341
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,680
Is this it?

342
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,880
For stir-fried in oyster sauce,
thumbs up.

343
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,545
No.

344
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,690
Those are chayote shoots.

345
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,545
How about this?

346
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,530
With crispy pork, heavenly.

347
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,175
This, then?

348
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,640
Sweet basil.
We ain't cooking tom yum.

349
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
This is it.

350
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,975
Gotu kola. Bingo.

351
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Hurry.

352
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,080
Alright. Put it down.

353
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,750
Gotu kola helps ease burning pain.

354
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,160
Still burning.

355
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,520
Grind it first.

356
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,270
Still not working.

357
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,310
Let him be.

358
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,240
Any tool to grind it with?

359
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
None.

360
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,520
But a natural grinder.

361
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,280
Wouldn't chewing dirty it?

362
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,835
It's fine.

363
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,975
It...

364
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,120
It...what now?

365
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,860
It works. Not dirty.

366
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,600
You should've told me
I was rubbing it.

367
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,080
So we daub it on the wound?

368
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,880
For how many days exactly?

369
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,360
The more often, the faster it heals.

370
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,160
Morning or evening?

371
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,320
Whenever you're free.

372
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,640
I'm a busy guy.
Can a friend do it?

373
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,075
Quit asking and
start grinding, will ya?

374
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,200
I smell like gotu kola, now.

375
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,000
What are you all doing?

376
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,560
Did I scare you?

377
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Not at all, ma'am.

378
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,815
What brings you to
the...slaves' quarters?

379
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,560
Don't tell me.
You followed us.

380
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,150
Hmm…

381
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,650
Yes.

382
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Hmm?

383
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,360
Just in time, ma'am.
Help us grind this.

384
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,600
Ahh… my wound.

385
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,620
It hurts.

386
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,480
Sit down. I'll treat your wounds.

387
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Ma'am,...

388
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,920
people might gossip about you
if you mingle with slaves like us.

389
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,600
Gossip about what?

390
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,360
Well, we're just slaves.

391
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,730
You teach Khun Phra's son.
Your status is way above ours.

392
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,240
If someone sees you with us,
it won't look good.

393
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,615
I have two arms and two legs,

394
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,655
and so do you.

395
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,280
I'm not above you. We're equals.

396
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,495
But it's alright, ma'am.

397
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,690
We'll manage. Come on.

398
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Keep grinding.

399
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,910
Don't turn down
her kindness, alright?

400
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,000
Put it down.

401
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's okay.

402
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,560
Ma'am, I'll go first, yeah?

403
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,240
See my back?
I got whipped the most.

404
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,360
It stings all over.

405
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,680
I'm using the stem,
crushed coarsely,

406
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
and packing it
over your wounds.

407
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,240
Why were they cruel?

408
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,400
How could you all endure this?

409
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,600
There's nothing we can do.

410
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,800
We were born slaves.

411
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,970
One can't choose the life
to be born into.

412
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,860
Born a slave? Just like that?

413
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
That's right.

414
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,440
It's something passed down by blood.

415
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,320
Born to a mother who was
a slave in Khun Phra's house,

416
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,154
I was marked to be
a household slave.

417
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,970
"Household slave"

418
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,360
That's how it goes.

419
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,640
But why call it a household slave?

420
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,640
My father was a slave.
My mother was a slave.

421
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,840
I was born in Khun Phra's house
and naturally became a slave.

422
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,325
My duty is to carry out
the master commands,

423
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,340
whether it's...

424
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,760
fishing, mopping, tethering horses,
feeding chickens.

425
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,855
Even massaging Khun Phra.
I do it all.

426
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,295
And do you get paid?

427
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,695
Paid.

428
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,280
I wouldn't dream of that.

429
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,275
Simple meals and living quarters
are all I could ask for.

430
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,280
But...I slack off a lot.

431
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,560
I make excuses and loaf around.

432
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You're done.

433
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,200
That was quick, ma'am.

434
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,290
- Go.
- This side, too.

435
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,345
- You're done.
- Go.

436
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,560
Let Maiphlong have some. Go.

437
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,320
Ma'am, uh...

438
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,160
my name is Maiphlong.

439
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,680
Are you also a household slave?

440
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,065
No.

441
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,200
I'm a bonded slave.

442
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,570
"What?"
What?

443
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,545
My father had gambling debts.

444
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,960
Come on. Bet big, win big.

445
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,360
Place your bets.

446
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Even.

447
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,895
Come on, even too.

448
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
I'm betting odd.

449
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Even.

450
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,880
Gambling was the air he breathed
and the trade he mastered.

451
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,485
What's it gonna be?
Bet more or stop here?

452
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,115
No stop. I'll bet.

453
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,340
One day, he gambled heavily
and lost everything.

454
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,120
What? No bets?

455
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,040
Can you spot me?

456
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,120
No way. No money. No play.

457
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,160
He sold things in the house.

458
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,720
In the end, nothing left
to sell but my mother.

459
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,040
And after that, it was...

460
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,105
me.

461
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,560
Scrawny prawn like you.

462
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,680
What can you do?

463
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,315
Looking for this?

464
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,080
Give me my money.

465
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,420
"Bonded slave"

466
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,765
Since that day,

467
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,150
I've been a slave
in Khun Phra's house.

468
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,070
Doesn't it hurt?

469
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Is it supposed to?

470
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,520
There you go.

471
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Thanks, ma'am.

472
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,695
And you? What kind of slave are you?

473
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,450
I'm the kind of slave
who was spared punishment.

474
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,280
Gather around. This way.

475
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,360
My greatest invention yet.

476
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,915
With this marvelous device,

477
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,650
you'll reach your destinations
faster than ever.

478
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,250
In the past, a trip to Sakonburi

479
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,120
would take you four days.

480
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,240
But with this device,
it'll take six days.

481
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,040
- What?
- What?

482
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,640
Just kidding.

483
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,080
Just two days.

484
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,640
- Come on, applause.
- Wow.

485
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,550
And...how does it work?

486
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,400
I want you to watch closely.

487
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,400
I'll show you.

488
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,560
Simply place your feet
on this wooden board,

489
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,140
hold the handle firmly,

490
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,960
and then push with your leg.

491
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,790
Here. Like this.

492
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,000
Here we go.

493
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,720
What a jaw-dropping invention.
Applause, then.

494
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,920
Woo-hoo.

495
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,640
Not as expensive as you think.
Try it out.

496
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,320
Let me give it a try.

497
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,360
Most pleased, sir.

498
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,120
- Go ahead, sir.
- Let me try it.

499
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,520
Like this?

500
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,200
Yes, sir, on the board.

501
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,120
- Keep pushing.
- Make way for me.

502
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
Clear the path.

503
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,890
Whoa.

504
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,880
Hey. How do I stop this?

505
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,280
How to stop this?

506
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Flying pigs.

507
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,240
- Stop.
- Don't run.

508
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,680
- Sit.
- Ow. Alright.

509
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,960
You must pay me
ten thousand Tamlung in damages.

510
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,655
How about ten thousand bean sprouts?
I'll trim them for you.

511
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,657
- Spare me.
- I want my money.

512
00:26:50,682 --> 00:26:52,705
You dare mock me.

513
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,760
I don't have ten thousand Tamlung.

514
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,440
But I grow it at home for soups.
(Tamlung, a homonym forcurrency and vegetable.)

515
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,295
You, charlatan.

516
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,800
Somebody, arrest this fraud. Oww.

517
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,160
Wait. I'm no fraud.

518
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,935
I've tested my device many times.

519
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,680
- Arrest him.
- No, don't.

520
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,660
Everyone, remain calm.

521
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,040
I am the police.

522
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,320
If you can't pay the fine,
you'll end up in jail.

523
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,205
At the time, I didn't know
what to do.

524
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,655
I didn't want to eat
chicken droppings in prison.

525
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,840
But then Khun Phra
came to my rescue.

526
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,120
I shall pay the fine
to the authorities.

527
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,010
In exchange, I'm taking him

528
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,560
as a slave in my household.

529
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,760
What say you?

530
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,220
Of course, sir.

531
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,520
Thank you so much, Khun Phra.

532
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,785
"Spared-punishment slave"

533
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,015
That's how it was.

534
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,575
At first, I thought
my life would be easy.

535
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
But it's alright.

536
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,675
I willingly accepted his offer.

537
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,015
Truth is, there are
many types of slaves.

538
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,000
If you're interested,
I'll tell you all about it.

539
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,220
They take advantage of you.
Why let them?

540
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,820
"Treat"
They treat you badly.

541
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,840
"Very bad."

542
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,800
You have the skill sets

543
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,975
to stand up and be on your own.

544
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,360
No need to remain
slaves like this forever.

545
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,280
We can't do anything about it.

546
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,200
We are like his property.

547
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,125
No rights to negotiate.

548
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,255
It's been this way for a long time

549
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,880
and likely will remain forever.

550
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,840
Nothing lasts forever.

551
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,240
You can have better lives than this.

552
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,390
It's the law of Suwanthani.

553
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,625
It's been this way for ages.
Nothing can change.

554
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,085
For slaves like us,

555
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,420
having food and a place to sleep

556
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,370
"Privilege"
is quite a privilege.

557
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,885
Nevertheless, I hope you...

558
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,200
"Cheer up"
cheer up.

559
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,320
I hope you will be freed
from slavery soon.

560
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,560
I must go.
Take care of yourselves.

561
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
Thank you, ma'am.

562
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,280
Well, you organized this gathering.

563
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Yet you arrive last.

564
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,580
Here, bring some
liquor for Khun Phra.

565
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,880
So he catches up.

566
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,000
Impatient as ever,
Khun Luang (Nobility title).

567
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,680
Don't run off.

568
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,400
Listen, I have important news

569
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,360
for you all here.

570
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:19,200
I wish to invite you to
my wedding with Nuanlaor.

571
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,840
A wedding?

572
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,240
She's pouting.

573
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,800
So Khun Phra Bamroekrung,
pulling in your claws?

574
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Correct.

575
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,280
Then tonight, more courtesans.

576
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,130
No. No more for me.

577
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,890
But really,...

578
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,640
I can't keep doing this.

579
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,800
I feel for Nuanlaor.
I don't want her to be sad.

580
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,485
Oh, you're becoming a faithful man.

581
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,240
Well, I must drink
to commend you.

582
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Alright.

583
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,320
- Let's toast.
- Cheers.

584
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,440
What a sanctimonious show.

585
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,720
Go ahead. Be fooled.
I, for one, won't be.

586
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,600
Behind closed doors,
your nature reveals.

587
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,880
Who knows what he's talking about.

588
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,800
Loudmouths keep on babbling.

589
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,750
We keep on celebrating.

590
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,780
When is the wedding?

591
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,440
On the day of the first waxing
moon of the tenth month.

592
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,895
First waxing moon
of the tenth month.

593
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,520
I recall an astrologer
once told my lord

594
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,400
that day would bring
doom upon the world.

595
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,120
A strange event,
a darkened sky, will occur.

596
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,680
It sounds silly.

597
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,360
Come now. The sky is just the sky.

598
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,480
Bright in the daytime.

599
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,920
No way it'll be pitch black.

600
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,560
Superstitious nonsense.

601
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,440
Said the man, itching
to take another wife.

602
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,480
If fireballs or plague
swept the land,

603
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,000
even the blackened sun itself,

604
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,320
none could deter
Khun Phra's resolve.

605
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,040
Yeah, that's true.

606
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,620
You're absolutely right.

607
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,000
I found a woman I love.
I'm marrying her. What's wrong?

608
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,335
Do I care what people say?

609
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,720
Let alone YOU.

610
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,290
Look at you.

611
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,310
Single and lonely.

612
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:32,784
Mature and able,
but nobody wants.

613
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,150
Pfft.

614
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,240
I choose my woman

615
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,800
to love and cherish.

616
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,580
Unlike you,

617
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,710
anything that moves is good enough.

618
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,415
Hey, Bamrungnakon.

619
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,855
Did you call me a dog?

620
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,345
If a dog comes to your mind,
then you're a dog.

621
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,720
Fool! You called me a dog?

622
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,790
I'll make you bleed.

623
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,600
Calm down, sir.

624
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,160
- Easy, easy.
- Please.

625
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,180
Calm down.

626
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,905
Don't pick a fight with
a worthless man

627
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,355
Everyone knows he's
jealous of you in every way.

628
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,240
Don't stoop to his level.

629
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,640
Alright, I'm calm now.

630
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,290
He should've known better.

631
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,600
Let us drink instead.

632
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,170
A blessed day calls for
a celebration.

633
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,920
If you don't heed my warning,

634
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,000
bane will come unforeseen.

635
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,920
Keep them coming.

636
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,175
"Green Lantern Brothel"

637
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,805
Bamrungnakon does have
a filthy mouth.

638
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,800
I should've knocked
a few teeth out.

639
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,120
Excuse me. You go back
and have some fun.

640
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,445
And tell them I'm covering
the whole table.

641
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,590
As you wish, Khun Phra Bamroekrung
the Magnificent.

642
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,560
Yeah, cheers.

643
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,925
Come to my wedding, yeah?

644
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,950
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

645
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,800
- Ladies.
- Yeah.

646
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,265
I must go now.
I'll return soon, okay?

647
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,840
- Be good, now.
- Yes, sir.

648
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,200
- See you.
- Yes, sir.

649
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,200
Watch where you're going.

650
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,040
Ugh. Got my clothes filthy.

651
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,280
Quite smashing, sir.

652
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,280
Left profile...Brad Pitt.

653
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,920
Right profile...Ben Affleck.

654
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,760
Look closer...oh, wow...

655
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Chris Evans!

656
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,960
Your nose hair needs a trim, sir.
May I?

657
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,560
Just teasing, sir.

658
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,800
You always joke around like a fool.

659
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,740
So, do I look sharp?

660
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:02,427
"Perfect"

661
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:04,966
"Perfect"

662
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,810
Good. Polish my shoes.

663
00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:11,520
"Perfect"

664
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,440
Hey, why'd you stop? Keep at it.

665
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,120
Chris Evans.

666
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,080
Thongbai.

667
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,485
Are you really challenging me?

668
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,695
You bet. And I'm going to beat you.

669
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,520
Fine. It's on.

670
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,720
Mount, sir.

671
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,465
You asked for it.

672
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,560
Oh, yeah.

673
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,720
Three, two, one.

674
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,630
Come on.

675
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,920
Hurry, young sir.

676
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,120
Oh, no.

677
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:16,120
(Ghost Crab Run: catch up and lash
the opponent with the flag.)

678
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,920
Phi (Endearment title) Sangthong.

679
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
Whatcha doing here?

680
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
What did you say?

681
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,560
Oh, a bug flew by, sir.

682
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:41,225
So I yelled at it,
"Whatcha doing here?"

683
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,880
Khun Phra's house is not your place.
Go away.

684
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,985
Play somewhere else. Go.

685
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,840
Your friends are getting in trouble.
Help them.

686
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,440
Go play somewhere else.

687
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,960
Let this old man
don his own wear.

688
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,320
It's so hard to pick
a wedding outfit.

689
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,280
Emergency.

690
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,040
Silent, will ya?

691
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,760
Did you tell me to shut up?

692
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,440
- Sangthong.
- I didn't mean to, sir.

693
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,080
You undressed me, too?

694
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,280
- Are you hurt?
- Okay, sir?

695
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,720
I'm sorry, sir.

696
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,200
Sorry, sir.

697
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,070
Sorry.

698
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,840
Thongbai, you fool.
You hurt my baby brother.

699
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,700
I'll tell on you.

700
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,640
- Please don't.
- I'm sorry, sir.

701
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,255
You...

702
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,660
- What happened?
- It was Maiphlong.

703
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,960
Why the commotion?

704
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,290
- Father.
- What is it?

705
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,600
These wretched two slaves tripped,

706
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,055
and my brother hit the ground.

707
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,100
- Not true, Khun Phra.
- Accident, sir.

708
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,240
That's it. You three are
getting out of hand.

709
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,630
I let you serve closely,

710
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,055
but you get ahead of yourself.

711
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,320
No sense of your place.

712
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,400
Where's Ming?
Ming, where are you?

713
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,405
Ming.

714
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,775
Lock them up now.

715
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,240
Please don't punish us.

716
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,890
- Khun Phra.
- We're sorry.

717
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,370
Have mercy, Khun Phra.

718
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,580
Ow, Uncle Ming.

719
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,760
Follow me.

720
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,585
Easy. My wounds hurt.
My hands too.

721
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,415
Get in.

722
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,300
No, no.

723
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,350
I didn't mean it.

724
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,720
Easy.

725
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,640
- The shirt's tearing my back scabs.
- Enjoy starving.

726
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,225
Oh, Uncle, locking us up
is bad enough.

727
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,480
Can't we eat?

728
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,360
If we die, that's
three laborers gone.

729
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,400
Is it wise?

730
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,295
Orders from Khun Phra.

731
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,000
You're locked up
until the wedding is over.

732
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,455
Uncle Ming, that's days away.

733
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,080
Khun Phra's child is fine
despite a little mishap.

734
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,640
Don't talk back. His word is final.

735
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,015
Even if I pity you,

736
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,200
I'm still a slave.
I must follow orders.

737
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,370
Slaves should help each other out.

738
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,895
Uncle Ming.

739
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,360
Great. Now, we can't
join the wedding feast.

740
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,585
I think it'll be just a few days.

741
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,895
We'll try begging Khun Phra.

742
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,135
Maybe he'll let us out early.

743
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,640
I'll speak for us.

744
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,860
I know you've got charm.

745
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,400
But do you really think
pleading with him will free us?

746
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,010
We're just slaves.

747
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,435
One little mistake, one wrong move,

748
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,920
and they order beatings
like we're cattle.

749
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,560
Even though we're human, too.

750
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,120
Pipe down, or we'll be
in deeper trouble.

751
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,145
Then just let me die.

752
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,225
No more orders and whipping.
There'll be no more pain.

753
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,080
I've served his boys faithfully.

754
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,655
Suffering is what I earn.

755
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,635
You know?

756
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,840
I'm starting to think
like the teacher.

757
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,160
Aren't we all equals?

758
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,780
Where is the justice?

759
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,710
Yeah.

760
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,200
Where's the justice?

761
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,040
"Khun Phra Bamroekrung's Wedding"

762
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,520
Congratulations, sir.
You look splendid today.

763
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,640
Of course. Today's my first wedding.

764
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,840
Didn't you count the past ones, sir?

765
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,305
Those didn't count.

766
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:16,085
Nuanlaor is the woman
I fell madly in love with.

767
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:20,485
So, everything today must
reflect my status and lineage.

768
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:24,265
Oh, it truly does, sir.

769
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,320
But, uh...where's your bride?

770
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
There.

771
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,145
Is that her, sir?

772
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,170
No.

773
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:03,130
Today is the wedding day, right?

774
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,750
I am famished.

775
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:10,290
Lady Jolie must look
absolutely ravishing.

776
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,215
How I long to see her.

777
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,755
Come on.

778
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,120
How could you dream of
a woman's face when starving.

779
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,840
My source of strength.

780
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,720
Oh, you.

781
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,080
Come to think of it,

782
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,930
I wish to attend
the wedding, too.

783
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,320
Over the few days,
I've withered like dried grass.

784
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,285
Ahem.

785
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,520
Kratai.

786
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,515
Yoo-hoo.

787
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,680
Where is my beautiful darling?

788
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,160
Will you send me away again?

789
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,110
Oh, now.

790
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,200
Please don't be mad at me.

791
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,860
I am but a...

792
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,840
loose-lipped, wretched
good-for-nothing

793
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,240
with nothing good
coming out of my mouth.

794
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,000
Fine, what do you want?

795
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,760
Help me break out of here.
Do you know any magic?

796
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,440
Oh please. Ghosts or humans
are no different.

797
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,320
Magic spells? Such nonsense.

798
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:16,830
But you have two options
to get out of here.

799
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,400
First, you die.

800
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:21,960
Oh, what a waste of time.

801
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,600
Second, serve your full sentence.

802
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,680
Even a simpleton like
Maiphlong knows those.

803
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,760
What a waste.
I thought you could help.

804
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,160
- Did you insult me?
- No.

805
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,620
Why the fuss?
Didn't you get the hint?

806
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,160
The first option, of course.

807
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,010
Oh.

808
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,940
- What?
- I got it.

809
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,880
- Maiphlong
- What?

810
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,200
You must die.

811
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:48,730
Hey.

812
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,020
This is the only way

813
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,440
to break out before our time.

814
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,640
You're right.

815
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,090
The dead must close their eyes.

816
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,090
Stay dead still.

817
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,600
- Uncle Ming.
- Uncle Ming.

818
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,400
Uncle Ming.

819
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,040
My friend is dead.

820
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,520
- Maiphlong is dead.
- My buddy.

821
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,080
What? What? I'm here.

822
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,320
-Hey.
- Ouch.

823
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
Sorry. I couldn't see.

824
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,400
- Ow, ow.
- Quiet.

825
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,130
Oh, hey.

826
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,080
He ain't dead.

827
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,840
Uncle Ming. Please listen to me.

828
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,360
We just don't want to be
left here to rot and die.

829
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,880
I've lost count of the days
since I last saw sunlight.

830
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,520
Days without food,
without a drop of water.

831
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,240
We are suffering
beyond imagination.

832
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,105
Now, we realize we did wrong.

833
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,215
Right?

834
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:53,920
What?

835
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,480
- Yeah, wrong.
- Wrong indeed.

836
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,640
By now, Khun Phra
must have forgiven us.

837
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,675
He must be at his wedding ceremony,

838
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:09,230
so happy he forgot
about us, Uncle Ming.

839
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,080
- Yes, yes.
- Uncle Ming.

840
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:19,440
Nobody cares about us,
low-life slaves.

841
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:22,280
You understand us, don't you?

842
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,120
You must understand us
better than anyone.

843
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,360
Please let us out.

844
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,000
Uncle, please.

845
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,720
Please, Uncle Ming.

846
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,600
The Best Actor Award
goes to...Sangthong.

847
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,800
Not possible.

848
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,935
You must serve your time,
or Khun Phra will have me whipped.

849
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,880
Oh no, nothing like that.
He won't care about triviality.

850
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,240
The bride is all on his mind today.

851
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,030
- Yes.
- Yes.

852
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,280
See? Keeping us locked up
serves no purpose anymore.

853
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,200
Just this once, you can
save our poor souls. Just once.

854
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,840
And we shall never forget
Uncle Ming's kindness.

855
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,520
Very well. But only this once.

856
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,480
And don't you dare
show your faces to him.

857
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,920
Or I'll be in trouble, too.

858
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,080
Woo-hoo.

859
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,100
Get going.

860
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,480
Move aside.

861
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:28,510
- Ow, hey.
- Woo-hoo.

862
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,200
- Ow.
- See you.

863
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:39,295
Hey, after this, I think
I'll swing by the wedding.

864
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,520
To find Lady Jolie.

865
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,160
You made a promise
to Uncle Ming.

866
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,110
That old uncle can't
remember a thing.

867
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,550
Don't want to?

868
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,515
You bet.

869
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,655
I'm always up for anything.
It's why we're out here.

870
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,720
Before we go,
I want to look decent.

871
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,600
I can't go like this.

872
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,720
Split up to bathe
and meet at the wedding.

873
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,840
Is that good?

874
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,860
I was wondering why it's bitter.

875
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,680
Let's go.

876
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,760
Sangthong.

877
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,840
You all shouldn't go to the wedding.

878
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,975
I have a bad feeling.
Something terrible will happen.

879
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,560
Don't let Khun Phra see you.

880
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,585
Now, what could
go wrong at a wedding?

881
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:43,825
I thought you said
you had no magic.

882
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:46,880
What's with this
bad-feeling nonsense?

883
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,785
I warned you.

884
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:50,810
I warned you.

885
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:54,341
"Up to you"

886
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,260
Please excuse me.
You have my warmest congrats.

887
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,480
Take care.

888
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

889
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,480
Khun Phra, sir.

890
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,880
The finest spirits in all of
Suwanthani, as I told you.

891
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,880
Finest, you say?

892
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,060
- Indeed, sir.
- Excellent.

893
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,600
One more, sir?

894
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,660
That's all.
I might lose my footing.

895
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,260
Much obliged.

896
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,200
Oh, you came as well, sir?

897
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,680
I didn't think you'd show up
after the scene the other night.

898
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,640
Am I not allowed?
Why? Any problem?

899
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,920
Not at all.
Make yourself comfortable, sir.

900
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,200
Do you think there's food?

901
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,320
Plenty.

902
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:37,610
Hey.

903
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,040
What happened?

904
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,200
Solar eclipse.

905
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:46,710
Solar what?

906
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,355
Never mind.

907
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,120
- Get out.
- Go away.

908
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:53,760
Go away.

909
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,040
Get away.

910
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,880
Thongbai, you didn't shoot
Khun Phra, did you?

911
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,200
Ever since you two knew me,

912
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,280
you think I had it in me?

913
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,535
You resent Khun Phra
as much as anyone.

914
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,920
If conspiring with the murderer,
you'll die like Khun Phra.

915
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,080
I'm sorry, Lady Nuanlaor.

916
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,220
But your tone sounds pleased.

917
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:19,720
Because you broke
the oath you made to me.

918
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,710
That's why you must die like this.

919
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,920
I shall prove it today.

920
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,480
Who the real killer is.
