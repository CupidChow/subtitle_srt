1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:02,485
This show is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to actual persons,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,650
living or dead, or real events
is purely coincidental and

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,990
not intended to offend any person,
profession, or organization.

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,250
My head hurts.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,835
Why do suspects keep popping up?

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,410
I say everybody was motivated
to kill Khun Phra.

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,880
Men like Khun Phra will be punished
when the final judgment falls.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,480
Ma'am killed Khun Phra?
Muen Int didn't?

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,280
Men like him are better off dead

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,975
so no one will be threatened
by him again.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,270
- Him gone, you're number one.
- Yes.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,530
So, you shot him, dead and gone.

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,580
Yes.

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,545
Muen Int has arrived, sir.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,791
Let him in.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Please, sir.

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,640
Good evening.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Please.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Ahem.

20
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,273
Ahem.

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,350
"Coffee or tea"
Coffee or tea?

22
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,190
Got manners?

23
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:26,927
- Dismissed.
- As you wish.

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,357
Pleasure to be here.

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,290
How may I serve, sir?

26
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:41,949
The royal administration
funded a bridge over a river.

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,327
They want it quick, okay?

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,874
There's a deadline to meet.

29
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,265
The royal administration's contract

30
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,195
must be handled quickly
to serve the people.

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,983
I understand your exigency.

32
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,175
That is my intention.
I knew you could help.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,380
Maybe you could...grease the wheels.

34
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,230
What exactly did you mean, sir?

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,605
The city laws allow the transport
of construction materials

36
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,175
during the day.

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,839
- Correct?
- Right, sir.

38
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:25,615
Well, it's insufficient.

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,865
I must do that at night, too.

40
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,305
So, I want you to ensure

41
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,925
my cargo is safe and secure.

42
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,815
What a substantial undertaking.

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,985
Dark streets. Heavy cargo.

44
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:51,415
This is going to put loads
on my shoulders.

45
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,930
How about a load in this chest?

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Ahem.

47
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,115
You must have been granted
a handsome budget for the bridge.

48
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,505
And you must have diverted
a hefty sum for personal gain.

49
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,023
Wouldn't you say this little chest

50
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,614
is but a mockery
of my sweat and tears?

"Mystery of the Deadly Sins"

64
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,240
Muen Int.

65
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,260
You and I have never coordinated.

66
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,138
But My friend assured me
you wouldn't be a tattletale.

67
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,250
So, you're summoned here.

68
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,280
Your reluctance is understandable.

69
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,040
I won't force you to do anything.

70
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,480
Spare me one moment.

71
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,495
My dear, sir.

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,065
I was not reluctant.

73
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,255
But my underlings are
dependent on me.

74
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,277
I would be remiss not to
negotiate on their behalf.

75
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,215
Looking inside again,

76
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,417
I find your generous contribution

77
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:12,250
is more than sufficient.

78
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,250
We'll use ink pads
like this as our pass.

79
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,251
I already advised my men.

80
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,015
"Deal"
It's a deal, sir.

81
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,240
"Very good"
Very good.

82
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,250
- Heh.
- Hmm.

83
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,265
You two have no
police-dignified look.

84
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,700
Show me you mean business.

85
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,640
Hey, our victim.

86
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,660
Whatchu got there?

87
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,155
Construction material?

88
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,349
It's illegal during nighttime.

89
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,020
What now?

90
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,468
Why show your face?

91
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,150
What's with the grinning?

92
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:13,808
Hey.

93
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,583
Why transport at this hour?

94
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,381
Have you got a permit?
You're entering Suwanthani.

95
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,665
Got a permit to show?

96
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,862
Blackened Teeth ink pad.

97
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:38,930
The symbol Khun Phra Bamroekrung
chose as a pass.

98
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,871
The ink pad covers for the cargo.

99
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,900
Not for the coolies.

100
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,805
Coolies must pay for the pass.

101
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,480
Otherwise, you'll be captured.

102
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,100
Spare us, sir.

103
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,930
Whatchu doing now?

104
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,015
We have no money
and yet to get the transport fee.

105
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,445
Any questions,
please ask Khun Phra, sir.

106
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,480
Hey.

107
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,715
Who are you to order me around?

108
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
What right have you?

109
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,475
You all want to pass?
You all must pay.

110
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,847
Otherwise, say hello to the slammer.

111
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,080
Your call.

112
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,780
Yeah?

113
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,845
Forget it, man.

114
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,965
- Hey.
- Hey.

115
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,185
- After them.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,966
Hey, you.

117
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:44,498
Anyway.

118
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,803
I get the cargo and the bribe.

119
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,515
Positive energy.

120
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,754
"Positive energy"

121
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:01,685
The illegal laborers ran away
before they were captured.

122
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,126
Our construction is delayed.
And we must face penalties.

123
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,050
Curses!

124
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,177
You did real good, Muen Int.

125
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,660
What will we do, sir?

126
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,245
You don't know, do you?
You're playing with fire.

127
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,610
Raaagh!

128
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,180
Blast.

129
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:26,649
Khun Phra held a grudge against me.

130
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,443
He reported me to my superiors.

131
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,276
I was stripped of my rank,

132
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,050
demoted,

133
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,390
forced to a measly wage,

134
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,782
"Police Station"
and sent to a distant post.

135
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,700
Everything fell apart,
fast and hard.

136
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,550
A total calamity.

137
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,690
- He's such an evil man.
- Yes.

138
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,105
- Him gone, you're number one.
- Yes.

139
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,390
- So, you shot him, dead and gone.
- Yes.

140
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,565
Now what?

141
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,774
I'm not sure. Let me think.

142
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,280
We can't stop now.
Allow me.

143
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,966
Hmm? What is it?

144
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,100
Oh.

145
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,585
What now, dear?

146
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,470
Are we playing police lock hold?
How cute.

147
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,425
Hey, what?

148
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,360
Quit being touchy-feely.
I'm not a woman.

149
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,160
I'm a man. Look.

150
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,390
Whoa.

151
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,150
Why did you trick me
with a woman's disguise?

152
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,320
Nong Sali, my dearest.
Please help me.

153
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,640
I'm not Sali.

154
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,840
Sali, you're in cahoots with him?

155
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,390
This can't be. No way.

156
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,735
You completely fooled me.
How's that possible?

157
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,860
You were drunk.

158
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,735
Who are you two?
What do you want from me?

159
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,395
We came to get your confession
of killing Khun Phra

160
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,560
and pinning it on us.

161
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,230
Wait a second.

162
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,600
I recognize you now.

163
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,160
Oh.

164
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,025
You are Khun Phra's slave.

165
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,495
How dare you do this to me?

166
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,690
Just you wait.
You shall face severe consequences.

167
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,070
No, it's you who will
face consequences. Murderer!

168
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,670
- Whatchu...?
- Do it.

169
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,140
Halt!

170
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,610
"Do not attempt. Imitated gun."

171
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,780
You are slaves.

172
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,725
But you dare accuse me?

173
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,715
You're asking for trouble.

174
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,805
Let me give you a clue.

175
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,071
Heads on pikes all over town.

176
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,250
Scared?

177
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,010
Too scared to scream?

178
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,460
Shriek!

179
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,010
Shriek!

180
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,730
Loose those coconut shells.

181
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,270
Wanna bash my head with those?

182
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Toss them.

183
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,930
Walk.

184
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,035
"Do not attempt. Imitated gun."
Halt.

185
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,370
I just thought of
an offer for you.

186
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,655
If you take me
to apprehend Thongbai,

187
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,205
I might consider forgiving you two.

188
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,579
How about that?

189
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,970
What do we do?

190
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,185
No choice.

191
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,730
Don't think about another stunt

192
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,005
because now I know

193
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,120
how cunning you both are.

194
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,530
Walk.

195
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,230
One step out of line,

196
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,560
a hole in your guts.

197
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,145
Keep walking.

198
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,702
Muen Int.

199
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,510
Hey.

200
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,370
Darn it.

201
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,210
You come here.

202
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,400
- Hey, hey.
- Let us go.

203
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,605
What business do the Ang Yi
brothers have at this joint?

204
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,438
Best you run while you still can.

205
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,635
Are you scared of them or not?
I'm confused.

206
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,815
We won't bow to you anymore.

207
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,540
You're one of those cops
who just threaten,

208
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,385
extort, and betray the people.

209
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,925
Good cops who serve and sacrifice

210
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,735
have my unwavering respect.

211
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,575
You, I have a beef with.

212
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,754
He leaves you no gap for a comeback.

213
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,310
Foul mouth.
This fight ain't yours.

214
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,380
You helped and fed me

215
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,050
because you knew I didn't do it.

216
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,160
And you were the one
who shot Khun Phra.

217
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,025
Please, Ma'am.

218
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,480
I beg you.

219
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,175
Tell me the truth.

220
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,035
Confess your crime.
Don't go on lying.

221
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,525
I don't want to die.

222
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,770
Will you, please?

223
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,240
We labor honestly
in our walks of life.

224
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,160
But you pervert the laws
to milk from us, immigrants.

225
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,815
You flip right to wrong
to pocket ill-gotten gains.

226
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,445
You press charges
and condemn us a gang of bandits.

227
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,740
Police officers like you

228
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,880
make us immigrants

229
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,980
come together and
cover for each other

230
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,311
so we don't fall victims to nobody.

231
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,270
Done yapping about
your miserable life?

232
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,610
If so, go on home.

233
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,925
No way.

234
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,475
This night is your doom, Muen Int.

235
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,660
Help.

236
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,800
Ang Yi brothers threaten
a police officer.

237
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,110
Yellow.

238
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,315
Is that all you got?

239
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,610
Hey, you two.
Help me get out of here.

240
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,645
And I won't press charges.

241
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,515
- Deal?
- Hey, hey.

242
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,305
Lawmen begging for safety?

243
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,590
- Who's gonna save the rest of us?
- Anyone but him.

244
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,930
Good cops are out there.

245
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,115
You two aren't with him.

246
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,250
Step aside.

247
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,173
Step aside,
and burnt are your hides.

248
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,570
"Gunshot"
A gunshot.

249
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Gun?

250
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,361
Sangthong. Maiphlong.

251
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,695
What's going on?

252
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,115
Where are you going, Ma'am?

253
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,380
Oh, no. No.

254
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,050
Out of my way, you two.

255
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,670
Got caught in a standoff.
How can we get away?

256
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,860
Muen Int, you got a gun.
Shoot your way out.

257
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,455
You're macho, right?
Don't hide behind our backs.

258
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,118
I said, "Stand aside."

259
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,770
If you do it, you'll be dead.

260
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,070
Will you two settle
your beef without us?

261
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,155
Yeah.

262
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,440
Move.

263
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,560
Don't move.

264
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,295
We want to move,
but he's got a gun, too.

265
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,625
Please don't shoot.

266
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,325
We're afraid.

267
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,380
I said, "Move."

268
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,900
I said, "Don't move."

269
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,610
Make a hole.

270
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,250
"Do not attempt. Imitated gun."
Last option.

271
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,155
I'll shoot this time for real.

272
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,565
If you want to walk away alive,

273
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,920
just let me

274
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,120
escape first.

275
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,470
Sangthong, help me.

276
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,541
Stay away, Ang Yi.

277
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,300
Get him.

278
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,490
Muen Int, sir.
Let him go, please.

279
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,225
- Please.
- No way.

280
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,955
Hey, you ain't brave
like in your story.

281
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,259
A story with no proof.
You, fools, fell for it.

282
00:16:09,696 --> 00:16:10,865
I knew it.

283
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:14,175
I could tell from
your scream outside, coward.

284
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,860
I hate to do it myself.

285
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,890
Gimme that.

286
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,180
Maiphlong. Maiphlong.

287
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,478
Why did you shoot?
They're Any Yi brothers.

288
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,515
Hey, why is your gun not firing?

289
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,250
That gun has no bullets. So what?

290
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:33,780
What?!

291
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,720
Quit yelling. I hate loud noise.

292
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,650
Spare me, brothers.
I beg you.

293
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,580
Spare me.

294
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,810
My life is ruined.
Take what's left and...

295
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,340
Spare me. Spare my life.

296
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,400
Am I dead?

297
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Hmm?

298
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,810
Hey?

299
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,410
I'm alive.

300
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,770
Big fluke.

301
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,215
Ain't dead yet, suckers.

302
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,625
I'm destined for high ranks,
Muen or Khun,

303
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,895
as fools like you lay dead.

304
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,155
Muahaha.

305
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,958
I'm alive.

306
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,355
Stop shooting.
I can't stand the noise.

307
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,115
Please.

308
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,690
At Khun Phra's wedding,
gunfire rang out to chase Rahu away.

309
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,915
Why weren't you afraid?

310
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,290
Because I'm a smart man.

311
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:49,305
I knew there'd be loud gunfire,
so I came prepared.

312
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,510
- What?
- Come on.

313
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
I can't stand it.

314
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,100
Oh? Huh?

315
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,300
Huh?

316
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,210
Go, go.

317
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,120
Where?

318
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,220
Hey, go.

319
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:24,000
Now, I can hear the birds.

320
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,610
Oy, Muen.

321
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,000
I have up to here
with your big talks.

322
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,695
Where are they now?

323
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,385
- Hey.
- Hey.

324
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,540
You're a dead meat.

325
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,035
- A dud.
- New bullet.

326
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,360
With me. Quick.

327
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,200
Follow him.

328
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,530
We got lucky.

329
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,895
Sangthong.

330
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,315
Maiphlong.

331
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,100
What happened upstairs?
I heard gunshots.

332
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,130
Are you safe?

333
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,430
- Look here.
- I'm fine.

334
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,255
We got caught in the crossfire
between Ang Yi and Muen Int.

335
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,386
He got away as they went after him.

336
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:12,641
Hey, Thongbai.

337
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,745
I've got something to tell you.

338
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,290
Muen Int confessed
that he killed Khun Phra.

339
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:22,222
Really?

340
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:25,780
So, I'm free?
Thanks a lot you two.

341
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
Excuse me?

342
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,868
"Police"
That police said

343
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,585
he killed Khun Phra?

344
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,675
Yes, Ma'am.

345
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,520
He told me and Sangthong that.

346
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,920
Now, the trifecta of Sangthong's
sleuth formula is complete.

347
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,300
First, a confession.

348
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,460
Second, a motive.

349
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,455
Third, a gun.

350
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,770
I am free. Yay.

351
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,295
Can we tell the police
to catch Muen Int, then?

352
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,515
I don't think they'll do it

353
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,945
because they're all
under his command.

354
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,395
He could flip the laws in his favor.

355
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,165
Even with his confession,

356
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,624
the police wouldn't
believe us slaves.

357
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,720
I agree.

358
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,935
He now knows we helped Thongbai.

359
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,147
He's probably going to pile
more charges onto us.

360
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,060
Thongbai, if I'm correct,
he's coming to get you now.

361
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,245
A scapegoat, you mean.

362
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,615
Must all officers obey his commands?

363
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,955
The chain of command.

364
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,335
Always follow orders
from their superiors.

365
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,635
I once talked to
a few good policemen.

366
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,717
They know right from wrong,

367
00:20:56,742 --> 00:20:58,365
but they don't want trouble.

368
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,535
Well, trouble's coming
for me right now.

369
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,920
Let's find a hiding place.

370
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,475
Can I suggest?

371
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,905
You come with me to
the mission station.

372
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,415
But you could get in trouble, too.

373
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,945
Hardly. The police never bother us.

374
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,220
It's safe for all of you.

375
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,333
Hey, she promises. Let's go.

376
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,655
The police could get here soon.

377
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,505
Yeah. Let's go.

378
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,590
- Okay.
- Good, good.

379
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,820
Thank you, Ma'am.

380
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,970
Come, come.

381
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,975
I pray to the divine.
Please spare my life.

382
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,500
Ang Yi brothers are coming
to take revenge on me.

383
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,850
Please don't let that happen.

384
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,385
Did you see him?

385
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,940
He came this way, Hia (leader).

386
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,340
Something is in my hands.

387
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,260
Right there.

388
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,230
Muen Int.

389
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,160
Come out.

390
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,630
Show your face or you're doomed.

391
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,245
- Hey.
- Halt.

392
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,395
Halt.

393
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,765
Stop now.

394
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,175
Drop your weapon.

395
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,990
You're being charged
with inciting civil unrest.

396
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,380
Praise be to the divine
for sparing my life

397
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,808
and showing mercy
upon a good man like me.

398
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,463
So be it.

399
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Walk.

400
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,755
Smell something rotten?
Like a dead dog?

401
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,650
Must've been dead for days.

402
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,155
It's me.

403
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,675
Were you insulting me?

404
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,720
Sorry, sir.
We didn't know you'd be here.

405
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,895
I chased down these two,
but they threw wet trash at me.

406
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,745
I didn't do it.

407
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,242
Shut up. Lock them up.
Throw away the keys.

408
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,875
My, my. Ang Yi.

409
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,245
It's me who gave you places
to live and trade.

410
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,075
But you're ungrateful to your host.

411
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,445
Suwanthani gave immigrants
a new home.

412
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,445
We came with no privilege.

413
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,515
We pay tolls, taxes, and rent.
We managed ourselves.

414
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,265
No one has done us any favors.

415
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,215
Keep complaining.

416
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,805
If you're not happy,
leave this town.

417
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,158
What right have you to expel me?
I'm not invading your door.

418
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,060
Hoy. Hon.

419
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,665
He is arguing with me
and insulting me.

420
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,180
Punish them.

421
00:24:08,295 --> 00:24:09,535
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

422
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,625
Walk.

423
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,810
Hold it.

424
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,760
I have one more assignment.

425
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,075
Those three slaves were hiding
in the brothel.

426
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,585
But they've escaped.

427
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,365
Find them. Hard target search.

428
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,675
Every residence, farmhouse,
hen house, and dog house.

429
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,015
Sir, yes, sir.

430
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,325
- Carry on.
- Go. Walk.

431
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,390
- Walk.
- Hey, hey.

432
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,390
Quickly.

433
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,835
How dare you disrespect me?

434
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,902
I promise you this, Thongbai.

435
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,808
You will kneel on
the execution ground.

436
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,395
Sangthong, think of
something else next time.

437
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,660
No more silly disguise.

438
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,200
I did work, nonetheless.

439
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,470
Hey, is it straight?

440
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,150
Forget that, will ya?

441
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,975
- Thongbai.
- Hmm?

442
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,285
Is this place always this quiet?

443
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,286
When I first came,
others were around,

444
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:20,351
but tonight it's eerily silent.

445
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,070
Whatchu thinking?

446
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,220
A little spooky. Don't you get it?

447
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,440
- We'll pray before bed, then.
- Mm-hmm.

448
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,650
Ma'am, is there nobody else here?

449
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,400
Oh, uh.

450
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,790
The others have gone to
spread the faith in the provinces.

451
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,975
Here are blankets
for you to use tonight.

452
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,685
Thank you so much.

453
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,140
You've been so kind to us.

454
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,810
Show your gratitude to the Lord.

455
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:06,325
He has destined me to spread love
to my fellow humans.

456
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,575
You've been through a lot. Rest now.

457
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,760
Good night.

458
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,220
Good night, Ma'am.

459
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,080
Showing off again.

460
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,350
I'm tired. Let's hit the sack.

461
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,886
Don't stress out. Sleep.

462
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:30,221
Stress will give you
bad dreams, okay?

463
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,166
Maiphlong. Can you spell "tired"?

464
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,900
T

465
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,040
I

466
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,190
R

467
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,830
and...

468
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,280
Not sure.

469
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,100
I was sarcastic.

470
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,970
Will you stop?

471
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,070
Well, I couldn't help it.

472
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,017
How do you have any strength left?

473
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,825
I always stay fit.

474
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,039
And now we're up against Muen Int.

475
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,650
Speaking of him, I think
he may not be the murderer.

476
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,345
Why not?

477
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,970
You saw his showdown
with the Ang Yi brothers.

478
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,570
Terrified of gunfire,
he carried an unloaded gun.

479
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,055
He's a coward, not a murderer.

480
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,309
But he said he shot Khun Phra.

481
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,970
A lie for sure.

482
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,440
Might as well say that
to scare Ang Yi brothers.

483
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,778
A new twist, huh?

484
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,918
We must find the murderer
to clear Thongbai's name.

485
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:53,126
What will we do?

486
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,530
Don't worry.

487
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,930
We won't desert you.

488
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,554
We'll find the murderer.

489
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,640
Thank you two for helping me.

490
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,550
But...

491
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,460
I've got something to tell you.

492
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,020
What is it?

493
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,645
What do you know?

494
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,670
Go ahead.

495
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:42,515
Ma'am, I overheard your conversation

496
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,875
with a foreigner
at the mission station.

497
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,800
Will you tell me the truth?

498
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,320
I don't want to be a scapegoat.

499
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,690
At Khun Phra's wedding,

500
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,835
you might think no one saw
what happened.

501
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,010
But I did.

502
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,320
What did you see?

503
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,760
I saw Khun Phra.

504
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,680
What?

505
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,815
He slapped her face?

506
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,455
Yeah. Like this.

507
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
There.

508
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,670
Why would he do that?

509
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,864
Weren't you listening?

510
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:29,650
Khun Phra dishonored Lady Jolie.

511
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,040
"Khun Phra Bamroekrung's Wedding"

512
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,130
I'll swing by the wedding
to find Lady Jolie.

513
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,995
Before we go,
I want to look decent.

514
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,465
I can't go like this.

515
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,040
Split up to bathe
and meet at the wedding.

516
00:29:48,026 --> 00:29:49,186
Hmm.

517
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,090
Is that good?

518
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,945
I was wondering why it's bitter.

519
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,150
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

520
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,360
Bing bong.

521
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,890
Khun Phra will be most pleased.

522
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,845
That's him and Lady Jolie.

523
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,030
What's going on?

524
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,650
You look simply irresistible.

525
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,250
Even more than my bride.

526
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,210
Did you...have too much to drink?

527
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,085
Today's your wedding.
Please don't say that.

528
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,837
Why not? You really have it all.

529
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,490
Beauty.

530
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,340
Scent.

531
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,725
Like an exotic rose.

532
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,050
Regrets, I would be laden with

533
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,738
if I didn't claim this rose as mine.

534
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,640
I think...best I fetch someone
to look after you.

535
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,360
Stop right there.

536
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,141
Stay for a bit, yeah?

537
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,409
Just one whiff.

538
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,010
Come on.

539
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,650
Let go.

540
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,050
Hmph.

541
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,075
Stop. Not all women will
tolerate this behavior.

542
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,935
I, for one, will not.

543
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,255
Whatever sins you did in darkness,
God sees in light.

544
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,538
Tribulation may come
before the End Times.

545
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,022
Foul mouth.

546
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,520
You slap and lecture me?

547
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,785
Suwanthani gives you a home.

548
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,860
But you show an attitude
toward the city lord.

549
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,585
So far, I've shown you generosity
for your growth in life.

550
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,000
If you repay me with this,
you're not welcome.

551
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,580
Out, git!
Leave.

552
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,720
Go on.

553
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,935
He got really mad.

554
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,320
Hey?

555
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,535
- He was really rude to her.
- Yeah.

556
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,930
- Why are you telling us now?
- Yeah...hmm?

557
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,990
Are you crazy?

558
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,685
We were always on the run
without any place to sleep.

559
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:16,600
So, I forgot to tell you
until I met her again.

560
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,645
Besides, what Sangthong told us
makes sense to me.

561
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,595
Every murder has a motive.

562
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,558
This conflict is her motive
to kill Khun Phra.

563
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,690
- A motive.
- Yeah.

564
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,690
A single incident

565
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,955
hardly gives a reason
for murder, right?

566
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,600
Yeah.

567
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,837
Not too merciless?

568
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,085
How many more kisses would've
justified his death?

569
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,085
I didn't mean to be blunt.

570
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,405
What I meant was

571
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,535
- he offended her...
- Mm-hmm.

572
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,330
- hugging and kissing...
- Mm-hmm.

573
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,160
- so she took his life.
- Mm-hmm.

574
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,210
Didn't she go too far?

575
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,740
Hmph. Why did I listen to you?

576
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,916
Have you any thoughts
about how she felt?

577
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,725
Hold, hold. Stop.

578
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,910
Let me tell you.

579
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,705
Not just once.

580
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,730
- Huh?
- What?

581
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,450
Good morning.

582
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,355
My name is Jolie Edwards.

583
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,915
You can call me Jolie.

584
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,450
I'm so glad to be here.

585
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,056
And nice to meet you.

586
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,965
Beats me.

587
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,580
No idea what she's saying.

588
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,205
Please call me Jolie.

589
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,470
So nice to meet you.

590
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,447
My, you can speak Thai.
Why didn't you say so?

591
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,045
But tell me, how do the foreigners

592
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,690
greet each other?

593
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
Like this?

594
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
Or...

595
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,250
Like this?

596
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,405
Or...

597
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,580
Like this?

598
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,845
Nothing like that.

599
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,870
Just...

600
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,790
a handshake.

601
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,655
My, a greeting as soft as silk.
A rare delight.

602
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,545
From the moment they met,
he began charming her.

603
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,000
She could barely believe it.

604
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,760
Time to let go?

605
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:38,725
So, today, I'll continue reading
Uncle Tom's Cabin from yesterday.

606
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:44,465
As Augustine St. Clare wanted to
return the favor,

607
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,725
he purchased Tom
from a slave trader.

608
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,910
And then...

609
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,200
Juk and the kids are playing
banana stalk popguns.

610
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,358
Let's join them.

611
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,834
Excuse me. What about our class?

612
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,330
Don't you know?

613
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:02,053
This class will unlock futures
many others won't have.

614
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,850
My father is a Khun Phra.

615
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,190
He's loaded with money.

616
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,220
Why must I study?

617
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,330
I'm all provided for all my life.

618
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,855
Your education is the key

619
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,435
to becoming a royal official,
as your father wants you.

620
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,972
Even without education,

621
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,740
I can become an official.

622
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,410
My father knows certain people.

623
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,795
Aren't you ashamed of that?

624
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,360
"Corruption"
You speak of corruption

625
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,082
like it's an everyday thing.

626
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,265
That's how things go.

627
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,175
He has connections so he uses them.

628
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,655
What kind of society
will you grow up in

629
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,228
if negligence toward corruption
is standard

630
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,675
and people speak of it with pride?

631
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,275
I must consider
a whole new coursework.

632
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,408
Mere English skills aren't enough.

633
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,130
You're not allowed to go play.
Our class will continue.

634
00:36:00,513 --> 00:36:02,763
Defiant spirit? How dare?

635
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:09,115
"Skill" Her skills and
Western free spirit gleamed.

636
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,975
Her words unchained women's voices.

637
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,860
With all that, his lust
burned darker.

638
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,945
Are you tired?

639
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,605
My children must've
put you through a lot today.

640
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,300
It's my duty and I enjoy teaching.

641
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,610
Then, could you teach me

642
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,780
just what L-O-V-E is?

643
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,540
I'd like to know.

644
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,850
Love, sir.

645
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,870
My, you just gave me a love lesson.

646
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Well.

647
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,545
Here's your compensation

648
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,720
for today's work.

649
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,785
Oh, dear.

650
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,680
It slipped through my fingers.

651
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:34,539
Loving hearts beat the same tune.
So, we meet.

652
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,445
Please excuse me.

653
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,305
At first, she paid no mind.

654
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,415
Coincidence, maybe.

655
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,540
But I knew him far too well
that it was his intent.

656
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,135
Later, as if she suspected him,
the classroom changed

657
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,620
to the minor house.

658
00:38:02,503 --> 00:38:06,875
I kept satisfaction to myself
that she distanced herself.

659
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,994
I almost threw a rag on his face.
I came to my senses first.

660
00:38:11,812 --> 00:38:14,868
But I still fail to see her motive.

661
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,285
Even though she's
a liberated westerner,

662
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,190
she's still a pious missionary
sharing God's word.

663
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,155
Ow, why don't you finish
your train of thought?

664
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,791
What were you trying to say?

665
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,120
I mean,

666
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,200
a super nice lady
shooting a man dead?

667
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,930
Does she even know how?

668
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,975
Let me clue you in on something.

669
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,250
Lady Jolie pulled off a real show.

670
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,175
Excellence shots, Khun Phra.

671
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,055
True marksmanship.

672
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,525
One climbing perch and
one snakehead fish were hit.

673
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,393
I was aiming at those jars.

674
00:39:17,753 --> 00:39:19,953
Thought you had your sight
over there.

675
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,190
Reload.

676
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,495
Of course, sir.

677
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,643
I know your next bullets
will fix on those jars, sir.

678
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,065
Khun Phra.

679
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:41,526
Your gunfire was
interfering with my lecture.

680
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,541
Your children couldn't concentrate.

681
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:50,552
Your beauty must be the reason
I kept missing those jars.

682
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,890
May I suggest?

683
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,625
You look tired from teaching.

684
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,595
How about a break
from teaching to studying?

685
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,780
Bring the gun.

686
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:05,330
I'll teach you hand-in-hand.

687
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,430
Here. Gently.

688
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,630
Some weight, huh?

689
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,430
Go on.

690
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,227
I can do more than you think.
You don't get to teach me.

691
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,634
Marks-woman-ship, sir.

692
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,830
A star shooter, for sure.

693
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,575
Hey, you know more than he does.

694
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,307
Should've told us sooner.
Left us clueless all this time.

695
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,660
You would've had no clue either way.

696
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,865
- Hey, sorry.
- Boys, boys.

697
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,225
I thought she was
a good person.

698
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,990
How could I suspect her?

699
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,575
Would she have to be a suspect?

700
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,284
You never saw her as a good person
but as a beautiful woman.

701
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,120
"Beauty privilege"
You gave her beauty privilege.

702
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,310
Not true.

703
00:41:06,414 --> 00:41:07,994
Maybe a tad.

704
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,085
But...she helped Thongbai.

705
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,435
Yeah, that explains it.

706
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,720
She did it because she felt guilty.

707
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:26,318
Sangthong.

708
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,975
Admit it.

709
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,925
Love has clouded your judgment.

710
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,110
Not true.

711
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
Maybe a bit.

712
00:41:37,615 --> 00:41:38,645
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

713
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,830
All right.

714
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,533
Regardless, I agree with Maiphlong

715
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,995
that a lovely lady

716
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,010
wouldn't be so aggressive
as to kill a man.

717
00:42:03,424 --> 00:42:07,755
Not enough just his shoes.
Gotta shine his wives' shoes, too.

718
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
Tch.

719
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,410
Won't you have some?

720
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,660
Ow...Ma'am. What brings you here?

721
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,025
This is for you.

722
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,127
I'm a slave. I can't take that.

723
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,005
Come on.

724
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,760
Just a few from my cooking class
for Nuanlaor today.

725
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,195
You can have some.

726
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,045
Hey, these are delicious.
They're called churros.

727
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,225
Sweet and crispy.

728
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,890
Sweet treats will get you
through hard days with ease.

729
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,100
Not even a try?

730
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,100
Fine.

731
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,180
For the birds.

732
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,135
- I'll crush you.
- Hey, hey.

733
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,015
- You ate it all?
- Hey, hey.

734
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
Stop.

735
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,090
Come on.

736
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,005
We got nothing.

737
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,010
- Don't ever do that again.
- Forgive me. I'm so sorry.

738
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,425
Focus on the good lady,
not the snacks.

739
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,705
But you took it all to yourself.

740
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,765
No use listening to you two.

741
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,020
Let's go straight to her.

742
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,360
Hey, hold on.

743
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:38,041
If you do that,
her feelings could get hurt.

744
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,910
What the...?

745
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,875
She gets hurt.
Or he gets executed.

746
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,770
- Choose one.
- Choose.

747
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,410
I give you one, wise guy.

748
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,550
You ask her, will ya?
Get this over with.

749
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,460
Yeah.

750
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,775
Aren't you coming with me?

751
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,370
- Alright. Coming with you.
- Quickly.

752
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,170
You said you wouldn't desert me.

753
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,620
- We're up. Let's go.
- Yeah.

754
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,260
Ma'am.

755
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,985
Where are you?

756
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,170
Ma'am.

757
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:16,930
Where are you lady?

758
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,680
Ma'am. Come out here.
I beg you, please.

759
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,280
Ma'am.

760
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,370
Hello?

761
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,170
Ma'am.

762
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,020
Ma'am.

763
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,420
Ma'am.

764
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,260
Show yourself and tell us the truth.

765
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,695
Ma'am.

766
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,675
Ma'am.

767
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,420
- Found her?
- No.

768
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,970
And you?

769
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,130
No.

770
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,290
But I found this.

771
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,200
Hey, we're in an emergency
not in a restaurant.

772
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,950
Well, I haven't eaten all day.

773
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,395
Oh, yeah. You had the lady's soup.

774
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,883
That's why you're not hungry.

775
00:45:08,196 --> 00:45:10,688
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

776
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,915
Resume our search.

777
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,545
You, upstairs.
And you that way.

778
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:18,730
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

779
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:19,890
- Hey.
- Wait.

780
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,095
And you?

781
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,665
I'll be here
in case she sneaks out at the front.

782
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,696
Hmm...sounds lazy,
but I see your reason.

783
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:28,880
Okay.

784
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,200
Ma'am.

785
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,300
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

786
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,130
Are you upstairs?

787
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
Ma'am.

788
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,282
Where could she be?

789
00:45:40,765 --> 00:45:42,948
"Green Lantern Brothel"

790
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,710
Muen Int.

791
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,290
- Gun, sir.
- Watch out.

792
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,385
It's the truth.
I never knew those three men.

793
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,830
You were with them the whole time,

794
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:03,375
but failed to notice their disguise.

795
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,150
Hey, Phuangsoi.

796
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,905
Are you saying I'm stupid or blind?

797
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,290
Whatever you think you are.

798
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,760
I don't believe your lies.

799
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:18,745
I know you colluded with them.

800
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:22,385
Tell me where they are.

801
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:28,040
If not, it's time to say goodbye
to the Green Lantern Brothel.

802
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,620
How's that? Tell me.

803
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,120
I saw one of them.

804
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,155
He came with Lady Jolie.

805
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,560
Phuangsoi...let her speak.

806
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,535
I saw them talk and leave together

807
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,555
when you were fighting Ang Yi.

808
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,900
You're not lying, yeah?

809
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,085
No, I'm not.

810
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,655
Hoy. Hon.

811
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,720
Apprehend them
at the mission station.

812
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:55,590
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

813
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,575
And...are you coming with us, sir?

814
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,993
Of course. Nothing for me here.

815
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,910
Ouch...he frightened me.

816
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,020
"Kissing and hugging
as a motive for murder?"

817
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,897
"Maybe so. We draw lines
to keep people out."

818
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:28,430
"Khun Phra happened
to cross hers."

819
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,960
"And she happened
to not tolerate it."

820
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,390
"If I were her,
I would lose my temper, too."

821
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,395
Did she actually shoot him?

822
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,675
"Not with a lethal intent, maybe?"

823
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,085
"But Khun Phra accidentally died."

824
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:48,685
An accident.
Yeah, that's it.

825
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,295
Hrr...Sangthong.

826
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,010
You must stop defending her.

827
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,650
Your friend has faith in you.

828
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:00,325
"Lady Jolie and Thongbai."

829
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,975
"There must be a way
to prove their innocence."

830
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,330
"Think. Sangthong, think."

831
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,420
Who's out there?

832
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,885
Muen, watch out, sir.

833
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,100
- What?
- Oh, it's only Hon's shadow.

834
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:20,900
Come on.

835
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,620
Muen Int.

836
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,915
How does he know?

837
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,160
So this is the mission station.

838
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,160
Yes, sir.

839
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,725
Maiphlong.

840
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,430
Thongbai.

841
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,165
What is it?

842
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,325
Shh. Shh.

843
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,815
- Found her?
- No, no.

844
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,000
Shh.

845
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,190
- What?
- Shh.

846
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:02,005
Muen Int and police officers
are outside.

847
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:03,190
For real?

848
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,250
For real, but pipe down, will ya?

849
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,010
How did they find us?

850
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,180
It's her.

851
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,260
Lady Jolie must have
tipped them off.

852
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,130
Listen up.

853
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,380
Those three slaves must be captured
at all costs.

854
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:29,295
In public, they'll face
commensurate punishment

855
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,560
for their crimes

856
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,025
to set an example for others.

857
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,210
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

858
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,840
She saved your life.

859
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,085
How could you suspect her?

860
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:45,240
She didn't save my life.
She only gave me food.

861
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:51,865
Is he saying her kindness
was just a bait?

862
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:55,920
Maybe.

863
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,225
Jeez.

864
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,395
That's it.

865
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,593
Why didn't I suspect when you said
she was all good?

866
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:05,625
I don't know what to think anymore.

867
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:09,600
What am I to do?
They'll catch me for sure this time.

868
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,670
I don't wanna go to prison and die.
Help me.

869
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:13,790
Think, Sangthong.

870
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,510
You're our brain. Think, buddy.

871
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:16,670
Please, please.

872
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,745
I don't wanna die.

873
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:20,770
Ready?

874
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,920
If they resist the arrest,

875
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,940
use lethal force.

876
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,530
Charge.

877
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,080
I surrender.

878
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,085
Come on, Sangthong.

879
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,735
This is the time you give her up.

880
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,640
Are you letting your friend
be a scapegoat?

881
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,735
You killed Khun Phra.

882
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,340
And you're kidnapping
Lady Nuanlaor's sister.

883
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:21,870
Please don't tell anyone.

884
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:25,036
Not a soul, okay?
I beg you. Please.

885
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,045
I am Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

886
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:31,335
My honesty extends
from thoughts to speech.

887
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,520
Khun Phra Bamroekrung.

888
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,580
I can't believe
your very tongue is steeped in sin.
