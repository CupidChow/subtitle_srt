1
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,679
He didn't do anything to you, did he?

2
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,639
Of course not.

3
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,719
Time is running out.

4
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,560
What's the matter? Speak.

5
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,359
After you arrived in Mikde,

6
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,440
did you switch to a local number?

7
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,560
Kunka gave us a few.

8
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,319
What's wrong?

9
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,719
There's a guy who asked me to help him launder money.

10
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,999
He wants me to find someone named Ma Shuai.

11
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:03,480
Ma Shuai?

12
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,639
A few years ago, Ma Shuai was also part of a drug trafficking group.

13
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,600
Later, the police cracked down on them.

14
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,319
I heard he went underground and started laundering money.

15
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,919
No one has been able to track him down since.

16
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,559
Why are you suddenly asking about him?

17
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
It's one of our...

18
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,520
Right.

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,119
It's a domestic case we're working on.

20
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
We've traced it to him.

21
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,679
Do you have any information on him?

22
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,720
I'll have to look for his file.

23
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,520
But it's all old information.

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,119
I only remember that when he was raided,

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,399
he was shot.

26
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,000
His left eye was damaged.

27
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,839
I think his vocal cords were also injured.

28
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
What's up, Captain Jiang?

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,520
With such obvious features, he should be easier to find.

30
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,440
With features that obvious,

31
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,800
do people in the underworld all know about him?

32
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,679
I heard that people in the underworld

33
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:53,000
gave him a nickname.

34
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,759
They call him

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,679
One-Eyed Shuai.

36
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,440
Captain Jiang

37
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,440
When did you start suspecting

38
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,000
that Wei Qiang was connected to Kunka?

39
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,600
Back at the scrap steel plant.

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,600
We had clearly already gotten the situation under control,

41
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,079
but Kunka’s men still shot at Wei Qiang.

42
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,239
They were aiming to kill him.

43
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,280
I suspect

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,319
that Kunka and Wei Qiang are secretly colluding.

45
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,519
Kunka was worried that if we caught Wei Qiang,

46
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,639
he’d be exposed.

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,720
So they tried to silence him.

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,759
Then why did you

49
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,359
still leak Ma Shuai’s situation to him?

50
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,079
Look,

51
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,840
Lao Gou

52
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,319
has been Wei Qiang’s trusted aide for over ten years.

53
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,720
Just using his mother alone

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
might not be enough to turn him.

55
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,720
If

56
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,000
Kunka and Wei Qiang are colluding,

57
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,359
Kunka will definitely

58
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,639
tell Wei Qiang about this.

59
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,199
Wei Qiang would never allow

60
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,239
anyone to launder money behind his back.

61
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,440
He’d cut off Lao Gou’s escape route first.

62
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,519
The rest depends on Qin Lang

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,919
and whether he can get Wei Qiang to take the bait.

64
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,440
So if Kunka is a problem,

65
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,519
what should we do?

66
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,120
Why do you have so many questions?

67
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,880
Can’t you wait to ask them back at the station?

68
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
You ask so many questions every day.

69
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:20,280
Drive.

70
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,239
This is Captain Jiang's.

71
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:51,039
You can reach him by calling this number.

72
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,720
Hey, what are you doing?

73
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:55,880
Go, go, go.

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,960
Feng Zhou, are you done yet?

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,039
Brother Gou is waiting.

76
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,039
Feng Zhou.

77
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,120
Feng Zhou.

78
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,200
I'm calling you and you don't answer, what are you doing?

79
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,919
I'm trying, bro.

80
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,840
You...

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,999
Why don't you wait for me outside?

82
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,960
Brother Gou is rushing me like crazy.

83
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,799
I'm waiting here for you.

84
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,200
Hurry up.

85
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,840
Bro, I can't go with you standing here.

86
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,479
Can you get me some toilet paper?

87
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,919
Wait—

88
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,119
You didn't bring toilet paper to poop?

89
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,520
Help me out, please.

90
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,119
So much trouble, just hurry up!

91
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,280
I'll go out in a minute.

92
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,320
What do you mean?

93
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,720
Are you trying to mess with me?

94
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,919
If you want to come at me, just do it directly.

95
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,679
Brother Gou.

96
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,320
What do you mean?

97
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
What do you mean?

98
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,039
You already did it.

99
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,559
You're asking me what I mean?

100
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,160
What's going on?

101
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,359
You don't say anything.

102
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,239
How am I supposed to know if I did it?

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,720
Tell me what happened.

104
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,919
Brother Gou.

105
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,960
If you don't say it,

106
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,320
I'm leaving.

107
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:45,679
Brother Gou.

108
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,119
Two hundred thousand.

109
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:04,720
Phone.

110
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:06,840
Hurry up.

111
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,679
Call Ma Shuai.

112
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,479
Brother Gou.

113
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,840
That doesn't sound like you're asking for a favor.

114
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,320
Bro.

115
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,320
I'm begging you, man.

116
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,520
Hurry up and call him.

117
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Is this attitude okay?

118
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,320
Hurry up, I'm in a rush.

119
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,559
Put it on speaker.

120
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,119
Ma Shuai.

121
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,439
Who is this?

122
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,119
It's me, Feng Zhou.

123
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,520
Oh, it's you, kid.

124
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:58,640
I thought the cops had shot you.

125
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,320
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

126
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,280
What's up?

127
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,520
You need something from me?

128
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:03,960
Ma Shuai.

129
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:06,320
I need your help to launder some money.

130
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,559
Your money?

131
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,760
No.

132
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,080
A good friend of mine.

133
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,200
It's his.

134
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,760
You call everyone your big brother.

135
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,679
Is he one of us?

136
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,640
If not,

137
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,720
Let me get to know him first.

138
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,439
Let me warn you,

139
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,720
things aren't safe right now.

140
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,879
Don't let yourself get fooled by your so-called big brother.

141
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:23,919
Ma Shuai, don't worry.

142
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,119
I know what I'm doing.

143
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,400
As long as you know what you're doing.

144
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,080
So, Ma Shuai,

145
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,400
where are you now?

146
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,359
We can come find you.

147
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,919
I'm at the hospital.

148
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,039
What's wrong?

149
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,080
Don't even mention it.

150
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,119
My left eye hurts.

151
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,200
I think it's from before,

152
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,679
some shrapnel got in my eye and wasn't cleaned out properly.

153
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,200
I'll contact you after I get it treated.

154
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,479
So, Ma Shuai,

155
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,320
which hospital are you at?

156
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,879
We can come visit you.

157
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:55,919
Alright.

158
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,960
I'll send you the location later.

159
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:03,160
The fish has already taken the bait.

160
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Hurry up and find Ma Shuai.

161
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:16,600
Okay.

162
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:18,479
You're good, kid.

163
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,720
You didn't fool me.

164
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,640
I've already heard about it.

165
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,320
Ma's eye got injured.

166
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,239
Bro,

167
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,400
let's just wait for him to send the message.

168
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,559
Then we'll go straight over.

169
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,879
That's decent of you.

170
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,600
This Double Eleven,

171
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,720
we have a brand new plan.

172
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,720
The target is 1.5 billion.

173
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,320
1.5 billion?

174
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,800
Meng, seriously?

175
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,720
That's so high.

176
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,639
Can we really achieve that?

177
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,320
Let me ask you,

178
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:00,279
what's your current commission rate?

179
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,920
Ten percent.

180
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,560
If you bring in one million,

181
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,359
how much do you earn?

182
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,479
One hundred thousand.

183
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,920
What about ten million?

184
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
It's a tenth, right?

185
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,320
One million.

186
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,200
And if it's 1.5 billion?

187
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
1.5 billion...

188
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,680
This time,

189
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,479
I've selected brand new clients for you.

190
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,519
And created a brand new script.

191
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,479
The goal for this Double Eleven

192
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,519
is to earn enough from

193
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,680
fifty thousand people across China

194
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,359
to reach 1.5 billion.

195
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:33,720
Brother Tian promises

196
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,479
that as long as the task is completed,

197
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,440
everyone's commission will increase by another five percent.

198
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,680
Great! Good!

199
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,200
Alright! Good!

200
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,680
I've already prepared the script.

201
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,320
Distribute it.

202
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,320
Everyone, memorize it in advance.

203
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,200
On Double Eleven,

204
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,720
I'll give you the list.

205
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,840
Let's dominate Double Eleven!

206
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,840
Dominate Double Eleven!

207
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,720
Earn the full 1.5 billion!

208
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,080
Earn the full 1.5 billion!

209
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,680
Everyone, come over.

210
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,759
We need to quickly come up with a solution.

211
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,440
To stop this Double Eleven plan.

212
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,359
The list of victims.

213
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,440
As long as we can get the list of victims,

214
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,320
I can find a way to use the opportunity of meeting Ma Shuai

215
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,239
to get the list out.

216
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,320
By the way,

217
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,519
have you reached Master?

218
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,359
Yes, I have.

219
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,879
He even asked me on the phone

220
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,519
about my relationship with Lao Gou.

221
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,320
He said if we're not on the same side,

222
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,879
we should find a way to get along.

223
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,720
On the same side...

224
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,239
Master must be hinting at something.

225
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,159
To win over Lao Gou.

226
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,560
Looks like I have to kill two birds with one stone.

227
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Take out your phones quickly.

228
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,519
The first step of the operation

229
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:11,040
is to find a way to get the Double Eleven documents.

230
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,320
From my observation,

231
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,040
every evening after work,

232
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,119
phones and documents are all collected together.

233
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
They're kept in the storage room.

234
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,840
I can try to sneak into the storage room

235
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,440
and get the list of victims.

236
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,720
But there are cameras everywhere here.

237
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,720
How will you sneak into the storage room?

238
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,040
That's where I need your help.
