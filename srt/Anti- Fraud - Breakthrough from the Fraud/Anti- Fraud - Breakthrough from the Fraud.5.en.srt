1
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,740
Through our investigation of Qian Mo's violent debt collection gang,

2
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:16,580
I have learned

3
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,900
that this gang has a total of twenty-three members in our city.

4
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,140
The main headquarters is overseas.

5
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,580
As for Li Xing's job,

6
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,620
it was introduced to him by his cousin Li Zhaodi.

7
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,420
Li Zhaodi

8
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:26,539
is from Fengyang Village.

9
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,420
She is thirty-one years old.

10
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,460
Only her mother and younger brother are left at home.

11
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:31,059
She went abroad more than ten years ago.

12
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:31,940
So I suspect

13
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,460
that she is very likely a member of the fraud gang.

14
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,219
Is there a way to break through with Li Zhaodi?

15
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:38,019
Yes.

16
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,700
You go ahead.

17
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,579
Through investigating Li Zhaodi's social connections,

18
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:46,299
we found out

19
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,539
that her younger brother Li Zhenye is about to get married.

20
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,619
We can consider starting from this point.

21
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:51,780
To lure Li Zhaodi back.

22
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,340
Alright.

23
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,539
You two work well together.

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,820
Here's what we'll do.

25
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,579
You two keep working together

26
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:01,100
and finish this task.

27
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:02,780
Yes.

28
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,420
Yes.

29
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,619
As for the twenty-three-member criminal gang,

30
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,460
don't take any action yet.

31
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:09,659
Wait until Li Zhaodi comes back.

32
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,420
Then find a way to catch them all at once.

33
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:12,219
Yes.

34
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:25,099
Hello.

35
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,180
Are you a family member of Li Zhaodi?

36
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,379
I'm Qin Lang, a detective from the Anti-Fraud Center.

37
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:30,939
This is my colleague, Gao Man.

38
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,739
Have you been in contact with Li Zhaodi recently?

39
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,060
We suspect she is engaged in illegal activities overseas.

40
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,140
My sister?

41
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,739
No, we haven't been in touch.

42
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,939
Not at all.

43
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,019
That's right.

44
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,180
You can leave now.

45
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,379
Anything she does

46
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:44,780
has nothing to do with us.

47
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,579
Yes, it doesn't concern us.

48
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,579
Zheng Hongmei.

49
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,540
A month ago,

50
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,579
your bank card ending in 9587

51
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,180
received a transfer of 250,000 yuan.

52
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,540
Half a year ago,

53
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,819
the same bank card

54
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,579
received a transfer of 130,000 yuan.

55
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,739
In the past three or four years,

56
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,579
you have received a total of 1.16 million yuan.

57
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:01,500
Who sent you this money?

58
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,420
My son transferred it.

59
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,420
Your son is unemployed.

60
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:09,659
How could he make that much money?

61
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,180
Watch your mouth.

62
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,459
Who are you calling unemployed?

63
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,260
Exactly.

64
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:14,859
What gives you the right to talk about my son like that?

65
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,620
So what if my son can earn money?

66
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,539
You think just because you're police

67
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:19,939
you can say whatever you want about people?

68
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:20,819
Enough, enough, Mom.

69
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:21,939
Let's not waste words with them.

70
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,460
Get out.

71
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:22,740
Get out.

72
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:24,099
Calm down.

73
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:24,300
Get out.

74
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,340
I'm telling you all to calm down.

75
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:25,939
You're assaulting the police.

76
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:26,659
I'm warning you.

77
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,020
The police are hitting people!

78
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:28,900
Mom.

79
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,460
Mom.

80
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,379
The police are hitting people!

81
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:30,659
Mom.

82
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,460
Mom.

83
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,020
The police are hitting people!

84
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,139
You hit my mom!

85
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,180
Do you know this is assaulting the police?

86
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:53,300
Are you okay?

87
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,659
I'm fine.

88
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,180
You can stop pretending too.

89
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:57,939
Let me tell you,

90
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,219
there is now concrete evidence proving

91
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,620
that Li Zhaodi is overseas

92
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,020
engaged in fraudulent activities.

93
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,460
The money you've received over the years

94
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,379
All of it is money she got through fraud.

95
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,659
We came here today

96
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:10,740
to ask you to persuade her to turn herself in.

97
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,819
If Li Zhaodi doesn't turn herself in,

98
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,740
and is caught by the police,

99
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,780
she will definitely receive a harsher sentence.

100
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,580
Do you know

101
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,780
that hiding her crime for her

102
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,379
is considered what?

103
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:19,500
It's called harboring a criminal.

104
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,620
What are the consequences?

105
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,219
Your whole family's political review will be affected.

106
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:24,460
Mom,

107
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,819
Mom, mom, mom,

108
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:28,539
Please stand up first.

109
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:30,180
Stand up.

110
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,300
Listen to me.

111
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,699
If our family really has a criminal,

112
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,180
and this gets out,

113
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,539
Qianqian definitely won't marry me.

114
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,780
Officer,

115
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,740
Zhaodi has been gone for over ten years.

116
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:41,780
Really,

117
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:43,740
she's only come back two or three times.

118
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,939
Every time she comes back,

119
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,620
she uses a lot of water and electricity,

120
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,180
and doesn't bring back any money.

121
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,060
Really.

122
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:50,300
They argue every time.

123
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:52,099
She doesn't even want to come back anymore.

124
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,900
We don't want to see her either.

125
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,099
Mom, think of a way to handle this.

126
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,099
Try to persuade her to come back.

127
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,819
You can't let this affect me.

128
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,099
That stubborn girl.

129
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:02,180
She doesn't listen to me either.

130
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,740
She doesn't listen to you?

131
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,099
Would she listen to me then?

132
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:03,500
Fine.

133
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,460
So you can't persuade her?

134
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,819
Then we won't make things difficult for you.

135
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,219
Th-th-thank you so much.

136
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:11,819
Officer.

137
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,180
Come with me to the station.

138
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,900
Let's settle the matter of assaulting a police officer first.

139
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:16,860
No, wait.

140
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:17,819
Please don't.

141
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,900
O-officer.

142
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:21,139
I'm sorry.

143
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:21,819
Officer.

144
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,860
My mom just fainted earlier.

145
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,060
I was anxious too.

146
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:26,660
But don't worry.

147
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,379
About this matter,

148
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:28,620
we'll definitely find a way.

149
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,779
We'll also bring Li Zhaodi back.

150
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:30,980
Right, Mom?

151
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:31,779
Yes, yes, yes.

152
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:34,100
We'll definitely find a way to bring her back.

153
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,180
Really.

154
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,819
But we have one small request.

155
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,300
Could you keep this matter confidential for us?

156
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,779
It can't affect my marriage, right?

157
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,579
That's right.

158
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:56,180
Get out of the car.

159
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,779
What for?

160
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:58,939
Buy me a cup of coffee.

161
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,779
Do you have any compassion?

162
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:02,500
Are you going or not?

163
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,579
I'll go.

164
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,779
Sir, your coffee.

165
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,100
Thank you.

166
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:24,660
Sorry about that.

167
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:25,939
I ordered the wrong thing.

168
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,259
Could you order another one for me?

169
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:27,899
A latte.

170
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,339
Extra milk, less coffee.

171
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,620
No need to order again.

172
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,860
I'll just make you a new one.

173
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,220
Thank you.

174
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:36,819
Xiaoxi.

175
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:37,540
Manman.

176
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,939
Have a seat, I'll take a call.

177
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,459
Okay.

178
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,220
I've been using "Power of Love" lately.

179
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,180
It's just a charity app.

180
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:57,060
That's really unexpected of you.

181
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:58,540
Should I put it on or not?

182
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:14,620
Done.

183
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:27,699
Your face.

184
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,379
That's good enough.

185
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:39,980
Manman.

186
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:41,579
Is this your friend?

187
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:44,379
Coworker.

188
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:47,779
He knows you pretty well.

189
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:49,379
He knows you love

190
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,019
drinking lattes with extra milk.

191
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:58,379
And you like to drink it here.

192
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:00,500
Xiaoxi.

193
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,339
Get us two to-go cups, please.

194
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:03,180
Thank you.

195
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,579
Xiaoxi

196
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,379
How has Mr. He been lately?

197
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,980
My dad came to the shop just the day before yesterday.

198
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,459
He scolded me in front of everyone in the shop again.

199
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:17,100
He told me

200
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,379
to close the shop

201
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,540
and that taking the civil service exam is the right path.

202
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,100
Mr. He is just like that.

203
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,819
Don't take it too much to heart.

204
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,620
Later,

205
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,139
I'll help you talk to him properly.

206
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:38,220
Stop right there!

207
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,060
Wei Qiang

208
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,100
You can't get away.

209
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,420
Goodbye.

210
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:50,940
Master

211
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,860
Where are you?
