1
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,720
Honey

2
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,520
Honey

3
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,240
Why can't I see you anymore?

4
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,039
Honey

5
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,559
Honey

6
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:00,920
Honey

7
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,160
Darling

8
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,080
I'm sorry

9
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,440
I shouldn't have killed your wife

10
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,600
Get ready to move.

11
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,679
Chase them!

12
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,360
Stop!

13
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,640
Go after them!

14
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,159
Don't run!

15
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,040
Police! Stop running!

16
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,760
Freeze!

17
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,040
Split up and chase!

18
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,360
Let's see where you run.

19
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,800
Bro,

20
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,760
I really can't believe you.

21
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,559
There are so many cops down there,

22
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,559
and you're still making a deal?

23
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:00,920
Cut the crap.

24
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,679
Are we doing this or not?

25
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,119
Did you bring the money?

26
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,119
Where's the stuff?

27
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,119
Mine is all top quality.

28
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,200
Let's hurry up and make the deal. Come on.

29
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,320
Hurry, the cops might show up any minute.

30
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,480
Wait.

31
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:12,920
Hold on.

32
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,399
Let me ask you something.

33
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,240
Do you know Wei Qiang?

34
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,520
Wei Qiang? I don't know him.

35
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:17,999
Hurry up, hurry up!

36
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:20,279
Are you really in the drug business or not?

37
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,999
You don't even know Wei Qiang?

38
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,320
Isn't he that drug lord from the border years ago?

39
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,519
Who doesn't know him?

40
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,759
He's really shady.

41
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,519
He cuts his product.

42
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,679
He got his whole operation busted.

43
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,439
Ours is all real.

44
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,600
Alright, alright.

45
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,280
Hurry up, come on.

46
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,119
Wait for me a second.

47
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:36,559
Wait.

48
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,519
Hold on, let me give you—

49
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:42,960
Are you messing with me?

50
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:37,079
Hold out your hand.

51
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,600
Why are you handcuffing me?

52
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,079
Gao Man.

53
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,199
Qin Lang.

54
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,439
I've been explaining to you for ages.

55
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,199
Let me go.

56
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,400
I really am from the anti-fraud center.

57
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:55,879
Cut the nonsense.

58
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,519
Come back to the station and explain yourself properly.

59
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,199
Would you even listen if I explained?

60
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,439
Then go ahead and explain to me.

61
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,160
Captain Jiang, mentor.

62
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,119
Qin Lang.

63
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,160
So the one we were chasing just now was you?

64
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,119
You know him?

65
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,720
He's our team's new colleague.

66
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,319
Qin Lang.

67
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,160
When he reported in, you happened to be out on a mission.

68
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,960
Not bad, kid.

69
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,360
Skipping out on your first day at work.

70
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,360
Not answering calls.

71
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:20,759
Not replying to messages.

72
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:21,879
Speak.

73
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,720
What are you trying to do?

74
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,519
Reporting, Captain Jiang.

75
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,360
Catching drug dealers.

76
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,360
It took me a lot of effort to get this guy to show up.

77
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,960
You really plan to join the narcotics unit, huh?

78
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,119
I want to join the narcotics unit.

79
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,480
Then you’ve arrested the wrong person.

80
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,519
He’s selling rock sugar.

81
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,519
Not meth.

82
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,439
Look at those meth sores on his face.

83
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,600
And his teeth.

84
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,759
They’re almost all gone.

85
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,079
I just made a deal with him.

86
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,960
How is it not meth?

87
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,920
Check the bag yourself and see what’s inside.

88
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,639
He did sell drugs before.

89
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,759
You’re not mistaken.

90
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,879
He was later caught by narcotics officers.

91
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,240
He served twelve years in prison.

92
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,800
After getting out, he’s been selling fake meth online.

93
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,679
Selling to support his own habit.

94
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,119
We’ve been watching him for a long time.

95
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,960
Captain Jiang,

96
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,360
I’m just selling some rock sugar.

97
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,319
I just took a little hit.

98
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:02,439
Come on, sir—

99
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,240
Do you realize

100
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,400
this counts as online fraud?

101
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,280
Take him away.

102
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:05,759
Let’s go.

103
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:06,879
No—

104
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:07,759
No—

105
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,800
You can’t even tell the difference between fraud and drug dealing.

106
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,240
You’d better work on your skills.

107
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,600
Go back and write a self-criticism.

108
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:33,920
Captain Jiang

109
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,160
Captain Jiang

110
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,199
What is it?

111
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:36,840
Do you need something?

112
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:38,960
Yes.

113
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,199
I want to say something.

114
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,439
You want to talk about investigating Wei Qiang.

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:42,759
Yes.

116
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:43,759
No need to say it.

117
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:44,319
Let's go.

118
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:46,720
Wait, why won't you let me speak?

119
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,559
My father disappeared while trying to arrest Wei Qiang.

120
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,759
He's been missing for ten years, his fate unknown.

121
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,960
I have to find out what happened to him.

122
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,199
Because you're a police officer.

123
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,960
Once you put on this uniform,

124
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:56,400
you need to understand what it means to follow orders.

125
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,040
Fine.

126
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:01,759
Then right now,

127
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm asking you as a victim's family member.

128
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,840
Officer Jiang,

129
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,199
back then, you and my father arrested

130
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:08,319
that drug lord Wei Qiang.

131
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,079
In the end, only he went missing.

132
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:10,720
It's been ten years.

133
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,040
You were his apprentice.

134
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,199
You were in charge of the case.

135
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,079
I want to ask if there's been any progress in the case.

136
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:16,240
Even if he's dead,

137
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,840
shouldn't I at least see his remains?

138
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,480
Are you finished talking?

139
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,759
I'm done.

140
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,639
Okay.

141
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,960
Don't you want to investigate the reason for your father's disappearance?

142
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,799
Don't you want to transfer to the narcotics unit?

143
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,320
I'll give you a chance.

144
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,560
One year.

145
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:56,360
If you do well here for a year,

146
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,759
I'll transfer you from anti-fraud

147
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:58,879
to narcotics.

148
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,320
What counts as doing well?

149
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,080
Just do as well as Gao Man.

150
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:06,960
Like her?

151
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:09,960
That's easy.

152
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,799
Boss,

153
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,960
There's a warning call we can't get through to.

154
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,440
We can't reach the family either.

155
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,600
Alright.

156
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,200
Take him with you.

157
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,680
You can teach him

158
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:23,159
what it means to do a home intervention.

159
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:25,960
Yes.

160
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,320
Qian Mo,

161
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,840
you're really easy to fool.

162
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
Just an AI-generated face

163
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,159
made you confess to killing your wife.

164
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,320
What do you people want?

165
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,759
I've already recorded everything.

166
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,399
Transfer your wife's three million insurance payout to me.

167
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,159
Otherwise, I'll go to the police.

168
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,360
No, no, no!

169
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,680
Please don't call the police.

170
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,440
As long as you don't call the police,

171
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,399
we can talk about anything.

172
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,560
But you can't...
