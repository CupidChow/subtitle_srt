1
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,369
I want to talk to you about something.

2
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,930
Aren't you short on money?

3
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:32,969
I've got a way to make some money.

4
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,610
How about we work together?

5
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:38,649
What are you looking at?

6
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,970
Once the deal's done, there will be plenty of girls.

7
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,770
Do you know Ma Shuai?

8
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:46,370
No, I don't.

9
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:48,849
What are you looking at?

10
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:50,209
I'm talking business with you.

11
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,169
Don't pretend with me.

12
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,129
I've already looked into everything.

13
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:56,529
You two are sworn brothers, right?

14
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:01,129
Your operation got busted before.

15
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,609
After that, Ma Shuai

16
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,010
started running an underground bank.

17
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,730
And you're still pretending you don't know him.

18
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,609
So what do you really want?

19
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,769
How about this—

20
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:14,969
Introduce me to him.

21
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,570
I'll give you ten.

22
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,169
Ma Shuai doesn't meet with just anyone.

23
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,010
Brother Gou.

24
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,010
You think just ten is enough for me to make the connection?

25
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,769
I don't even know what you want to do.

26
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:28,730
Understood.

27
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:29,969
I know all the rules.

28
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,130
If anything was off just now,

29
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,210
please forgive me.

30
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,969
I didn't mean anything else by it.

31
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:35,969
Let me be straight with you.

32
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:38,809
My childhood friend ran into some money trouble.

33
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,769
He needs to launder money from overseas into the country.

34
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:42,769
It's that simple.

35
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:43,570
Brother Gou,

36
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:46,049
laundering money privately in the park is a serious crime.

37
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:47,010
Don't get me in trouble.

38
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,570
What are you thinking?

39
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,969
You think I don't know how important the park's money is?

40
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:53,049
Do you know how important it is?

41
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,090
How about this:

42
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:55,130
Once it's done,

43
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,450
I'll give you twenty.

44
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,370
And also,

45
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,650
from now on in the park,

46
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,049
I'll have your back.

47
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:14,490
It's settled then.

48
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:15,090
Alright.

49
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,450
Leave this to me.

50
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,089
Okay.

51
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,609
I'm off to dance.

52
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,530
There are plenty of girls.

53
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,970
I'll introduce you to a couple later.

54
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:24,649
You're really something, seriously.

55
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:26,769
You're amazing, alright.

56
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:39,970
Gentlemen, please place your bets.

57
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,369
Small.

58
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:49,850
Big.

59
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:52,730
Small wins.

60
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,209
Another win.

61
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,929
Sorry about that.

62
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,609
Gentlemen, please place your bets.

63
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:13,570
Still small.

64
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,049
Are you still in?

65
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:19,730
Big.

66
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:25,169
Small wins.

67
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,209
That's amazing.

68
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:34,410
You're really sharp.

69
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,130
That's a woman's intuition.

70
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:38,489
My intuition is always accurate.

71
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:40,889
Intuition.

72
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:43,410
Then use your intuition to make a prediction.

73
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,929
What will happen next?

74
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:45,970
Then give it a try.

75
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,489
Excuse me.

76
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:48,769
I need to take a call.

77
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:51,010
Okay.

78
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:52,530
Take them to the second floor.

79
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,010
If you're really that confident,

80
00:04:58,769 --> 00:04:59,810
do you dare to bet big?

81
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,250
I'm willing to play along.

82
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,130
Brother.

83
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:08,609
Brother Tian.

84
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:10,690
Yeah.

85
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:18,570
Come on.

86
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:20,769
Everyone's here.

87
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:24,570
What does that mean?

88
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:26,849
We're playing this game.

89
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,769
The rules are simple.

90
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,849
This person is the target.

91
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,610
Bet on whether three darts can kill him.

92
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,010
You choose first.

93
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,450
If you win, I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars.

94
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:44,610
If you lose,

95
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:45,769
come with me.

96
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,690
If we're playing a game, let's just play a game.

97
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,610
Why does it have to be life or death?

98
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:51,329
I'm not playing.

99
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,849
Don't you like to trust your instincts?

100
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:01,969
Let's bet on whether it can be done within three throws.

101
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:04,209
Can you kill him with them or not?

102
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:09,370
Bet on life or death.

103
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,450
You put up the money, I'll provide the man.

104
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,089
Isn't that unfair?

105
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,209
A Bin.

106
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:17,769
Here.

107
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:19,610
Get the throwing knives ready.

108
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:20,570
Yes.

109
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:25,769
Bet on death.

110
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:27,570
Or life.

111
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:38,690
Brother Tian.

112
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:41,690
How about I do it instead?

113
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,570
A strong leader has no weak subordinates.

114
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,250
He will definitely die.

115
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,769
No, no, that doesn't count.

116
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,450
It must be because your men are on your side.

117
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:54,570
They missed on purpose.

118
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:58,930
After we finish this job,

119
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,610
I'll take you out to have fun.

120
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,209
How many times have you said that?

121
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,690
You lie to me every time.

122
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,570
I won't lie to you this time.

123
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:09,969
You have to keep your word.

124
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:11,570
How about this:

125
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:12,729
I'll play the second round.

126
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:13,889
The bet stays the same.

127
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:17,130
Okay.

128
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:19,329
I'll do as you say.

129
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:49,529
Beautiful lady,

130
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:50,810
your strength is good,

131
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:52,570
but your accuracy is a bit off.

132
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:55,329
Third round.

133
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,570
Wait a second.

134
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,289
Let me throw this one.

135
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,889
My fate is in your hands.

136
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,089
Don't let me down.

137
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,610
Brother Tian is still the best.

138
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:37,849
He actually hit the same spot as the lady.

139
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,609
Sorry.

140
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:44,770
I let you down.

141
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,290
You must have done it on purpose.

142
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:48,009
Go ahead.

143
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:54,690
Brother Tian,

144
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:58,129
what should we do with this guy?

145
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,290
He's lucky.

146
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:00,969
Let him go.

147
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:14,609
Hurry up.

148
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:15,609
Alright.

149
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,530
What are you doing here?

150
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,690
Brother, brother

151
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,690
Sorry, let me wipe it

152
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,209
Brother

153
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,249
Sorry, sorry, brother

154
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:31,410
Are you blind, Ah Bin?

155
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:32,969
Forget it

156
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:34,770
Thank you, boss

157
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:35,770
Come out

158
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:02,969
Sneaking around

159
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,369
Stealing things

160
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:06,009
No, I didn't steal anything, boss

161
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,770
Still dare to lie

162
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,369
I really didn't steal anything

163
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,369
Take it out

164
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:11,410
Take it out

165
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:15,009
Boss

166
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,290
I-I saw there's a watch here.

167
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,890
I picked it up.

168
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,729
I didn't steal it.

169
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,450
With this,

170
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:20,930
we can confirm whether Wu Tian

171
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,129
is actually Wei Qiang or not.

172
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:23,450
This is way too dangerous.

173
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:25,770
I've made it through my part.

174
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:26,969
Now it's up to you two.

175
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,489
You must be careful, understand?

176
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:29,249
I know.

177
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,089
By the way, help me look into someone named Ma Shuai.

178
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:31,969
Find out his background.

179
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,930
He should be with the underground bank.

180
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,129
Why are you looking for him?

181
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:38,329
Wei Qiang has three close associates.

182
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,810
They are Lao Gou,

183
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,650
Meng Lu, and A Bin.

184
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,810
Meng Lu and Lao Gou are in charge of fraud.

185
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:44,969
A Bin handles security.

186
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:46,489
Here are their personal characteristics.

187
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,690
You must find a way

188
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,849
to get the bar's surveillance footage.

189
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,170
Match these people's information.

190
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,810
Especially this Lao Gou.

191
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:52,849
He launders money on the side.

192
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,290
He also asked me to help him find someone named Ma Shuai.

193
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,570
Investigate this Ma Shuai thoroughly.

194
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,170
He'll definitely be useful later.

195
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,170
That's all I know for now.

196
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:01,650
I'll find a way to contact you.

197
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:02,770
Got it.

198
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:03,410
Take care.

199
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:04,570
You too.

200
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,969
Can you get in touch with Ma Shuai tomorrow?

201
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,450
Tomorrow?

202
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,249
Is it that urgent?

203
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,369
How can I not be anxious?

204
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:31,450
The longer the night, the more things can go wrong.

205
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,530
My brother is anxious.

206
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,690
Twenty, not a cent less. Really.

207
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:34,770
Alright.

208
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:35,969
I'll think of a way.

209
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,369
But I need a phone.

210
00:12:37,609 --> 00:12:38,969
And the money needs to be ready.

211
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:39,770
Don't worry.

212
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,170
Once we're in the park, I'll give it to you right away.

213
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,570
Please, I'm begging you.
