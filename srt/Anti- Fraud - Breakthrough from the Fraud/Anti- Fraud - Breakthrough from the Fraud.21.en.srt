1
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,780
This is yours.

2
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,370
Okay, thanks.

3
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:28,780
Here you go.

4
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:29,420
Yours.

5
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:39,780
Go.

6
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,370
Hurry up and go.

7
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,650
Hurry back.

8
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,850
Take it easy on the road.

9
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:45,780
Hello.

10
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,700
Son.

11
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,210
I've transferred the money to you.

12
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,290
Did you receive it?

13
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,900
When did I ask you to transfer money to me?

14
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,290
Get ready to move.

15
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,010
Don't move.

16
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,010
Don't move.

17
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,980
Get out of the car. Move.

18
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,210
Get out. Get out.

19
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,980
Crouch down.

20
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,140
Hurry up.

21
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,260
Come down.

22
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,730
Get out of the car.

23
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,290
Put your hands on your head and crouch down.

24
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,140
Alright, alright, I'll contact you if anything comes up.

25
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,180
Go.

26
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:18,410
Move.

27
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,460
Wang Shufen.

28
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,340
Why is it you?

29
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,580
Is it strange?

30
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,500
I've been watching you for a long time.

31
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:30,860
Cuff her.

32
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,370
Wang Shufen.

33
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,580
Start talking.

34
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,020
What's going on?

35
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,210
What do you mean, what's going on?

36
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,210
I should be asking you that.

37
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,340
I was just out for a walk.

38
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,620
And you suddenly arrested me.

39
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,500
What do you want?

40
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,780
Stop pretending.

41
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,090
Your accomplice has already been caught, you know.

42
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,060
If you confess early,

43
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,620
you might get a lighter sentence.

44
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,020
I didn't do anything.

45
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,970
What am I supposed to confess?

46
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:53,970
Talk.

47
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,340
How much money did you launder in total?

48
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,130
I don't know anything.

49
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:58,930
What money laundering?

50
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,810
Stop playing dumb.

51
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,090
Wang Shufen.

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,620
How many accomplices do you have?

53
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,060
Stop pretending.

54
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,900
They're all old hands.

55
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,060
We don't have any solid evidence.

56
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,180
It's hard to get them to talk.

57
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,580
Before noon tomorrow,

58
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,210
we must get her to talk.

59
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,810
Wang Shufen

60
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,500
You recruited your relatives and family members

61
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,180
to launder money for an overseas fraud syndicate

62
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,930
Is that true?

63
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,900
Where is your son Gou Fugui now?

64
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,130
Is he involved in fraudulent activities overseas?

65
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,180
Come in

66
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,620
Captain Hao

67
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,020
This is the information Captain Jiang just sent back

68
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,090
They've gathered information on Wei Qiang's fraud operation

69
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,810
and the core details of its main members

70
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:14,780
Good

71
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,580
You may go

72
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,500
Wang Shufen

73
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,090
Not talking, are you?

74
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,250
Let me tell you

75
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,860
We focus on evidence, not confessions, now

76
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,370
Even without a confession, I can still sentence you with the evidence

77
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,060
Just don't regret it when it's time for sentencing

78
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,690
Do you hear me?

79
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,130
Wang Shufen

80
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,660
Take a look—do you know who this is?

81
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,220
According to our investigation,

82
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,060
your son's name is Gou Fugui.

83
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,620
His nickname is Old Dog, right?

84
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,540
He's currently overseas.

85
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,980
He's involved in fraudulent activities.

86
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,060
I can be honest with you.

87
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,060
We have already

88
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,810
taken action against your son's fraud operation.

89
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,860
taken action.

90
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,930
You and I go way back.

91
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,540
I've been watching you for a long time.

92
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,010
Don't think that the things you've done

93
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,890
are unknown to us.

94
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,930
Otherwise, we wouldn't have brought you here.

95
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,620
I hope you can adjust your attitude.

96
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,930
Be honest and confess your own issues.

97
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,690
We will give you

98
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,980
a chance to persuade your son to come back.

99
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,620
Do you know what the current policy is?

100
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,450
Anyone who is persuaded to return

101
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,420
can receive a lighter sentence.

102
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,300
Of course,

103
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,300
we can give you this opportunity,

104
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,540
or we can choose not to.

105
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
I hope you think it over carefully.

106
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,100
Make the most of this opportunity.

107
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,100
It's up to you.

108
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,250
I...

109
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,180
I'll talk.

110
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,300
I'll tell you everything.

111
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,060
I'll tell you everything.

112
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,660
That's right, now you're doing the right thing.

113
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,500
Daqian,

114
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,370
take the statement.

115
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,220
Captain Hao

116
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,740
Xiao Jiang

117
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,330
I have two pieces of good news.

118
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,540
Which one do you want to hear first?

119
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,570
The DNA results are in.

120
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,420
Our suspicion was correct.

121
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,130
This Wu Tian is actually Wei Qiang.

122
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,930
We must catch Wei Qiang.

123
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,890
And find out where my mentor is.

124
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,690
We will definitely find Zhijun.

125
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,620
Also,

126
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,770
Wei Qiang's subordinate is called Lao Gou.

127
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,220
We've detained his mother.

128
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,810
According to his mother's statement,

129
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,980
Lao Gou's real name is Gou Fugui.

130
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,180
I'll send you his detailed information

131
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,740
in a bit.

132
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,450
Okay.

133
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,740
And one more thing,

134
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:51,980
The bureau has decided

135
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,180
that at the right time,

136
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,740
we can try to turn Lao Gou.

137
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,370
Let him assist inside the scam park

138
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,180
to help Qin Lang and Gao Man with their work.

139
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,010
Understood.

140
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,890
With Wang Shufen as our leverage,

141
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,500
I think the plan is feasible.

142
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,250
Also, this Gou Fugui

143
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,860
is eager to use Qin Lang

144
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,130
to connect with Ma Shuai.

145
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,300
Make the most of this opportunity.

146
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,420
Carry out the operation.

147
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,660
Be sure to stay safe.

148
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,220
Don't worry.

149
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,860
Life is bold and unrestrained

150
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,420
Full of fighting spirit

151
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,570
I'm the strongest of all

152
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,010
Without hardship or toil

153
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,060
Life is tasteless

154
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,420
If you don't strive or fight

155
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,810
It's as if you lived in vain

156
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,220
Hoeing crops under the midday sun

157
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,130
Sweat drips onto the soil beneath the crops

158
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,420
Did you rest well last night?

159
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,370
Arrived at the telecom team

160
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,980
Fifteen thousand a day

161
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,180
What does your company do?

162
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,300
Everything is taken care of

163
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,540
Only success is allowed

164
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,220
Fraud

165
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
Don't joke around

166
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,620
You scared me

167
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,810
This is my office

168
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,540
So what job will I do?

169
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,250
Brother Tian

170
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
Who is this young lady?

171
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,250
Manny

172
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,540
Your outfit today

173
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,220
You put a lot of thought into it, didn't you?

174
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,250
Is there anything strange about it?

175
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,740
Where are you from?

176
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,980
Liancheng

177
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,860
What a coincidence

178
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,330
I'm also from Liancheng

179
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,330
Why are you so nervous?

180
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,530
Shouldn't you be happy to meet someone from your hometown?

181
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,220
Which neighborhood do you live in?

182
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,980
Liancheng is a small place.

183
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,740
Maybe we're even neighbors.

184
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,340
Xinlian Neighborhood.

185
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,980
Xinlian Neighborhood.

186
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,860
How come I've never heard of that place?

187
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,370
Of course you haven't.

188
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,980
Because Liancheng

189
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,010
is something I made up.

190
00:09:59,650 --> 00:09:59,980
You...

191
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,740
That line of questioning

192
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,250
must have taken some effort.

193
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,700
Actually, I'm from Jiangdong.

194
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,010
What a coincidence.

195
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,620
You're from Jiangdong too, aren't you?

196
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,370
Alright.

197
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,500
This is Menglu.

198
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,370
She's the company's psychologist.

199
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,460
Sister Lu.

200
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,220
It really is quite a coincidence.

201
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,580
I also studied psychology.

202
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,250
Looks like we'll have to exchange ideas more often.

203
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,290
Brother Tian, can we talk in private?

204
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,620
Let's talk in private.

205
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
Don't you understand?

206
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,170
Feng Zhou.

207
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,530
Brother Gou is looking for you.

208
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,700
I'll just use the restroom, be right there.

209
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,220
Hurry up.

210
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,620
Brother Tian, I've contacted Kunka.

211
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,220
But...

212
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,100
What did he say?

213
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,650
He just said, "I'm not meeting."

214
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,820
Then he hung up.

215
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,010
He hasn't answered since.

216
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,290
It's okay.

217
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:37,860
I have a way.

218
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,460
You have something more important to do right now.

219
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,170
What are your instructions, Brother Tian?

220
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,370
I have a new plan.

221
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,740
The Double Eleven Shopping Festival.

222
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,770
This time, everyone will participate.

223
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,500
We need to make at least 1.5 billion.

224
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,220
Alright, Brother Tian.

225
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,010
With this 1.5 billion,

226
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,170
find a way

227
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,890
to let this news

228
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,580
reach Kunka.

229
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,500
Then he'll call me personally.

230
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,250
You're still the clever one, Brother Tian.

231
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,620
By the way,

232
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,580
that new recruit, Manni,

233
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,010
what do you plan to have her do?

234
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,740
Do you have thoughts about her?

235
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,410
I just feel

236
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,370
she looks too much like Sister Xiao Zhao.

237
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,890
So what?

238
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,620
The way someone dresses and acts,

239
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,740
all resemble another person.

240
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,130
Unless it's a one-in-ten-thousand coincidence,

241
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
there's only one possibility:

242
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,100
she has an agenda.

243
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,010
We have to be cautious.

244
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,130
Brother Tian,

245
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,050
I'm worried about you.

246
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,050
I'll look into this myself.

247
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,530
Your top priority is to finish the script.

248
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,220
And one more thing,

249
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,620
don't touch her.
