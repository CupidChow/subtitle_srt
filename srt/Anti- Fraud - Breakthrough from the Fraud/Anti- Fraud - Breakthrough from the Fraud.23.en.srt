00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,181
Mr. Kunka

2
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:24,621
A couple of days ago, you had someone call me.

3
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:25,461
Was there something you needed?

4
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,781
It was about Jiang Haofeng.

5
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,421
I acted on my own initiative.

6
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,381
I called you

7
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:33,461
because I wanted to apologize.

8
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,101
No need.

9
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,421
It's all in the past.

10
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,381
Thank you for forgiving me.

11
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:41,180
If there's nothing else,

12
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:42,661
I won't bother you any further.

13
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:43,701
Wait a moment.

14
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:44,781
Go ahead.

15
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,820
The two of us are partners.

16
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:49,381
Your future plans

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,981
Didn't you think to inform me?

18
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,180
Plans.

19
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,461
You're talking about the Double Eleven project.

20
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,381
This plan isn't mature enough yet.

21
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,580
I originally wanted to tell you this in person.

22
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,381
I didn't expect you to be so well-informed.

23
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:08,341
Are you sure you can make 1.5 billion?

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,180
As long as Jiang Haofeng doesn't interfere.

25
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,381
Don't worry.

26
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,220
As long as I'm here,

27
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:13,461
they can't touch you.

28
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:15,581
And once I become mayor,

29
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,340
I'll definitely help you get rid of him.

30
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,941
As long as we make this 1.5 billion,

31
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,180
your campaign

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,420
will definitely succeed.

33
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:24,661
Also,

34
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,301
today Jiang Haofeng suddenly came to see me.

35
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,661
He was asking about

36
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:30,501
Ma Shuai.

37
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,741
Ma Shuai?

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,581
Why are they looking for him?

39
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,900
Although Jiang Haofeng said

40
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:37,461
he was looking for clues to another case,

41
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:39,980
I think there's something fishy about this.

42
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,581
At this time,

43
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,340
they might be trying to bypass the police department

44
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,780
and secretly come after you.

45
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:50,141
You'd better keep an eye on your people at the company.

46
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:51,620
You mean

47
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:54,101
someone inside our company wants to launder money on their own?

48
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,180
Whether it's laundering money or not,

49
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,301
you should check it out yourself.

50
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,180
It's best if you clean this up for me.

51
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:01,980
It absolutely can't affect Double Eleven.

52
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:05,021
You don't need to worry about Ma Shuai.

53
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:06,021
With me here,

54
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:08,461
Jiang Haofeng definitely won't find him.

55
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,980
Alright.

56
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:11,381
Rest assured.

57
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:22,541
Brother Tian

58
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,780
You should be in the dorm at this time.

59
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,500
I want to talk to you.

60
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,981
Sure.

61
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,100
What do you want to talk about?

62
00:04:10,581 --> 00:04:11,021
Brother Tian

63
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:12,701
You still haven't told me

64
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:13,780
why you brought me here

65
00:04:13,981 --> 00:04:15,220
and what exactly you want me to do

66
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:17,421
You shouldn't be so naive

67
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:19,060
Now that you're already here

68
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,261
what else could you do

69
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,461
Come, let me show you our company

70
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,261
Brother Tian

71
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:32,821
You guys

72
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,660
are you really doing scams?

73
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,581
"Scam" sounds so unpleasant

74
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:40,301
This is art

75
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:42,620
You have to experience it yourself

76
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,500
to feel how wonderful it is

77
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,421
I don't want to do this

78
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:57,780
Then what do you want to do

79
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:01,940
Brother Tian, let me toast to you

80
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,100
I'll pay the ransom

81
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:05,900
but I really don't want to do scams

82
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:23,821
Alright

83
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,941
I won't force you

84
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:28,181
Tomorrow

85
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:29,381
I'll send you away

86
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,381
Really

87
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:39,261
A sudden burst of joy is impossible to suppress

88
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:42,381
Looks like you really don't want to stay here

89
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,381
Then I can rest assured

90
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,181
leaving you here.

91
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,300
I'm not your plaything.

92
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,980
At the bar, I thought you were

93
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:57,141
such a special person.

94
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:58,061
I didn't expect

95
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,980
I've heard about places like yours before.

96
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:03,540
But don't think you can convince me

97
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,581
to do scams with you.

98
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:05,980
Why not?

99
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,300
Isn't scamming good?

100
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,701
It's a crime.

101
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,821
It's an art.

102
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,181
Have you seen movies?

103
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:15,740
The convincing performances in movies

104
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,100
are called art.

105
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,701
We write scripts every day,

106
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,540
practice our lines,

107
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,381
all to make people believe it's real.

108
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:24,860
That's not the same.

109
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,021
How is it different?

110
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:29,261
For those who are lustful,

111
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,461
movies have adult films.

112
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:32,461
We have beautiful women for nude chats too.

113
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:34,980
For girls longing for love,

114
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:37,340
movies have handsome guys and sweethearts.

115
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:38,621
We can offer her

116
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,540
a custom-made online boyfriend just for her.

117
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,461
In any case,

118
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,701
whatever you need,

119
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:52,941
we let you experience it.

120
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,660
It's just that our fees

121
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,780
are only a little more expensive than a movie ticket.

122
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,701
This is different.

123
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,740
What you swindle away

124
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,181
is the hard-earned money

125
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:02,461
that others have saved up over a lifetime.

126
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,300
If you invest in a bad movie

127
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:08,621
and lose everything,

128
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:10,860
are you really going to sue in court?

129
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:14,860
When something like this happens, don't you feel cheated?

130
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,100
But when you just chat with us,

131
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:19,381
do you feel like you've been scammed?

132
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:24,181
Remember,

133
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:27,780
we have never forced anyone.

134
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,141
Maybe you think I'm not upright enough.

135
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,980
Maybe you think I'm just being sophistical.

136
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,980
Maybe you think I'm being too abstract.

137
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,181
Do you know the story of the blind men and the elephant?

138
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,381
We are all blind.

139
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,660
Touching the elephant called the world.

140
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:59,821
The reason we have different views on justice and crime,

141
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:01,501
evil and kindness,

142
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,900
and all sorts of opposing opinions,

143
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:06,461
is because we touch different parts.

144
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:08,980
My abstraction

145
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,621
is a critique of the world.

146
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:12,581
Manny,

147
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,061
are you willing to take one more step to the side

148
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:19,141
and feel another side of the elephant with me?

149
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:31,100
You two, check over there.

150
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:31,621
You.

151
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:37,821
You go that way, we'll go this way.

152
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:47,660
Who?

153
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,941
There's something going on in Corridor Two.

154
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,740
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

155
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,581
Alright, alright, alright.

156
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:15,540
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

157
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,581
Come on, let's go.

158
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:21,141
It's just the old janitor, nothing's wrong.

159
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:24,021
Feng Zhou is missing.

160
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:25,141
Everyone, go look for him.

161
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
You, go over there.

162
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,980
Come with me.

163
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:30,860
Go, hurry, move!

164
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,420
No.

165
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,740
Go, search outside.

166
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,701
Go.

167
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,220
What are you looking at?

168
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:12,980
You scared me.

169
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,301
Why did you climb down from here?

170
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:16,181
What are you doing?

171
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,020
Say something, what are you up to?

172
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,100
Go search over there.

173
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,500
I've been looking for you for ages.

174
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,740
I was trying to help you contact Ma Shuai.

175
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,181
I even stole a phone on purpose.

176
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:35,100
You actually dared to steal a phone?

177
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,181
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

178
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,461
Stealing a phone inside the compound—

179
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,181
Do you know you'll get buried alive for that?

180
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,061
Buried alive?

181
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:41,421
Brother Gou, you have to help me.

182
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,461
Tell me what's going on.

183
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:46,301
I did all this just to help you contact Ma Shuai.

184
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:48,781
If it weren't for helping you,

185
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,980
I wouldn't have needed to steal a phone at all.

186
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,220
If we get caught now,

187
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,181
we're both finished.

188
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,821
Open the door.

189
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:56,781
Help me, please help me.

190
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:58,220
Who's in there?

191
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,260
Open the door.

192
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:01,581
Me, me, me, me.

193
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:09,941
What are you doing? Why did it take you so long to open the door?

194
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:10,941
Who are you talking to?

195
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:12,980
Didn't you see this guy's gunshot wound?

196
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,821
It's opened up again.

197
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:14,661
What's going on?

198
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:16,100
How should I know what's going on?

199
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:20,500
Brother Tian

200
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,941
Brother Tian

201
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,661
Brother Tian

202
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,181
Look, this guy's hiding out here.

203
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,100
My old problem, gastritis.

204
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,740
I was squatting in the bathroom.

205
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,061
There was a loud bang, scared me half to death.

206
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,301
No way.

207
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,181
There's so much blood.

208
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,740
We need to get him to the hospital right away.

209
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,061
We can't take him to the hospital.

210
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,181
It's too dangerous.

211
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:43,901
If he's lucky, he'll survive.

212
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:45,020
If not, we'll bury him here.

213
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,260
A Bin

214
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:46,980
Here.

215
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,821
Yes.

216
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:15,020
Take him to the hospital.

217
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,140
You're lucky to be alive, kid.

218
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,020
Let's go.

219
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:48,181
Get someone to keep an eye on them for me.

220
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:50,061
Who they meet, what they say,

221
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,980
record everything and send it to me.
