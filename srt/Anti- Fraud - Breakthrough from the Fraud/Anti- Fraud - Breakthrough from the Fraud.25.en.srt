1
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,749
Brother Gou

2
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,950
Brother Tian is asking for you.

3
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:57,229
Brother Tian

4
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,070
What's going on?

5
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:01,470
Brother Gou

6
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:03,030
You haven't come back for so long.

7
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,110
I thought you had run away.

8
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,629
Girl, you're teasing me again.

9
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:08,390
Why would I run away?

10
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,710
I've been with Brother Tian for so many years.

11
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,269
Even if you ran away,

12
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:13,350
I couldn't run away.

13
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:14,910
So Brother Gou is certain

14
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,749
he's one of Brother Tian's old hands.

15
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:19,029
So no matter what mistake he makes,

16
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,710
Brother Tian will always let it slide.

17
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,589
Is that so?

18
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:23,589
It's not about being certain I'm an old hand.

19
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:26,029
I really am one of Brother Tian's old hands.

20
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,550
Besides, what mistake did I make?

21
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,550
How would I not know?

22
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:30,510
Brother Tian checked the accounts this morning.

23
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,869
The company is missing three million.

24
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:35,949
Whose side is the deficit on?

25
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,309
Do I really need to remind you, Brother Gou?

26
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,190
Three million wasn't credited to the account.

27
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,350
That's impossible.

28
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:56,469
Brother Tian

29
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:59,749
Maybe it's just that my mom is getting old.

30
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,550
She might have forgotten.

31
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:03,430
I'll remind her.

32
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,430
I'll tell her to call quickly.

33
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:05,749
Old Dog

34
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,910
You've been with me the longest.

35
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:09,389
You know the rules.

36
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,229
I know.

37
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:13,749
One time.

38
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,190
One hand.

39
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,709
But don't worry, Brother Tian.

40
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,669
Even if you gave me a hundred times the courage,

41
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:21,630
I still wouldn't dare to embezzle the company's assets.

42
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,630
Call her.

43
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,829
Brother Tian, actually I...

44
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,030
Brother Tian

45
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,709
The three million from Brother Dog's side has arrived.

46
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,949
I knew it.

47
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:06,149
Old Dog would never betray me.

48
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:08,949
From now on, don’t say things without evidence.

49
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,949
Don’t speak carelessly.

50
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,310
Yes.

51
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:15,989
This matter ends here.

52
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,190
Brother Tian,

53
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:18,790
I have something to say.

54
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,429
Brother Dog was actually scammed out of that three million.

55
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,549
Feng Zhou,

56
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:26,389
Is this your place to speak?

57
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:27,630
Sorry, Brother Dog.

58
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:29,590
I overheard you talking to Auntie on the phone at the hospital.

59
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,470
Auntie scraped together and borrowed three million.

60
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,269
Just to cover the company’s deficit.

61
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,590
Old Dog,

62
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,350
What’s going on?

63
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:39,510
Brother Tian,

64
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,829
I just feel

65
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,350
really uneasy inside.

66
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,790
I don’t know who’s trying to harm me.

67
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,590
To pull something like this.

68
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,549
Brother Tian,

69
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:47,149
Brother Dog feels

70
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,709
it’s embarrassing to admit he was scammed.

71
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:49,709
But I think

72
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,149
not saying anything only encourages the mastermind.

73
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,750
This isn’t just an ordinary scam.

74
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:55,149
You’d have to know Auntie’s work process

75
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:56,070
very well to pull this off.

76
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,389
It’s obvious someone in the company

77
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:58,549
is deliberately trying to harm Brother Dog.

78
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,630
I think internal strife is a minor issue,

79
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,590
but if someone dares to mess with the company’s money,

80
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,030
someone like that

81
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,870
can’t be kept around.

82
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,070
Right.

83
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:08,949
So that’s how it is.

84
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,989
Brother Tian

85
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:15,269
This matter must be thoroughly investigated.

86
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:17,510
A Bin

87
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,149
Here.

88
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:20,229
Check all the accounts under everyone's name.

89
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,549
Yes.

90
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,190
Those accounts you gave to Wang Shufen—

91
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,190
Are you sure they can't be traced?

92
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,230
Don't worry.

93
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,589
Those are all new cards.

94
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:37,589
They definitely can't be traced.

95
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:39,349
Also,

96
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,670
Any news from the person following Lao Gou?

97
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,630
He called me once before.

98
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,070
He said there was something wrong with Lao Gou.

99
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,110
I'll call him again.

100
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,789
Hurry up.

101
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:54,430
Brother Le

102
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:58,110
Have you figured out what's going on with Lao Gou?

103
00:05:58,909 --> 00:05:59,870
Yes, it's clear now.

104
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,630
There's nothing wrong with Lao Gou.

105
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,630
No problem.

106
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,510
Didn't you say that nurse was there

107
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,389
for a long time?

108
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:06,670
How is there no problem then?

109
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,670
The nurse did change his medication.

110
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,750
And Lao Gou also registered at the proctology department.

111
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,789
Alright, alright.

112
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,149
What a mess.

113
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:13,949
Get lost.

114
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:20,230
You two

115
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:23,750
I—is it okay for me to say this?

116
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:27,949
No, that's not right.

117
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,630
I suspect there's something wrong with Feng Zhou.

118
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,389
Find out everything you can about this person.

119
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,870
I want to see

120
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,789
what his real background is.

121
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:40,990
Menglu is Wei Qiang's advisor.

122
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,310
I originally wanted to use this opportunity to keep her in check.

123
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,870
Even if it's just for a few days.

124
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,269
But who knew she had already cleared herself of suspicion.

125
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:49,870
So, in the next few days, will Master and the others

126
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,750
make any moves?

127
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:51,949
In three days

128
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:53,949
at exactly noon on November 11th

129
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,750
Captain Jiang will join forces with the local police

130
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,190
to launch a full-scale raid on the park.

131
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,269
Also,

132
00:06:58,949 --> 00:06:59,949
it's now confirmed

133
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,829
that Kunka is Wei Qiang's protector.

134
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,029
He's the protector.

135
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,349
Then how will Master and the others work with the local police?

136
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:10,430
You said Kunka set up the fraud base

137
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,670
in the basement of our police station.

138
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,310
This is a clue provided

139
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,389
by one of the minor leaders we turned from the criminal group.

140
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:19,829
So, we invited you here today.

141
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:21,990
This Kunka

142
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,550
is truly a disgrace to our Mikde police.

143
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:24,789
Captain Jiang, your plan

144
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:25,550
we will fully cooperate.

145
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:26,709
That's great.

146
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:27,510
Thank you.

147
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,789
Zhehui,

148
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,789
about the list Captain Jiang sent back

149
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:32,750
the Double Eleven fraud list,

150
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,630
have you sent it to everyone?

151
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,469
I'm already sending it out.

152
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,670
I see.

153
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,430
Captain Jiang's side will launch the main operation on the eleventh.

154
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:40,110
So our task here

155
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,589
is to finish before the eleventh.

156
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:42,990
We must complete the operation.

157
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,789
This list is huge.

158
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,389
Time is tight and the task is heavy.

159
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,789
We must make sure

160
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:49,550
all the early warning preparations in Xinhai are ready.

161
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,389
Then, based on the phone number locations,

162
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:52,750
notify the local police.

163
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,149
We must protect every cent of the people's money.

164
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:56,829
Yes.

165
00:07:56,829 --> 00:07:57,630
Let's get to work.

166
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:00,510
Hello

167
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,029
This is the Xin Hai City Anti-Fraud Center

168
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:03,149
Double Eleven is approaching

169
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,510
Criminals are targeting Double Eleven

170
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,829
They have devised a new round of scams

171
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,389
The police would like to remind you

172
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:08,550
to pay attention to the following points

173
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,630
Scammers use illegal methods

174
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,949
to obtain your online shopping information

175
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,870
They may impersonate online store customer service or couriers

176
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,349
using excuses such as goods cannot be shipped

177
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:16,589
or delivery issues to contact you

178
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:17,589
and proactively offer refunds

179
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:18,430
and compensation

180
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,269
Please verify information through the official contact channels of the courier company

181
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:20,990
to confirm the details

182
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,230
Do not scan unknown

183
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,230
QR codes or links

184
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,510
And never provide your bank card password

185
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,149
or verification code to others

186
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:27,070
If you encounter fraud

187
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,349
please report it to the police promptly and keep relevant evidence

188
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:30,430
Thank you for your cooperation

189
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:30,990
Goodbye

190
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,269
Mr. Kunka

191
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,630
How is it going? Is everything going smoothly?

192
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,550
Don't worry.

193
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,750
Everything is going well.

194
00:08:58,149 --> 00:08:59,469
For this mayoral election,

195
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:00,589
besides me,

196
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,110
there's also that old fox, Sampa.

197
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,709
This time, you must fully support the campaign.

198
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:06,190
If we fail,

199
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:07,430
both of us are finished.

200
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,269
Understood.

201
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,789
Brother Tian

202
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:14,909
Mr. Kunka

203
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,670
If there's nothing else,

204
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,230
I won't bother you any further.

205
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,029
Brother Tian, there's a problem.

206
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,269
The list we selected

207
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,670
was all tipped off in advance.

208
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,709
What?

209
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:27,870
I'm afraid in the park

210
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:29,230
there's a mole.

211
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,349
A mole?

212
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:32,269
Who do you suspect?

213
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,389
Feng Zhou.

214
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,029
I've already arranged for someone to investigate him.

215
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,469
Find out the truth and report to me.

216
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:37,149
Yes.

217
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,510
So what about the Double Eleven plan now?

218
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,389
We can't miss this opportunity.

219
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,590
We need to find the mole,

220
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:54,990
and we still need to make money.

221
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:57,710
Otherwise, none of us will survive.

222
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:58,830
Yes.

223
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,590
As far as I know,

224
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,510
everyone on this list

225
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:16,309
has already been warned.

226
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:17,669
W-what should we do?

227
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:19,429
That's just what I wanted.

228
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,710
The local police have paved the way for us.

229
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,750
We'll use the name of anti-fraud police

230
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:26,309
to make calls and send links.

231
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:27,549
Then we'll steal money from their bank cards.

232
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,909
A big haul for Singles' Day.

233
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:32,350
Let's officially get started.

234
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,789
Call your number.

235
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:35,110
Say your lines.

236
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:36,189
Everyone,

237
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:38,710
let's thank the anti-fraud police.

238
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,710
Let's all get rich together.

239
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,669
Alright, alright, alright.

240
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,429
As long as he clicks the link,

241
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,510
no matter who he tries to call,

242
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:55,669
the call will come to us.

243
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,870
Thanks to the anti-fraud police back home

244
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,149
for paving the way for us.

245
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,710
Let's get started.

246
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,830
Okay.

247
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,149
Everyone, get to work.

248
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:05,630
Come on, let's get started.

249
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,110
Hello, Ms. Wang.

250
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:10,230
Yes, hello, hello.

251
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,669
I'm Xiao Zhang, the one who called you last time.

252
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:15,870
Hello, Liu Yang.

253
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,710
This is the Xinhai City Anti-Fraud Center.

254
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,950
The system shows an abnormality with your bank account.

255
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,870
It is very likely to be a scam.

256
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,789
Please contact the bank where your card was opened

257
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:23,590
to unfreeze your account.

258
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,029
This is Xinhai Bank.

259
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:26,590
May I ask if the last digits of your card are

260
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,669
8199?

261
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:28,309
We've checked on our end.

262
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:30,069
Your bank card is indeed at risk of being stolen.

263
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:31,710
Please follow the steps to unfreeze it.

264
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,069
Please enter your payment password.

265
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,990
Give me the phone.

266
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,870
I'll contact Captain Jiang.

267
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,510
Okay.

268
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:47,230
Who is it?

269
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,350
One of us.

270
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:58,990
She's also a police officer.

271
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,230
We need to issue a warning.

272
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:02,789
But there are too many victims now.

273
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,029
Someone has already been scammed.

274
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:05,069
So what's your idea?

275
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,269
Cut off the source.

276
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,189
Do you know about the laundering operations in the park?

277
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,510
You mean the domestic park laundering data?

278
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,750
Don't worry, leave it to me.

279
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,549
I'll take care of it.

280
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,789
This was sent back from Mikede.

281
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:27,269
The exact location of the money laundering operation.

282
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,789
They took advantage of our previous warning.

283
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:31,750
Instead, they impersonated us.

284
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,669
And carried out a reverse scam.

285
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,630
So this time,

286
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,830
we need to cut them off at the root.

287
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,750
Take down all their money laundering operations in the country.

288
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,110
Make sure they can't get a single cent out of the country.

289
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,149
At the same time,

290
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,909
we need to coordinate again with Captain Jiang from Mikede.

291
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:46,149
Synchronize our timing.

292
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,750
Each team must arrive at their assigned positions and lie in wait.

293
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:52,110
Act simultaneously at exactly twelve o'clock.

294
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:53,590
To avoid alerting the suspects.

295
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,750
So this time,

296
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:57,590
we must completely eradicate them.

297
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,149
Not a single one can slip through the net.

298
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:01,069
Yes.

299
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,029
Move out.

300
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,230
Today, the police from both countries will act at the same time.

301
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,630
The three of us must open the park gate at exactly noon.

302
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:26,189
Open the park gate on time.

303
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:28,069
To receive Captain Jiang and the Mikede police.

304
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,309
I'll provide cover.

305
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,309
I'll find a way

306
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,789
to distract the internal security at the gate.

307
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,309
I'll be in charge of opening the gate.

308
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:36,189
Feng Zhou.
