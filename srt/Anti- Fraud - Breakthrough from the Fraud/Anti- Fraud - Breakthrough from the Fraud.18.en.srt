1
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,410
This is Qin Lang's father.

2
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,330
It's Qin Lang.

3
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,210
Qin Lang.

4
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,170
He has already entered the scam park.

5
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,820
So they used AI face-swapping.

6
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,100
They swapped his face to Qin Zhijun.

7
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,820
My mentor disappeared more than ten years ago.

8
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,460
He couldn't possibly know I'm working in anti-fraud now.

9
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,570
Qin Lang knows.

10
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,650
So this person is Qin Lang.

11
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,140
Could he have already been exposed?

12
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,930
Wei Qiang had Qin Lang pretend to be my mentor.

13
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,420
That means Qin Lang has temporarily

14
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,610
gained Wei Qiang's trust.

15
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,170
I understand, Master.

16
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,020
So he's

17
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,700
sending you a message.

18
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,060
Wei Qiang wants to use Officer Qin to set a trap.

19
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,210
To lure you over.

20
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,290
Jiming.

21
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,650
The cross-border case procedures

22
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,820
How is the approval going?

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,460
It's already in the approval process.

24
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,530
You mean

25
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,610
What I mean is

26
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,340
Since Qin Lang wants us to play along,

27
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,060
let's cooperate and keep acting.

28
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,930
Once the paperwork is done,

29
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,900
we'll set out immediately.

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,140
Yes.

31
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,290
Gao Man.

32
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,900
You need to find a way to get close to Wei Qiang.

33
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,340
Right.

34
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,850
It'll be ready this afternoon, right?

35
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,370
Thank you so much, Director.

36
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,090
Alright, alright.

37
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,980
Got it.

38
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,060
Leaders,

39
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,850
Recently, overseas

40
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,450
Mikede scam activities

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,620
Becoming increasingly rampant

42
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,210
The social impact is extremely negative

43
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,340
It has already threatened the property safety of the general public

44
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,420
and public security

45
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,850
causing serious harm

46
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,850
The recent cases

47
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,370
have already been reported by the provincial department to the Ministry of Public Security

48
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,420
The ministry leaders attach great importance to this

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,780
After research and decision by the Ministry of Public Security

50
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,500
In order to implement the directives of the Supreme People's Court

51
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,010
the Supreme People's Procuratorate

52
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,930
and the Ministry of Public Security

53
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,930
regarding the handling of cross-border telecom network fraud

54
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,420
and other criminal cases

55
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,010
and opinions on the application of relevant laws

56
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,730
as well as the requirements set out in the documents

57
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,620
to crack down on those entrenched in Mikede

58
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,580
telecom network fraud gangs

59
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,250
a special task force has been established

60
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,810
for the 921 major transnational telecom fraud case

61
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,250
Comrade Zhao Jian is appointed as the leader of the task force

62
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,020
Comrade Jiang Haofeng as the deputy leader

63
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,460
They will go to Mikede to carry out Operation Sharp Blade

64
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,410
Yes

65
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,580
Master

66
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,410
Daqian

67
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,690
Director Zhao

68
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,620
Thank you for your hard work

69
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,250
Okay

70
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,090
Zheng Daqian from the Jiangdong City West Anti-Fraud Center

71
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,780
Zhehui

72
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
reporting for duty

73
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,210
Daqian

74
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,580
While Captain Jiang is handling the case abroad

75
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,300
thank you for coordinating the operation domestically

76
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,580
We will coordinate efforts both inside and outside

77
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,410
and win a beautiful victory

78
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,370
I'm counting on you

79
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,340
Stay safe

80
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,020
Okay

81
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,020
Salute.

82
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,620
After you arrive,

83
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,740
you must work with the local police

84
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,410
and coordinate closely with all departments.

85
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,690
We are determined to completely destroy

86
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,090
Salute.

87
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,860
the criminal base that has been entrenched abroad for many years,

88
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,620
led by the so-called Brother Tian,

89
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,930
which is a fraud gang's hideout.

90
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,650
Restore stability to society

91
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,740
and peace to the people.

92
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,210
Give me the gun.

93
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,780
Don't move.

94
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,740
Don't move.

95
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,650
Using him to threaten me?

96
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,580
Shoot, then!

97
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,410
You don't dare.

98
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,410
I'll help you.

99
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,540
Wu Tian.

100
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,220
I'm the Deputy Chief of the Mikede City Police Department.

101
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,060
You are already surrounded.

102
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,060
Give up your pointless resistance.

103
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,770
Surrender your weapon immediately.

104
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,180
If you do anything extreme,

105
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,810
we will open fire at once.

106
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,060
Jiang Haofeng.

107
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,930
Qin Zhijun is in my hands.

108
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,980
If I die,

109
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,540
you'll never know where he is.

110
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,810
Wei Qiang.

111
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,770
You definitely won't get out today.

112
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,420
How about this:

113
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,980
I'll give you a chance.

114
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,250
As long as you tell us the location of the compound,

115
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,300
I promise you

116
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,250
when you leave,

117
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,450
I'll let you keep your dignity.

118
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,300
Alright.

119
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,540
I'll cooperate with you.

120
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,450
Hurry up.

121
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,450
Get in the car.

122
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,130
Chase them.

123
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,500
Get in, old man.

124
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,100
Hurry up.

125
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,420
Are you okay?

126
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:09,690
Come here.

127
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,810
Son.

128
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,450
Dad.

129
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,010
It really is you, Dad.

130
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,420
I've been looking for you for so many years.

131
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,180
I knew you were still alive.

132
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,860
I...

133
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,740
I finally found you, Dad.

134
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,690
Son.

135
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,420
How did you end up here?

136
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,740
I guessed you were here.

137
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,220
I came here just to find you.

138
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,810
I just want to take you home, Dad.

139
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,180
You're really foolish.

140
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,810
No one comes back from here.

141
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,250
It's a dead end.

142
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,570
I was right.

143
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,810
You two really are father and son.

144
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,420
Don't!

145
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,330
Dad!

146
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,620
Dad!

147
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,180
What does he want to say?

148
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,860
You old loner.

149
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,820
What are you doing here?

150
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,820
You're awake.

151
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,770
Brother Tian wants to see you.

152
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,700
Let's go.

153
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,980
Isn't Qin Lang risking his life?

154
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,220
Why did he suddenly save Wei Qiang?

155
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,500
Because Wei Qiang mentioned his father.

156
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,010
Yes.

157
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,170
Given Qin Lang's personality,

158
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,410
even if there's only a one-in-ten-thousand chance

159
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,700
that Officer Qin is still alive,

160
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,820
he would still choose

161
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,050
to save Wei Qiang first,

162
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,410
and then try to get information out of him.

163
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,580
But he used his own body to block the bullets.

164
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,010
That's way too risky.

165
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,820
I wonder how badly he's hurt.

166
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,620
This is a risky move.

167
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,460
Gaining Wei Qiang's trust

168
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,580
is not easy.

169
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,290
Wei Qiang is a very cunning person.

170
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,410
I originally wanted to record

171
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,010
evidence of him admitting his identity.

172
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,580
But he didn't let anything slip.

173
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,770
If we had pinned him down on the spot back then,

174
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,770
none of these problems would exist now.

175
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,860
I still think there's something off with the local police.

176
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,460
You just said

177
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,580
that the situation at the time

178
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,370
didn't meet the conditions for using lethal force at all.

179
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,650
So why did they suddenly open fire?

180
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,580
It might involve internal issues within the local police.

181
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,370
Let's not jump to conclusions.

182
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,740
We'll talk when we have evidence.

183
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,740
Send the information we have so far

184
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,820
back to headquarters.

185
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,340
The situation on Captain Jiang's side

186
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,130
is even more complicated than we thought.

187
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,100
The main issue

188
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,410
is that without Wu Tian

189
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,410
there's no concrete evidence against Wei Qiang.

190
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,460
They can't figure out the location of the facility.

191
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,250
At the same time,

192
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,940
we have no law enforcement authority abroad.

193
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,460
This is also the biggest challenge Captain Jiang is facing right now.

194
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,860
It would be best to find a way

195
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,050
to obtain a sample of Wu Tian's skin tissue.

196
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,860
That way, we can confirm whether Wu Tian is actually Wei Qiang.

197
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,130
If we can confirm this person is Wei Qiang,

198
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,500
then it's very likely

199
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,650
we'll find our comrade who has been missing for years—

200
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,500
Qin Zhijun.

201
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,620
Qin Lang has already infiltrated the enemy.

202
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,130
In other words,

203
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,010
getting the exact location of the facility

204
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,770
and Wu Tian's biological information

205
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,980
is only a matter of time.

206
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,580
Notify Captain Jiang

207
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,340
On one hand, we need to quickly wrap up the 7-5 major case

208
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,130
and merge it with the current 9-21 major case

209
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,010
On the other hand

210
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,250
while ensuring Qin Lang's safety

211
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,370
we need him to send back more intelligence

212
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,650
We need to coordinate efforts both inside and outside the country

213
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,410
to protect as many people as possible

214
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,460
from being deceived

215
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,740
Daqian, Zhehui

216
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,050
you two must stay in constant contact with our overseas counterparts

217
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,620
and follow up immediately if there’s any news

218
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,740
First, coordinate with foreign teams

219
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,130
Second, protect domestic interests

220
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,740
You both have a heavy responsibility

221
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,290
Understood

222
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,410
About Tang Xiaobo’s cardholder case

223
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,170
How is it going?

224
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,130
We investigated all the bank card transaction records

225
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,740
provided by Tang Xiaobo

226
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,010
and found four local withdrawal records

227
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,100
but three of them were from over six months ago

228
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,050
which means the bank’s surveillance footage

229
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,890
is no longer available

230
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,220
There is one recent transaction

231
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,220
but because the person

232
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,770
was wearing a hat and a mask

233
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,650
it’s hard to see their face on the ATM footage

234
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,650
clearly

235
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,620
We can only judge by their body shape

236
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
that it’s a woman

237
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,580
So we’re still checking street surveillance

238
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,530
Do it as soon as possible

239
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:47,940
Okay

240
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,700
Master

241
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,370
Why are you rushing off in such a hurry?

242
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,050
Isn't the meeting over now?

243
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,770
You two, hurry up and get things done.

244
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,620
My time is almost up.

245
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,860
I have to go dance in the square.

246
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,860
Don't go, Captain Hao.

247
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,940
You need to stay and be our backbone.

248
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,220
Listen to what you're saying.

249
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,580
Your master is right here.

250
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,010
Why should I be the backbone?

251
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,980
Master

252
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,890
You wouldn't...

253
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,620
Are you really joining the seniors' club?

254
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,620
Stop with the nonsense.

255
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,940
Go do what you need to do.

256
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,620
Make good use of your time.

257
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,650
Take it easy.
