1
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,200
We've docked.

2
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,160
Gather your things and get off the boat.

3
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:56,959
Hurry up.

4
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,040
Brother Le,

5
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,919
All fourteen you asked for are here.

6
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:00,520
Check them.

7
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,520
Hello, everyone.

8
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:10,879
My name is Xiao Le.

9
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,799
Please do me a favor,

10
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,559
and call me Brother Le.

11
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,400
Today,

12
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,719
I'm in charge of taking you all to the company.

13
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,279
During this time,

14
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,480
if you have any issues,

15
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:21,680
you can come to me.

16
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:22,519
Next,

17
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,320
please hand over your ID cards

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,919
and personal communication devices.

19
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,880
Give them all to me.

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
We'll handle your onboarding together.

21
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,719
Take out your ID cards quickly.

22
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:36,719
Behave yourselves.

23
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,840
ID cards, take out your ID cards and phones.

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,840
Hurry up.

25
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,200
Yours.

26
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:40,639
Yours.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,559
Hurry up.

28
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,320
Hand yours over.

29
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:43,840
Quickly.

30
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,359
Don't make me take it myself.

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,999
Who's called...

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,559
Tang Xiaobo?

33
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,320
Tang Xiaobo

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,760
I don't know anyone named Tang Xiaobo.

35
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,999
Aren't the fourteen people you wanted all here?

36
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,919
Thanks to Brother Le for signing off.

37
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,279
Where is this place?

38
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:11,719
Weren't we supposed to go to Thailand?

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,400
Yeah, didn't we agree on Thailand?

40
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:13,999
And also,

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,519
Why do we have to hand over our IDs and phones?

42
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,119
Yeah, exactly.

43
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,160
Enough, enough.

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,119
What are you all arguing about?

45
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,239
You're all here to work illegally.

46
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,720
What's the point of keeping your ID?

47
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,560
If someone finds out, you'll just get deported.

48
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:25,799
Let me tell you,

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,880
Having a phone won't help you.

50
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:28,720
Go ahead and try.

51
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,919
Who can even make a call now?

52
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,320
Hand them over, now.

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,119
I'll get SIM cards for everyone.

54
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,799
Yeah, that's right.

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,119
Listen to Brother Le.

56
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,359
Hurry up and get on the bus.

57
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:39,720
You're about to get rich.

58
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,280
Are you guys running a scam?

59
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:41,839
I'm not going.

60
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:42,440
Let's go.

61
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,359
You, you're not going, huh?

62
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,119
Don't move.

63
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,359
Are you the one leading the refusal?

64
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:56,560
Don't move.

65
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,040
Wait, brother.

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,799
Don't do anything stupid.

67
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,280
These are all our people.

68
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,440
If you dare touch me,

69
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,160
they'll make sure you regret it.

70
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,040
What are you all standing around for?

71
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,119
Let's go.

72
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,320
Full of passion

73
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,359
Life never fails

74
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,040
High fighting spirit

75
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm the strongest

76
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,600
No pain, no gain

77
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,239
Life is tasteless

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,760
If you don't fight, don't struggle

79
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,320
It's like living for nothing

80
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,239
Hoeing crops under the midday sun

81
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,119
Sweat drips onto the soil beneath the crops

82
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,560
Arriving at the telecom team

83
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,560
Fifteen thousand a day

84
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,399
If you don't push, I don't push

85
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,000
When will our careers succeed

86
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,120
Dear family members

87
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,519
Please start your performance

88
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,120
Come on, let's begin

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,519
Go, go, go

90
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,320
Line up, line up

91
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,120
Go inside

92
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:36,399
Get them their clothes

93
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,440
Get them their clothes

94
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,800
Hurry up

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Where are your clothes

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,639
What are you looking at

97
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,200
You, behave yourself

98
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,479
Get the clothes, get the clothes

99
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,479
Everyone, take a good look

100
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,440
This is your employment contract

101
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:55,639
Once you sign

102
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,440
We become a family

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,159
Let's get rich together

104
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,000
What is a deposit

105
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,240
You

106
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:05,560
Your travel expenses

107
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,959
Entry and exit approval fee

108
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,039
Uniform fee

109
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,760
And your future accommodation fees

110
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,519
Training fee

111
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,599
We paid all those in advance

112
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,279
Everyone, please try to understand.

113
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,479
The competition in our industry is so intense now.

114
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,120
The talented people we worked so hard to train

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,800
leave to start their own businesses in no time.

116
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,440
The company is under so much competitive pressure.

117
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,200
Who will take responsibility?

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,920
There isn't much money.

119
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,120
It's just this small amount.

120
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,680
You can earn it back in a day or two.

121
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,000
Hello, is this Ms. Guo Shuyi?

122
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,560
Yes, it is.

123
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,399
This is the customer service representative from Xinhai Airlines.

124
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,159
Employee number 13658.

125
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,320
I'm sorry to inform you

126
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:45,519
that your flight CA7869 today

127
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,719
has been grounded due to a landing gear malfunction

128
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:48,000
and safety concerns.

129
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,320
Would you like to reschedule or get a refund?

130
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,320
I have something urgent to attend to.

131
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,479
When is the earliest available flight?

132
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,120
There is a flight that is

133
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,920
one hour later than your original flight.

134
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,719
Would that work for you?

135
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,159
Yes, please reschedule me to that flight.

136
00:06:59,479 --> 00:06:59,920
Alright.

137
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,599
Kid,

138
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,279
pay close attention and learn.

139
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,279
I've completed the process for you.

140
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,920
Since the delay was caused by our airline,

141
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
and disrupted your travel plans,

142
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
we will provide each passenger

143
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,599
with a 300 yuan delay compensation.

144
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,440
Mingan Insurance will handle the compensation for you.

145
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,399
The specific instructions will be sent to you

146
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,200
via text message to your phone.

147
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,320
Please keep an eye out for it.

148
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,240
Please rate my service later.

149
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,120
Wish you a pleasant day.

150
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:29,800
She took the bait.

151
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,959
Next,

152
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,320
no matter what number this lady dials,

153
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,719
whatever phone number she calls,

154
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,519
it will all come to us.

155
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:38,920
Hey, newbie,

156
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,120
watch closely.

157
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,680
Three,

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,360
two,

159
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:51,959
one.

160
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,719
Hello?

161
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,519
This is Ming'an Insurance customer service.

162
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Employee number 45673.

163
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,920
How can I help you?

164
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,560
Hello.

165
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,200
I have a flight delay insurance claim

166
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,039
that hasn't been paid out.

167
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,680
I can't access the website.

168
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,399
Can I handle it on my phone?

169
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,880
Yes, you can.

170
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,519
Could you please provide your ID number

171
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,399
and the last digits of your phone number?

172
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,399
Okay.

173
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,120
Sorry.

174
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,719
Ms. Guo, sorry to keep you waiting.

175
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,920
To refund to your bank card,

176
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,279
we need to verify your funds.

177
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,920
Currently, we can't process that here.

178
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,399
You can call the bank for fund verification.

179
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,760
That's so troublesome.

180
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:31,719
Fine, fine.

181
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,360
I'll call the bank then.

182
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,079
Here,

183
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,760
this is the bank's script.

184
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,680
You can read Chinese, right?

185
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,120
Read it exactly as written.

186
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,519
Not a single word wrong.

187
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:47,719
Come on,

188
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,039
answer the call.

189
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,760
Hello, hi.

190
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,639
This is the customer service representative from Xinhai Bank.

191
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,159
Employee ID 89757.

192
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:20,200
How can I assist you?

193
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,240
A claim payment from Ming'an Insurance can't be credited.

194
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,360
Please help me verify my bank card funds.

195
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,440
Sure, I can do that.

196
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,959
Please enter your payment password on the keypad.

197
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,519
End with the pound key.

198
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:03,119
It's on fire.

199
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,119
The internet is down.

200
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,320
What are you doing?

201
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,800
What's going on?

202
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,719
It's all ruined.

203
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,400
What's happening? What's happening?

204
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,440
Get up.

205
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,160
What's going on?

206
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:15,200
What's going on?

207
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,599
Ask him.

208
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I was just one step away from making the fraudulent transaction.

209
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,800
This idiot.

210
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,839
It was just a tiny spark.

211
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,759
He dumped such a big bucket of water on me.

212
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,920
All the business on my whole row of machines

213
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,280
got completely messed up because of him.

214
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,119
Who are you talking about?

215
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,920
Who are you cursing at?

216
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,400
You.

217
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:32,479
I was just worried the script would burn up and be gone.

218
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,719
I think he did it on purpose to mess things up.

219
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:35,640
Don't make false accusations.

220
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,599
Who did something on purpose?

221
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:37,640
I was just trying to help.

222
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:40,920
I was trying to cool him down.

223
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:41,359
Alright.

224
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,719
What are you doing?

225
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,839
Don't just stand there.

226
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,040
Hurry up and clean this up.

227
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,040
It's fine now, it's fine.

228
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,079
Get back to work.

229
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:54,999
Go on, go on.

230
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,160
We're about to get paid.

231
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,079
Why are you just standing here?

232
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,520
Tell me, between death and being foolish,

233
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,359
which one is worse?

234
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,440
This place is so big,

235
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,119
it must be hard for you to clean it all by yourself.

236
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,719
In a few days, I'll find someone to help you.

237
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,400
You'll definitely like him.

238
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,719
Actually, I really hope

239
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:48,920
you're just pretending to be foolish.
