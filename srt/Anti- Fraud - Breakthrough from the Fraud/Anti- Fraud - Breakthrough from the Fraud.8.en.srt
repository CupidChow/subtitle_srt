1
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,719
Xiao Jiang

2
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:18,639
Come, come, come.

3
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,279
What's up, Captain Hao?

4
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,359
I want to report something to you.

5
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:24,279
Today I saw someone on the street.

6
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:26,279
Judging by his gait,

7
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,119
he looked exactly like Wei Qiang from back in the day.

8
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,319
Only the face has changed.

9
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,119
Wei Qiang?

10
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,839
Help me check Linshan Street again.

11
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:40,999
The T-junction.

12
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,959
2 p.m.

13
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:44,920
Between 2:50 and 3:00 p.m.

14
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:50,840
Looks like him.

15
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,319
It really does.

16
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,639
Check where this car went.

17
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:57,039
Captain Jiang.

18
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,959
After this car entered the suburbs,

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,920
it disappeared.

20
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,679
Check the origin of this car.

21
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,160
Who is it?

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,200
You're the boss, right?

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,039
Yes, yes, yes.

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,999
Here, let me see your ID.

25
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,160
Are you sure?

26
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,079
No problem.

27
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,920
Let me ask you something.

28
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:12,839
This car—

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,559
Was it rented out from your place?

30
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,119
Officer,

31
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,759
this person came here the day before yesterday.

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,319
I still have his ID as collateral.

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:19,919
Let me show you.

34
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,679
He said he was only renting for one day.

35
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,520
But he still hasn't returned the car.

36
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,679
I can't reach him at the number he left.

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,520
I can't find him either.

38
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,520
Officer,

39
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,600
this Wu Tian—

40
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
he's not a fugitive, is he?

41
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:43,679
Master

42
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:45,880
Captain Jiang

43
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:46,839
What's wrong?

44
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,679
Li Zhaodi has been released on bail pending trial.

45
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,520
Released on bail pending trial?

46
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,800
She's pregnant.

47
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,000
There's a hospital certificate.

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,600
Captain Hao

49
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:56,039
Take a look.

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,199
Her mother came today to return all the stolen money.

51
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,759
She also took her away.

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,360
Logically speaking,

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,199
her relationship with her mother was almost broken.

54
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,919
How could her mother help return the stolen money?

55
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,720
Besides, all their family's money

56
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,119
was used for Li Zhenye's wedding.

57
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,919
In such a short time,

58
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,319
where did they get so much money?

59
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,240
Captain Jiang, you mean

60
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,319
someone is manipulating things behind the scenes?

61
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,239
From this interrogation record,

62
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,160
Li Zhaodi isn't that simple.

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,799
She has a strong sense of counter-investigation.

64
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,680
And she's familiar with our interrogation procedures.

65
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,359
She doesn't seem like an ordinary petty scammer.

66
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,160
Alright.

67
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,680
You two, hurry up.

68
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,919
Go to Li Zhaodi's hometown.

69
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,919
See what's going on.

70
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,519
Yes, sir.

71
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,639
She's pregnant.

72
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,319
Bail pending trial.

73
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:47,720
Alright, alright.

74
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,479
Go out, go out.

75
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,919
It's obvious you're no good.

76
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,720
Who knows whose bastard child she's carrying.

77
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:52,280
Besides,

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,319
we cut ties with her a long time ago.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,079
If you want help with this, find someone else.

80
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,600
We can't handle it.

81
00:04:59,039 --> 00:04:59,560
Mom.

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,479
Talk to them properly.

83
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,840
What if this child

84
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,120
is related to this gentleman?

85
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,239
Sir.

86
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,720
Let's sit down and talk.

87
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,000
I think

88
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,720
bail pending trial is possible.

89
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:20,799
Zhenye.

90
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,759
Wait before you speak.

91
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,720
But our family's situation,

92
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,720
you've seen it yourself.

93
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:26,320
You just mentioned one million.

94
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,280
For our family,

95
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,160
even if I sell everything we own,

96
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,479
we still couldn't come up with that much money.

97
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,400
Don't worry.

98
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:32,799
The money—

99
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,520
I'll pay.

100
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,479
Then—

101
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,080
We can't just help for nothing, right?

102
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,919
If you have any requests,

103
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,760
just say it.

104
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:45,160
Then on top of that money,

105
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,160
add another five hundred thousand.

106
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,760
Yes, five hundred thousand.

107
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,119
Alright.

108
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,799
I knew I wasn't wrong about you.

109
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,400
This child must be yours and my sister's.

110
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Then can I ask

111
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,479
how long have you and my sister been together?

112
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,720
Eight years.

113
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,559
That's a really long time.

114
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,720
I have an account to settle with you.

115
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:12,999
Look,

116
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,720
for a beauty like my sister,

117
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,919
if you were to keep someone like her outside,

118
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:17,879
for a year,

119
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,720
it would cost at least six hundred thousand, right?

120
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:22,320
So, six times eight is forty-eight.

121
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,919
You owe us 4.8 million.

122
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,160
Of course,

123
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,879
as the child's uncle,

124
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,160
I'm reasonable.

125
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,799
I'll give you a discount on this.

126
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,320
Let's make it 4.5 million.

127
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,640
I'll handle it for you.

128
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,400
Zhenye.

129
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,119
Watch your mouth.

130
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,919
What do you mean, "keep someone"?

131
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,439
What about our Zhenye?

132
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,760
I know my words sound a bit harsh.

133
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,359
We're marrying off our daughter,

134
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,479
not selling her.

135
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,640
But as for the bride price,

136
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:52,799
this is the amount.

137
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,119
Think about it,

138
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,799
Zhaodi is a young, unmarried woman.

139
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,280
She's been with you for so many years.

140
00:06:58,679 --> 00:06:59,239
And now,

141
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,479
she's pregnant with your child.

142
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,760
I can't rely on her for my old age anymore.

143
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,119
I can't count on her now.

144
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,119
So this money,

145
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,119
you have to give it.

146
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,200
You must.

147
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,200
Brother-in-law,

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,080
listen to me.

149
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,119
A beauty like my sister,

150
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
she's a great deal for you.

151
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:25,600
Is there anything else?

152
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:26,479
No, that's all.

153
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:27,799
That's all.

154
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:29,119
That's it.

155
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,119
Mom,

156
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,720
don't.

157
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,200
Are there any other requests?

158
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:48,320
No, no.

159
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,919
No, no, no.

160
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,520
Hello, Master.

161
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,119
Have you arrived at Li Zhaodi's hometown?

162
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
About ten more minutes.

163
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,879
We're almost at the village entrance.

164
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,960
Be careful.

165
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:05,760
Okay.

166
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,479
You're still feeling sorry for them.

167
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,919
They're not worth it.

168
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,439
I didn't want you to come back in the first place.

169
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,720
I was afraid they'd take advantage of you.

170
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,119
You treat them like family.

171
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,720
They just want to drain you dry.

172
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,359
I heard

173
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,840
that people who die in a fire

174
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,879
their souls

175
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,999
will be trapped in the house forever.

176
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,640
They can't be reincarnated.

177
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:46,720
That's actually good.

178
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,559
At least they won't have to be family in the next life.

179
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:32,999
Hello

180
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,039
What?

181
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,919
There's been a fire.

182
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,559
This is the scene of the fire at Li Zhaodi's house.

183
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,119
We also found at the scene

184
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,359
a burned gasoline can and a lighter.

185
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,960
It's clearly arson.

186
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,399
But we didn't find any fingerprints at the scene.

187
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,159
Luckily, Qin Lang and I arrived just in time last night.

188
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,119
We managed to save Zheng Hongmei and Li Zhenye.

189
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,119
But both of them suffered extensive burns.

190
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,359
They're currently in a coma.

191
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,800
They're still not out of danger.

192
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,200
Also, Li Zhenye's right hand

193
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,840
was injured by a sharp object before the fire.

194
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:05,920
Last night

195
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,399
on our way to Li Zhaodi's house,

196
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,920
we saw a black Mercedes coming out of the village.

197
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,879
Our dashcam recorded it.

198
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,920
What was the license plate number?

199
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,399
Jiang A99523.

200
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,680
I've checked this car.

201
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,759
This car was rented from a scrapyard.

202
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,960
The owner is Wu Tian.

203
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,279
The ID is fake.

204
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,320
Wu Tian.

205
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,560
Captain Jiang, who is this Wu Tian?

206
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,560
How did you find out?

207
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,759
This is an old case.

208
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,080
He's involved.

209
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,320
There's not enough evidence right now.

210
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,800
Once the evidence is solid,

211
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
I'll update everyone.

212
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,320
This Li Zhaodi—

213
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,720
Are there any other leads?

214
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,479
Yes.

215
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,840
Yesterday at 4:20 p.m.,

216
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,960
Zheng Hongmei picked up Li Zhaodi from the detention center.

217
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,040
Then they got into Li Zhenye's private car.

218
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,519
They went straight back to Li Zhaodi's home.

219
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,879
She hasn't been seen since.

220
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,119
I went to the service center

221
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,040
and pulled Li Zhaodi's communication records.

222
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
I found that she deleted two

223
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,680
messages after returning to the country.

224
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:03,320
The other party said, since you're back,

225
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,759
let's meet at the usual place to check the goods.

226
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:05,720
Check the goods?

227
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,720
What goods are they checking?

228
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:10,920
Is there anything else?

229
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:11,879
No, that's all.

230
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:12,840
Check the goods.

231
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,639
Check the goods at the usual place.

232
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,399
No matter what these goods are,

233
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,239
they're definitely connected to the fraud gang.

234
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,440
This arson case

235
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,680
has the main suspects

236
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,680
Wu Tian and Li Zhaodi.

237
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,479
And the only clue we have right now

238
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,040
is this black Mercedes.

239
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,720
So,

240
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,560
let's assign more people.

241
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,680
In our city,

242
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,879
all possible

243
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,239
entry and exit routes should be blocked.

244
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,279
Keep these two trapped in the city.

245
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:35,879
They can't go anywhere.

246
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,960
Then, using the clues from this car,

247
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,600
find these two people.
