1
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,239
You're here.

2
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,159
I made this bento for you.

3
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,599
Go ahead and eat.

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,119
You should eat too.

5
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,920
Xiaoxi.

6
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,240
I love you.

7
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:44,479
I know.

8
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,439
I love you too.

9
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,479
Do you really love me?

10
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,600
I worked hard to make you dinner.

11
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,920
I came to see you so happily.

12
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,600
But you were getting close with them.

13
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,439
Laughing and chatting together.

14
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,439
I didn't.

15
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,119
No, I didn't.

16
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,879
So now you've learned to lie to me, right?

17
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,680
Then who was that guy who just came by?

18
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,920
He's Gaoman's colleague.

19
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:05,680
He just came to buy a cup of coffee.

20
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,360
I accidentally spilled it for him.

21
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:08,680
Besides,

22
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,600
Gaoman's friend

23
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,279
is also my friend.

24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,199
Now I finally understand.

25
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,479
You never really cared about me.

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,359
Are Gaoman's friends all more important than me?

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,719
Then go find them. I'm leaving.

28
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,839
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

29
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,320
You're important.

30
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,320
You're the most important.

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,279
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,479
I was wrong, I really was.

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,279
Xiaobo.

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,479
I was wrong.

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,759
I was wrong.

36
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,040
I was wrong.

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,279
I was wrong.

38
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,880
I was wrong.

39
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:45,559
I was wrong.

40
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,119
I was wrong.

41
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,279
You're doing this again.

42
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,279
Does it hurt?

43
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,200
It hurts me too.

44
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:38,920
My heart aches.

45
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,839
Xiaoxi,

46
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,559
Can you stop doing this from now on?

47
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,080
I love you.

48
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,119
I love you more than anyone else, really.

49
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,999
Every time you burn yourself,

50
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,879
it feels like my heart is being cut with a knife.

51
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,400
Be good.

52
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,039
Let's not make any more mistakes, okay?

53
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,200
For me,

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,119
for our love,

55
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,520
please don't let me down again, okay?

56
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:05,960
Okay.

57
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:07,520
Okay.

58
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,760
Let me take this call.

59
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,159
Get up.

60
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:30,920
Big brother.

61
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,879
Are you guys done yet?

62
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,279
Didn't we agree

63
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,999
to meet and talk properly this weekend?

64
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:42,119
I will definitely pay back this money.

65
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,520
No, you're pushing me to the edge.

66
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,719
What good does that do for you?

67
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,599
Xiaobo,

68
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:52,520
Big brother.

69
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,080
I can't run away.

70
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,319
Xiaobo

71
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:06,279
Who do you owe money to?

72
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,159
It's nothing.

73
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,999
What exactly happened?

74
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,319
Tell me.

75
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,559
I... Didn't I open a shop before?

76
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,559
I ended up owing some money.

77
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,279
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

78
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:25,479
Xiaoxi

79
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,599
You've already helped me too many times.

80
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:29,000
I can't take your money anymore.

81
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,080
It's okay.

82
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,919
All the money I make from my shop can go to you.

83
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,159
Silly.

84
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,000
This money isn't nearly enough.

85
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,440
Back then,

86
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,400
I was young and got tricked by someone too.

87
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,239
I started taking out high-interest loans in college.

88
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,520
Now with my business, I've lost everything again.

89
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,520
How much is it?

90
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,359
1.2 million.

91
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,080
That much?

92
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,440
No.

93
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:54,599
Xiaoxi, listen to me.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,039
I've already thought of a solution.

95
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,039
I'll go work somewhere soon.

96
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,799
After a few years, I'll pay them back with what I earn.

97
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,719
Then I'll come back for you.

98
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,239
Don't worry.

99
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:06,640
How about this—

100
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,599
I'll help you figure something out.

101
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,560
There's 1.35 million in this card.

102
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,839
Take it and pay off your debt right away.

103
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,320
No.

104
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,760
I can't take this money.

105
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,799
Your dad bought this house for you.

106
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,679
It's fine.

107
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,880
They don't know yet.

108
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,679
Wait for me.

109
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,679
When I make some money,

110
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,279
I'll buy you a bigger place.

111
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,919
How many times have I told you?

112
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,919
I don't want you to keep in touch with her anymore.

113
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,039
You can only be mine.

114
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:10,560
Do you understand?

115
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:11,440
I promise you.

116
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:14,120
Okay.

117
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,000
Master.

118
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,520
According to Lin Sanpeng's statement,

119
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,760
the leader of their scam operation is called Brother Tian.

120
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,279
Lin Sanpeng's job is to lure people out of the country.

121
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,479
He transports them to the port in Mikede City abroad.

122
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,719
But he doesn't know

123
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:39,960
the exact location of the scam operation.

124
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:41,440
Share this with Captain Hao.

125
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:41,719
Yes.

126
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,880
Captain Jiang, we've compiled the latest data.

127
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,159
The number of people lured by Yafeng Club in recent years

128
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,440
has reached 183.

129
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:48,520
Here's the detailed list.

130
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,799
Persuade them to return and notify their families.

131
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,359
Captain Jiang.

132
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,679
Yafeng Club also has a money laundering channel.

133
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:55,239
Really?

134
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,120
Two months ago, they took a big order.

135
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,400
Through this lead,

136
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,919
we found a large batch of secondary cards.

137
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,200
Hurry up.

138
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,679
Find the source of these secondary cards.

139
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:03,960
Okay, got it.

140
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,200
Captain Jiang.

141
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,120
This is my self-criticism report.

142
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,599
Thanks.

143
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,520
I've already reflected on it.

144
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:22,919
Congratulations.

145
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,440
What's wrong?

146
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,479
Xiaoxi's parents said

147
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,400
Xiaoxi hasn't been home these past few days.

148
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,960
The café hasn't been open either.

149
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:34,120
And they can't reach her by phone.

150
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:39,599
Now that you mention it,

151
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,440
the last time I went to the café,

152
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,400
she was acting strange.

153
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,440
She knew I was your friend,

154
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,719
but she barely talked to me.

155
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,960
There were also a lot more cameras in the shop.

156
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,320
Right, does she usually smoke?

157
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,400
No, she doesn't.

158
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:53,919
But she had a lot of cigarette burns on her hand.

159
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,159
Cigarette burns?

160
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,520
Could something have happened to her?

161
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,200
Give me her phone number.

162
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,679
Sorry,

163
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,520
the person you are calling is not answering at the moment.

164
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,400
Sorry,

165
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,239
the person you are calling is not answering at the moment.

166
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,000
Please wait—

167
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,599
Xiaobo.

168
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,520
Why haven't you been answering my calls?

169
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,679
Did something happen again?

170
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,279
I'm starting a business.

171
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,239
I'm really busy.

172
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,799
If I talk to you every day,

173
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,679
how am I supposed to make money?

174
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,039
Alright, alright.

175
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,799
Then I won't bother you anymore.

176
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,319
Remember to eat well.

177
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,039
I'm waiting for you at the Ni's Haitai Hotel.

178
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,559
Come whenever you can.

179
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,319
I called and asked.

180
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,600
He Xiaoxi is right here.

181
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,559
Hello, Teacher He.

182
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,799
Dad, Xiaoxi.

183
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,720
Mom.

184
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,199
Dad.

185
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,199
Mom.

186
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Why are you here?

187
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,120
You ungrateful child!

188
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,679
We worked so hard to raise you.

189
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,039
And this is how you repay us?

190
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,919
This is just disgraceful and shameless!

191
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:38,199
Keep your voice down.

192
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,480
You want me to keep my voice down?

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,480
Look!

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,159
They even sent nude photos to my phone.

195
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,640
They're blackmailing us for three hundred thousand.

196
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
How did we end up with a child like you?

197
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,000
You've completely ruined my reputation.

198
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,720
I told you long ago to break up with that delinquent.

199
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,600
But you just wouldn't listen.

200
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,720
Xiaoxi, what exactly is going on?

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,919
Tell Mom.

202
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,720
Was it that delinquent who did this?

203
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,880
If it really was him,

204
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:01,319
we'll call the police right away.

205
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,959
Let the police arrest him.

206
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:04,400
It wasn't him.

207
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,120
It definitely wasn't him.

208
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:07,400
If it wasn't him, then who else could it be?

209
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,000
With the way he is,

210
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,079
You think I'm wronging him?

211
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,919
Call him and tell him to come here.

212
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:11,760
We'll confront him face to face.

213
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,640
Go on, call him!

214
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,159
Hello.

215
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,640
The number you dialed is currently busy.

216
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,199
Please try again later.

217
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,679
See?

218
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,039
He doesn't even dare to answer the phone.

219
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,319
And you're still defending him?

220
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:39,039
Enough.

221
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,679
I'm a principal, after all.

222
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,679
I've raised you for over twenty years.

223
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:49,319
Of all the people you could be friends with,

224
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,640
you just had to pick a thug like him.

225
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,319
All you do is cry.

226
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,760
What else are you good for?

227
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,919
Since you were little,

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,480
have you ever made us proud even once?

229
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:00,120
Have you ever done anything that satisfied us?

230
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,600
You can't study well.

231
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,240
Your work isn't up to standard.

232
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,480
And your friends are all shady.

233
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,079
Look at your life so far—

234
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:08,799
besides causing us trouble,

235
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,360
what else can you do?

236
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,919
If I ended up like you,

237
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,400
I'd rather be dead.

238
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,120
What are you saying?

239
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,760
Old He

240
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,880
How old are you now?

241
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,120
Can't you change that bad temper of yours?

242
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,919
Teacher, Mrs. Teacher

243
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,439
I haven't been able to reach Xiaoxi by phone.

244
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:29,159
Is she okay?

245
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,679
She's upstairs.

246
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,159
Go upstairs and check on her.

247
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,120
Mrs. Teacher, what's wrong?

248
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,079
Xiaoxi, she...

249
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,120
Manman

250
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,240
Go upstairs and talk to her.

251
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,400
Tell her not to associate with those people anymore.

252
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,159
About this matter...

253
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,120
It's understandable that her father is angry.

254
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,120
Okay.

255
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,959
Mrs. Teacher, don't worry.

256
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
I'll go check on her.

257
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:54,880
Don't worry.

258
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,880
Xiaoxi

259
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:12,600
Xiaoxi

260
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,319
Xiaoxi, are you okay?

261
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,600
Manman

262
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,240
Do you also think

263
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,279
Xiaobo is a bad person?
