1
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,300
You're awake.

2
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,300
You're quite something, kid.

3
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,060
You can even fall asleep in a place like this.

4
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,690
What else am I supposed to do if I don't sleep?

5
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:24,980
Cut the crap.

6
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,890
Tell me your real identity.

7
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,300
And your reason for coming here.

8
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,620
What identity or motive could I possibly have?

9
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,300
I already told you.

10
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,460
I'm here to make money.

11
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,330
Stop pretending.

12
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,570
Do you even know where you are?

13
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,460
I could kill you in a second, you know.

14
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,530
Not to be rude, but you sure talk a lot.

15
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,140
Why so many words?

16
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,780
I told you, I'm just here to make money.

17
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,570
But you don't believe me anyway.

18
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,740
If you've got the guts, kill me. Go ahead.

19
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,610
Tell me who you really are.

20
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,500
I'm your father.

21
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,020
Within three steps,

22
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,060
you could've shot Xiao Le right away.

23
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,610
But you deliberately backed down.

24
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,210
Then you disarmed him with your bare hands.

25
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,740
And you purposely spilled water at the workstation.

26
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,210
Do you think I'm blind?

27
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,250
So what?

28
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,780
Did I forget to tell you?

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,970
I've already found out your real identity.

30
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,820
But

31
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,420
I want to hear you say it yourself.

32
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,210
If you've already found out who I am,

33
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,210
then you should know the consequences of killing me.

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,370
Kid,

35
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,010
you're getting a bit cocky.

36
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,340
You're even more arrogant than I am.

37
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,060
The police back home already know what's going on here.

38
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,500
It's only a matter of time before they track us down here.

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,210
Are you trying to drag us all down with you?

40
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,650
Do you think that when the police from home arrive,

41
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,810
you'll be able to get away?

42
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Feng Zhou.

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,290
Qin Lang.

44
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,900
Qin Lang.

45
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,290
Gao Man, have you seen Qin Lang?

46
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,420
I want him to play Feng Zhou.

47
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,420
Senior, don't worry.

48
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,370
I'll go look for him.

49
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,010
Okay.

50
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,210
Please give him this script for me.

51
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:57,810
Okay.

52
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,570
Alright, don't worry.

53
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,420
You'll go straight on stage in a bit.

54
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,090
Wait a minute.

55
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,420
Why do you all get to play the police

56
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,140
while I have to play the drug dealer?

57
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:04,620
I'm not doing it.

58
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,290
Aren't you the one who knows this drug dealer best?

59
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,500
Why can't you play him?

60
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,850
I know Feng Zhou because I want to catch him,

61
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,810
not because I want to play him.

62
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,370
How about I treat you to a meal?

63
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,540
This isn't about food.

64
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,500
This is a matter of principle.

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,210
You're really not going to do it?

66
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:15,900
I'm really not.

67
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:16,780
Alright then.

68
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,930
I even told Senior

69
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,210
that I could definitely convince you.

70
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,250
So we could finish the performance.

71
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,300
Looks like I overestimated myself.

72
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,780
I'll try to think of another way.

73
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,020
Wait.

74
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,650
Fine, I'll help you this one time.

75
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,210
Don't you already know?

76
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,180
Then why are you beating around the bush with me?

77
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,690
But there's one thing you've forgotten.

78
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,460
The police back home can't reach this place.

79
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,780
You're a smart person.

80
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,690
You should know what to do.

81
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,650
None of us are fools.

82
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,300
You guys are just scammers.

83
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,810
Even if the police aren't after me,

84
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,210
sooner or later they'll take down this place too.

85
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,930
Why should I trust you?

86
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,460
The reason you came here

87
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,780
isn't it because you had nowhere else to go?

88
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,210
So many people come here every year to scam.

89
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,780
This is the safest place in Mikede.

90
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,650
If I can keep them alive,

91
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,300
I can keep you alive too.

92
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,810
I've trafficked drugs.

93
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:21,900
I've killed people.

94
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,180
Don't you already know that?

95
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,810
I'm not afraid of anything.

96
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,250
As long as you pay me.

97
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,210
Alright.

98
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,250
I can take you to make big money right now.

99
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,900
Take him back to see Brother Tian.

100
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,460
The higher-ups have already agreed.

101
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,900
to create a fake identity for Qin Lang.

102
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,460
And use the identity of Feng Zhou.

103
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,370
Issue a wanted notice.

104
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,810
But can you be sure

105
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,250
he can match up with this identity?

106
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,250
I believe

107
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,530
as long as Qin Lang hears the name Feng Zhou,

108
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,740
he'll know what to say.

109
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:53,930
Okay.

110
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,810
Feng Zhou.

111
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,860
Interesting.

112
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:04,810
Brother Tian.

113
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,650
Feng Zhou is here.

114
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:12,970
Brother Tian

115
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,620
I heard you've smuggled drugs before.

116
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,620
Let me check.

117
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,220
Brother Tian

118
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,220
You’re ignoring such big business in the industrial park,

119
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,620
and instead doing this kind of life-risking job.

120
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,180
Alright.

121
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,860
I'll check it for you.

122
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,420
Who gave you this stuff?

123
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,100
What's wrong?

124
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,010
At least half of this is glucose.

125
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,660
Brother Tian, if you keep doing things like this,

126
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,420
you'll end up like Wei Qiang back in the day.

127
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,450
You had dealings with Wei Qiang?

128
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,130
Not really.

129
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,690
Who's Wei Qiang?

130
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,570
He was a legendary figure in the business back then.

131
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,690
Brother Qiang.

132
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,100
I was just a small-time lackey.

133
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,010
No way I could have any connection with him.

134
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,420
He even had his own drug lab.

135
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,450
But it was because he mixed glucose into his stuff

136
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,620
that he got ratted out by his peers.

137
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,130
Later, the police raided his whole operation.

138
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,890
After that, he disappeared from the scene.

139
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,250
So you mean

140
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,540
Wei Qiang went down because he was cutting his product?

141
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,010
I think he just wasn't smart enough.

142
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,220
What do you mean?

143
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,690
Smart people

144
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,980
know which ship won't sink.

145
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,620
They know which business will keep them alive.

146
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,810
You're pretty smart yourself.

147
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,620
But I don't know if you'll last long.

148
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:48,860
Whether I last or not

149
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,540
depends on what Brother Tian has me do.

150
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,500
Right?

151
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,180
But I don't believe

152
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,660
Brother Tian is interested in this stuff.

153
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,890
So now it's up to you

154
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,250
to see if you can get on my ship.

155
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:09,930
Come in.

156
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,740
Master.

157
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,250
Let me report to you.

158
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,500
According to Tang Xiaobo's confession,

159
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,220
we have arrested

160
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,860
one of his hideouts in the city.

161
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,220
On the surface, they run a casino,

162
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,860
but in reality, they're a card fraud gang.

163
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,450
They specialize in providing bank cards to overseas scam organizations.

164
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,420
We suspect

165
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,060
Long time no see, Officer Jiang.

166
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:45,980
Wu Tian.

167
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:47,930
Or

168
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,620
should I call you Wei Qiang?

169
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,100
I think

170
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,420
you must be looking for me everywhere.

171
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:56,810
So,

172
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,180
have you found any leads?

173
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,770
You’re pretty bold.

174
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,100
Daring enough to video call me.

175
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,740
What do you want from me?

176
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,370
I wouldn’t bother you if it wasn’t important.

177
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,060
An old friend just wants to catch up with you.

178
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,810
Master.

179
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,220
Wei Qiang.

180
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,620
If you have a problem, come at me.

181
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,980
Let them go.

182
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,130
Wei Qiang.

183
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,370
Who is Wei Qiang?

184
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,860
I just heard about this person.

185
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,250
He’s an old friend of yours.

186
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,770
He wants to have a chat with you.

187
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,100
So I’m making it happen.

188
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,660
Wei Qiang, I—

189
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,420
What are you going to do?

190
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,810
9 a.m. the day after tomorrow

191
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,620
Abandoned steel factory at 85 Mickdeliya Road

192
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,420
This person wants to see you one last time

193
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,570
Jiang Haofeng

194
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,890
I don't care if you're with anti-fraud now

195
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,010
or with narcotics

196
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,770
Wei Qiang's case

197
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,250
you're not allowed to touch it anymore

198
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,450
Sit down

199
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,300
Master

200
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,220
Master

201
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,010
What are you doing

202
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,010
You really got into character

203
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,810
I didn't know you weren't recording, Brother Tian

204
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,930
The acting was pretty good, right

205
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,980
Bring him with you the day after tomorrow

206
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,220
Master

207
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:34,980
Master

208
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,700
Master

209
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,890
Wei Qiang

210
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,860
I know you're here

211
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,250
Come out

212
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,890
Where is my master?

213
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,050
Who is Wei Qiang?

214
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,620
I'm just an honest businessman

215
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,010
What,

216
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,220
your master's life matters,

217
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,700
but my wife and child's lives don't?

218
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,820
She had no grudge against you

219
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,100
but you got her killed

220
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,620
You owe me an explanation

221
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:45,860
An explanation for what?

222
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,170
What kind of explanation do you want from me?

223
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,100
Wei Qiang

224
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,940
Just to deal with me alone,

225
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,620
you brought such a big setup.

226
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,100
You brought four assassins,

227
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,500
and there's even a sniper aiming at me from afar.

228
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,410
Wei Qiang,

229
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,620
we've been rivals for ten years.

230
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,050
No matter how much you change your face,

231
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,820
I can recognize you at a glance.

232
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,620
Drug trafficking,

233
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,370
fraud—

234
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,650
both are punishable by death.

235
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,220
Let's stop hiding things from each other.

236
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,460
What evidence do you have that I'm Wei Qiang?

237
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,370
And what proof do you have that I trafficked drugs or committed fraud?

238
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,290
But you,

239
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,250
can you even get out of here today?

240
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,740
I came here alone and unarmed.

241
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,010
I never planned to leave here alive today.

242
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,740
Wei Qiang,

243
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,010
if I die, I want to die knowing the truth.

244
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,700
Just one question.

245
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,980
That night ten years ago,

246
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,580
what did you do to my master?

247
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,410
Is he—

248
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,650
still alive?

249
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,010
You want to know?

250
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,410
He—

251
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,010
what does he have to do with me?

252
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,700
I was just seeking justice for my woman.

253
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,820
Is that wrong?

254
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,620
If you want to find your master,

255
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,740
try in your next life.

256
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,010
Brother Tian, let me handle this.

257
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,010
Come out.

258
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,500
This is a dead end.

259
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,370
Why did you really come?
