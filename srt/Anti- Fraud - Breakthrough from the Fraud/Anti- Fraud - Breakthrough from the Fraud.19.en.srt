1
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,319
Alright.

2
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,479
Take a break, take a break.

3
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,040
Come on, come on.

4
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,319
Please have a seat.

5
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,119
Sit, sit, sit.

6
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Why are you so proactive now?

7
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,639
Before, when I asked you to dance,

8
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:41,719
you barely paid any attention to me.

9
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,600
I just didn't know what was good for me back then.

10
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,800
I didn't see how great you were.

11
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,160
But now, at a glance,

12
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,480
among all these people,

13
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,120
you're the most charming one.

14
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,800
I've known you for so long,

15
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,920
but I still don't know what you do for a living.

16
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,800
What kind of job could I possibly have?

17
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,759
It's my son who's really capable.

18
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,120
Where does your son work?

19
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,000
He's just an ordinary worker.

20
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,039
Brother Hao,

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,959
what do you do for a living?

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,559
I've done all sorts of things.

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,959
When I was young,

24
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
I traveled all over the country.

25
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,959
I spent some time in Southeast Asia.

26
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,440
The food there was really awful.

27
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,880
I could never get used to it.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,880
There was this thing called "nai si tang" candy.

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,919
It tasted like dirty socks.

30
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,240
I'm sure you've never tried it.

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,559
Actually, I have.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,520
My son sent some to me from over there.

33
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,520
I tasted it and it was terrible.

34
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,520
I scolded him for it.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,319
I threw it all away.

36
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,479
So your son works in Southeast Asia too?

37
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,720
No, just traveling, just traveling.

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,160
Let me take this call.

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,520
Go ahead, please.

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,919
Hello, son.

41
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,640
Mom, the three million the company needs to launder—

42
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,919
Did you withdraw it all in cash?

43
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,759
Don't worry.

44
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,160
I've already withdrawn it all.

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,960
I'll deposit it into those cards you gave me later.

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,919
Don't rush yet.

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,120
The old cards can't be used anymore.

48
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,319
I'll give you a few new bank cards.

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,400
Then I need to notify them quickly.

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,120
Yes, yes, that's right.

51
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,079
Let's leave it at that.

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,319
I'll talk to you later.

53
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,720
Meng, Lao Gou's mom took the bait.

54
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,919
Send her this batch of new card numbers.

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,319
Make sure Lao Gou doesn't suspect anything.

56
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,960
Who are you calling?

57
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,680
A friend.

58
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,799
A friend invited me to play mahjong.

59
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,359
Today?

60
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,519
Let's stop here for today.

61
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,120
Let's meet another day.

62
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,359
Don't be like that.

63
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,120
You're really no fun.

64
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,919
Next time, I'll definitely play a full round.

65
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,919
Alright, alright.

66
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,400
Hello

67
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:30,960
Daqian

68
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,079
Help me check a car

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,519
I'll send you the photo

70
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,639
Send me the surveillance footage

71
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,319
from the ATM from the past two days

72
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,680
Brother Tian

73
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,600
This Kunka isn't being fair, is he?

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,680
We pay him so much money every year

75
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,000
and he actually shot at you

76
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,720
He clearly doesn't take you seriously

77
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,199
If Feng Zhou hadn't reacted quickly

78
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,519
and taken the bullet for you

79
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,720
who knows what would have happened

80
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,280
No one dares to imagine

81
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,680
In that situation

82
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,720
he was afraid I'd really fall into the hands of the police

83
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,519
and expose him

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,440
That's why he wanted to kill me to silence me

85
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:01,560
Brother Tian

86
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,519
I don't know if I'm right

87
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,720
We need to find a new backer

88
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,799
Kunka isn't reliable

89
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,120
It's not that simple

90
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,919
We still can't do without him right now

91
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
What about Jiang Haofeng?

92
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:14,160
Brother Gou

93
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,359
Kunka is running for mayor soon

94
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,799
So during this period

95
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,880
he absolutely won't allow

96
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
any negative news

97
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,239
What do you know?

98
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,160
Wait, so you mean

99
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,200
we can't touch Jiang Haofeng now?

100
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,999
Don't rush

101
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,919
He can't stir up any trouble in Mikde

102
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,359
Let's stabilize Kunka first

103
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,720
We have more important things to do

104
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,960
Jiang Haofeng took you hostage.

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,280
I didn't hold back.

106
00:05:58,919 --> 00:05:59,919
You have a problem with me.

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
That's only natural.

108
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,760
But I was about to kill you.

109
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,760
Why did you still save me?

110
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,439
Seriously, is there something wrong with you?

111
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:09,559
I just saved your life, and you—

112
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,840
What are you talking about?

113
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,960
What are you doing?

114
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,799
What's your purpose?

115
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:17,919
Speak.

116
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,479
For money.

117
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,520
What else could I want?

118
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,520
Money.

119
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,999
Isn't making money the reason we do this?

120
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,520
I can leave on my own.

121
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,320
Can you really leave?

122
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,960
If you die, who am I supposed to get the money from?

123
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,720
I'd rather lose my head

124
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,640
than do a losing deal.

125
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,720
Aren't you the same?

126
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,320
How much do you want?

127
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,520
For me to do this job,

128
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,999
fifty.

129
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Is that okay?

130
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,879
Saving your life

131
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,320
is also fifty.

132
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:54,960
That's not too much, right?

133
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,119
A total of one million.

134
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,439
In unmarked cash.

135
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,439
Give it to me and I'll leave right away.

136
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,320
But what if I want you to stay?

137
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,439
Boss,

138
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,999
I really don't dare stay here with you.

139
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,879
I just saved your life and now you want to kill me.

140
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,239
If I stay here with you,

141
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,840
Brother,

142
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,960
I really admire you.

143
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,559
You're pretty skilled.

144
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,320
When you pretended to be Qin Zhijun before,

145
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,520
you did a great job.

146
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,999
You're quite a talent.

147
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,479
A full meal.

148
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:20,720
Every meal is full.

149
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,640
Pick one.

150
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,760
Alright.

151
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,119
But you still have to give me my one hundred.

152
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,479
I'll give you two hundred.

153
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,479
Brother Tian,

154
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,359
From now on, follow Abin.

155
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,559
Boss,

156
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,479
Let me take a call.

157
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,239
Hello, son.

158
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:17,919
Mom.

159
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,600
Didn't I tell you already?

160
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,799
If there's something, I'll contact you.

161
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,679
I've transferred the money to you.

162
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,520
Did you receive it?

163
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,600
When did I ever ask you to transfer money to me?

164
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:27,960
Didn't you say

165
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,559
to transfer three million to you?

166
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,520
And that you changed to a new set of cards?

167
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,960
I didn't change my account.

168
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,600
When did I ever change to a new account?

169
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,960
What's going on?

170
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
You said it this afternoon.

171
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,520
What?

172
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,439
Son, what exactly is going on?

173
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:48,919
Are you having trouble with someone again?

174
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,119
Mom.

175
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
I'll look into this right now.

176
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:55,640
Before I figure this out,

177
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,119
no one can know about this.

178
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:57,760
And you absolutely can't call the police.

179
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,640
Do you understand?

180
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,119
I have to use my own money

181
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,679
to cover that three million first.

182
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,119
This is company money.

183
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,679
If Tian finds out, he'll kill me.

184
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,320
You can forget about seeing your son again.

185
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,320
Son...

186
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,479
Don't scare me like this.

187
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,320
Alright, alright.

188
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,679
I'll contact you if anything comes up.

189
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,280
Haozi.

190
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,879
Someone moved the money.

191
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,320
Find out for me right now

192
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,520
who's messing with me behind my back.

193
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,320
Hurry up.

194
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,960
Big brother, bro, bro.

195
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,080
Sorry, let me wipe it.

196
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,639
Yeah.

197
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Sorry, sorry, bro.

198
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:58,960
Are you blind?

199
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,560
A Bin.

200
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:00,800
Forget it.

201
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,159
Thank you, boss. Thank you, boss.

202
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:03,920
Come out here.

203
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,119
Let's go, let's go.

204
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,999
Brother Tian.

205
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,399
Me.

206
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,920
I didn't know you had a grudge with that guy named Jiang.

207
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,320
That cop with the last name Jiang.

208
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,519
I see.

209
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:30,920
You give me four hundred thousand.

210
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,200
I'll kill him tomorrow.

211
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,080
You're really blinded by money.

212
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,800
Who would complain about too much money these days?

213
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
That person.

214
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,119
I'll handle it myself.

215
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,320
You're going to do this yourself?

216
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,639
Isn't there another one?

217
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:47,080
What's his name?

218
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,359
The one who pretended before.

219
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,680
Qin Zhijun.

220
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,320
For that one, give me two hundred thousand.

221
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,800
I'll kill him for two hundred thousand.

222
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,200
Let's go dance.

223
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,200
What are you doing here?

224
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,840
Is your injury okay?

225
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,960
I'm fine.

226
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,479
I asked you, what are you doing here?

227
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,479
To help you.

228
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:51,999
Help with what?

229
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,560
Do you know how dangerous it is here?

230
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,560
Go back right now.

231
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,479
I can handle it alone.

232
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:56,720
Qin Lang.

233
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,840
I told you I wouldn't let you take risks alone anymore.

234
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,720
Now isn't the time to let emotions take over.

235
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,639
May I have this dance?

236
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,840
Is that okay?
