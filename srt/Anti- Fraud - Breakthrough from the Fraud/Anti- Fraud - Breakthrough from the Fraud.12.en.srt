00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:12,821
Thank you.

2
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:19,461
Hello, dear passengers.

3
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,461
The cruise heading from Xinhai to Mikede

4
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:24,420
Golden No. 2 cruise is preparing for security check.

5
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,100
Passengers taking the Golden No. 2 cruise

6
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,260
please organize your luggage and belongings.

7
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,701
Proceed to the security checkpoint.

8
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,581
Hello, Master.

9
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:36,460
Where are you?

10
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,100
At the dock.

11
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,341
Going to Mikede.

12
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:40,581
What exactly are you trying to do?

13
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,660
Qin Lang is being reckless.

14
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,300
And you're following along with him.

15
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,260
Come back right now.

16
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:44,300
I can't go back.

17
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:46,101
I'm already getting ready to board.

18
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,581
Do you understand the nature of what you're doing?

19
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,101
I know.

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,300
He doesn't want to wear his police uniform anymore.

21
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,581
You don't want to wear it either.

22
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:51,660
Master.

23
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:54,101
It's not that I don't want to wear this uniform.

24
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,101
It's just that now Qin Lang and I are partners.

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,501
Since we're partners,

26
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,260
we should share honor and disgrace, advance and retreat together.

27
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:00,940
That's what you've always taught me.

28
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,421
Golden No. 2.

29
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,060
So I'm sorry, Master.

30
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,940
Ticket checking has started.

31
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:04,181
Please line up.

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,620
Come on, come on.

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,340
Ticket checking over here.

34
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,781
Enter.

35
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,020
Your ticket.

36
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,341
Let go of me.

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,180
What are you doing?

38
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,421
Going to Mickde.

39
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,100
I know you're trying to stop me this way.

40
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
But I'm telling you, it won't work.

41
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:24,540
Don't waste your effort, just go back.

42
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:25,740
I'm not trying to stop you.

43
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:27,020
I want to go with you.

44
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,380
Do you know what this counts as?

45
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,380
Without approval from superiors, it's acting without authorization.

46
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,221
You know the consequences.

47
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,660
You're being so fussy.

48
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:33,940
Gaoman.

49
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,861
Hasn't it been your dream since childhood to be a police officer?

50
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:37,900
Once you cross this gate,

51
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,900
it will affect your whole life.

52
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:40,900
Finding your father

53
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,100
isn't that something you've always wanted to do too?

54
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:43,740
Yes.

55
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,900
So this is my own business.

56
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,781
I'll go by myself.

57
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:48,061
Qin Lang, let me tell you,

58
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,501
we're partners now.

59
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,020
So this isn't just your business anymore.

60
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:58,261
I'm not going.

61
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:05,861
I remember in our junior year,

62
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,141
when we interned at the station,

63
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:09,221
that time,

64
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,421
you insisted on catching that drug dealer by yourself.

65
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:14,421
Back then,

66
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:17,141
I didn't know the whole story.

67
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,381
I thought you just wanted to show off.

68
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,220
So,

69
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:25,060
I remember now.

70
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:26,981
You mean reporting it to the station?

71
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:29,620
That wasn't your fault.

72
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,141
I was also to blame for acting on my own.

73
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,261
Besides,

74
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:34,661
that drug dealer was pretty dangerous too.

75
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:36,340
If you hadn't reported it,

76
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,900
and the station hadn't sent someone to escort me back,

77
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,261
I might have been hurt even worse.

78
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,900
But I really didn't expect

79
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:46,661
that you would get punished because of it.

80
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:48,220
And even have to repeat a year.

81
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,701
Repeating a year wasn't just because of you.

82
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:57,460
But about that incident,

83
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,460
I don't really have any regrets.

84
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,740
It's just that

85
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,460
if back then

86
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,060
I had known about your father's situation,

87
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:08,500
I would have understood

88
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:11,300
why catching that drug dealer

89
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,381
was so important to you.

90
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,060
I heard from my mentor

91
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:23,900
that your father

92
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,581
went missing while trying to capture Wei Qiang.

93
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,101
I remember the year my dad had his accident,

94
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,500
I had just started middle school.

95
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,421
It was just an ordinary afternoon.

96
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:36,900
My mom was still preparing

97
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,220
a change of clothes for my dad.

98
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:39,740
Suddenly, we got a phone call.

99
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:40,821
On the call, they said

100
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:44,300
that while my dad was chasing drug dealers,

101
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,941
he went missing along with them.

102
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:47,541
At that time, I didn't realize

103
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,701
how serious the situation was.

104
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,261
But then, the waiting

105
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,101
lasted ten years.

106
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,701
Ever since my mom got that call,

107
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:56,981
she fell ill.

108
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,300
And after she got sick,

109
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:01,101
as you know,

110
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:03,141
medical bills became a bottomless pit.

111
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,981
The team donated some money,

112
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,981
but we couldn't rely on others forever.

113
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,661
Uncle Hao and Captain Jiang had no other choice

114
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,180
but to declare my dad as having died in the line of duty.

115
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:19,861
That way, I could receive compensation.

116
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,381
But you know,

117
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,180
when I signed the papers,

118
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:27,381
it was the most humiliating moment

119
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,460
of my life.

120
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:33,141
For the sake of money,

121
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,701
I had to sign my dad's death certificate.

122
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,020
But my mom was saved.

123
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,340
Although her health was never the same as before,

124
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,141
she always felt

125
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:03,100
she would never hear any news about my dad again.

126
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,061
But I told myself,

127
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:07,181
no matter if he's dead or alive,

128
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,061
I have to bring him back.

129
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:20,220
Don't worry.

130
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,941
No matter how difficult it gets,

131
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,460
I'll be with you.

132
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,581
We'll bring your dad back.

133
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,621
Meng,

134
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:36,660
If you ask me,

135
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,621
you've done so much to help Tian.

136
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:40,301
But now Zhao is gone.

137
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,501
And Lao Gou has quickly pulled the people from Group Three

138
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:43,701
over to his side.

139
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:44,621
Why does it seem like

140
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:46,061
he's determined to win this?

141
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,900
Look how arrogant Lao Gou has been these days.

142
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,141
He's almost walking all over us.

143
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,261
What should we do?

144
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:54,501
Let's wait for Tian to come back and then decide.

145
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:11,540
Tian,

146
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,701
you're back!

147
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,141
You've had a tough time.

148
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,701
Tian,

149
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,540
Tian.

150
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:28,780
As expected, Sister Zhao is really gone.

151
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:29,860
Brother Gou was the farsighted one after all.

152
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,460
He made his move early.

153
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:33,701
Um, Brother Tian.

154
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,821
Where is Sister Zhao?

155
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Did something happen to her?

156
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,860
If anything's wrong, you can tell me.

157
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:44,141
Why didn't you stop him?

158
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,460
Look at how smug he is.

159
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:49,780
He’s just relying on someone powerful.

160
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,501
At such a critical moment,

161
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,220
the higher you jump,

162
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:57,381
the harder you fall.

163
00:07:59,261 --> 00:07:59,701
Brother Tian.

164
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,460
Stop hitting me, Brother Tian, please.

165
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,701
I've been away for so long,

166
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:04,780
and this is all you've accomplished?

167
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,540
I was wrong, Brother Tian.

168
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:07,261
I know I was wrong, Brother Tian.

169
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:14,381
Congratulations to Sister Meng for taking over Group Three.

170
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:16,301
Keep it low-key.

171
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:18,701
Brother Tian hasn't officially announced it yet.

172
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:20,301
Once Brother Tian announces it,

173
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:21,860
it's just a matter of time.

174
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:23,741
Cheers!

175
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,061
Sister Meng.

176
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:26,261
Sister Meng.

177
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:28,821
Brother Tian asks you to come to the office.

178
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:30,181
Okay.

179
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,381
Brother Tian

180
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,141
About Sister Zhao

181
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,581
My condolences

182
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,581
When a person is gone, the light goes out

183
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:52,621
What's the use of condolences

184
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,460
Let's talk about the company

185
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,780
Xiao Zhao is gone

186
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,261
Her Group Three is now leaderless

187
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,900
I know you two are both fighting for it

188
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,660
Competition is a good thing

189
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,381
But I don't want our own people

190
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:06,821
to fight each other to the bitter end

191
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,581
Brother Tian

192
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:11,540
But some people keep picking fights

193
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,701
How do you want to arrange it

194
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:17,301
We'll do whatever you say, Brother Tian

195
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:18,061
Of course

196
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:19,301
Who doesn't listen to Brother Tian

197
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,660
Then this cup of tea

198
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,301
is for Lao Gou

199
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:54,860
Thank you, Brother Tian

200
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:09,860
Jiming

201
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:10,661
Captain Jiang

202
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:11,661
Later, go over the Yafeng Club

203
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,500
and re-interrogate the other suspects

204
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,541
See if you can get any useful information out of them

205
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,980
Okay, I'll go now

206
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,581
Captain Jiang

207
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:23,340
What about the two of us

208
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,061
You two write a self-criticism

209
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,100
What?

210
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,220
Don't you know what you two did

211
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,500
Write a self-criticism

212
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:31,301
Three thousand words

213
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,061
Make it thorough

214
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:32,581
Reflective

215
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:33,541
From the heart

216
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:35,661
That's not really fair

217
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:36,340
Qin Lang

218
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,500
How am I being unfair?

219
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,860
It's not unfair to me.

220
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,100
It's unfair to Gao Man.

221
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,821
I acted on my own, so I'll write a self-criticism.

222
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:50,500
That's how it should be.

223
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:51,901
But everything Gao Man did

224
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,980
was to persuade me to come back.

225
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:54,140
Why should she have to write a self-criticism?

226
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:57,380
Fine.

227
00:10:58,181 --> 00:10:58,541
Gao Man.

228
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,260
You go interrogate Lin Sanpeng in a bit.

229
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,500
You

230
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,941
keep writing your self-criticism.

231
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,181
Six thousand words.

232
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:10,460
Doesn't anyone else have work to do?

233
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:47,860
Rewrite it.

234
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:03,100
Qin Lang

235
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,340
Go buy me a cup of coffee.

236
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,661
Aren't you supposed to be writing a self-reflection?

237
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:07,581
Let me see.

238
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:08,821
No.

239
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,661
So this is the so-called top student in the whole school,

240
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:19,500
and this is your self-reflection?

241
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,941
You'd better just go buy me coffee.

242
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,220
When you get back,

243
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:24,620
I'll help you think about it.

244
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,021
Really.

245
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,620
Hurry up.

246
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:37,941
Four coffees.

247
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,901
Make one of them a latte.

248
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:41,541
Less coffee, more milk.

249
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,460
Xiaoxi, you don't remember me?

250
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:48,500
I'm Gao Man's friend.

251
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:49,701
That day, I was sitting right

252
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,901
Why are there so many more cameras in your shop now?

253
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:00,421
The area near our police station isn't very safe.

254
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:07,581
What happened to your arm?

255
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:12,860
I'm not in a good mood.

256
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,100
It's fine, I'll do it myself.

257
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,100
Sorry.

258
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,500
It's okay.

259
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,021
Sorry.

260
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,301
Witch.
