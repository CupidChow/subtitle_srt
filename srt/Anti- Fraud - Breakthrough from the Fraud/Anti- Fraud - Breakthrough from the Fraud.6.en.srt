1
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,279
Brother Tian

2
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,199
I want to go home for a bit.

3
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,359
Go home?

4
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,000
Why?

5
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:25,679
My younger brother is getting married.

6
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:27,040
He's getting married?

7
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,799
And that's why you want to go home?

8
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,319
I originally planned that for the rest of my life,

9
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,600
I wouldn't have any contact with them.

10
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,439
But they just called me.

11
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,319
They asked me to be my brother's wedding witness.

12
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,200
You know as well as I do,

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,639
only someone respected in the family

14
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,120
is qualified to be the wedding witness.

15
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,240
After all these years,

16
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,359
it feels like I'm being valued for the first time.

17
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,399
Right now, I really want to go back and see them.

18
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,600
I also want to experience

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,319
the kind of feeling my brother has,

20
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,079
being loved by our parents.

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
Even if it's just once.

22
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:14,399
Qianqian

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,600
What's going on?

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,959
Where's my engagement ring?

25
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,720
If we don't see Li Zhaodi's engagement ring today,

26
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,039
the wedding can't go on.

27
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,919
Your daughter-in-law is going to leave.

28
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:22,919
Son, son, listen to me.

29
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,720
Zhaodi, she promised me.

30
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:26,000
But she hasn't come back yet.

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,199
I'm anxious too.

32
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,759
If she hasn't come back, hurry her up!

33
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:29,919
You go handle things for now.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,759
I'll figure something out here.

35
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:31,640
Go, hurry!

36
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,080
Go now!

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,039
There’s been no record of her entering the country these past two days.

38
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,759
Maybe she never came at all.

39
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,759
Don’t worry.

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,640
Let’s wait a bit longer.

41
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:46,600
Okay.

42
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,759
Next, let’s give a warm round of applause to welcome

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,199
the officiant of today’s wedding,

44
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:51,600
the groom’s older sister,

45
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,640
Miss Li Zhaodi to the stage.

46
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,479
Where is she?

47
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,080
Why isn’t she here yet?

48
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,839
Let’s welcome the groom’s sister, Li Zhaodi.

49
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:06,880
Li Zhaodi, please come in.

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,000
It’s a wedding, let’s be happy, okay?

51
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,319
She’ll definitely come.

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,319
She’s here.

53
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:14,919
She’s here.

54
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,239
Wait a moment.

55
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,280
Let her finish her speech on stage.

56
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,560
Zhaodi,

57
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,239
why are you only arriving now?

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,199
Did you buy your brother's engagement ring? Did you?

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,120
Let me see it.

60
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,479
I bought it, I bought it. Don't worry.

61
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,400
Honestly...

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,280
Xiaolong,

63
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:43,799
hurry up.

64
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,160
Take it up to Zhenye.

65
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,079
Why are you only just getting here?

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,280
Didn't I make it just in time?

67
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:50,880
See?

68
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,160
You only arrived now.

69
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,519
I had no choice but to let your uncle be the witness.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,560
Look at you.

71
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,720
You must be tired from the journey.

72
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,280
How about this—

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
go over there and rest for a bit.

74
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:02,720
Go on.

75
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,319
I need to go on stage.

76
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,120
Hurry up and go.

77
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,199
It doesn't matter who goes up.

78
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,479
Go.

79
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:10,440
Go on.

80
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,119
Now, let's invite the groom to speak.

81
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,119
As for me,

82
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,160
being able to marry such a wonderful wife

83
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,119
makes me truly very happy.

84
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,080
From now on,

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
I hope all our friends and family can be witnesses.

86
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:40,879
I

87
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:44,239
will also treat Qianqian with all my heart.

88
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,039
I'll give all my love to Qianqian.

89
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,479
And of course, to my mom as well.

90
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,119
Our whole family

91
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,080
thanks everyone again for your blessings.

92
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,720
Can I walk out by myself?

93
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,160
Officer,

94
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,879
Officer,

95
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:21,799
Wait, wait.

96
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,559
Hold on, officer.

97
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:22,879
What's wrong?

98
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,879
Officer,

99
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,359
we wrote something.

100
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,479
Could you take a look for us?

101
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:26,879
Yes.

102
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,320
If we write it like this,

103
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,320
can it clearly separate us from her?

104
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,799
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

105
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,080
I can't let her hold back our family's Zhenye

106
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:34,640
and our little grandson

107
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,879
and their future prospects.

108
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:38,320
Yes.

109
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,600
We made three copies of this.

110
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,600
Could you officers please sign as well?

111
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,039
As witnesses.

112
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,200
Officer,

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,239
we're begging you.

114
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
We really need to sever ties.

115
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:23,720
I did it.

116
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:28,999
It was fraud.

117
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,960
After I graduated from middle school,

118
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,999
I worked at an electronics factory.

119
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,720
To support my younger brother's education.

120
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,039
I couldn't earn much at that time.

121
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,039
My parents said I was useless every day.

122
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,679
Later, when I was abroad,

123
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,640
I saw a high-paying job offer.

124
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:46,280
And the educational requirements weren't high.

125
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,320
I didn't realize it was a fraud syndicate.

126
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,999
At first, I really didn't want to do it.

127
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:54,359
But they tortured me.

128
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,320
They locked me in a water cell.

129
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,840
They even made me sit in an electric chair.

130
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,320
Look at me.

131
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,679
I was almost tortured to death by them.

132
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:07,479
If you want to survive,

133
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,479
you have to do what they say.

134
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,479
Back then, I thought every day about how to get back.

135
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,160
But I knew

136
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,640
I had to gain their trust first.

137
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,479
Only then would I have a chance to leave.

138
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:20,840
So,

139
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,640
when they told me to commit fraud,

140
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:24,239
I did it.

141
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,919
When they told me to do nude video chats,

142
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,359
I did that too.

143
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,080
Until they thought

144
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,119
I had committed enough crimes.

145
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,840
I didn't dare to run anymore.

146
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,439
Only then did they finally let me come back.

147
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,559
To attend my younger brother's wedding.

148
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
I originally thought

149
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,119
that if I earned more money,

150
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,999
my family would value me more.

151
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:47,439
How did you come back?

152
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:48,479
I snuck in illegally.

153
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,479
People like us, when we return to the country,

154
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,879
basically all do it illegally.

155
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,720
Because we don't know if the police are watching us.

156
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,200
We can't risk having an entry record.

157
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,720
Officer,

158
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,239
am I going to be in prison for many years?

159
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,720
When did you join the fraud organization?

160
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,400
A year ago.

161
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,479
Around March last year.

162
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,239
But I haven't been scamming people for that long.

163
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,080
I...

164
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,239
Where is your compound located?

165
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,320
I only know it's in Mikede City.

166
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,799
But I don't know the exact address.

167
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,520
Because when we went in and out,

168
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
we always had to be blindfolded.

169
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,960
How many people are there in your compound in total?

170
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,479
Probably more than two hundred people.

171
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,679
I don't know the exact number.

172
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,479
You just said

173
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,479
when did you start

174
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,679
actually doing the scamming yourself?

175
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:33,439
Around June last year.

176
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,040
Write down the victims of fraud that went through you,

177
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:42,519
their names and the amounts.

178
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:43,879
Write them all down.

179
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,519
Prepare the information of the intended victims.

180
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,320
How many do you still remember?

181
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,759
I left after finishing the last few jobs.

182
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:54,320
I had no right to ask about the others.

183
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:55,639
Think again.

184
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,680
There seems to be one called

185
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,519
"Powered by Love."

186
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,840
"Powered by Love."

187
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:06,479
Yes.

188
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,720
It's disguised as a charity

189
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,680
but is actually a fake order mobile app.

190
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,040
Manman, have a seat first.

191
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
I need to take a call.

192
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,519
Okay.

193
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,879
I've been using "Powered by Love" recently.

194
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,040
It's just a charity app.

Qin Lang.

196
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,999
I have to step out for a bit.

00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,080
Ask Miaowen to join you for the questioning.

198
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,440
