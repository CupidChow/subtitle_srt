1
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,369
Like this.

2
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,570
Prepare for a frontal assault.

3
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:19,529
Team one, charge straight in from the front.

4
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,289
Team two, provide cover.

5
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,529
If it doesn't work,

6
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:23,689
we'll think of something else.

7
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:24,289
Alright.

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,289
Captain Jiang, Captain Jiang.

9
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,449
They have hostages.

10
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,250
Brother San.

11
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:39,930
What should we do?

12
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,489
There are police everywhere outside.

13
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,489
We can't get out.

14
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:49,809
The police are after Brother Tian and Sister Zhao.

15
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:52,050
What we did

16
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,690
isn't enough to get us killed.

17
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,569
You guys go and set up an ambush by the stairs.

18
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,050
I'll lure Brother Tian and Zhao Di over.

19
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,410
We'll take them down together.

20
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,650
Hand them over to the police.

21
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,770
Redeem ourselves by turning them in.

22
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:18,450
Brother Tian.

23
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:23,289
Don't be afraid.

24
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,369
With those girls as hostages,

25
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,929
the police won't dare rush in.

26
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,009
I'll find a way to get you out.

27
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,489
Brother Tian.

28
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,289
Brother Tian, Sister Zhao.

29
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:35,530
I know

30
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,410
there's a secret exit.

31
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:38,690
No police are guarding it.

32
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,009
I'll take you out through it.

33
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,089
That's great.

34
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,209
Brother Tian, Sister Zhao.

35
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,410
This way.

36
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,129
Brother Tian.

37
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:01,849
Idiot, you can't even lie properly.

38
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,610
Brother Tian

39
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:14,849
I'm sorry

40
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:18,529
It's all because of me

41
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,770
You shouldn't have come back

42
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,649
I don't want to drag you into this

43
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,450
Don't say that

44
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,730
Don't ever say things like that again

45
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,890
But now

46
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:40,890
The only thing I regret

47
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,969
is not sending you abroad first

48
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:46,089
before setting that fire

49
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,089
I've thought of a way to get out

50
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,170
I'll have that cop pretend to be me

51
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,730
and find someone else to pretend to be you

52
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,330
They'll drive out through the exit

53
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,249
to draw the police's attention

54
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:02,730
There's a car near the entrance

55
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:05,249
Brother Tian, wait for me in the car

56
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,249
As soon as they draw the police away

57
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,489
we'll leave through the entrance

58
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,290
Xiao Zhao

59
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,450
Gao Man

60
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:47,089
Chase them

61
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:06,610
Xiao Zhao

62
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,850
Brother Tian

63
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:12,249
Do you remember the first time

64
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:14,290
you taught me how to lie?

65
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,170
Back then, you said

66
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,890
if one day

67
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,290
I could fool you

68
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:23,809
then I'd have truly learned

69
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,690
They still don't know your identity very well

70
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,490
So only if I drive out myself

71
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:32,770
can I draw the police at the entrance away

72
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,490
All this time

73
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,049
I've always listened to you

74
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:37,649
But this time

75
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,770
let me

76
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,209
be reckless just this once

77
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,289
Thank you

78
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,289
Li Zhaodi

79
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,450
What are you doing?

80
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:46,690
Li Zhaodi

81
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,049
Calm down.

82
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,250
This isn't a capital offense.

83
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,089
You still have a chance.

84
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,490
Li Zhaodi

85
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,450
Li Zhaodi

86
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,130
Stop the car.

87
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:54,770
Stop the car.

88
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:55,969
Do you have a death wish?

89
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,450
Stop the car.

90
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,609
Gaoman

91
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,289
Gaoman

92
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,250
Gaoman, are you okay, Gaoman?

93
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:50,890
Gaoman, hang in there.

94
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:51,490
Gaoman

95
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,049
I'll get you out right away.

96
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:54,049
Gaoman

97
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:20,370
Gaoman

98
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,089
Hold on, Gaoman.

99
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:42,849
There's still one more inside.

100
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:44,130
Hurry, save them!

101
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,250
Hurry!

102
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,690
Handsome, want a massage?

103
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,490
Haircut.

104
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,850
Bro.

105
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,970
Let's go in and have some fun together.

106
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:45,649
Yeah.

107
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:46,250
Let's go.

108
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:46,850
Our girls here

109
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,090
are all top-notch.

110
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,730
Didn't you hear?

111
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:51,289
Haircut.

112
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,049
What's going on these days?

113
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,970
Not a single proper customer.

114
00:09:58,649 --> 00:09:59,770
Zhao, come here.

115
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,569
Why are you here?

116
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,689
I'm out of money.

117
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:13,649
Give me some.

118
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:16,529
We've already broken up.

119
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,010
And I don't have any money either.

120
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,210
When did I agree to break up?

121
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,610
When I tell you to sell, you better do it properly.

122
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,689
Stop pretending to be innocent.

123
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:31,210
Give me money.

124
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:33,250
Give me money, did you hear me?

125
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,569
I'm still giving a haircut here.

126
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:43,890
Money.

127
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,289
Give me money.

128
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:46,169
Where's the money?

129
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,730
I said I'm giving a haircut.

130
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,329
Did you hear me?

131
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:10,329
Haircut.

132
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:22,090
Thank you.
