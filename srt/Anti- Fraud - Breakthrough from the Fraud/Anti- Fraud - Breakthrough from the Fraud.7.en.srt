00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,420
The mission of our platform is

2
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,460
to ensure that good deeds are rewarded.

3
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,139
Dear, as long as you top up to help boost the store's sales,

4
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,139
you'll receive a rebate.

5
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,780
And for every transaction,

6
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,420
the merchant will donate five percent

7
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,859
to help children with serious illnesses.

8
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,220
Thank you for your kindness.

9
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:38,979
Let's place another order then.

10
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,260
Sorry, sorry.

11
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,900
Watch where you're going.

12
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,180
We have launched a promotion: top up 100,000

13
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,339
and get a 10,000 discount coupon.

14
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,059
It's only valid for today.

15
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:06,900
Anyway, you'll get it back soon.

16
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:20,700
He Xiaoxi

17
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,019
Why didn't you answer my call?

18
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,420
I was just about to call you back.

19
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,379
Did you download "Yong Ai Fa Dian"?

20
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,300
Did you top up?

21
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,179
He Xiaoxi

22
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:36,500
Haven't I taught you about order-scamming tricks?

23
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,899
If they ever ask you to top up,

24
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:39,060
do fake orders or tasks,

25
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,860
and claim the more you pay, the more you get back,

26
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,739
it's a scam.

27
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,140
It's fine.

28
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,259
I only topped up 2,500 anyway.

29
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:46,860
And it's all been returned already.

30
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:47,980
If you don't believe me, look.

31
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,060
Hurry up and uninstall the app.

32
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,060
I already did.

33
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,860
It's uninstalled.

34
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:18,380
Hello

35
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,380
Xiaoxi

36
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,459
I'm really sorry

37
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,499
About that "Powered by Love" app I sent you a few days ago

38
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,219
I just found out it's actually

39
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,339
pretending to help seriously ill children

40
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,779
but it's a scam to steal money

41
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:30,420
Really?

42
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,899
Make sure you don't put any money into it

43
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,860
Uninstall it right away

44
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,300
Honestly, you...

45
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:40,820
Alright, I know

46
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,459
I'm not stupid

47
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,219
Not stupid, huh?

48
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:44,660
Who warned you?

49
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:48,899
Something happened

50
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,339
It's about what I told you last time

51
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,739
Xiaobo

52
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:53,420
He

53
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,219
confessed his feelings to me

54
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:56,660
The one who makes money from stocks

55
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:58,019
Makes a million a year, that guy

56
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:58,660
Yeah

57
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,860
Is he reliable?

58
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,980
If he wasn't

59
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,860
I would've lost a hundred thousand by now

60
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,380
Alright, let's not talk about him

61
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:05,459
Go have a seat

62
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,459
I'll make you a cup of coffee

63
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:09,459
Coffee

64
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,420
You guys split it

65
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,179
Thanks

66
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,140
I'll have an Americano

67
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:12,459
Okay

68
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:16,980
Thank you.

69
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,459
What happened?

70
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:20,380
Nothing.

71
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,019
It's been resolved.

72
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:22,219
How are things on your end?

73
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,660
Is it enough to hand over to the prosecutor's office?

74
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,619
Definitely enough.

75
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,219
Been in this line of work for over half a year.

76
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,899
Scammed a total of thirteen people.

77
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:28,660
Evidence.

78
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,100
Stolen money.

79
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:30,619
Confession.

80
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:31,420
All complete.

81
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:34,380
I thought we caught a big shot.

82
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:35,860
Turns out it's just a pitiful person.

83
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:37,980
Looks like you want to handle a big case.

84
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:39,860
Of course I do.

85
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:40,980
But...

86
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:42,179
What's the use of just wanting it?

87
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:43,459
Hope she gets a lighter sentence.

88
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,619
Actually, according to policy,

89
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:47,380
if their family

90
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,779
can return all the stolen money,

91
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,179
they can apply for bail pending trial.

92
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:51,380
But with how clueless their family is...

93
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,660
Everyone.

94
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,019
Put aside what you're working on for now.

95
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,899
Our team has a new assignment.

96
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,820
What assignment?

97
00:04:58,219 --> 00:04:59,939
In a few days, it's Anti-Fraud Awareness Day.

98
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,980
Captain Jiang wants our whole team

99
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,339
to go into the community for anti-fraud outreach.

100
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:06,820
Everyone, get ready.

101
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,459
And make a few more copies of those materials.

102
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,380
Okay.

103
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:13,300
I don't want to go.

104
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:15,219
It's not even solving a case.

105
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,019
What does outreach have to do with me?

106
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:20,660
Sir,

107
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:21,660
please take a look.

108
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,380
This is the national anti-fraud app.

109
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,780
Let me help you download it.

110
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,579
What are you thinking about?

111
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,860
I'm thinking, if I have time for this,

112
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,100
I'd rather go catch some criminals.

113
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,699
Do something more practical.

114
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,660
You don't think raising awareness is doing something practical?

115
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:35,379
That's right.

116
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,980
I think you just want to earn merit.

117
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,139
I heard from our mentor

118
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:41,059
that you want to surpass me within a year,

119
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,460
become the top member of the team,

120
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,059
and then transfer to the narcotics unit.

121
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:46,220
What,

122
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:47,259
are you scared?

123
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:48,619
You?

124
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,860
I suggest you fix your mindset first,

125
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,619
and then your attitude.

126
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,139
You don't even know

127
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,660
what's most important in anti-fraud work,

128
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:56,179
yet you want to earn merit and transfer.

129
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:57,059
I catch criminals—

130
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:58,220
how is that not important work?

131
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,579
It is.

132
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,939
Catching criminals is important,

133
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,460
but have you ever thought about

134
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,259
by the time you catch the criminal,

135
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,900
the people's money has already been stolen,

136
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,220
transferred overseas and can't be recovered.

137
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,059
Put yourself in their shoes.

138
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:10,020
If you were the victim,

139
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,379
would you want the police to catch the criminal after you've been scammed,

140
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:14,059
or

141
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,460
help you protect your money before you're scammed?

142
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,619
Right, phone number and ID number.

143
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,059
Register with your real name.

144
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,819
Last month you said my grandson was missing.

145
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,860
But when I got home and checked,

146
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:27,860
What are you doing?

147
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,179
I just thought of a place

148
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,619
that's even better for promoting this.

149
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:31,980
Let's go.

150
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:50,660
Sorry about that.

151
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:51,860
I need to take a call.

152
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:52,300
Okay.

153
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,100
Hello?

154
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,819
Alright, alright.

155
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,900
Sorry about today.

156
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,420
I have to go, I still have something to do.

157
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,619
Wait, but you—

158
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,860
Uncle Hao.

159
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:11,259
Qin Lang.

160
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:11,860
Uncle Hao.

161
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,739
What's wrong?

162
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,100
Uh—

163
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,420
This is our new colleague, Gao Man.

164
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,619
Captain Hao.

165
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:16,980
Hello, Captain Hao.

166
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,379
Hello.

167
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:19,179
Today,

168
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:19,340
What's up?

169
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,059
We have a small favor to ask you.

170
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,540
We want these senior colleagues

171
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,460
to download

172
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:24,980
the National Anti-Fraud Center mobile app.

173
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,619
That's not my responsibility.

174
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,179
This is your job.

175
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,499
You have to handle it yourselves.

176
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,340
Besides,

177
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:33,420
this is a good opportunity

178
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,619
for you young people to learn.

179
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,460
Forget it, forget it.

180
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,499
Don't make things hard for Captain Hao.

181
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:40,020
He's not like when he first became captain.

182
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,179
His words carried more weight back then.

183
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:42,220
We'll figure it out ourselves.

184
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,460
Hey, you brat, stop right there.

185
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,860
What do you mean I’ve stepped back?

186
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,220
That I have no influence anymore?

187
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,579
Alright.

188
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,540
Today I'll show you what real influence looks like.

189
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,220
Will this work?

190
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,220
He used to be a narcotics officer.

191
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,819
Former captain of the West City Anti-Fraud Center.

192
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,059
He's a true veteran.

193
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:08,059
Old Hao,

194
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:09,420
what are you doing?

195
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:10,860
Take a break.

196
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,300
Come on.

197
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,619
Say something to everyone.

198
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,619
The current fraud situation is very serious.

199
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,739
Fraudsters are everywhere.

200
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:19,540
Those two young anti-fraud officers from the city bureau

201
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,739
are here to serve everyone.

202
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:21,780
Let's all come over.

203
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,939
Support their work.

204
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,860
Everyone, download the mobile app.

205
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,619
Come on.

206
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,699
We have a competition.

207
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,340
Let's talk after the competition, okay?

208
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,059
Look at this.

209
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,179
Can't you take a break?

210
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:30,619
Hurry up, go.

211
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,460
Captain Hao,

212
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,460
Or just forget it.

213
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:34,819
What are you thinking?

214
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:35,819
Wait a moment.

215
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:38,499
Old Liu, come here.

216
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,300
Come over here.

217
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,379
Come here, come here.

218
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,619
What are you doing?

219
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:42,340
I'm telling you,

220
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,579
stop talking nonsense.

221
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,059
This time, you get everyone to download this

222
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:46,579
mobile app.

223
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,619
For this district competition,

224
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,619
I won't compete with you for team leader.

225
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,179
How about that?

226
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,460
Old Hao,

227
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,980
Then you have to beat me first.

228
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,860
What now?

229
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:58,980
You still want to give it a try?

230
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:02,100
Okay

231
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,499
I'll do you a favor

232
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:05,540
Come on, come on

233
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:06,819
Come over here for this

234
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:07,420
It's a mobile app

235
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,420
It's a good thing

236
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,499
There's no harm in it

237
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:09,980
Alright?

238
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,059
Come on

239
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,980
Thank you, Captain Hao

240
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,059
Yes, just scan this QR code

241
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,860
Is everyone ready?

242
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:21,939
Right?

243
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:22,379
Come on

244
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:35,980
Stop
