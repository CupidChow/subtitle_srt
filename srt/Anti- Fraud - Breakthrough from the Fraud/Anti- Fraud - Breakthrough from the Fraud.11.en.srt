1
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,639
Goodbye

2
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,400
You

3
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,000
Stop

4
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:32,520
Stop

5
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,199
Xiao Jiang

6
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,359
Xiao Jiang

7
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,079
Xiao Jiang

8
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,199
Xiao Jiang

9
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:38,520
Xiao Jiang

10
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:39,399
Xiao Jiang

11
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,239
Xiao Jiang

12
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,239
Hang in there

13
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,040
Captain Hao

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,840
You're here

15
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:43,919
I'll go catch him

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,679
Be careful

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
You bastard

18
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,440
You

19
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,360
Thank you

20
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
Stop, stop hitting

21
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,119
Recently

22
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,720
Officers from our city's anti-fraud center

23
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,280
successfully busted a large fraud ring

24
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,720
arresting a total of thirty-seven suspects

25
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,720
and killing two

26
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:58,119
and rescuing twenty-one women who had been trafficked

27
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,160
The ringleader, Li Moudi

28
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,200
died in an accident while fleeing by car

29
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,440
This operation

30
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,640
effectively struck at a criminal group that had been entrenched in our city for years

31
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,200
a telecom fraud syndicate

32
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,080
achieving a significant milestone

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,679
Next, let's have Captain Jiang talk to us

34
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,879
about the specific situation at the time

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,159
Manjie, time to eat

36
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:24,480
Keep your voice down

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,239
I'll go get some more water

38
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,119
You're awake.

39
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:51,959
Are you okay?

40
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,159
How are you feeling?

41
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,040
I'm fine.

42
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,040
Don't worry.

43
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:58,640
You're okay.

44
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,279
Do you know you almost...

45
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,119
You...

46
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,880
Do you know...

47
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,080
You almost died back there.

48
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,279
Didn't I tell you not to take risks alone?

49
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,040
Wait for us to act together.

50
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,080
But you just wouldn't listen.

51
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,520
It was just a matter of seconds.

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,880
Just a few more seconds and you would have...

53
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:20,239
You just woke up, don't rush.

54
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,600
The situation was really urgent at the time.

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
I didn't expect things to turn out like this.

56
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,200
Besides, we saved all those girls.

57
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,600
See, everything went smoothly.

58
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,600
We even made a contribution.

59
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,040
Is making a contribution more important than your life?

60
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,320
Qin Lang.

61
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:40,880
Qin Lang.

62
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,239
Are you crazy?

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
He had a weapon.

64
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,439
Is catching drug dealers more important than your life?

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,239
It's none of your business.

66
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,119
Qin Lang.

67
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,200
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:04,800
Captain Jiang

69
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,880
We checked the surveillance footage.

70
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,760
We found that there was a car at the time.

71
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,239
While we were rescuing the hostages,

72
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,800
it quietly left through this underground garage entrance.

73
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,279
According to the footage,

74
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,080
it appeared

75
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,760
near the scene where Li Zhaodi died.

76
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,880
It eventually went to the dock.

77
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,200
Afterwards, he arrived at the dock.

78
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Then he disappeared again.

79
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,920
But there is a ferry at the dock.

80
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,279
In the following three hours,

81
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,200
there was only one ferry.

82
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,880
It was heading to Luodi Port in Mikede City.

83
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,240
So we infer

84
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,719
that he most likely disguised himself,

85
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,959
then assumed a new identity,

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,799
and left the country by boat.

87
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:37,799
Captain Hao

88
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,760
Look at the location of the wound.

89
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:43,039
That's right.

90
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:44,880
Back then, the shot from Zhijun

91
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:46,839
hit right at this spot.

92
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:51,039
No matter how much he tries to fix a penetrating wound like this with plastic surgery,

93
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,039
it's impossible to fully restore it to normal.

94
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,080
After all these years,

95
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,959
this Wei Qiang suddenly shows up.

96
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,959
This is a good opportunity for us.

97
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,560
We have to catch Wei Qiang

98
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,159
and find out Zhijun's whereabouts.

99
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,560
Captain Hao

100
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,959
Let's go see Director Zhao today.

101
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:13,640
Let's go.

102
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:25,359
Director Zhao,

103
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,200
This is the information Captain Hao and I have compiled.

104
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,159
We have sufficient reason to suspect

105
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,039
that the mastermind behind trafficking women abroad

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,000
is Wu Tian, the owner of Yafeng Club,

107
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,240
and that he is the same person

108
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,440
as Wei Qiang, the drug lord who caused my mentor's disappearance ten years ago.

109
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,799
They are the same person.

110
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,919
This Yafeng Club case

111
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,640
is extremely serious in nature.

112
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,359
It has caused a very negative social impact.

113
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,599
If we can't completely eliminate this criminal gang,

114
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,799
root and branch,

115
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,320
the people's property and safety

116
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,719
cannot be guaranteed.

117
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,240
I suggest

118
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,399
we set up a special task force.

119
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,159
Comrade Jiang Haofeng will serve as the team leader.

120
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,399
Mentor,

121
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,240
I'll have to trouble you a bit.

122
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,159
Please assist Captain Jiang as an advisor.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,159
Director Zhao, rest assured.

124
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,359
We guarantee to complete the mission.

125
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,039
We will handle this case

126
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,479
together with the major 7/5 case from ten years ago.

127
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,279
No matter if he's Wei Qiang

128
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,120
or Wu Tian,

129
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,640
he must be brought to justice.

130
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,599
Investigate thoroughly.

131
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,120
Yes, sir.

132
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,640
Mentor,

133
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:27,919
what do you think,

134
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,520
what personnel do you need?

135
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,680
Feel free to choose anyone from the bureau.

136
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,880
You have my full support.

137
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,039
No need.

138
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,799
Just transfer Daqian and Zhehui from the west side of the city.

139
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,279
I'm used to working with them.

140
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:38,959
That works too.

141
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:41,159
I haven't seen this junior fellow in a long time either.

142
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:46,919
Master

143
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,440
How is it going?

144
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,000
The doctor said the recovery is going well.

145
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,440
Just took the medicine and fell asleep.

146
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:55,959
By the way, Master,

147
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,560
I need to report something to you.

148
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,120
Lin Sanpeng was rescued in time and his life was saved.

149
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,839
In a few days, we can interrogate him.

150
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,120
Also,

151
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,159
Zheng Hongmei is also out of danger now.

152
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,159
I showed her a photo of Wu Tian for identification.

153
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,200
She got very emotional.

154
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,120
She said Li Zhenye was stabbed by him.

155
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,799
Even at the hospital, you’re still busy.

156
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:14,839
Master

157
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:16,760
Is there any new development in the team?

158
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,240
What's wrong, Master?

159
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,599
This time, the suspect Wu Tian

160
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,959
is very likely to be Wei Qiang.

161
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,799
Wei Qiang?

162
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,039
Wei Qiang is the one Qin Lang has been after all this time,

163
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,640
that drug lord.

164
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,560
Qin Lang's father, Qin Zhijun,

165
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,479
was also my master.

166
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,000
Back then,

167
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,320
he disappeared while trying to capture Wei Qiang.

168
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,640
He's been missing for ten years, fate unknown.

169
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,279
So about this matter,

170
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:57,599
Qin Lang can't know.

171
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,320
No wonder he's always after drug dealers.

172
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,080
But why can't he know?

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,760
The stronger the obsession,

174
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,919
the harder it is to control oneself.

175
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,039
Think about it,

176
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,240
with his personality,

177
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,399
if he found out,

178
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,959
who knows what extreme things he might do.

179
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,399
I understand.

180
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,440
Is there anything I can look into?

181
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,760
Our surveillance shows

182
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,080
that Wei Qiang disappeared after arriving at the dock.

183
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,240
He most likely hid his identity

184
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,799
and took a boat to Luodi Port.

185
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,240
What about Jiming and Miaowen?

186
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,320
They're checking the surveillance footage.

187
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,279
Go over there.

188
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,799
Make sure they check thoroughly.

189
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,039
Let go.

190
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,480
What are you trying to do?

191
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,159
Huh?

192
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,559
You clearly knew about Wei Qiang,

193
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,399
so why didn't you tell me?

194
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,120
Where I go is none of your business.

195
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:54,960
Let me go.

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,120
What right do you have to handcuff me?

197
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,399
Because I'm your captain.

198
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,039
Because you're a police officer.

199
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:00,360
You acted on your own.

200
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:01,240
And you even wanted to go abroad.

201
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,720
Did you think about the consequences?

202
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,960
Did you already know about Wei Qiang?

203
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,760
You deliberately didn't tell me.

204
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,640
Is this what a captain should do?

205
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,679
Why are you yelling at me?

206
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,640
I didn't tell you

207
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,559
because I didn't want to see you like this.

208
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,880
You're completely overwhelmed by your own emotions.

209
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,600
What's wrong with me now?

210
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,240
What's wrong with me having personal feelings?

211
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,159
That's my dad.

212
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:20,279
He's also my mentor.

213
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,319
You...

214
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,240
Stay here handcuffed.

215
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:29,079
Think about it.

216
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,439
When you've thought it through and understood,

217
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:31,760
I'll unlock the handcuffs for you.

218
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,840
Get out of my way.

219
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,600
Move.

220
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,840
I'm so angry I went the wrong way.

221
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,439
Are you hungry?

222
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,799
If you came to persuade me for him,

223
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,159
then just go back.

224
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,399
You're not a child anymore.

225
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:07,079
Can you stop being so impulsive?

226
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:13,319
Later, apologize properly to your mentor.

227
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:15,000
Mentor said

228
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,399
as long as you calm down and figure things out,

229
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,960
he'll unlock the handcuffs for you.

230
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,039
Give it to me.

231
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,039
I've figured it out.

232
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,679
I've figured it out.

233
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,799
You want to find my dad, huh?

234
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,520
To get revenge on Wei Qiang.

235
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,480
Being a police officer is the best chance.

236
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,919
But without this uniform,

237
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,439
there's no chance at all.

238
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,600
If you don't untie me, I can't eat.

239
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,319
Captain Jiang.

240
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,120
Qin Lang.

241
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,039
I've been looking for my dad for ten years.

242
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,120
I can't let this chance slip by.

243
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,439
I have to go to Mike De.

244
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,679
I'll take responsibility for whatever happens.

245
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,600
How will you take responsibility?

246
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,039
I know you're doing this for my own good.

247
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,679
But it's been so hard to get news about Wei Qiang.

248
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,600
I don't want to regret it.

249
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,960
Qin Lang.

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,039
Come back here!

251
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,760
Hey, Qin!

252
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,120
Hello, I'm going to Mike De.
