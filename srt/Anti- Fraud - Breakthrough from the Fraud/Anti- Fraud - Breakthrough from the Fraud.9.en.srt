1
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,140
Brother Tian

2
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:22,060
Thank you

3
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:26,820
for taking such a big risk to save me this time.

4
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:28,899
If it weren't for you,

5
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,379
I'd already be dead and buried.

6
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,339
Brother Tian, Sister Zhao

7
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,140
Sorry to interrupt.

8
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,219
We got word from the snakehead.

9
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,500
They said at midnight tonight,

10
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,780
the shipment will leave from the cargo terminal.

11
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,020
We've checked all the roads in the surrounding area.

12
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,780
We haven't found that black Mercedes.

13
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:49,020
The suspect is very familiar with the area.

14
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:50,179
They perfectly avoided all surveillance.

15
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,100
At the moment,

16
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,219
this lead is a dead end.

17
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,579
So next, we...

18
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,500
Do you remember the message Li Zhaodi sent?

19
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,100
"Inspect the goods at the usual place."

20
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:06,340
Here, take a look.

21
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,579
See these three girls?

22
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,219
The police station sent word

23
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,019
that these three girls

24
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:18,579
all went missing within a week.

25
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,019
Before they disappeared,

26
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,420
they all received

27
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:23,180
offers for high-paying jobs abroad.

28
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:24,140
I suspect

29
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,420
these three girls

30
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,420
were likely lured overseas by a scam.

31
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,180
They're being forced into fraud activities.

32
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,459
Fortunately, there's no record of them leaving the country yet.

33
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,099
So,

34
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,180
you two

35
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:34,180
go to the police station

36
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,500
and talk to the person who reported it.

37
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:36,620
See if there are any leads.

38
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,260
I suspect

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,379
the "goods" Li Zhaodi mentioned are the missing girls.

40
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,500
Yes.

41
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:46,219
She did mention it.

42
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:47,900
She said she was going to work abroad.

43
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,579
She said she could earn twenty or thirty thousand a month.

44
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,459
Officer,

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:52,980
can you close the case?

46
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,500
You keep calling me in for questioning every few days.

47
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:57,019
Besides, we've already broken up.

48
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:58,340
She's my ex-girlfriend.

49
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,019
Mei Mei said she was going for training.

50
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,099
Then I never heard from her again.

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,420
I don't know where she was training.

52
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:05,859
You should go investigate.

53
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,180
Are you the police or am I?

54
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,260
Alright?

55
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:11,579
My movie is about to start.

56
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:12,620
My girlfriend is still waiting for me.

57
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:13,939
I just remembered.

58
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,459
Mei Mei once sent me a photo she took secretly.

59
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,620
Mei Mei is my best friend.

60
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,819
You must find her.

61
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:26,819
Strange, it looks like she lives nearby in the photo.

62
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:29,020
But none of the buildings look like it.

63
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,020
Hello, Captain Jiang.

64
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,979
Are you two back yet?

65
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:36,659
Not yet.

66
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:38,060
We've found that Mercedes.

67
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:38,740
I'll send you the location.

68
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,460
You go over there first.

69
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:40,419
I'll be there soon.

70
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:43,860
What's wrong?

71
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,139
They told me they've found the Mercedes.

72
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:47,020
They want me to go over now.

73
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,180
But we've just arrived here.

74
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:49,219
How about this:

75
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,819
You go look for the car first.

76
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,379
I'll keep searching around here.

77
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:58,860
Let me know if you find anything.

78
00:03:59,219 --> 00:03:59,939
Don't take any risks alone.

79
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:01,860
Got it.

80
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,780
Hello, ma'am.

81
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,099
Please show your membership card.

82
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,219
I don't have a membership card.

83
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:55,500
Sorry.

84
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,939
We operate on a membership basis.

85
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:58,819
Non-members are not allowed inside.

86
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,180
Then I'll get one.

87
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:00,819
How much is it?

88
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,740
Our annual membership fee is 150,000.

89
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,340
150,000?

90
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:07,020
That's right.

91
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,259
Master.

92
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,579
I suspect the missing girl is at Yafeng Club.

93
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:26,779
I want to go in and take a look.

94
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:27,459
Okay.

95
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,220
Be careful if you go in alone.

96
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:30,620
I'll send someone over right now.

97
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,060
I'm not the cleaner you called.

98
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,779
Are you crazy?

99
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:21,660
Sorry.

100
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:22,220
Sorry.

101
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:13,139
Qin Lang has been found.

102
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,220
The missing girls are all at the Yafeng Club.

103
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,220
The person who abducted them

104
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,899
is actually Li Zhaodi.

105
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,899
There are nine people here.

106
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,220
Hurry and notify Captain Jiang.

107
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:20,139
Surround the Yafeng Club.

108
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,540
Why are you acting on your own?

109
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,540
Stop talking and hurry up.

110
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:45,220
Sister Zhao,

111
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,139
look.

112
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,019
Untie the rope on her feet.

113
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,899
Yes, yes.

114
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:11,779
Take her away.

115
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:24,100
Who are you?

116
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:24,860
What are you doing?

117
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,019
Sister Zhao...

118
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,100
Hurry, go!

119
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:36,300
Catch her!

120
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:37,019
She's a police officer!

121
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:37,579
Yes, yes.

122
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:40,220
Stop!

123
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:41,540
Stop, don't run!

124
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:41,939
Stop!

125
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:42,660
Sister Zhao!

126
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,019
Block all signals in the building.

127
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:45,540
Cut off all her contact with the outside.

128
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,819
Tell Brother Tian there are police here.

129
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:47,779
Tell him to leave quickly.

130
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:49,540
This way.

131
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:51,100
Hurry up.

132
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,100
Stop.

133
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:54,699
Go over there, quickly.

134
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,540
Don't run.

135
00:08:58,699 --> 00:08:58,939
Hurry.

136
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:03,220
Where are you going?

137
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:05,899
Sorry.

138
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,939
The number you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

139
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,259
Please try again later.

140
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:10,899
Still not connected?

141
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:14,500
No answer, still can't get through.

142
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,379
Stop.

143
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:26,779
This way.
