1
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,619
Brother Le

2
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:17,780
Did you bring the girl I told you to bring?

3
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,260
Yes, I brought her.

4
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,899
Is the girl reliable?

5
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:23,700
She is.

6
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,260
Brother Le

7
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:25,980
All the girls I handle are reliable.

8
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,419
There’s no problem.

9
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:26,939
Don’t worry.

10
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:27,700
Brother Le

11
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:30,700
Can I just wait at the place where we board the boat?

12
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:31,340
This place

13
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:32,579
is too rundown.

14
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:33,419
And it smells terrible.

15
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,899
Stop talking nonsense.

16
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:37,020
Wait where I told you to wait.

17
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,620
The smuggler will contact you when the time comes.

18
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,140
Don’t cause me any trouble.

19
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:42,859
Xiaobo

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,099
Xiaobo

21
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:50,779
Xiaobo

22
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,540
Xiaoxi

23
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,099
Why did you come wearing so little?

24
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,620
It’s windy by the sea.

25
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,260
Put your clothes on properly.

26
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:09,980
Xiaobo

27
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,260
I can’t live without you.

28
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,300
It’s all my fault.

29
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:14,019
I shouldn’t have told you I wanted to break up.

30
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,139
I was wrong.

31
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,820
We’ll never be apart again.

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,980
When the boat comes,

33
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,380
we’ll leave this place together.

34
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:20,620
Then we’ll finally be free.

35
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,620
Okay?

36
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:23,380
Okay.

37
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:28,900
Your hand—

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,299
Does it hurt?

39
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:35,540
It’s fine.

40
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:43,820
He Xiaoxi's disappearance

41
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:45,820
is very likely related to Tang Xiaobo.

42
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:47,260
Tang Xiaobo,

43
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:47,900
male,

44
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,659
twenty-seven years old.

45
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,180
His parents are dock workers.

46
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,700
He lacked proper family education.

47
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,620
He himself is not well-educated.

48
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,980
After graduating from a technical college,

49
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,380
he has been drifting in society.

50
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:58,340
He has already been in and out of prison several times.

51
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,019
Also, through Tang Xiaobo's phone,

52
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:01,260
we located a gambling den.

53
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:02,859
Through interrogation, we learned

54
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,460
that this might be a card fraud gang.

55
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:05,820
Tang Xiaobo is the ringleader.

56
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,059
He is preparing to leave the country.

57
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,419
So it's very likely that He Xiaoxi

58
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:10,939
left together with Tang Xiaobo.

59
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,499
Focus our resources.

60
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,859
Conduct a citywide search.

61
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,700
Yes.

62
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,139
I want to make one last

63
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,940
call to my mom.

64
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,139
You'd better not call.

65
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,619
The police are definitely trying everything

66
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:37,380
to find us right now.

67
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,220
Making a call is too risky.

68
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:41,339
I was thinking,

69
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:43,780
we left in a hurry,

70
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,299
and we don't have any money on us.

71
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,060
I could ask my mom for some.

72
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,380
It could be used as travel expenses.

73
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,619
Hello, Mom.

74
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,380
I'm getting ready to leave Xinhai.

75
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,419
As long as you transfer me another fifty thousand,

76
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:20,820
I'll leave.

77
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,220
You and Dad will finally have peace.

78
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:27,859
But if you don't agree,

79
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,220
I'll try to kill myself again.

80
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,459
Jump into the sea.

81
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,820
Suicide.

82
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,019
Jump into the sea.

83
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,380
This is very likely He Xiaoxi trying to tell us

84
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,260
their exact location.

85
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,380
Tang Xiaobo is probably trying to leave Xinhai.

86
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:52,739
Why did she go by herself?

87
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:54,019
Why didn't she tell us in advance?

88
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:55,940
She probably wanted to confirm where Tang Xiaobo was

89
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,500
before telling us the exact location.

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,380
Xiaoxi,

91
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,619
it's about time.

92
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:19,220
We have to go.

93
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
My mom has already agreed to transfer us the money.

94
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:24,380
Let's wait a bit longer.

95
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:27,139
Find a nearby bank

96
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,459
and withdraw the money.

97
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,860
It's safer to have cash on us.

98
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,620
We definitely can't withdraw money right now.

99
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,180
It's too easy to get exposed.

100
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,820
The police could find us very easily.

101
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:37,979
Besides, if the money stays in the card,

102
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:38,979
it will always be ours.

103
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,940
We're running out of time.

104
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,820
Let's go.

105
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:45,820
Let's wait a bit longer.

106
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,459
We can't wait any longer.

107
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:02,019
Let's go.

108
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:05,060
I said wait a little longer.

109
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:06,579
What are you trying to do?

110
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,459
Go.

111
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,700
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

112
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,740
There's no time left.

113
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,579
We have to leave now.

114
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,339
Do you understand?

115
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:15,740
Hurry up.

116
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,860
You're hurting me.

117
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,019
You are now—

118
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,260
You... you... you...

119
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,500
Don't come any closer!

120
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,459
Screw you!

121
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:43,740
Damn it!

122
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,539
Let go of me!

123
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:05,659
Damn it!

124
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,019
Damn it!

125
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:52,019
Xiaoxi

126
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:53,260
Xiaoxi

127
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,420
Xiaoxi

128
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:05,019
Hello, is this 120?

129
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,700
This is New Seaport.

130
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,940
Someone is seriously injured, please come quickly!

131
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,459
Freight terminal.

132
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,579
Tang Xiaobo is trying to stow away.

133
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:14,459
You must catch him.

134
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,979
I'll go after him.

135
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,260
Xiaoxi

136
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,659
Hang in there.

137
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,339
The ambulance will be here soon.

138
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:24,620
Hold on.

139
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:28,260
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,019
I still didn't do well enough.

141
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,979
Don't say that.

142
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,820
You really did more than enough.

143
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,260
Xiaoxi

144
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:42,820
Thank you.

145
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,620
Xiaoxi

146
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Xiaoxi

147
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:57,260
Xiaoxi

148
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,899
Xiaoxi

149
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,740
Xiaoxi

150
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:33,539
Captain Jiang

151
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,700
Tang Xiaobo is at the New Harbor

152
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,899
He just boarded a ship

153
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,940
He might be trying to stow away

154
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,140
You

155
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:09,259
Help!

156
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:09,979
What was that sound?

157
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:10,739
Go out and take a look

158
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:12,499
Help!

159
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:18,900
Xiaoxi

160
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,979
My daughter, He Xiaoxi

161
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,420
Let me in

162
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:30,739
Xiaoxi

163
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:32,859
Daddy was wrong

164
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:34,140
My daughter!

165
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,940
Here

166
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,180
There's someone in the sea

167
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,619
Gao Man

168
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,099
Tang Xiaobo has confessed everything

169
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,459
He's already been sent to the detention center

170
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,259
But there's one more thing

171
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,820
He said Qin Lang, in order to catch him

172
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,780
boarded a smuggling boat to Micde

173
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,020
What
