1
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,520
Brother Tian

2
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,239
Let me introduce someone to you.

3
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,639
Do you know him?

4
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,239
Isn't this the old man who cleans our toilets?

5
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:04,999
Kill him.

6
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:05,840
What?

7
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,400
Kill him.

8
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,479
Look at the state he's in now.

9
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,839
Could you imagine he used to be a cop?

10
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,160
Surprised, aren't you?

11
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,039
He

12
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,879
ruined everything I had back then.

13
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,000
But now he's ended up in my hands.

14
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm merciful.

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,080
I didn't kill him.

16
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,360
I just damaged his brain.

17
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,839
Cut out his tongue.

18
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,039
Kept him trapped by my side.

19
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,560
I want him to see with his own eyes

20
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,000
how I rise again, step by step.

21
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,920
It's been ten years.

22
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,720
My organization is strong enough now.

23
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,479
He's lived long enough.

24
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
You said before you'd help me kill a cop.

25
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,159
Do it.

26
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,399
He's the cop I told you about.

27
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,679
Qin Zhijun

28
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:42,880
Son

29
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,640
Why are you here?

30
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,159
Dad

31
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,439
Dad

32
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:53,640
Dad

33
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,399
Dad

34
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,039
No, what are you doing?

35
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Run!

36
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,799
Run!

37
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,039
Do it!

38
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,200
You said before,

39
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,320
we're in this for the money.

40
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,159
Better to lose your head

41
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,719
than do a losing deal.

42
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,799
Forty for killing Jiang Haofeng.

43
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Twenty for killing him.

44
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,799
I'll give you ten times that.

45
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,599
Go ahead.

46
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,520
Can't bear to part

47
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:04,799
I'll teach you

48
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,919
Officer Qin Lang

49
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,000

51
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,760
Close the net

52
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:54,640
Today, I'm going to make you watch your son die.

53
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,840
Dad.

54
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,439
Dad.

55
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,360
Dad.

56
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:22,960
Dad.

57
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:28,679
Don't move.

58
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,760
Hang in there.

59
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,760
Dad, hold on.

60
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,720
Captain Jiang will be here soon.

61
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,079
I know, Dad.

62
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,319
I know.

63
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:55,480
Dad.

64
00:10:59,559 --> 00:10:59,840
Dad.

65
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,279
Dad.

66
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:12,919
Dad.

67
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:22,559
Dad.

68
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,559
It concerns the overall stability of society.

69
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,840
It concerns economic and financial security.

70
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,880

Everyone, attention

114

Salute

115
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,039
What are your plans next?

116
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,640
Are you transferring to the anti-narcotics unit?

117
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,439
Or staying in anti-fraud?

118
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,439
The anti-fraud situation is so severe now

119
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:07,240

Let's go

128
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,199
Anti-fraud is a

129
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,279
battle that requires everyone to join

130
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,279
Only if everyone stays alert

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,760

132
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,640
can the fire of justice spread across every inch of the land
