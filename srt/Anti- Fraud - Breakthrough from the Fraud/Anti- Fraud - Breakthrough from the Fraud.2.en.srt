1
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:12,859
Wait.

2
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,419
Qian Mo.

3
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:22,699
It really is you.

4
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:24,540
No wonder you looked familiar to me just now.

5
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:30,660
Don't be nervous.

6
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,900
I've watched your livestreams.

7
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:36,939
Hello.

8
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,779
We're from the city's anti-fraud center.

9
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,740
Did you just receive a phone call?

10
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:45,699
We received an alert.

11
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,300
It was a scam call.

12
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:50,979
A scam call?

13
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,020
What did the caller say to you?

14
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,779
They said...

15
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:14,300
Mr. Qian.

16
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:20,259
Yes.

17
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:21,740
Officer, you...

18
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,539
What did you just ask?

19
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:23,499
I said,

20
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,700
on the phone,

21
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,819
what did they say to you?

22
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,140
They said they were police officers.

23
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,140
They said I was involved in some...

24
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:33,740
economic crime case.

25
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:36,740
They told me to transfer money to an account they specified.

26
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,379
Otherwise, they'd arrest me.

27
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:42,420
That's all just scammer talk.

28
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,499
They tricked you.

29
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,700
Of course, their goal is to steal your money.

30
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:46,180
Yes.

31
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:48,580
I will also stay alert.

32
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,539
I definitely won't answer their calls anymore.

33
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,900
It's not easy for you either.

34
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,259
To take care of your wife,

35
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,700
you even quit your job.

36
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,779
Live streaming and selling products is also quite tough.

37
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,059
Be sure not to fall for any scams.

38
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:00,659
How is your wife?

39
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:02,180
Officer,

40
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:04,539
you know about this illness too.

41
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,059
It's not something that can be cured quickly.

42
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:09,099
It's so late.

43
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:09,339
She

44
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
She's resting in the room.

45
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:13,659
So I won't let you go in.

46
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:14,740
Sorry about that.

47
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,539
Happy birthday to you.

48
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,580
Happy birthday to you.

49
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:44,099
Happy birthday to you.

50
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:47,059
Happy birthday to you.

51
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,499
Happy birthday, honey.

52
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,339
Honey, what's wrong?

53
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,499
I don't know either.

54
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,620
Lately, I always feel like my legs have no strength.

55
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:02,379
Mr. Qian,

56
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,740
Based on the electromyography and blood tests,

57
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,339
as well as the MRI scans of the brain and spinal cord,

58
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:08,659
your wife

59
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,420
has been diagnosed with stage two ALS.

60
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:11,020
ALS...

61
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,379
Doctor, how can this illness be cured?

62
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,700
Generally, the survival period is three to five years.

63
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,539
You need to be mentally prepared.

64
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,499
Honey,

65
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,059
I've bought the medicine.

66
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,620
Honey

67
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,860
Come, have a sip.

68
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,699
In your heart, you think I'm useless, don't you?

69
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,939
I didn't mean that.

70
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:55,620
Fine.

71
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:57,459
Then you do it yourself.

72
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:14,059
I'm just a useless person.

73
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,660
Just a useless person.

74
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,459
Honey, no one said you're useless.

75
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:21,300
How about this—

76
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,899
We

77
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,699
just need to cooperate with the treatment.

78
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,620
You'll recover soon.

79
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,139
Can I really get better?

80
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,699
There's no way you can get better.

81
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,139
Can I really recover?

82
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:37,220
You're lying to me, lying to me.

83
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:38,340
Honey, honey.

84
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,180
Liar.

85
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:39,939
Honey.

86
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:07,220
Yes.

87
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,420
I really do need to go back and take care of my wife.

88
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,379
I—I’ll be back soon.

89
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:14,740
You started livestreaming, huh?

90
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,740
Not making enough money moving goods, is that it?

91
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,340
Brother Wang

92
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,499
Do me a favor, do me a favor.

93
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,180
I—I’ll go back right away.

94
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:21,899
Hurry up.

95
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,420
Honey.

96
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:28,139
Honey.

97
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,660
What are you doing?

98
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,139
I can't even die.

99
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,540
What else can I do?

100
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:49,139
Mom.

101
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:52,100
Um...

102
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,459
Xuetong's condition...

103
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:54,139
has gotten worse again.

104
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,780
Could you talk it over with Dad?

105
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,899
Maybe sell our old family house.

106
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:00,819
Junkyard.

107
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:02,340
I can do it.

108
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,139
Auntie.

109
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:03,819
Brother.

110
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,139
Hello?

111
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:06,180
I...

112
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,379
Um...

113
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,939
Could you lend me fifty thousand more?

114
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:09,740
I'm begging you again.

115
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:11,300
Help me one last time.

116
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,540
I-I-I promise I'll pay you back.

117
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,499
Honey, I want some water.

118
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,340
Did you notice

119
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,340
that Qian Mo just now seemed a bit off?

120
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:01,740
What do you think?

121
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,259
Ever since we ran into him in the elevator,

122
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:05,740
he's been unusually nervous.

123
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,740
When we asked him questions,

124
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:08,980
he avoided eye contact,

125
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,100
and his voice got higher.

126
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,019
When he noticed we were watching him,

127
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:13,139
the expressions on both sides of his face

128
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:13,939
were clearly asymmetrical.

129
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:14,499
Also,

130
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:16,139
he kept subconsciously touching his nose.

131
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,780
These are all signs of lying.

132
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:20,740
He must be hiding something.

133
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,579
You didn't notice anything?

134
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,540
How could that be?

135
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,620
I've watched Qian Mo's livestreams.

136
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,660
He mentioned during his streams

137
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,579
that his wife is a light sleeper.

138
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:36,100
But we talked outside his door for quite a while,

139
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,899
and his wife didn't make a sound.

140
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,340
And as soon as we mentioned his wife,

141
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,139
he immediately got nervous.

142
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,700
Then he used his wife's sleep as an excuse

143
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,419
to make us leave.

144
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:46,899
Isn't that a bit strange?

145
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,580
Looks like you've improved.

146
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:15,419
Hello?

147
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,100
Is this 120?

148
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,019
My wife is suffocating at home.

149
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,460
I'm on Songchuan Road.

150
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,299
Yes.

151
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,580
Yes, number 223.

152
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,139
What exactly do you want from me?

153
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,100
Over and over again.

154
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,379
Haven't I already told you everything?

155
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,860
I shouldn't have gone out.

156
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,259
I shouldn't have left her alone at home.

157
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,620
It was my fault.

158
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:57,899
Qian Mo.

159
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
You don't need to act pitiful here.

160
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,139
Just answer what we ask you.

161
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:01,940
Be honest.

162
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,899
After the livestream that day,

163
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,220
I helped my wife go rest.

164
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,740
We passed by the barbecue stand at the entrance of the neighborhood.

165
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:11,700
I suddenly wanted to have a drink.

166
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:14,299
Qian Mo.

167
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:16,580
Do you think that because there are security cameras

168
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,499
and witnesses,

169
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,740
you have a perfect alibi?

170
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,340
What do you mean by a perfect alibi?

171
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,220
I went out to drink and eat barbecue, and people saw me.

172
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,980
Isn't that a normal thing?

173
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:28,139
Besides,

174
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:29,220
Right now, I...

175
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:30,899
My wife is dead.

176
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,379
She was my wife.

177
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,019
You can't just pin this case

178
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,340
on me.

179
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:36,019
Watch your attitude.

180
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,139
You're being unreasonable.

181
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:39,340
This...

182
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:41,980
Qian Mo, let me ask you,

183
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:43,220
while you were drinking,

184
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,139
did you ever leave the barbecue stand?

185
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,179
No.

186
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,379
No.

187
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,100
The surveillance footage shows everything clearly.

188
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,340
You went to the restroom at 9:10.

189
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,060
You didn't come back until 9:25.

190
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,899
You spent fifteen minutes in the restroom.

191
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,179
After you left the restroom,

192
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:05,899
you deliberately paused in front of the camera.

193
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:07,700
So the camera would capture your face.

194
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,460
But that's not all.

195
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,659
You even went out of your way to find someone

196
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:14,299
and bumped into them on purpose.

197
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,060
Trying to create an alibi.

198
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:17,340
Sorry,

199
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:17,940
but you didn't expect this, did you?

200
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,340
That person was me.

201
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,060
Think carefully.

202
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,700
Where did those fifteen minutes go?

203
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,379
I...

204
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,460
I drank too much.

205
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:31,740
I was throwing up in the restroom.

206
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:32,899
I was only in the restroom.

207
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:34,340
I didn't go anywhere else.

208
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:35,299
I didn't.

209
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,899
This place has a back door.

210
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,060
How long does it take to get from the back door to your house?

211
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,779
How would I know?

212
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:41,539
I don't know.

213
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:43,860
From the restaurant's back door to your house,

214
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,340
it's at most a ten-minute round trip.

215
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:47,820
That leaves you with five minutes to commit the crime.

216
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,779
Did you think there was no surveillance at the back door?

217
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,659
You thought you covered your tracks perfectly.

218
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,220
Captain Jiang

219
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:05,220
The forensic report is out.

220
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:09,779
Qian Mo

221
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,580
Everything you did was recorded.

222
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:15,019
I suggest you confess now.

223
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,899
We have all the evidence.

224
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,779
Now I'm asking you,

225
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,379
this is your chance to turn yourself in.

226
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:19,899
Speak.

227
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,779
What exactly did you do during those fifteen minutes?

228
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,499
I...

229
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:39,340
You two, come out for a moment.

230
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:47,980
The appraisal report is out.

231
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,060
Accidental death.

232
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:57,980
How is that possible?
