1
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:30,620
What do you mean?

2
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,899
Are you trying to get me killed?

3
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:40,460
Why are you stealing phones?

4
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,139
Hurry up.

5
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:45,340
Call Ma Shuai.

6
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,660
Put it on speaker.

7
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,260
Ma Shuai.

8
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,900
You still haven't told us which hospital it is.

9
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,340
We'll head over now.

10
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:14,180
What's the rush?

11
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,740
Why do you have to launder the money right now?

12
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,540
It's really urgent for us too.

13
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,939
They even said they're willing to pay extra fees.

14
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,540
Alright, alright.

15
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:32,900
Boding Hospital.

16
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,540
Contact me when you get there.

17
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,059
Okay, Ma Shuai.

18
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:37,340
I'm heading over now.

19
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,139
Qin Lang isn't in trouble, is he?

20
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,499
Why is it so urgent?

21
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,620
The problem is, we still haven't found Ma Shuai.

22
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:45,980
What should we do, Captain Jiang?

23
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,180
Besides,

24
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,460
Ma Shuai's features are so distinctive.

25
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,620
He wouldn't even look convincing in disguise.

26
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,219
And Lao Gou would see through him after just a couple of questions.

27
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:53,419
Then think of a way.

28
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:55,859
So he can't figure it out.

29
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:28,260
Brother Feng,

30
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:29,820
Brother Feng,

31
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,980
Look at the time.

32
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,940
He still hasn't come.

33
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,380
Let's wait a bit longer.

34
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,619
I'm waiting.

35
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,299
I've been waiting all along.

36
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Is he coming or not?

37
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,700
I don't have time to wait any longer, big brother.

38
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,459
I've never worked with this Brother Ma before.

39
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:45,739
Is this guy reliable or not?

40
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:46,660
You were the one who found Brother Ma.

41
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,780
And now you're doubting his reliability?

42
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,859
No, that's not it.

43
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,619
Feng Zhou,

44
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,380
He's the good guy you introduced.

45
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,899
Yeah, that's right.

46
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,339
Miss,

47
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,019
You're with Brother Ma, right?

48
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:07,820
Miss,

49
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,299
Old Feng,

50
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:10,139
What does this mean?

51
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,899
Old Feng,

52
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:11,419
Sister,

53
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,619
My brother said,

54
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:13,780
Feng Zhou is dumb.

55
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,459
He's not dumb at all.

56
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,419
Everyone knows your park has a lot of rules.

57
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,100
You don't launder your money in your own park.

58
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:20,500
Yet you want a newcomer like him

59
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,700
to introduce you to a new laundering place.

60
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,260
Do you really want to launder money,

61
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:24,980
or are you just trying to set him up?

62
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,660
No, no.

63
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,579
Miss,

64
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:28,859
Old Dog,

65
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,139
I treat you like a brother.

66
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,299
Are you trying to play me?

67
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:35,019
I never meant to scheme against you.

68
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:36,459
Even if it wasn't intentional framing,

69
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
it was still a deliberate test.

70
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,060
Either way, your intentions weren't good.

71
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:41,139
Feng Zhou.

72
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:42,579
Today, I helped you get rid of him.

73
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,859
You could say I saved your life.

74
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,380
No, no, no.

75
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,139
Old Feng, help me talk to her.

76
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,380
Can we put the gun down first?

77
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,940
You should know what I do, right?

78
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,220
Why would I seek my own death?

79
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,419
I came to you

80
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,100
truly for money laundering.

81
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
I'm in trouble.

82
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:57,820
I transferred three million into a domestic account.

83
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,179
But it didn't go to the company.

84
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,780
Someone else transferred it away.

85
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,220
I got scammed, you understand?

86
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,899
Now I want to use my own money to cover the loss.

87
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,619
But all my money is overseas.

88
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,339
I need you to launder it back into the country for me.

89
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:09,859
And I can't let Brother Tian find out.

90
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,179
If he finds out, I'm dead.

91
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:13,500
That's why I came to Old Feng and begged Old Ma.

92
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:15,019
Why would I ever harm you?

93
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,820
The domestic runner got scammed.

94
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,220
Why are you so anxious?

95
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,060
How can I not be anxious?

96
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,739
The head runner is my mom.

97
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:24,740
I understand now.

98
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,620
The money you made from running errands was scammed.

99
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,380
You're afraid Brother Tian will misunderstand you.

100
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,260
Spending money secretly.

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,139
I almost feel sorry for you, Lao Gou.

102
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:31,659
Brother.

103
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,339
You understand everything I said, right?

104
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,579
Be my guarantor.

105
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:36,860
If I say a single lie, you can check.

106
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,740
You can deal with me then if you want.

107
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,539
Is that okay?

108
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,740
Girl,

109
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,820
Everything I said is true.

110
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:53,620
Ma Xiaoning.

111
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,740
Ma Shuai's younger sister.

112
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,060
My brother has always been cautious.

113
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,740
I just offended you.

114
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,459
Ma Mei,

115
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:06,099
Ma Mei.

116
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,420
It's not really offending.

117
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,659
This is the right thing to do.

118
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:09,979
You have to be careful.

119
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:10,979
You have to be careful.

120
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,979
Bro, it's been checked.

121
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,740
It's safe.

122
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,899
Where's Feng Zhou?

123
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,779
Brother Ma.

124
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,060
Use your head next time.

125
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,339
Don't be so reckless.

126
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:27,740
Brother Ma.

127
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,979
Old Dog.

128
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,459
We've met before.

129
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:31,620
Just once.

130
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,019
At the banquet hall of the Harry Hotel.

131
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,019
I even greeted you back then.

132
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,099
Do you remember?

133
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,099
Stop wasting time.

134
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,539
Speak.

135
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:40,940
How much is being transferred this time?

136
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,940
Clean money.

137
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:43,219
Three million.

138
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:44,219
How long will it take?

139
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,420
By tomorrow morning.

140
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,459
I want seventy percent.

141
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,539
Big brother.

142
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:49,779
You want seventy percent?

143
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,579
Seventy percent means I have to give you ten million.

144
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,979
I don't have that much money.

145
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:54,940
Can you lower it a bit?

146
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,659
Time is tight.

147
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:57,779
The risk is high.

148
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:58,940
Can't lower it.

149
00:06:59,019 --> 00:06:59,779
Brother Ma.

150
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,339
We're all people of the underworld.

151
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,779
You can't set me up, right?

152
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,099
Brother Ma, listen to me.

153
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,099
Brother Ma, Brother Ma.

154
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,940
Go find someone else.

155
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,659
No, wait—

156
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:07,260
Sister Ma, Sister Ma.

157
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,579
I said something I shouldn't have.

158
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,139
I'll take responsibility for seventy percent, I'll admit to all of it.

159
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:15,500
Can you transfer the money right now?

160
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,339
Tell your brother I admit it.

161
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,260
Get the card.

162
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,779
Ten million.

163
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:23,380
Transfer it here.

164
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,060
Okay.

165
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,420
Brother Le,

166
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,940
I saw a nurse go into the ward.

167
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,339
She hasn't come out for a long time.

168
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:42,700
I suspect something.

169
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:44,139
I think Lao Gou is up to something.

170
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:49,380
Look.

171
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:50,380
It's all been transferred.

172
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,459
Deal.

173
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:54,740
Wait.

174
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:58,940
Have your brother

175
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,979
transfer three million

176
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
to this account.

177
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,260
My brother got the money.

178
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:11,620
Go back and tell your brother

179
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:13,260
thank you.

180
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,820
No rush.

181
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:16,380
I'll help you contact someone else.

182
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,019
No rush, no rush.

183
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,740
Mom

184
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:28,219
Son

185
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,500
Mom, are you okay?

186
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,019
Mom

187
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,659
Son

188
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,700
What's going on?

189
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,260
The police asked me to cooperate.

190
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:40,139
Old Dog

191
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:40,820
Don't move

192
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,300
Move again and I'll kill her, believe it or not

193
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,899
Let my mom go right now

194
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,860
Or I'll kill her

195
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,459
Son

196
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,740
Don't do anything stupid

197
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,579
Dog, calm down too

198
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:50,899
Let the hostage go first

199
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,180
Even if I let your mom go

200
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,219
You still can't go back now

201
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:54,979
Mom, don't worry

202
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,219
Are you messing with me?

203
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,019
Even if I let you go back now

204
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,539
There's still a Menglu in the park

205
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,820
She set a three million trap

206
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,940
Just waiting for you to fall in

207
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:04,019
If we don't help you

208
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:05,459
Going back means certain death for you

209
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:06,500
Fine

210
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,099
Come on, let's die together

211
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,019
Gou Fugui

212
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,180
Jiang Haofeng

213
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
So you two are in this together?

214
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:25,940
Don't move

215
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,940
Move again and I'll kill her, believe it or not

216
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,620
One

217
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,740
Two

218
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:39,339
Three

219
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,900
Good thing you didn't shoot.

220
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:49,379
If you had fired,

221
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:50,940
there would be no turning back.

222
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:54,859
It's a fake gun.

223
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:57,780
I...

224
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,259
Tell me, what exactly do you want?

225
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:03,739
Come on, come on.

226
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:04,739
Don't be so angry.

227
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:06,180
Sit down, let me talk to you. Come on.

228
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,900
Sit down.

229
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:20,259
Where are you looking?

230
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,499
I'm asking you a question.

231
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:23,700
I'm asking you.

232
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:24,739
Do you still know Kunka?

233
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:27,180
What Kunka?

234
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,979
What does he do?

235
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:32,780
Don't pretend with me here.

236
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,060
What's his relationship with Brother Tian?

237
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,379
We've already investigated everything.

238
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,379
Let me put it this way.

239
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,420
This time,

240
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,060
not only are we going to arrest Wei Qiang,

241
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,820
but we also want to root out Kunka,

242
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:41,979
completely and thoroughly.

243
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,379
Now I'm giving you a chance.

244
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,940
If you choose to cooperate with us,

245
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,339
and make a contribution,

246
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,700
both you and your mother can be treated leniently.

247
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:53,940
But if you don't cooperate with us,

248
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:56,420
Kunka already knows that someone in the park

249
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:58,780
has been secretly contacting Ma Shuai.

250
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,780
Trying to launder money.

251
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,300
What do you mean?

252
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,300
Are you trying to trick me again?

253
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,259
What I mean is,

254
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,780
the Ma Shuai who just video called you,

255
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:12,259
was actually me pretending.

256
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:13,780
I recorded the video.

257
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,459
I also have the transfer records.

258
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:17,259
Think about it—if you go back,

259
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:18,780
isn't it a dead end for you?

260
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,420
You set me up, didn't you?

261
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,339
Yeah, I set you up. So what?

262
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,700
Are you going to cooperate or not?

263
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,900
Think it over carefully.

264
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:35,020
Tell me first.

265
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:36,619
Where is the location of the facility?

266
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:38,459
It's right under the police station.

267
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,859
There's a hidden entrance.

268
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,940
Have your car follow me.

269
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:41,979
Then you'll know.

270
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,180
Brother,

271
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,379
I've already agreed to work with you.

272
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,660
We can't go back now.

273
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,940
It's too dangerous to go back.

274
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:18,900
The police need time to organize a raid.

275
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,979
We still need to coordinate with the police from inside and out.

276
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,060
But don't worry.

277
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:24,060
As long as we don't alert them,

278
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:25,339
there won't be any danger.
