1
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,540
Honey

2
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,460
You

3
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,860
You, are you okay?

4
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:26,819
I'm fine.

5
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:30,979
What's wrong?

6
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,020
Honey

7
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,259
I can't just leave like this.

8
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:49,900
I definitely can't leave Xuetong to face all this alone.

9
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,100
What should I do?

10
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:54,619
What am I supposed to do?

11
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,619
Honey,

12
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,500
are we still streaming today?

13
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:07,820
Everyone,

14
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,900
these oranges from our family,

15
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,979
are so sweet and juicy.

16
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,220
I hope you all support us.

17
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,500
Support the two of us.

18
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,580
And place lots of orders.

19
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,819
Right now,

20
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,379
everyone, please like manually.

21
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,260
Tap this little heart.

22
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,780
As long as we reach twenty thousand likes,

23
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:22,700
I'll agree to one request from everyone.

24
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:23,220
Alright.

25
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:25,019
Yes.

26
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:26,019
Keep tapping, keep tapping, keep tapping!

27
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,060
Honey,

28
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,620
the comments say

29
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:35,860
they want you to hold up an orange.

30
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,379
Come on.

31
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,459
You can do it!

32
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,659
Go for it!

33
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,899
Keep it up!

34
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,980
Honey,

35
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,099
You can do it!

36
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:45,780
Go for it!

37
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:46,819
Keep it up!

38
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,659
Honey,

39
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,659
you're amazing.

40
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:51,939
In just these few minutes,

41
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,099
you sold fifty-nine orders.

42
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,459
Turns out you're the real top salesperson.

43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,299
Honey,

44
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,220
don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

45
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:02,860
It's just thunder.

46
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:09,420
He still wants to make money through livestreaming.

47
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:10,539
He doesn't want to hurt his wife.

48
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,220
Okay.

49
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,420
Attack them.

50
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,299
Force him to end the stream.

51
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:16,459
Cut off his source of income.

52
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,059
Brothers and sisters,

53
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
start sending comments.

54
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:24,860
Get the hype going for me.

55
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,580
Alright, okay.

56
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:32,059
She's still streaming even in this state.

57
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,619
Isn't this just profiting off others' misfortune?

58
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:34,420
This woman too,

59
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,299
just knows how to play the victim.

60
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,179
Hurry up and end the stream.

61
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:36,660
Stop embarrassing yourself.

62
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,580
It's obvious she's faking it.

63
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,860
Are all of you who ordered oranges idiots?

64
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,260
I should learn from you and make money by seeking sympathy too.

65
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:41,499
What a disgrace.

66
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:42,260
Seeing you makes me want to vomit.

67
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:42,700
Go die, all of you.

68
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,499
Excuse me, about this illness...

69
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:45,339
I hope ALS defeats you.

70
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:47,420
Are those who ordered oranges all idiots?

71
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,260
Seeing you makes me want to vomit.

72
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,019
I hope ALS defeats you.

73
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,980
Everyone, that's it for today's stream.

74
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:00,380
Honey,

75
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,899
I'm going out to take out the trash.

76
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:03,899
Honey,

77
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,499
Tell me, what's the right way to live this life?

78
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,179
Honey,

79
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,140
Stop overthinking.

80
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,540
Get some rest early.

81
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:26,260
Honey,

82
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:34,459
You

83
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,059
Take care

84
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,499
Honey

85
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,660
I'm just going out to take out the trash

86
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,499
Go to bed early

87
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,619
Have you thought about the three million?

88
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,700
I can't go through with it

89
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:06,380
Do you need my help?

90
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,179
She won't survive anyway

91
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:18,420
I really can't hold on anymore

92
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:20,779
I'm sorry

93
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:22,420
Honey

94
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,979
Honey

95
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,740
I'm sorry

96
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,180
When you see this video

97
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:07,700
I have already

98
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:09,779
passed away

99
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,019
Don't cry

100
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:21,899
Actually

101
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,459
my biggest regret in this life

102
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,899
is not being able to stay with you until the end

103
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,219
I often think

104
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,500
if you didn't love me so much

105
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:47,700
or maybe gave up on me earlier

106
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,300
things might have turned out differently

107
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,339
As long as you were by my side

108
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:01,979
I felt that life was wonderful

109
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,260
Even though you never mentioned

110
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,300
how tired or how hard it was for you

111
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,380
but I know

112
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:17,140
you've long been overwhelmed

113
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:18,859
Honey

114
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,019
Remember

115
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:25,820
after I'm gone

116
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,979
quickly go and get the insurance payout

117
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,300
and pay off the gambling debts as soon as possible

118
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:38,339
If this can help you

119
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:41,700
I can rest in peace

120
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,740
Ever since the last incident,

121
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,380
Qian Mo's livestream account

122
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,300
has been completely silent.

123
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,099
There was no announcement about Zhou Xuetong's death either.

124
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:37,180
You know what,

125
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,539
Qian Mo's wife's insurance payout just came through these past couple of days.

126
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:41,700
He was in such a hurry to get the money.

127
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,820
This is a classic case of killing his wife for insurance money.

128
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:45,779
No, that's not right.

129
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:47,339
No, that's not it.

130
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,820
Why not?

131
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:51,219
When Qian Mo learned the cause of Zhou Xuetong's death,

132
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,099
he looked completely drained.

133
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:53,940
I think

134
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,300
he doesn't seem like

135
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,019
the type of person who could kill his wife for insurance money.

136
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:59,300
There are still some doubts about this case.

137
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,779
Back then,

138
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,459
when we checked his bank records,

139
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:04,099
there really was a large sum of money.

140
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,060
But it was money he won from online gambling.

141
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,339
And there was another sum,

142
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,300
which was from selling his house.

143
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,099
It was all transferred out quickly.

144
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,979
Sold the house?

145
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:13,140
Transferred out?

146
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,219
Why didn't you say this earlier?

147
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,539
The case is already closed.

148
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,500
And he's already been released.

149
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,659
Do you think he might have really been scammed?

150
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:24,260
Come with me.

151
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:27,940
Mr. Qian,

152
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,339
your wife's insurance payout has come through, right?

153
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:32,300
Yes, the payout has already come through.

154
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,180
As for me,

155
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
I'm done pretending with you.

156
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
You won't get a single cent of this money.

157
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,300
And also,

158
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:42,700
thank you for the reminder.

159
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,979
What about those insurance premiums?

160
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,459
I already returned them to the relatives.

161
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,499
You bastard, how dare you—

162
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,219
As for Qian Mo's case,

163
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,739
it's very regrettable.

164
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,979
When Gao Man and Qin Lang arrived at their home,

165
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,780
he had already jumped to his death.

166
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:44,420
However, he left a suicide note.

167
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,300
The note detailed

168
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:47,780
how he was tricked into gambling

169
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,339
and the incident of killing the debt collector.

170
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:51,180
The murder part

171
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,580
has already been handed over to the criminal investigation team.

172
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,339
All the evidence indicates

173
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:56,099
that Qian Mo is the murderer.

174
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:57,580
However,

175
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,139
in this case,

176
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,139
there are still many issues related to telecom fraud

177
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,300
that remain unresolved.

178
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,820
We must get to the bottom of them.

179
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,660
Gao Man,

180
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:08,060
please brief everyone.

181
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:16,139
Based on Qian Mo's suicide note, our analysis is

182
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:18,820
that the reason the scammers targeted the couple

183
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:20,020
was because

184
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:25,020
Zhou Xuetong's insurance payout

185
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,660
The scammer first lured Qian Mo into online gambling

186
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:29,060
and made him sell off his assets

187
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:30,660
then he ended up in huge debt

188
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:31,780
In the end, to pay off the debt

189
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:32,940
he killed his wife for the insurance money

190
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,339
After Zhou Xuetong died

191
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:35,859
the scammer called Qian Mo again

192
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,979
using an AI face-swapping call

193
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,820
probably to obtain evidence of him killing his wife

194
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,180
and threatened him to hand over the insurance payout

195
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,300
To get this three million, they took out a second insurance policy

196
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,060
What are you doing?

197
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,060
Why are you slamming the table?

198
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:49,099
We're in a meeting

199
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:49,660
I...

200
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,700
I just think those scammers are despicable

201
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,020
Can you act normal?

202
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:56,979
I asked you to check the "Ningjing de Xiatian" account

203
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:57,940
How did it go?

204
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,619
I pretended to be Qian Mo to get information from them

205
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
but the other side was very cautious

206
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,099
and immediately deleted the account

207
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,900
Does anyone else have any leads?

208
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:08,619
Captain Jiang, I checked

209
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,099
the phone number used for the AI face-swapping

210
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,099
it's a virtual account

211
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,580
with multiple layers of encryption

212
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,619
Their IP address

213
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,099
keeps changing

214
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,139
We can't locate them

215
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,339
So this lead doesn't work for now

216
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:19,139
Both leads have gone cold

217
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,820
This shows how alert these scammers are

218
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:22,859
extremely alert

219
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:24,099
Everyone, think about it

220
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,259
and see if there are any other leads we can follow

221
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:30,300
Let me give a hint.

222
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:32,020
Loan shark.

223
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,300
Debt collector.

224
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,820
Qian Mo's loan shark debt.

225
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,499
It was borrowed directly from a gambling website.

226
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,859
So behind the loan sharking

227
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:42,099
is a fraud gang.

228
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:43,660
They come to collect debts violently.

229
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,099
It must be connected to the scammers.

230
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:46,660
Makes sense.

231
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:47,739
But why do I feel

232
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:48,900
like you're showing off to me here?

233
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,619
Can you act normal in meetings from now on?

234
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,259
I see.

235
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,020
Let me go over the next work assignments.

236
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,940
Xiao Yu,

237
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,020
let Miao Wen know

238
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:02,420
to check the surveillance footage from the day of the incident.

239
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:03,339
Gao Man,

240
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,180
visit Qian Mo's neighborhood.

241
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,259
Ji Ming, investigate the suspect's social connections.

242
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,379
Qin Lang,

243
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,099
do a field investigation to track the suspect's exact movements.
