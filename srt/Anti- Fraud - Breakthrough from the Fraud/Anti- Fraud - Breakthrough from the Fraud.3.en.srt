1
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,480
Meng

2
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,120
Qian Mo finally took the bait.

3
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,879
Zhou Xuetong's medical expenses have been increasing lately.

4
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,160
The two of them are doing livestream sales.

5
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,239
Business hasn't been good recently.

6
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,000
It's exactly when they need money.

7
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:59,360
Give him a little benefit first.

8
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,879
Let him get completely drawn in.

9
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,360
Alright.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,360
Honey.

11
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,440
Honey.

12
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:11,239
Are you feeling better today?

13
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:13,840
Look.

14
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:14,879
What's this?

15
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,000
A magnetic therapy device.

16
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,679
And also,

17
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,560
I have some good news for you.

18
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,679
I've also made an appointment with the hospital.

19
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,360
Tomorrow,

20
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,560
we'll go get the nusinersen injection.

21
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,160
It's thirty thousand yuan per shot.

22
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:33,640
You...

23
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,200
Where did you get the money?

24
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,560
Didn't I tell you before?

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,720
As long as you cooperate with the treatment,

26
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,280
money

27
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,560
will never be a problem.

28
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,440
Meng

29
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,479
You called me?

30
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,759
How much has Qian Mo paid so far?

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,360
It's already over a hundred thousand.

32
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,200
Starting today,

33
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,239
we'll bleed him slowly.

34
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,079
Sister Meng

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,039
Qian Mo has already sold his house.

36
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,680
The previous six hundred thousand

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
has all been paid back.

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,039
The remaining five hundred thousand

39
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,479
he also lost to us.

40
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,280
And

41
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,840
he keeps losing.

42
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,759
Continue.

43
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:26,440
Raise his credit limit.

44
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,280
But Sister Meng,

45
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,840
look at how broke Qian Mo is.

46
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,639
How could he have any money left?

47
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,599
What do you know?

48
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,759
Qian Mo may not have money,

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,319
but he has a good wife.

50
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,039
Zhou Xuetong's accident insurance is three million.

51
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,079
Qian Mo is listed as the beneficiary.

52
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,079
That's a big payout.

53
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:47,079
By the way,

54
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,039
send the loan sharks to Qian Mo's house.

55
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
It's time to put some pressure on him.

56
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:56,560
Who is it?

57
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:58,960
Who is it?

58
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,840
What are you doing?

59
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:08,680
What do you want?

60
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,240
We're here to collect money from you.

61
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,240
Smash it for me.

62
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,079
Big brother.

63
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:19,039
Boss

64
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:19,639
Boss

65
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,960
You owe our boss three million.

66
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,879
When are you going to pay it back?

67
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,239
Boss

68
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,599
Two days.

69
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,720
Can I definitely pay you back within two days?

70
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,679
Two days.

71
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:29,999
Qiangzi

72
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:32,119
What does that chick look like?

73
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,119
Take off the mask.

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,999
Let’s see her face.

75
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,799
Pretty good-looking.

76
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,200
Bro.

77
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,280
I'm in love.

78
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,080
Let her go.

79
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:48,679
Let her go.

80
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,599
It's just a shame she's in a wheelchair.

81
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:55,160
Let go.

82
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,479
Is this going to get violent?

83
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,640
Come on, hurry up and continue.

84
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,840
Didn't get a drag.

85
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:02,999
You animal.

86
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,840
I'll kill you!

87
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,039
Let go.

88
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:08,039
Let go.

89
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:10,119
Let go.

90
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,119
Go.

91
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,599
If you want to beg, beg over there.

92
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:16,119
Show some sincerity.

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,640
I suspect you're faking your paralysis.

94
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:19,599
Come on, get up.

95
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,559
Then we'll let that guy go.

96
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:22,840
Come on.

97
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,720
Come on, come on.

98
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:25,840
Come on, get up.

99
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,799
Come, follow me, come on.

100
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,999
Come on, get up.

101
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,439
Come on, stand up, come on.

102
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,280
Follow me, come on.

103
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:35,559
Come on, come on.

104
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,359
Honey.

105
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,200
A m-miracle, did you see that?

106
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,720
Don't move, don't come over here!

107
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:45,919
She peed.

108
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,119
She peed, she peed.

109
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
She peed.

110
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,559
Come here.

111
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,400
Give a close-up.

112
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,280
Look at that little face, even I feel sorry for you.

113
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:09,880
Let go.

114
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,799
It reeks of urine.

115
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,720
Honey.

116
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:16,840
Come here.

117
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,799
I'll give you two three days.

118
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:20,919
If you still can't pay back the money,

119
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,599
I'll make sure you two can't survive in Xinhai.

120
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,439
Let's go.

121
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,039
Goodbye.

122
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,999
Honey, I'm sorry.

123
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,880
Honey.

124
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,919
Don't be mad.

125
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,999
I swear.

126
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,439
I'll never touch this stuff again.

127
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:58,760
I won't gamble anymore either.

128
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,239
Can you forgive me this once?

129
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,200
Money.

130
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:05,039
Money.

131
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,280
Honey

132
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:13,479
Honey

133
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:14,039
Honey

134
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:14,679
Honey, it's okay.

135
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,160
Honey, I was wrong.

136
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,160
You lied to me.

137
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,400
Honey, I was wrong.

138
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,039
Meng

139
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:26,720
This Zhou Xuetong

140
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,280
She won't die anytime soon.

141
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,119
Our three million

142
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,679
When can we actually get it?

143
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,239
Do you think

144
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,280
I'm waiting for her to die naturally?

145
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:38,160
Are you saying

146
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,359
Qian Mo should kill his wife

147
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,880
and then claim the insurance money?

148
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,679
Sis

149
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,960
That's a big move.

150
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,720
If we pull this off

151
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,039
Tian can see for himself

152
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,679
the true strength of our team.

153
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,599
Get the face-swapping software ready.

154
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,559
Once Zhou Xuetong dies

155
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,679
we'll fake evidence of him killing his wife

156
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,840
and force him to transfer the insurance money.

157
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,080
Okay.

158
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,359
Honey

159
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,720
I bought your favorite noodles.

160
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Don't worry anymore.

161
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,999
I'll figure something out.

162
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,880
Isn't this our big internet celebrity?

163
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,760
Just one more day until you pay back the money.

164
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:25,080
What,

165
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,280
you still have the nerve to eat without paying back?

166
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:29,320
Sorry.

167
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,640
Um...

168
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,840
I'll pay you back in the next couple of days.

169
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,919
Actually,

170
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
you don't have to rush to pay back the money.

171
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,199
But next time we come to your house,

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,880
it won't just be smashing things.

173
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,120
Your wife will have to let the guys have some fun.

174
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,439
Even though your wife smells like urine,

175
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,839
and can't move,

176
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,439
it's fine.

177
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,039
The guys like to help others.

178
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,600
We can move for her.

179
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,240
To be honest,

180
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,039
your wife actually looks pretty good.

181
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,039
After a wash, you can still use her.

182
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,079
If you don't pay back for a day,

183
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,000
the guys will go "help" for a day.

184
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,719
Until the day you pay back.

185
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:57,199
You still dare to call me?

186
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,319
Three million.

187
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,319
How am I supposed to pay that back?

188
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,600
Mr. Qian,

189
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,600
why are you so impatient?

190
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,760
A temporary win or loss means nothing.

191
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,760
As long as you still trust me,

192
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,439
I’ll definitely help you turn things around.

193
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,799
One hundred percent.

194
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,360
Nonsense!

195
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,719
You’re still lying to me even now.

196
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,000
I’m lying to you?

197
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,679
You’re the one lying to yourself.

198
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,679
You know full well that your wife’s illness

199
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,679
can’t be cured at all.

200
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,640
Yet you keep pouring money into it.

201
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,520
Is that my fault too?

202
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,719
All of this

203
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,880
should come to an end.

204
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,439
But I...

205
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,679
I have nothing left now.

206
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:34,839
Doesn’t your wife still have a large insurance policy?
