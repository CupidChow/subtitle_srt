1
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,701
What?

2
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,101
You sold your house for him?

3
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,020
Xiaoxi.

4
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,981
Isn't this obvious enough?

5
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,541
He's manipulating you.

6
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,541
He's scamming you out of your money.

7
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,180
He's even threatening you with nude photos.

8
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:26,860
Xiaoxi.

9
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,180
You're the kindest person I've ever met,

10
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,700
and the most compassionate.

11
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,981
But if you trust people too easily,

12
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:37,821
you'll end up getting hurt when you shouldn't.

13
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:38,380
Do you understand?

14
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:44,100
Alright.

15
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:45,541
Don't be afraid.

16
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,661
I'm here for you.

17
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,861
For now,

18
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:49,301
just stay at my place.

19
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,740
Don't go to the shop.

20
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:52,340
I'll keep you company and help you relax.

21
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:53,581
This will all pass.

22
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:05,861
Hello, Jiming.

23
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,780
Hello, Gaoman.

24
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,820
While I was investigating Lin Sanpeng's money laundering operation,

25
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,060
I found someone else involved in the laundering.

26
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:12,501
Who?

27
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,221
He Xiaoxi.

28
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:25,740
Are you sure?

29
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:26,661
I'm sure.

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,341
We're about to summon her.

31
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,980
She's with me right now.

32
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,260
We'll come over right now.

33
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:38,180
Alright.

34
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:39,620
I'll send you the address.

35
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:54,020
Xiaoxi.

36
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:57,460
Did you

37
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,701
take part in money laundering?

38
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:00,820
Money laundering?

39
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,180
I didn't.

40
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:14,861
Hello

41
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:15,941
Xiaoxi

42
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:18,260
The cash I left with you

43
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,061
help me transfer it out

44
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,661
I'll send you the account number in a bit

45
00:03:21,021 --> 00:03:21,420
Okay

46
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,941
I'll transfer it to you right away

47
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,461
Xiaoxi

48
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,420
Help me transfer another sum

49
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,380
Okay, I got it

50
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,061
Xiaoxi

51
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,781
Help me transfer some more money

52
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,061
Help me transfer money

53
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,140
Help me transfer money

54
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:46,860
How about this

55
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,181
In a bit

56
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,380
Come back to the station with me first

57
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:50,980
No matter what happens

58
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:52,501
Let's explain everything clearly

59
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,540
What do you think

60
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,061
Okay

61
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,781
Before I go

62
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,980
Can I use the restroom

63
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,781
Freshen up a bit

64
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:05,980
Go ahead

65
00:04:17,061 --> 00:04:17,580
Eight Dots

66
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:19,181
I'm going to give you all a big one this round.

67
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:19,540
Watch closely.

68
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,540
Come on, come on.

69
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:22,221
See that? Ten Thousand.

70
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:23,980
What do you mean, Ten Thousand?

71
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:24,781
What is that?

72
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,540
All honor tiles.

73
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,420
Useless.

74
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:34,901
Sorry.

75
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,860
The number you dialed is currently

76
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,661
Hung up, hung up.

77
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,820
Brother Bo

78
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:43,580
Brother Le's call.

79
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:48,341
Six Dots

80
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:51,140
Wait, wait.

81
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,461
Okay.

82
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:52,260
You play, you play.

83
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,621
Why are you answering the phone now?

84
00:04:59,341 --> 00:04:59,941
Brother Le

85
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:00,781
Xiaobo

86
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:02,341
What are you doing?

87
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:04,380
We're playing cards.

88
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:05,181
Alright.

89
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,061
The 300,000 has already been received.

90
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,181
I knew those nude photos of his daughter

91
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,540
were the old man's weak spot.

92
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,901
Now I regret that we didn't ask for more back then.

93
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:15,501
You did well this time.

94
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,221
Thank you, Brother Le.

95
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:18,181
Get rid of her quickly.

96
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:18,820
Yes.

97
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,461
That girl is completely ruined now.

98
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:20,901
She's useless.

99
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:21,901
I'll get rid of her right away.

100
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:23,781
Brother Le

101
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,540
I actually have something I want to ask your help with.

102
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:27,701
Say it quickly.

103
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,381
It's just that...

104
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:34,100
I've done this so many times recently.

105
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:36,060
I'm afraid the police are watching me.

106
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:38,141
Can I go abroad and lay low at your place for a while?

107
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,901
Just for a while.

108
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,740
I'll see what I can do.

109
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,860
Alright, Brother Le.

110
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:43,781
Alright, alright, alright.

111
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,221
I'll wait for your message then.

112
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,540
I'm ready anytime.

113
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:47,381
I'm prepared.

114
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,141
That's enough.

115
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,500
Okay, thank you, Brother Le.

116
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,180
Did you contact Gao Man again?

117
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,420
What did she say to you?

118
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:11,661
Tell me.

119
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:14,060
Did you really launder money?

120
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,781
That's right.

121
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:18,940
I laundered money.

122
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:21,060
But I did this

123
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,781
all for you.

124
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:24,261
For me?

125
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,141
Who else would I do it for?

126
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,300
For myself?

127
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
You know me.

128
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,821
I'm not afraid of hardship or exhaustion.

129
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,980
I'm not afraid of living a hard life.

130
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,381
But I don't want you to live like that.

131
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,860
I want to buy you a house and a car.

132
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,100
I want to give you a better life.

133
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:42,980
All of that needs money.

134
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,180
I did it for you.

135
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,500
For our future.

136
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,901
That's why I did this.

137
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:50,821
But I committed a crime.

138
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:52,940
What am I supposed to do now?

139
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,221
What about me?

140
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,261
Didn't I commit a crime too?

141
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:58,060
All this time,

142
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,701
I've done so many things.

143
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:01,100
My crime is even worse than yours.

144
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,901
Do you understand?

145
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,980
Do you know why

146
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,540
I don't answer your calls?

147
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,060
I know.

148
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,540
Whenever you call, it's always about this.

149
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,620
We've been talking for so long,

150
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,701
have you ever said

151
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,540
even one word of concern for me?

152
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,180
That's not what I meant.

153
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,221
Enough.

154
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,620
You're always so pitiful.

155
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:21,740
You make me feel

156
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:25,581
It's been such a long time.

157
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:27,781
Ask yourself.

158
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,781
Have you ever truly trusted me?

159
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,980
I'm human too.

160
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,940
I have feelings too.

161
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,500
I've had enough.

162
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,901
Let's break up.

163
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,221
Don't call me anymore.

164
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,100
Xiaoxi.

165
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,261
Xiaoxi.

166
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:25,500
Xiaoxi.

167
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:27,940
He Xiaoxi.

168
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:34,381
Xiaoxi.

169
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,661
Xiaoxi.

170
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:45,901
Please make way.

171
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,420
Xiaoxi, hang in there a little longer.

172
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:53,261
Family members, please wait outside.

173
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:56,141
Gaoman.

174
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,261
She'll be okay.

175
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:00,381
Manman.

176
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,740
Manman.

177
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,701
Teacher He, Mrs. He.

178
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:07,461
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,341
Manman, what happened to Xiaoxi?

180
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,540
Uncle, Auntie, please calm down.

181
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:12,740
The doctors are trying to save her right now.

182
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,540
She'll definitely be fine.

183
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:15,180
How could she be fine?

184
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,141
Didn't I ask you to talk to her?

185
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,341
Why did she cut her wrists?

186
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,141
This isn't Manman's fault.

187
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,381
It's all because Xiaoxi is too immature.

188
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:26,940
Sorry for causing you trouble.

189
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:28,540
Uncle, please don't say that.

190
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:30,300
Xiaoxi might have just been

191
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:31,821
emotionally manipulated by bad people.

192
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:33,100
When she wakes up,

193
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:34,781
you'll still need to talk to her and help her think things through.

194
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,221
What emotional manipulation?

195
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,221
It's because we didn't discipline her enough.

196
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,021
That's why she acted out like this.

197
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:42,261
Xiaoxi isn't just acting out.

198
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:45,861
Teacher He.

199
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,621
Maybe if you see this,

200
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:49,180
you'll understand her.

201
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:19,220
Dad.

202
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:21,861
I often think about one question.

203
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,300
To you,

204
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:26,141
what am I, really?

205
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:29,381
Am I just a tool for you to compare with others?

206
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,101
Am I your carefully crafted creation?

207
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,101
Am I a brooch on your jacket pocket?

208
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:38,661
No matter what I am,

209
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:40,981
I've never truly been your daughter.

210
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,340
Since I was little,

211
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,861
I have always tried my best.

212
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:53,940
But I'm not pretty.

213
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,381
I'm not outstanding.

214
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:56,741
I'm not smart.

215
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:58,060
I'm terrible.

216
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,741
I'm always falling behind others.

217
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,501
So you've never been satisfied with me.

218
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,180
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:07,901
I've really done my best.

220
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:09,381
You still have the nerve to come home.

221
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,381
You have always opposed my relationship with Xiaobo.

222
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:20,340
But what you don't know is

223
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,940
in this world,

224
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,741
only Tang Xiaobo

225
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:25,861
has openly told me he loves me.

226
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:27,940
To me,

227
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,861
he is like a drowning person

228
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:31,781
grabbing onto the last piece of driftwood.

229
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,021
Only then could I finally catch my breath.

230
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,180
I thought I had finally found happiness.

231
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:40,661
But I was also consumed by this love.

232
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:43,661
He started to restrict my contact with others.

233
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,261
He borrowed money from me under various excuses.

234
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:47,820
He asked me to help him transfer money.

235
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:50,101
I couldn't refuse him.

236
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,340
Refusing

237
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,820
meant not loving.

238
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,300
Now,

239
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,940
I'm finally leaving.

240
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:01,901
Maybe you'll feel relieved too.

241
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:04,940
If there is a next life,

242
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:07,820
I hope I won't be your daughter again.

243
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:09,460
That way,

244
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,180
you won't be disappointed anymore.

245
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,580
Okay.

246
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,180
I'll do as you say.

247
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,540
I'll go with you.

248
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,060
Xiaoxi
