3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,240
Auntie,

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,360
we're back.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,760
Chuxia,

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,360
you're finally home.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,800
Auntie,

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,280
I have a surprise for you.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,360
Here, sit.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,480
What surprise?

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,600
Give me your hand.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,880
Qilu.

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,840
Mom.

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,400
I'm well now.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,840
Chuxia?

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,880
Qilu.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,800
Qilu.

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,720
Over the years,

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,640
Mom always wants to hug you.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,120
Today the wish is finally fulfilled.

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,720
I'm sorry, Mom.

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,000
Chuxia,

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,480
you're really our lucky star.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,480
Auntie, I was just doing my job.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,320
Honey,

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,280
Qilu,

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,400
Qilu has recovered.

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,960
Come and have a look.

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,080
Have a look.

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,600
Mr. Han,

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,880
were you going to
ask me something just now?

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,200
Qilu,

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,760
your birthday party will be in two days.

34
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,240
Ma'am wants to know

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,760
if you have any special demands.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,640
Is there anything special this year?

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,360
Or maybe

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,880
you want some

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,240
special gifts?

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,480
Special gifts?

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,360
They don't have to be expensive.

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,440
It's the thought that counts.

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,440
Did she hear me?

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,880
Qilu,

45
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,360
you can invite Chuxia

46
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,760
to your party fair and square.

47
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,800
Who wants to invite the fool?

48
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,120
Chuxia

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,440
has cured you.

50
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,720
The whole family is grateful to her.

51
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,520
Your parents

52
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,360
both want you to invite her.

53
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,840
That sounds reasonable.

54
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,400
Han Qilu's birthday is coming.

55
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,560
What gift should I prepare?

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,320
Hello, Chenchuan,

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,880
what birthday gifts

58
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,760
do you boys

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,000
usually want?

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,440
(Whose birthday?)

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,960
Han Qilu's birthday is coming.

62
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,800
(Do you have money?)

63
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,520
Don't you know

64
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,280
whether I have money or not?

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,800
(I think)

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
(he'll like it)

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,920
(no matter what gift you give him.)

68
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,480
(After all, it's your thought that counts.)

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,040
Thought?

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,880
The bossy president's way,

71
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,440
kiss the girl peremptorily.

72
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,980
(What are romantic confessions?
Seven ways to win her heart.)

73
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,240
This is nonsense.

74
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,080
No.

75
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,920
I have to ask for advice.

76
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,000
Are you Qilu?

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Who are you?

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Do you want to see my parents?

79
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,560
They are inside.

80
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,680
Uncle.

81
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,120
Hello, Mankui.

82
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
Where was

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,160
Qilu going in such a hurry?

84
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,400
Did I come at a bad time?

85
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,520
No, you think too much.

86
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,800
He just went out on business.

87
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,680
We haven't seen each other for years.

88
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,440
He doesn't seem to remember me.

89
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,960
By the way, Uncle,

90
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
this is a gift
I brought for you and Auntie.

91
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,160
Thank you.

92
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,920
Come on.

93
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,520
Have a seat.

94
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,280
What can I do for you,

95
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,320
Young Master?

96
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,800
What will you do if you're going to

97
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,840
confess to Mo Xiwei?

98
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,800
Confess?

99
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,360
Why do you ask about this?

100
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
I want to...

101
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,720
You're going to confess to Chuxia.

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,120
Come on, let me tell you.

103
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,160
Are you sure

104
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,240
she will like that?

105
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,280
Rest assured.

106
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,120
Every girl likes that.

107
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,320
Actually, I want to give her a surprise.

108
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,400
I tell you what,

109
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,840
you should do me a favor
at my birthday party

110
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,640
in a few days.

111
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,280
What do you think?

112
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,040
Little prince.

113
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,080
Are you suggesting that

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,880
Han Qilu is your prince?

115
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,000
No.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,720
I simply think it looks good.

117
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,080
Whatever you make,

118
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,440
he'll like it.

119
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

120
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,480
He'll definitely like it.

121
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,040
Even if you made a piece of shi...

122
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,840
he would like it.

123
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,000
You guys must keep it a secret

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,280
and not tell him.

125
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Alright. I'll get back to work.

126
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,960
Chuxia,

127
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,520
remember to

128
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,720
wear a red dress

129
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
on his birthday.

130
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,840
Why?

131
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,760
I hear that

132
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,240
he's liked red

133
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,640
since he was a child.

134
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,040
OK.

135
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,240
Thanks. Bye.

136
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,800
Bye.

137
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,320
Bye.

138
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,600
Xiwei,

139
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
did you tell her?

140
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,080
I worried that I was too clumsy

141
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,200
and would betray myself.

142
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,960
You never thought

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,840
you would betray yourself

144
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,960
concerning your own business, right?

145
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,040
What's this?

146
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,400
I don't know English.

Appointment letter of
a senior dessert chief abroad.

148
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,320
Xiwei,

149
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,760
it took me effort to make you like me.

150
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
How can I leave you easily?

151
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,320
But

152
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,040
isn't that your dream?

153
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
Don't worry.

154
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,640
I made an agreement with them.

155
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,520
I'll take the job after college.

156
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,760
At that time,
