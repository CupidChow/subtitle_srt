3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,280
Han Qilu,

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:20,920
the exam is about to begin.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,720
Where are you going?

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,080
You'll get a zero if you give up.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,440
What are you doing?

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,040
Where is An Chuxia?

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,200
Why do you ask me?

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,360
Shouldn't I ask you?

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,120
Didn't you ask her to

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,560
keep a distance from you
within one meter?

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
An Chuxia went missing.

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,360
Missing?

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,000
Did you do it?

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,000
What?

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Han Qilu is looking for her everywhere.

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,440
Why should I know?

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,480
Xiwei.

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,840
I told you I didn't know.

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,720
An Chuxia!

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,040
An Chuxia!

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,560
(Xiwei.)

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,480
I'm done with you.

25
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,440
The exam is beginning soon.

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,680
Xiwei.

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
Why would you help An Chuxia?

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,920
I'm helping you.

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,360
Think about it.

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,400
If something happens to her,

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,960
do you think you can get away with it?

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,760
Will Han Qilu

33
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,680
let you off?

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,360
I didn't do it on purpose.

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,760
I told you to ask the school board
to check the security video.

36
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,080
Why haven't you found her yet?

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,760
If there are so many videos,

38
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,440
why don't you take more people?

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,120
Found...

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,120
We, we found Chuxia.

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,000
This way.

42
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,360
Hurry. Hurry.

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,040
Hurry.

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:37,880
Thanks. Thanks.

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,880
Chuxia.

46
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,200
Chuxia.

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,210
Go.

48
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,440
Seriously?

49
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,880
How come there was a girl inside?

50
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,840
I'm so scared.

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,680
I thought she passed out.
It turns out that she fell asleep.

52
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,080
Are you awake?

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,930
Oh, my!

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,400
I'm so sleepy that I'm seeing visions.

55
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,160
Stupid.

56
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,960
What's the time?

57
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,040
Half past twelve.

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,820
What's wrong?

59
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,920
The exam.

60
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,880
I'll get a zero if I don't take it.

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
You can't do anything.

62
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,440
It's too late.

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,880
Xi...

64
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,080
I come to apologize to you.

65
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,480
I remember it now.

66
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,200
It was you!

67
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
I didn't mean it.

68
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
I was so angry then.

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,880
I was going to let you out,

70
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,480
but...

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,600
I really don't know

72
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,080
what I had done that offended you?

73
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Do you have the face to ask that?

74
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,440
You cursed Han Qilu in front of me.

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,400
Does that have anything to do with you?

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,520
Qilu,

77
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,000
she said you were sick.

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,920
I'm sick.

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,040
What does that matter to you?

80
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,720
Qilu.

81
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,280
No.

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,760
Are you OK?

83
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,520
Xiwei.

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,520
Does it hurt?

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,120
Where did you get it?

86
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
This?

87
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,720
I asked the housekeeper for it.

88
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,040
I carry it with me

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,520
in case of emergency.

90
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,360
Am I smart?

91
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,960
You're considerate.

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,160
All knowledge, when I give the word,

93
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,680
line up and get into my head!

94
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,480
Come on!

95
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Get in, you guys!

96
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,520
Get in!

97
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,280
Get in, you guys!

98
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,600
Get in!

99
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,560
Get in!

100
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
Get in!

101
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,080
Ma'am.

102
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,200
How many times have I told you?

103
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,520
Call me Auntie.

104
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,240
Ma'am makes me feel

105
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,000
like a stranger.

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,680
Auntie.

107
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,880
I know what happened today.

108
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,120
You were sent to the infirmary.

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,240
Why are you still studying?

110
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,600
Have some soup.

111
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,320
How do you like it?

112
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,760
I cooked it myself.

113
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,720
Does it taste good?

114
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,080
Good.

115
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,920
Very good.

116
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,160
Thanks, Auntie.

117
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,360
Kiddo,

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,960
what's wrong?

119
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,040
Why are you crying?

120
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,880
Auntie, you know what,

121
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,320
since my mom fell ill,

122
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,440
over the years,

123
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
no one has cooked soup for me.

124
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,320
If you say that,

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,360
I should thank you, too.

126
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,720
You know

127
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,600
Qilu's situation.

128
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,840
Over the past 14 years,

129
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,400
I've never

130
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,720
stroked my son like this.

131
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,400
Take the soup.

132
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,000
Though Qilu always pulls a long face,

133
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,160
he is actually as warm-hearted

134
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,680
as his dad.

135
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
You haven't met Qilu's dad, right?

136
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
No.

137
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,920
In a couple of days,

138
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,360
he'll come back from abroad.

139
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Then you'll see him.

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,120
Our Chuxia

141
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
is so cute.

142
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,960
Qilu's dad must be happy

143
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,040
to see you.

144
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,120
Han Qilu,

145
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,840
no matter what a monster you are,

146
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,240
I swear,

147
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,080
I'll cure you

148
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,800
as soon as possible.
