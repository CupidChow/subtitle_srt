Time's up.

00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,240
Wait a minute.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,160
Time's up.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,840
Wait.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,560
Time is up.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,040
I'm going to bed.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,640
Auntie.

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,960
Chuxia,

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
I want to extend the time
for your physical contact

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,040
to ten minutes.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Ten minutes?

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,280
I know it's a little difficult.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,200
But,

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
you know Qilu's situation.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,920
OK.

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,760
How can I make physical contact

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,880
with him for ten minutes every day?

20
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,500
(Cinderella)

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,400
If...

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Are you dreaming away?

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,120
You wanna do that?

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I have both tears

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,680
and acting skills.

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,840
Why can't I compete for

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,680
the leading actress?

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,280
Do you want to...

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,040
Not interested.

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,080
try the leading actor?

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,480
What?

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,200
Aren't you the leading actor?

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,800
Why,

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,080
you also work as a porter?

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,640
Chuxia is making props.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,520
I'm going to help her.

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,040
Wait.

38
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,360
Isn't she the leading actress?

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,200
The leading actress is Xiwei.

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,680
Chuxia wants to compete for

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,240
the role of Cinderella,

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,480
but the club has already decided that

43
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,080
Xiwei and I

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
are the prince and the princess.

45
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,520
Put it down.

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,520
I'll help you.

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,320
OK.

48
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,120
Thanks, then.

49
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,080
I'm going to rehearse.

50
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,480
I thought I would stand out

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,120
by memorizing all the lines.

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,880
Isn't it my fate

53
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,680
to be the heroine?

54
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,720
Why are you here?

55
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,200

I ran into Han Qilu halfway

75
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,840
and gave the prop to him.

76
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
Why would you do that?

77
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,280

00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,600

No worries.
