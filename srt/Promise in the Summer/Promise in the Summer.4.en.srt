3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,200
Go check

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,680
why Qilu hasn't come downstairs.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,120
Yes.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Qilu,

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,120
did you have nightmares again?

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,640
Don't worry, Mom.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,160
Let's eat.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,800
(It can't be true.)

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,440
(Did the words
I wrote casually come true?)

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
You scared me.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,800
What are you thinking about?

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,080
Do you think

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,680
there's really

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,480
such a death notebook,

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,280
the curse

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,400
written on which

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,320
would come true?

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,960
Hey, hey, hey.

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,440
You told me yesterday that

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,280
as a college student,

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,360
I shouldn't believe such nonsense.

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,120
Then why do you...

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm just saying.

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,680
So why do you look preoccupied?

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,760
You know what,

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,760
last night,

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
I wrote on my notebook

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
a curse that

31
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,320
Han Qilu would have nightmares

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,760
and be unable to sleep.

33
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,440
In the end, he really said this morning

34
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,960
that he had a nightmare.

35
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,200
I think

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,520
it's just a coincidence.

37
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,560
You worried too much.

38
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,200
Han Qilu

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,680
always looked sleepy before.

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
He slept every time
when he got into the classroom.

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,560
We didn't even dare to talk.

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,320
No wonder

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,520
everyone reacted that way

44
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,680
the first time
I stepped into the classroom.

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,160
So,

46
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,640
don't blame yourself.

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,840
But I still think

48
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,360
Han Qilu is weird today.

49
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,720
Isn't it weird to talk about others
behind their backs?

50
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,240
You...

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,200
How could you walk without
making any sound?

52
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,320
You are like a ghost.

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,000
Give me back.

54
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,040
If so,

55
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,920
I'll take that as your resignation.

56
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,520
No!

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,320
Chuxia,

58
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,240
I can't stand him

59
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,280
bullying you like this.

60
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,360
Give him the bracelet.

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
I'll pay you a salary,

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,160
triple.

63
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,480
You...

64
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,520
I'll explain to you later.

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,360
If you still want to finish the task,

66
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,200
keep a distance from me
within one meter.

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,600
Why do you give me so many books?

68
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,800
The exam is coming soon.

69
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
Are you going to study overnight?

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,720
Not me.

71
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,080
You.

72
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,760
Why?

73
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,080
If you come in last

74
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,720
in the exam,

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,480
you'll no longer be eligible
to sit in on classes.

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,320
It isn't in the contract, right?

77
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
No, it isn't.

78
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,600
But Party A may add terms

79
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,080
based on the actual situation.

80
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
So I added the term just now.

81
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,680
Go and study for your exam.

82
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,320
What are you waiting for?

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,480
He doesn't want me to sleep

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,640
because he can't sleep well.

85
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,040
Totally

86
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,680
confused.

87
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,000
Han Qilu,

88
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,840
big scoundrel.

89
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,840
I wish you

90
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,040
get a zero.

91
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,500
(Han Qilu, you demon.
I wish you get a zero in the exam.)

92
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,400
Qilu,

93
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,040
are you...

94
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,720
I'm fine.

95
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,800
If you're unable to sleep,

96
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,680
I'll send someone to get you some pills.

97
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,480
I'm OK, Mom.

98
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,160
Han Qilu,

99
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,940
are you satisfied?

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,540
I'm as sleepy

101
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,650
as you are now.

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,560
Wake up.

103
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,080
Wake up.

104
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,920
An Chuxia!

105
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,160
Yes!

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,440
It's you.

107
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,640
Han Qilu is in there.

108
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,560
Go inside if you want to see him.

109
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,040
Just don't distract me from sleep.

110
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,200
What are you doing?

111
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,080
What ideas have you
put in Han Qilu's head

112
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,280
that makes him allow you
to approach him?

113
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,240
What ideas?

114
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,080
Han Qilu is sick.

115
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,480
How dare you curse him?

116
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,840
What do you want?

117
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,200
He is really sick.

118
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,320
He treats you so well and you...

119
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,320
Hey!

120
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,080
Mo Xiwei!

121
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,760
Mo Xiwei, let me out.

122
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,840
Unless you make an apology.

123
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,240
I won't.

124
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,080
Open the door.

125
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,280
I won't open the door
unless you apologize.

126
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,960
Xiwei.

127
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Make an apology!

128
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,040
