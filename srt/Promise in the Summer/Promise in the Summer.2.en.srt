3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,920
The bracelet will automatically light up

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,800
within the specified distance.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,200
Take it away.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,040
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,320
I didn't mean to

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,720
upset you before.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,360
Is that all?

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,680
I know you don't want it,

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,360
but...

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,200
I, I...

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,760
And,

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,400
I promised your mom

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,040
to help with your treatment.

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm really sorry.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,720
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,400
If you really feel sorry,

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,880
you should resign

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,560
to my mom.

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,760
I can't do that.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
Then your apology

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,120
is meaningless.

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,280
Even if you want me to resign,

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,080
you should give me a chance to explain.

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,120
Don't you even give people

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,560
a probation period?

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,320
Today is the probation period.

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,280
If you can't make it,

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,480
you quit.

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,680
Hey!

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Let's see.

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,400
This is

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,520
your study room.

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,160
This is your bedroom.

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,280
Miss An,

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,400
is there anything
you're not happy about?

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,240
No, no.

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,640
I've never had such a nice bedroom

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,160
or a study room.

41
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,320
By the way,

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,560
please me Chuxia.

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,520
This is

44
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,160
the information about Qilu.

45
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,600
It's recorded in detail

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,480
what he likes

47
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,160
and doesn't like.

48
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,800
Please read it carefully.

49
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,720
It'll help you
to get along well with Qilu.

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,400
Uniform.

51
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,280
We've applied for you
to sit in on classes.

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,440
You're in the same class with Qilu.

53
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,680
Stilan Business College.

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,560
Class A, Grade 2, Finance Department.

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,440
Change into your uniform
in the afternoon.

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,080
Then go to school with Qilu.

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,760
Back off.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,600
Further.

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,400
Further.

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,600
Can you remember the distance?

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,440
Don't come near me.

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,880
You deliberately stop me
from accomplishing the task.

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,320
I've never seen her before.

64
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,800
Is there any problem with your eyes?

65
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't look at me like that.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,160
The seat next to you
is the only one spared.

67
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,000
If I don't sit here,

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,080
I'll have to go out.

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,800
Whatever.

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,680
Is there any problem?

71
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,320
Stop talking,

72
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,760
or get out of here.

73
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
What are you doing?

74
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,680
Don't you recognize me?

75
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,560
Who are you?

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,000
Look carefully.

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,280
I don't remember.

78
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,600
The bakery.

79
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,680
The bakery?

80
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,160
You worked part-time in my shop.

81
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,840
I remember now.

82
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,600
I remember now.

83
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,760
I've done many part-time jobs

84
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,560
over the past two years.

85
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,320
No worries.

86
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,520
By the way,

87
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,680
how is your mom?

88
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,080
Same old.

89
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,040
She needs hemodialysis once a week.

90
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,360
We can't find a suitable kidney donor.

91
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,880
But there's hope now.

92
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,520
I've got a job in the Han Family.

93
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,400
Han Qilu's family?

94
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,960
Yeah.

95
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,600
You know what,

96
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,680
I think there's something wrong
with Han Qilu.

97
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,080
If anyone dares to touch him,

98
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,360
he'll become violent and hurt others.

99
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,600
Then I'm a transformed werewolf.

100
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,360
You're a college student.

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
How could you believe such nonsense?

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,960
Really.

103
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,440
I really think he has a problem.

104
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,320
I don't think he's a bad guy,

105
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,400
only that he always pulls a long face.

106
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,880
Childish.

107
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
You're here.

108
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,280
I've been looking for you.

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm keeping a distance

110
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,280
as you asked.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,480
Well,

112
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,080
the terrace is big.

113
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,960
You can't stop me from staying here

114
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,760
just because you're here.

115
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,400
Do you like the terrace?

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,480
Yeah.

117
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,480
Then stay here yourself.

118
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,240
Hey.

119
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,000
Hey, hey, hey.

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,880
Han Qilu. Han Qilu.

121
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
How can I get out?

122
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,760
Give me a hand.

123
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,520
I was wrong before.

124
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,120
Han Qilu

125
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,040
is a

126
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,760
cold-blooded demon.

127
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,700
(I was wrong before.
Han Qilu is a cold-blooded demon.)

128
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Don't worry.

129
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,200
I won't take advantage of you.

130
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,200
I'll leave after one minute.

131
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
I thought you were not bad before.

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,760
But you're cold blooded.

133
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,720
Fortunately,
the housekeeper gave me a key.

134
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,760
One who upholds justice
enjoys much support.

136
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,680
