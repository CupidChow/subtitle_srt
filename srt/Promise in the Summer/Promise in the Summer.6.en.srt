00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,880
(Auntie,)

(is there any way)

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,200
(to cure Han Qilu quickly?)

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,840
(Why don't you try one minute of
physical contact?)

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,520
How do I start?

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,800
Since you like to laugh,

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,240
you should stay here and laugh.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,800
Look.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,880
There are quite a few.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,960
Where is it?

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,120
Xiwei,

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,240
you won the first place.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,800
Why is she so upset?

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,760
I hear that Han Qilu

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,120
missed the exam because of An Chuxia.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,760
Otherwise, how could Mo Xiwei
get the first place?

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,160
He got a zero for missing the exam.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,800
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,320
No worries.

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,720
Why did you

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,120
miss the exam for no reason?

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,840
An Chenchuan,
why are you smiling?

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,880
Because, Miss,

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,960
I think

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,760
it's rare for me to get the same score

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,040
with Han Qilu.

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,120
Miss the exam.

30
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,160
Get a zero.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,800
Do you know how humiliating it is?

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,040
I'm sorry, Miss.

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,040
Please punish me
if you must punish someone.

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,840
Don't punish them.

35
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,920
They missed

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,040
the exam

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,440
trying to help me.

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,560
Help you?

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,120
What happened exactly?

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,320
Because I was

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,640
accidentally

42
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,960
locked in the piano room.

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,880
Then they went to help me

44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,000
and missed the exam.

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,960
Who can prove your absurd excuse?

46
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,240
Miss, I can prove it.

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,200
Xiwei,

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,560
how can you mess around like them?

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,080
I'm not.

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
I'm telling the truth.

51
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,680
Before the exam,

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,200
the four of us
were roughhousing in the hall.

53
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,440
The door of the piano room was open.

54
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,960
An Chuxia was accidentally locked up.

55
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,520
They

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,680
missed the exam trying to help her.

57
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,920
The caretaker can prove that.

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,320
Next week,

59
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,080
you will resit the exam.

60
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you, Miss.

61
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,240
Why doesn't he study for the exam?

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,880
Do you think

63
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,320
he needs to do that?

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,040
I didn't expect him to be so great.

65
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,960
I have to go.

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,680
Continue with your study.

67
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,080
I...

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,720
Why do you look at me

69
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,360
instead of the books?

70
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,840
The books are incomprehensible.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,080
Would you please

72
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,680
lend me your notes?

73
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,560
Pen.

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,160
(He looks cool)

75
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,520
(this way.)

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,800
That's all for the exam.

77
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
How do you know?

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
Because I have a brain.

79
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,920
Do you mean I'm brainless?

80
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,280
Well,

81
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,600
there are some points
I still don't understand.

82
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,680
I don't have

83
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,160
high expectations of your IQ.

84
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,240
Come in.

85
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,840
The exam questions are all here.

86
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,040
If you can't master them,

87
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,400
just memorize them.

88
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,080
I'm impressed.

89
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,440
If so, why did you give me
so many books?

90
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
I know. I know.

91
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,840
You want me to study hard
and make progress every day.

92
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,360
I get it.

93
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,240
Can I show these to Chenchuan?

94
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,440
Whatever.

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
A lime-flavored rainbow cake.

96
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,920
Thanks.

97
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,880
Why are you here?

98
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,680
I passed by

99
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,120
and came to buy a cake.

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,520
Wait for minute.

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,960
How is your review going?

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,240
Just so so.

103
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,920
If I can't do well in the exam,

104
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
I can always

105
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,560
apply my mind to the bakery.

106
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,320
You can't just rest on your laurels.

107
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,760
These are my review materials.

108
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,320
Read them carefully.

109
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,720
You must do better
than An Chuxia in the exam.

110
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,720
I don't mind.

111
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,880
If I do poorly,

112
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,400
I'd get beaten up by my dad at most.

113
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,680
But Chuxia is different.

114
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,920
She would be miserable.

115
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,200
If you dare do worse than her,

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
I'll never talk to you again.
