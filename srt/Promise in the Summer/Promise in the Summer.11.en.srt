00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,860
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,680
The doctor said

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,560
you mustn't use your injured foot,

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,840
or it would become an uncured illness.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,440
You need to rest for about three days.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,080
Three days!

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,440
Then...

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,960
What about my show?

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,200
Be careful.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,840
The show

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
isn't so important as your health.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll figure a way out.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,720
Xiwei is definitely
unable to play her role.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,080
Therefore,

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,040
we must choose another heroine.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,080
Why are you looking at me?

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,920
Chuxia.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,560
I did want to
compete for the role before,

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,200
but

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,880
I doubt it's appropriate for me

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,200
to do it now.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,520
But at the moment,

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,920
no one but you has memorized
all of Cinderella's lines.

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,600
Moreover, we're running out of time.

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
But I don't know how to dance.

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,400
Chenchuan can teach you.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,160
Come on. I'll teach you.

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Let me try.

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,880
Left hand.

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,600
OK.

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,760
The first move,

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
right foot backward.

34
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,080
OK.

35
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,440
Come.

36
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,040
One.

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,240
Then right foot forward.

38
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,000
Forward.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,720
Two.

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,840
Left foot backward.

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,480
Three.

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,920
Three.

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,680
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,400
No worries.

45
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,640
Come.

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,120
Let's...

47
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,720
let's do it again.

48
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,120
OK.

49
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,840
Right foot backward.

50
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,080
OK.

51
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,400
Come.

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,360
One.

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,760
Two.

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,320
You're much skilled now.

55
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,920
Right.

56
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,600
Three.

57
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,040
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,240
Hey.

59
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,920
No worries.

60
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,560
How much longer will it take?

61
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,520
If you want to dance so much,

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
you can practice here yourself.

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,880
Wait for me.

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,760
Chuxia.

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,720
I'll practice when I get home.

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,880
Are you going to practice or not?

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,960
Wait for me.

68
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,840
It sounds unsympathetic,

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,280
but Mo Xiwei's accident

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,880
actually makes me the heroine.

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,320
Does it make you so happy?

72
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,040
Sure.

73
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,120
Why are you upset again?

74
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,520
I was going to ask you
to teach me to dance.

75
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,320
Why hasn't she come yet?

76
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,360
Four.

77
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,360
I forgot I hadn't finished

78
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,040
the ten-minute task.

79
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,800
Why do you stop dancing?

80
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,880
Dancing is important,

81
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,160
but the task is also...

82
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
more important.

83
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,560
Waltz?

84
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,480
I teach only once.

85
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,720
No worries.

87
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,720
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,120
No worries.

89
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,320
Again.

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,800
Can't you tell left from right?

91
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,760
A little bit.

92
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,360
A little bit?

93
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,320
Do you know

94
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,600
how many times

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,960
you stepped on me
since the beginning?

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,640
Forget it.

97
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,200
Won't you teach me anymore?

98
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Step on my feet.

99
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,800
You step on my feet.

100
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,640
I'll tell you left and right.

101
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Wh, wh, what?

102
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,720
Step, step on your feet?

103
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,400
You wanna learn or not?

104
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,960
Yes.

105
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,320
Hold tight.

106
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,880
What did you say?

107
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,920
Ma'am,

108
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,160
absolutely true.

109
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,360
Qilu is dancing with Chuxia

110
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,400
in the garden now.

111
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,960
That's great!

112
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,400
Don't stand there.

113
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,720
Go grab my SLR camera.

114
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,120
Yeah. Yeah.

115
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,240
Ma'am.

116
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,640
They're such a perfect match.

117
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,560
Wonderful!

118
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,280
Well,

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,760
thanks.

120
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,080
Thanks for helping me
to prepare the prop

121
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,200
and teaching me to dance.

122
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,320
Will you

123
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,000
go to see my show?

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,720
Not interested.

125
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,200
Great.

126
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,880
You learned to dance so fast.

127
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,680
Chenchuan seems to be a good teacher.

128
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,440
I can't take all the credit.

129
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,920
Chuxia learned it herself at home.

130
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:57,920
Hello?

131
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,360
Don't worry.

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,640
I must ruin

133
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,360
Cinderella's dress.

134
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,280
(Hurry up.)

135
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,200
(Don't get caught.)

136
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,720
What's wrong?

137
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,120
It's OK.

138
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,520
Someone is coming.

139
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,160
