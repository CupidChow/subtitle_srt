=Episode 9=

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,960
It's her.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,480
The newcomer, An Chuxia.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,080
I hear that

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,680
she has moved in with Han Qilu.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,000
That's what happened.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,800
Chuxia,

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,480
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,000
No worries.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,320
I said

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,480
it wasn't your fault.

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,120
But

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,240
the rumor has spread
all over the school.

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,840
You really don't mind?

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,920
I'm OK.

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,040
But I'm worried that Han Qilu

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,840
would explode.

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,500
Come on.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,640
Really?

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,480
Could my mom have the transplant
next week?

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,560
Great.

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,240
Thanks, Auntie.

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,440
You're welcome.

25
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
Study in peace

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,280
with Qilu.

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,400
Your mom is

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,800
taken good care of.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,320
Before the transplant,

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll have someone to

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,920
send you to see her.

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,280
Thank you so much, Auntie.

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,560
I can't thank you enough.

34
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,160
By the way, Auntie,

35
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,680
I've finished the one-minute task today.

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,360
Really?

37
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,240
Great.

38
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,400
You're really our lucky star.

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,800
They're probably together.

40
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,880
I agree.

41
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
Think about it.

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,440
Chuxia dared to sit next to

43
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,040
Han Qilu on her first day of school.

44
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,640
This is like the novels of
bossy president becoming real.

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,920
So sweet!

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,360
Exactly.

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,880
Exactly.

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,560
Enough!

49
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,360
Han Qilu will never take a fancy

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,440
to someone like An Chuxia.

51
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,760
They'll never be together.

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,080
Qilu,

53
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,280
I just...

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
You are right.

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,400
I'll never be together with An Chuxia.

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,920
So,

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,960
An Chuxia

58
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,680
must have edited the photo herself.

59
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,160
Edited?

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,480
She did it.

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,000
I didn't expect her to do that.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,520
Yeah.

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,560
She's quite calculating.

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,320
I thought it was true.

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,280
It was unintentional.

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,720
I didn't know

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
the iPad was among the books.

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,040
And I didn't set the desktop...

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,480
Fine.

70
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,640
I should be blamed
for not changing it in time.

71
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,840
If it bothers you so much,

72
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,440
I can always change it.

73
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,160
An Chuxia,

74
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,080
you only work for my family.

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,200
Who are you to bother me?

76
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,360
Chuxia.

77
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,120
What?

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,040
I heard what happened yesterday.

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,880
I...

80
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,200
No big deal.

81
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,280
I said no big deal.

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,760
Don't worry.

83
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,000
What about Han Qilu?

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,920
That's the kind of guy

85
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,640
Han Qilu is.

86
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,800
He always flips out for no reason.

87
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,000
And he keeps things all bottled up,

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,040
never saying anything.

89
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,720
It's exhausting.

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,920
Chuxia,

91
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,640
what about you?

92
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,880
In the whole thing,

93
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,360
the one who gets hurt the worst is you.

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,000
But you're still thinking about
how he feels.

95
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,160
Do you worry about Han Qilu that much?

96
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,480
Do you like him that much?

97
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,840
It's OK.

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,760
The rumor will die down

99
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,840
in a couple of days.

100
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,400
It doesn't matter.

101
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,360
I have no right to judge you.

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,720
I'm no better than you.

103
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,080
Every time something happens,

104
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,040
the first thing I consider

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,200
is Xiwei's feelings.

106
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,800
Mo Xiwei?

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,960
Yeah.

108
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,800
You like Mo Xiwei?

109
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,120
Isn't that obvious?

(R&D Innovation Center)

111
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,760
I can't believe that those campy dramas
actually become real.

112
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,840
Why didn't you

113
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,600
follow Han Qilu around today?

114
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,920
You live at his house, so what?

115
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,160
Still, he won't

116
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
take a fancy to you.

117
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,360
By the way,

118
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,200
I forgot to tell you that

119
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,840
today, Qilu and I would have

120
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,240
a date.

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
Date.

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,160
Date.

123
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,440
Date?

124
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Date, no!

125
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
Wait!

126
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,400
It's burned.

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:17,880
Go.

128
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,640
Where's the ointment?

129
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,080
What ointment?

130
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,680
