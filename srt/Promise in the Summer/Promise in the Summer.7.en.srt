3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,200
You're so noisy.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,560
This question is too difficult.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,040
I can only memorize it.

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,840
What are you looking at?

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,840
Focus.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,240
Get it?

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,440
Any other questions?

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,480
Chenchuan.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,000
Wait for a minute.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,360
Follow me.

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,480
What are you doing?

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,920
Why are you so secretive?

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,200
What's this?

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,360
Simulated exam questions
given by Han Qilu.

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,280
He said that

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,680
the questions of the make-up exam

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,760
were all included.

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,040
Chuxia...

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,400
Am I a real buddy?

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,080
You are. You are.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,760
You really are.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:31,920
By the way,

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,800
I have a question to ask you.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,520
How can I

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,760
touch Han Qilu without

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,240
irritating him?

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,920
Touch Han Qilu

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,360
without...

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Why do you want to touch him?

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,280
Why do I want to touch him?

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
You have a crush on him.

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,200
Enough.

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,560
Stop pretending.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,400
Your buddy will keep your secret.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,640
No.

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,120
Don't worry about that.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,880
Do you have any idea?

40
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,520
I do

41
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,240
have an idea.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,760
You can touch him secretly

43
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,720
while he's asleep.

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,480
I'll consider it.

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,640
Think if there are other ways.

46
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,360
I have to go.

47
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,320
Ma'am,

48
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Mr. Han is back.

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,800
Honey,

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,040
I have a surprise for you.

51
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,720
You mean the girl called Chuxia?

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,800
Well,

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,840
you'll be more surprised

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,600
when you see the photo.

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,000
Look.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,040
Nothing happened even though

57
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,240
they were so close to each other.

58
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,440
They do look the part.

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,200
If only the photo is clearer!

60
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,400
How I wish

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,880
Chuxia is my daughter-in-law!

62
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,080
What are you thinking about?

63
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,960
Qilu and the daughter
of the Xiang Family

64
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,400
will be together sooner or later.

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,600
- We should honor our word.
- Honor our word.

66
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,160
You're such a killjoy.

67
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,200
I wonder if they are

68
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
so close to each other at school.

69
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,800
Why did you leave without a word?

70
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,480
I thought you went missing.

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,280
I was scared to death.

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,080
Hey!

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,480
What's wrong?

74
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
Learn from my mistake.

75
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,880
Seriously?

76
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,040
He was nice yesterday.

77
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,480
Tell me

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,840
why there is such a kind of guy.

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,320
He turns hostile suddenly.

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,040
Has he ever turned?

81
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,080
He's always been hostile.

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
I mean,

83
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,600
look,

84
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,040
he kindly gave me
review materials yesterday.

85
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,640
Then today, he keeps avoiding me.

86
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,240
I don't understand.

87
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,280
What's wrong?

88
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,040
Nothing.

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,520
Well,

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,360
Chuxia,

91
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,800
by the way,

92
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
do you worry about the make-up exam?

93
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,320
Not at all.

94
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,280
I will have time

95
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,520
to worry about losing my job.

96
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Now,

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,200
my biggest worry

98
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,840
is Han Qilu.

99
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
I have an idea.

100
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,640
Here it is.

101
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,680
You hide some paper scraps
in your hands.

102
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,160
Then try to touch his hair

103
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,400
and see how he reacts.

104
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,760
If he gets angry,

105
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,480
you can say

106
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,240
I'm picking something off your hair.

107
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,680
Will it work?

108
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,000
Of course it will.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
Come on.

110
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
Try it on me.

111
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,160
I'm Han Qilu.

112
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,560
No.

113
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,880
He is much fiercer than you.

114
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,680
Silly girl.

115
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,360
Come on.

116
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,040
You play the part of Han Qilu.

117
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,640
I'll play you.

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,200
I play Han Qilu.

119
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,240
Qilu,

120
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,360
there's something in your hair.

121
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,160
Don't move.

122
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,040
Let me pick it off.

123
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,760
What's wrong?

124
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,280
I think I saw Han Qilu.

125
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,960
You might be mistaken.

126
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,680
He never comes to the cafeteria.

127
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
It' s said that

128
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,360
he doesn't need to eat.

129
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,000
(I shouldn't have been mistaken.)

130
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,440
Chuxia.

131
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,080
Sir,

132
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,920
why are you here?

133
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,000
Hurry up.

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,160
Mr. Han went home today.

135
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,680
Let's go.

136
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,600
Han...

137
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,320
Mr. Han.

138
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,600
(As Auntie said,)

139
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,280
(Han Qilu's dad)

140
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,920
(is as scary as him.)

141
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,080
It's your fault.

142
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,000
The whole family

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,560
becomes lifeless when you're at home.

144
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,720
Why are you looking at me?

145
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,680
Did I say it wrong?

146
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,480
When you're away,

147
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,960
with the company of Chuxia,

148
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,400
Qilu became

149
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,360
more cheerful.

150
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,280
Qilu, tell him.

151
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,480
I'm full.

152
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,080
Enjoy yourselves.

153
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Let me try.

154
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,240
Easy. Easy.

155
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,920
Han Qilu is a human being,

156
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,640
not a demon.

157
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,560
Wait.

158
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,360
Well,

159
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,280
were you angry

160
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,920
because I told Chenchuan that

161
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,800
I had a crush on you?

162
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,480
What did you say?

163
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
No, no.

164
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,920
That's because I want to help to
desensitize you quickly.

165
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,280
I can't tell anyone

166
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,840
the truth about you.

167
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,880
I have no other choice.

168
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,760
If you really mind,

169
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,120
I can explain it to him.

170
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't bother.

171
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,920
