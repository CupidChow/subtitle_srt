=Episode 22=

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,400
Do you know what you are doing?

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,440
What am I doing?

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,240
I want to know what you are doing?

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,120
I've been in love with you since I was a child.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,440
And we have an engagement.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,600
And you?

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,120
You're indifferent to me.

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,760
You left me alone at the party

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,640
and allowed your mom to humiliate me.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,640
It's all because of her!

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,480
Because of her, you betrayed me.

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,360
She's ruining my happy life.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,560
I made it clear enough last time.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,720
Our engagement was canceled.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,080
Don't be too obstinate.

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,240
Am I obstinate?

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,120
Aren't you?

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,200
You keep defending her
no matter what I say.

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,320
I just don't understand

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,880
why I can't compare with her.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,800
Fine.

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,040
Let me tell you now,

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,320
no matter how many women
show up around me,

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,040
I'll always choose her.

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,400
Do you understand?

28
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,160
If you say so,

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,160
it seems that you're about to
go against my family.

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,440
It seems that you don't know

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,800
what your family did.

32
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,860
(Cash Journal)

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,240
This is the account book

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,680
of Liang Baisheng,
the treasurer of the factory.

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,320
It clearly recorded
how the redundancy payment

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,160
our family paid went into

37
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,600
the pocket of the Xiang Family.

38
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,960
Well...

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,880
Big surprise, huh?

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,600
Let me tell you why my kidnapping

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,320
became a cold case.

42
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,520
Since the Xiang Family
pocketed the redundancy payment,

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,320
a laid-off female worker
was driven crazy.

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,440
Then,

45
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,600
the mentally disordered woman

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,680
kidnapped me.

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,040
The woman is now

48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,440
in an asylum.

49
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,800
No wonder

50
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,240
we couldn't find your kidnapper.

51
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,040
For the sake of the overall situation,

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,600
you blocked the news
of my disappearance.

53
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,520
So I was trapped in the factory
for a long time

54
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,840
till Chuxia

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,080
went to save me.

56
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,120
Chuxia,

57
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,520
you're really our lucky star.

58
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,240
I just...

59
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,960
Impossible.

60
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,520
Absolutely impossible.

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,200
An Chuxia,

62
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,520
is this your plot?

63
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,680
The account book must be fake.

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,400
Dad,

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,560
the evidence is right here.

66
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,520
Call off the engagement.

67
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,120
I told you early that

68
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,240
the Xiang Family did things...

69
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,960
You regarded him as a brother.

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,560
Now what?

71
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,680
You got stabbed by the brother.

72
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,000
Enough,

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,120
stop blaming me.

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,680
The engagement

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,280
is off.

76
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,240
Uncle Han!

77
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,000
What's going on?

78
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,640
Dad!

79
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,360
Look at them.

80
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,960
They were all bullying me.

81
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,960
Uncle Xiang,

82
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,400
do you remember

83
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,800
this account book?

84
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,120
What are you talking about?

85
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,920
I don't get it.

86
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,640
You don't get it?

87
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,840
It doesn't matter.

88
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,400
When you are in court,

89
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
you'll probably get it.

90
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,680
Han,

91
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,640
your son...

92
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,840
My son is very good.

93
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,360
He is right.

94
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,120
You can't make up for your wrongdoing.

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,800
I'll see you in court.

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,920
I...

97
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,560
Han,

98
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,520
it was just a moment of weakness.

99
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,400
We've been friends for many years,

100
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,000
do you have to...

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,280
Dad,

102
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,680
they're clearly framing you.

103
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,640
Why do you beg them?

104
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,680
Calm down.

105
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,960
I'll explain to you when we get home.

106
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,000
Chuxia,

107
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,560
it was

108
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,920
my negligence.

109
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
I apologize to you.

110
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,200
Mr. Han,

111
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,120
you shouldn't apologize to me.

112
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,960
I have no right

113
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,280
to forgive anybody on behalf of

114
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,400
those laid-off workers.

115
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
In those days,

116
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,720
without the redundancy money,

117
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,520
people had to live on odd jobs.

118
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,240
Every time when they went negotiating,

119
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,000
they were stopped halfway
by the people of the Xiang Family.

120
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,280
To pay elders' medical expenses

121
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,800
and children's tuition fees,

122
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
they ran around borrowing money.

123
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,520
They suffered too much.

124
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,920
I can't forgive anyone on their behalf.

125
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,360
When everything is clarified,

126
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,680
we'll reissue the redundancy money

127
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,920
to the workers in full.

128
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,160
Thanks, Mr. Han.

129
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,160
Qilu,

130
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,600
Chuxia is a good girl.

131
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,360
You have

132
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,920
a good eye.

133
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,160
Of course.

134
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,480
Will you interfere with

135
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,920
my personal affairs again?

136
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,480
Alright, alright.

137
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,600
I won't.

138
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,840
Though you apologized,

139
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,520
you haven't thanked Chuxia yet.

140
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,920
Last time included,

141
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,040
Chuxia saved Qilu

142
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,800
twice.

143
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,360
Two times.

144
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,840
Auntie, you're welcome.

145
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,920
I saved Han Qilu,

146
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,800
but

147
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,400
you also saved my mom.

148
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
You found her the doctor

149
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,720
and arranged the hospital.

150
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,920
Without your help,

151
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
she wouldn't recover so quickly.

152
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,800
So, thank you.

153
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,920
Alright.

154
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,840
We're family.

155
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,040
Don't stand on ceremony.

156
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,360
Auntie, don't make fun of me.

157
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,280
Anyway, in future,

158
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,040
wherever I go,

159
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,120
whatever I do,

160
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,920
I won't forget your kindness.

161
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,920
It's getting late.

162
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,160
I have to go.

163
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,800
An Chuxia.

164
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,600
What's wrong?

165
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,480
You haven't finished the task

166
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,600
my mom assigned you.

167
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,280
How could you go?

168
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,680
I, I've finished it.

169
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm not cured.

170
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,600
Yes, you are.

171
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,160
I have a relapse.

172
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,160
Oh?

173
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,800
Xiang Mankui scared me.

174
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,360
I have a relapse.

175
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,040
How is that possible?

176
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,280
Yeah, yeah.

177
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,960
Qilu has

178
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,720
a relapse.

179
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,960
Look, I dare not touch him.

180
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
Chuxia,

181
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,480
how about this,

182
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,160
you stay here

183
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,840
till Qilu

184
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,600
fully recovers.

185
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,160
But my mom is still...

186
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
You can give her a call.

187
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,680
If you're too embarrassed to call her,

188
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,280
I can do it for you.

189
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
But, still, I...

190
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,280
Chuxia,

191
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,280
consider it as a favor to me.

192
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,600
Yeah.

193
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,720
If you won't do them the favor,

194
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,120
you must do me the favor.

195
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,040
You don't dislike me, do you?

196
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,920
No, no.

197
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,840
OK, then.

198
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,360
I'll stay.

199
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,720
Great.

200
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,360
Why do you still keep it?

201
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,720
What?

202
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,360
Because someone

203
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,960
sneaked away on my birthday.

204
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,600
I was really mad.

205
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,040
You'll celebrate your birthday again.

206
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,240
Next year.

207
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,360
Next year I'll make it up to you.

208
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000
You promised.

209
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,600
Yeah.

210
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,840
The cake was nice.

211
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
Did you eat it?

212
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,960
You made it for me.

213
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,120
Couldn't I eat it?

214
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,160
No, no.

215
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,680
I mean...

216
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,360
I can easily

217
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,040
read your mind.

218
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,880
After all, you have low IQ.

219
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,040
Did you forget

220
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,840
who helped you to pass the exam?

221
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,760
Do you have the nerve to say that?

222
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,280
If I hadn't been so sleepy,

223
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,040
I wouldn't have been

224
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,440
locked in the piano room by Mo Xiwei.

225
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Didn't I give up the exam
and go to save you?

226
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,160
Then...

227
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's call it even.

228
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,960
How can we call it even?

229
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,280
I'm a patient now.

230
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,160
According to my mom's contract,

231
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,400
don't you have to...

232
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Alright, alright.

233
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,160
I promise,

234
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,400
from now on,

235
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
I won't be more than a meter

236
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,800
away from you,

237
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,520
OK?

238
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,760
I also have one.
