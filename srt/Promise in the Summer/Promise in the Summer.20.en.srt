00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,900
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,360
Auntie, look.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,520
This, this, and this

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,600
are all rogue software.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,440
They occupy much memory.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,680
You should do this,

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,440
this...

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,120
Then it'll get better.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,440
I see.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,480
No wonder it gets
more and more sluggish.

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,080
Thank you so much.

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,200
You are young,

14
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,000
smart

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and clever.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,680
I'm sure many girls like you.

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,520
Au, Auntie,

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,480
I'm not really good at pleasing girls.

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,360
Qilu,

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,680
if you are not in a hurry,

21
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,440
stay for lunch.

22
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,400
Mom.

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,880
I'm not in a hurry.

24
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
I have plenty of time.

25
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
I can stay.

26
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,640
Great.

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,400
I'll cook several dishes myself

28
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,560
to show my gratitude.

29
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,520
Chuxia,

30
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,480
go to buy some food.

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,480
Auntie, I'll go with her.

32
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,880
Go.

33
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:00,960
OK.

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
I thought you were great,

35
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,440
but you don't know
how to buy food

36
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,520
or bargain.

37
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,640
Why are you smiling?

38
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,360
I think you're good at bargaining.

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,000
Of course.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,880
What are you looking at?

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,640
I...

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,080
My, my, my food.

43
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,200
What's wrong?

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,160
Qilu.

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,560
It's all your fault.

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,840
It's all your family's fault.

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,040
I lost my job.

48
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,160
I lost everything.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,440
You took everything from me.

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,720
I must take yours in return.

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,680
Qilu.

52
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,120
Han Qilu.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,160
Don't scare me.

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,320
Don't scare me.

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,000
What's wrong?

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,840
What's wrong?

57
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,560
Han Qilu.

58
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,560
Han Qilu,

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,440
Don't scare me.

60
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,840
Don't scare me.

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,160
Don't scare me.

62
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,040
Han Qilu.

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,240
Are you OK?

64
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,680
I remember now.

65
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,040
Oh?

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,800
You were the little girl who saved me.

67
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,040
The boy,

68
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,440
the boy I freed in my childhood was you?

69
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,040
Enough.

70
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,840
Forget about it.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Chuxia,

72
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,920
thank you.

73
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,280
It took you so long to say that.

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,600
Can you blame me?

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,480
Who would leave a hostage
by the roadside

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,560
in the middle of saving him?

77
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,440
Hey,

78
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,000
I didn't leave you.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,880
You were thirsty.

80
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,600
I went to get you water.

81
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,160
I didn't have money,

82
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,600
so I had to
get a glass of water for you.

83
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,800
But when I was back with water,

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,280
you were no longer there.

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,360
It wasn't long after you left

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
that my dad found me.

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,600
But I was in a coma.

88
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,720
When I woke up,

89
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,160
I told them a little girl saved me.

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,160
But they said
there wasn't a little girl.

91
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,120
It must be my illusion.

92
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,240
It took me great effort to save you

93
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,040
and you said I was an illusion?

94
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,680
I don't think you're an illusion.

95
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,480
So I've asked people
to look for you all the time.

96
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,480
It happened many years ago.

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,800
I really didn't remember
the location of the factory.

98
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,360
Then I got sick.

99
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,480
I was

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,040
going to look for you myself

101
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,600
after the birthday party.

102
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,360
So,

103
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,480
it's me you've been looking for?

104
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,240
Or who is it?

105
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,720
I thought it was Miss Xiang.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Why would I look for her?

107
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,920
I only want to avoid her.

108
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,480
You've been looking for me
all these years

109
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
without giving up.

110
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,040
Are you so persistent?

111
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,440
The food.

112
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,600
Mom, we're back.

113
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,280
What took you so long?

114
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,920
Mom,

115
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,680
do you remember that I told you

116
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,480
I saved a little boy when I was little?

117
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,680
Guess who he is.

118
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,040
Han Qilu!

119
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,680
I saved Han Qilu.

120
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,920
What

121
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,480
a coincidence!

122
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,800
Mom, what's wrong?

123
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
I...

124
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,000
Chuxia,

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,360
that day you ran home happily,

126
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,440
telling me that

127
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
you saved a little boy

128
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,680
in the abandoned factory.

129
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,600
I didn't disbelieve you.

130
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
I was afraid of getting into trouble,

131
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,920
so I...

132
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,880
So you lied to me that
you didn't believe it

133
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,040
and you didn't let me tell anyone.

134
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,240
Do you know

135
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,040
who kidnapped me?

136
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,600
She was a coworker of mine.

137
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,160
That year,

138
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,680
the Han Family suddenly
decided to close the factory.

139
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,240
There should be

140
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,720
redundancy money,

141
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,120
but none of the workers

142
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,680
got a penny.

143
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,680
She was unlucky.

144
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,480
She couldn't find a job.

145
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,600
Her husband

146
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
demanded to divorce her

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,040
and took their

148
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,600
only son.

149
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,680
She then had

150
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,240
a mental breakdown.

151
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
So, all the workers knew that

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,720
I was kidnapped.

153
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,800
We didn't know.

154
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,600
We really didn't know.

155
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,360
She talked nonsense all day.

156
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,360
Then she suddenly told us

157
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,240
she kidnapped the son
of the Han Family.

158
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,480
We thought it was nonsense.

159
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,680
Then we contacted
the neighborhood committee

160
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
and had her sent to an asylum.

161
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,600
Since no one believed that

162
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
I was kidnapped,

163
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,040
after she

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,600
was sent to the asylum,

165
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,040
I was trapped in the factory
for a long time

166
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,560
till Chuxia found me.

167
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,080
I remember when I was young,

168
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,640
my family closed the factory

169
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,080
to optimize the industrial structure.

170
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,240
My family

171
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,560
must have paid a large amount of

172
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,880
redundancy money.

173
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
But we really didn't...

174
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,640
Auntie,

175
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,760
I'm not questioning you.

176
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,880
What I want to say is,

177
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,680
I'll find out what happened

178
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,440
and give you

179
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,520
and your coworkers an explanation.

180
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,560
If you can find out the truth,

181
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,520
that would be great.

182
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,560
That's what I should do.

183
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,200
Wait.

184
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,200
Could you tell me

185
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,560
when Qilu

186
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,920
comes back?

187
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,480
Our Qilu,

188
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,680
as you know,

189
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,480
always goes his own way.

190
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,080
When he goes out,

191
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,480
when he comes back,

192
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,560
no one can tell exactly.

193
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,080
Then you should know where he went.

194
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,160
I really don't know.

195
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,720
Why don't you

196
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,960
go home first?

197
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
When he gets home,

198
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,840
I'll call you.

199
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,440
No, thanks.

200
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,960
I'd rather wait for him here.

201
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,560
Anyway, Qilu

202
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,840
has to come home eventually.

203
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,920
You're right.

204
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,840
Qilu will definitely come home.

205
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,200
But I'm not sure

206
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,360
when it is.

207
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,320
Come.

208
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,200
Auntie.

209
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,840
Anyway,

210
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,040
you want to wait for him.

211
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,960
We may as well

212
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,320
have a look at his photos.

213
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,080
OK.

214
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
I took these all by myself.

215
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,680
Really?

216
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,080
Look.

217
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,440
Qilu is so handsome.

218
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,080
These were taken

219
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,680
when Qilu and Chuxia

220
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,360
practiced waltz.

221
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,440
These were taken

222
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,080
when they were hanging out

223
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,280
at the beach.

224
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,960
They look so sweet together.

225
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,080
Don't you think
my camera techniques are good?

226
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Of course, you have good skills.

227
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,320
I'm flattered.

228
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,960
It's mainly because

229
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,160
they're pretty.

230
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,960
Don't you think so?

231
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,080
It's getting late.

232
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
Do you still want to wait here?

233
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,320
Auntie,

234
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,720
I don't

235
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,320
have any plans for today.

236
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,160
So I'm

237
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,960
going to sit here

238
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,080
waiting for Qilu.

239
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,600
OK, let's continue our little chat.

240
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,080
OK.

241
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,080
Look.

242
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,160
Look at them.

243
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Great.

244
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
In my mom's mind,

245
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,840
you're now a Bodhisattva
that saves people from distress.

246
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,800
That's exaggerated.

247
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,720
I only want to
give everyone an explanation.

248
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,680
Han Qilu,

249
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,360
aren't you afraid of
falling out with your family?

250
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,200
I don't think

251
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,440
my father knew about this.

252
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,440
The Xiang Family
must have played tricks.

253
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,560
But the Xiang Family...

254
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,320
You still have an engagement
to their daughter.

255
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,200
Will you still walk with me?

256
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,680
I have to go home.

257
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,720
Hello.

258
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,960
It's me.

259
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,720
I want you to look into

260
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,480
the fabric factory
that was closed down 14 years ago.

261
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,800
Focus on the money flow

262
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,960
and the finance of the Xiang Family.

263
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,320
