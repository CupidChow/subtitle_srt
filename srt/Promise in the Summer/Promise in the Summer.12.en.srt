3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,760
I remember clearly

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,760
my costume was here.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,120
Why can't I find it?

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,080
It's too late, Chuxia.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,680
The show is about to begin.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,360
Go ahead. Go.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,960
I'll look for it again.

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,120
Why hasn't he come up yet?

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,440
Doesn't this Cinderella

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,880
get a prince?

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,200
It's a bit embarrassing.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,880
Would she be the first Cinderella

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,040
that is left on stage by a prince?

16
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:11,810
Who is she waiting for?

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,560
So embarrassing.

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,560
He's so cute!

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,040
Yeah.

20
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,400
Wow!

21
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,080
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

22
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
What should you do if I don't?

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,640
Well done,

24
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,320
Cinderella.

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,320
Look,

26
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,680
they dance so well.

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,400
Chuxia's prince

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
finally came.

29
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,160
Great!

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,240
Seriously?

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Though we had a little problem

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,240
before the show began last night,

33
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,960
luckily,

34
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,480
we were more scared than hurt.

35
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,760
The show went smoothly.

36
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,280
No one knew that Han Qilu

37
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,880
went onstage
as a last-minute understudy.

38
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,200
They all praised him

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,400
and said that

40
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,680
he was the real

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,600
Prince Charming.

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,840
Eek.

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,320
Aren't you happy?

44
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,760
Should I be happy?

45
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,360
Xiwei,

46
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,640
you shouldn't leave the bed.

47
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,840
Xiwei,

48
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,920
you...

49
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,080
Xiwei, be careful.

50
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,000
Why?

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,040
Lunatic.

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,160
Don't go.

53
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,720
How many times have I told you?

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,080
Don't touch me.

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,160
Why An Chuxia can touch you

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,040
but I can't?

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,680
Is she really better than me?

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,400
Tell me!

59
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,040
Xiwei.

60
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Don't touch me!

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,680
Let's go back to the infirmary.

62
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,560
Fortunately,

63
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,800
the injury isn't aggravated.

64
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,360
Where on earth

65
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,600
can't I compare with that An Chuxia?

66
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,400
It's OK if it was anyone else.

67
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,320
Why must he choose

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,760
that useless An Chuxia?

69
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,280
Do you also think
An Chuxia is better than me?

70
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,120
Xiwei,

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,920
when it comes to love,

72
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,080
we can only say like or dislike,

73
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,600
not good or bad.

74
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,520
If he likes someone

75
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,560
only because she is good,

76
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,200
do you still think the feeling is pure?

77
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,040
But I like Han Qilu!

78
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,240
I know.

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,880
Chenchuan,

80
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,040
if you fall for someone

81
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,640
who will never like you,

82
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,360
what would you do?

83
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,440
What's wrong?

84
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,440
Nothing.

85
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,160
I know

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,240
I'm the dumbest.

87
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,560
I fall for someone

88
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,000
who will never like me.

89
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,480
Xiwei,

90
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,240
do you want an answer

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,480
to the question you just asked me?

92
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,640
Then come to my bakery

93
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,480
when you recover.

94
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,680
I'll tell you.

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,520
Honey,

96
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,080
look.

97
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
Don't you think I'm good at photography?

98
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,760
It's too much, isn't it?

99
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,960
What's too much?

100
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
After all, Qilu and the daughter
of the Xiang Family...

101
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,680
Do you have to remind me?

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,800
I finally had a good time.

103
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
Must you...

104
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,280
Buzz kill.

105
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,480
Qilu,

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,720
I have a surprise for you.

107
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,680
Look.

108
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,680
How do you like them?

109
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,960
Are they good?

110
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,600
Savorless guy.

111
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,680
Chuxia,

112
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,640
look,

113
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,600
which one do you like?

114
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,440
I'll enlarge it,

115
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,640
have it framed and put it in your room.

116
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,520
No, Auntie.

117
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,840
Don't bother.

118
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,600
The photos are great.

119
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,320
She's too shy.

120
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,800
When I was cleaning the backstage,

121
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
I found Chuxia's

122
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,600
notebook.

123
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,760
Please give it to her.

124
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,360
I'm in a hurry to visit Xiwei.

125
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,440
Chenchuan.

126
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,360
Hello.

127
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
Could you tell me

128
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,320
the answer now?

129
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,920
What answer?

130
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,160
The answer to my question.

131
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
If you fall for someone

132
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,880
who will never like you,

133
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,840
what would you do?

134
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,200
Me?

135
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,240
I'll choose to

136
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,120
win her back

137
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,800
no matter what it takes.

138
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,840
I was kidding.

139
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,760
Come. Sit down.

140
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,280
I'm gonna find you the answer.

141
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,440
Here's the answer.

142
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,600
Rainbow cake?

143
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,040
Try it.

144
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,520
Don't worry.

145
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,200
It's made of margarin.

146
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,240
You won't put on weight.

147
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,640
And it's your favorite

148
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,440
lime flavor.

149
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,440
In fact,

150
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,840
my real answer is,

151
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll choose to accompany her quietly.

152
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,080
I want her to be happy.

153
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,600
I'll remember her joys and sorrows.

154
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,880
Of course,

155
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,720
I don't want her

156
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,920
to be sad

157
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,480
or upset,

158
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,600
so,

159
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,760
I'll make her

160
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,000
the rainbow cake she likes.

161
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,520
I...

162
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,440
Don't say anything like "I'm sorry",

163
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,600
or "I feel bad".

164
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,280
Don't you think

165
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,320
it's unfair?

166
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,080
I took the liberty to like you.

167
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,520
It has nothing to do with fairness.

168
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,720
As far as fairness is concerned,

169
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,600
if I demand you to like me

170
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,320
just because I like you,

171
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,640
it would be unfair to you.

172
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,040
Chenchuan,

173
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,240
you're more reasonable than me,

174
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,120
but I...

175
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,640
It's OK.

176
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,120
You don't have to do anything.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,240
You don't get it.

178
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm just thinking,

179
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720
maybe I should think it over

180
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
about what I really want.

181
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
So,

182
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,640
