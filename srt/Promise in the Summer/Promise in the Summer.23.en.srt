=Episode 23=

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,600
(Every girl)

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,720
(must have fantasized about)

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,000
(being with her Prince Charming)

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,080
(forever.)

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,000
(At their leisure,
they would bask in the sun)

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,240
(and walk along the beach.)

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,120
(But in real life,)

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,280
(before she gets a chance
with the prince,)

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,000
(she becomes his sister first.)

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,360
Chuxia,

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,200
sweetheart.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,760
Auntie,

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,160
I'm so sleepy.

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,120
What did you call me?

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,480
Godmother.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,920
(Fortunately,)

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,840
(my mom was sent to
the best nursing home,)

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,800
(and I've got one more loving mom.)

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,640
(Unfortunately,)

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,680
(from horse riding to fencing,)

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,080
(from cooking to flower arrangement,)

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,520
(the courses that didn't belong to me)

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,090
(occupied my summer vacation
one by one.)

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
So pretty.

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,600
Chuxia,

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,880
Mommy

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
promised your mom

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,160
to cultivate you

31
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,400
into the best girl.

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,520
When school starts,

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,600
let's see who dares to say

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,680
you are not worthy of Qilu again.

35
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
Qilu will be the one

36
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,960
not worthy of you.

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,520
Today,

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,400
you'll learn flower arrangement first.

39
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,120
In the afternoon,

40
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,400
you'll learn etiquette.

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,040
At night,

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,960
you'll...

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,760
Godmother, Godmother,

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,600
may I take a day off?

45
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,520
No.

46
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,400
Doesn't the food agree with you?

47
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,520
The food doesn't matter,

48
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,680
but the person who eats it does.

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,600
Ever since your mom

50
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,680
had Chuxia,

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,680
she doesn't

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,960
care about her husband at all.

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,160
Ever since Chuxia
hung around with my mom,

54
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,680
she doesn't care about
her boyfriend at all.

55
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,960
Your future wife

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,120
has stolen my wife.

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,880
You didn't discipline your wife well,

58
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,320
you should review yourself.

59
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,600
You brat,

60
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,880
how could you talk to Dad like that?

61
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,000
Dad,

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,080
I have an idea.

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,240
Flower arrangement is like the way

64
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,800
people conduct themselves.

65
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,960
It's about seizing chance
and borrowing strength.

66
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,240
One tree does not make a forest.

67
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,800
One flower can not be thriving.

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,960
You can look over more

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
traditional ink paintings

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,960
and feel their artistic conception.

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,920
Chuxia, sweetheart,

72
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,640
come on.

73
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,120
For Qilu,

74
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll study hard!

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,520
Mom.

76
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,240
What?

77
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,720
What's the fuss about?

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,440
Dad is sick.

79
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,200
He's in hospital.

80
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,680
What should I do?

81
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,400
Go and check on him.

82
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,960
Chuxia,

83
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,360
I can't accompany you anymore.

84
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,960
I have to go.

85
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,440
Be safe, Mom.

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,960
Miss,

87
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
my mom is busy today.

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,280
Shall we call it a day?

89
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
OK, then.

90
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,920
Thank you, Miss.

91
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,400
Thank you.

92
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,400
What's wrong with uncle?

93
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Let's go visit him.

94
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:35,960
Nothing.

95
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,430
Anxiety.

96
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,010
Don't worry about him.

97
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,440
You monopolize my mom every day.

98
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,120
He's jealous.

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,960
Above all,

100
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
you asked me for help.

101
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,680
So I have to help you.

102
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
But your move is mean.

103
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,680
Anyway, you should think about

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,080
how to repay me.

105
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,120
Then,

106
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
I'll make you something delicious.

107
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,120
Really?

108
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,640
I can do it.

109
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,360
Go.

110
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,200
Really?

111
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,090
Come on.

112
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,120
Are you sure?

113
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,640
What do you mean?

114
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,520
It's really good.

115
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,280
You didn't take cooking lessons

116
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,120
in vain.

117
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
But

118
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,880
I don't think

119
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
this is good enough.

120
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,440
This needs a bit more soy sauce.

121
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,640
This doesn't look very nice.

122
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,680
This seems to be

123
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,520
a little oily.

124
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,080
Are you tired?

125
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,080
I must learn everything well

126
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,760
in case I would disgrace the family.

127
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,760
Actually, you don't have to do this.

128
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,200
You were

129
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,000
good enough before.

130
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,080
Han Qilu,

131
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,520
are you confessing to me?

132
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,680
But

133
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,640
this dish is really a bit oily.

134
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,400
A bit oily?

135
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,560
Let me see

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,080
which piece is oily.

137
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,680
This piece is the oiliest,

138
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,400
right?

139
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,520
Oily?

140
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,300
(Slide)

141
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm here

142
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,640
to say goodbye to you.

143
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,320
You don't need to say goodbye
to anyone here.

144
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,520
An Chuxia,

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,880
I'm sorry.

146
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,200
It doesn't matter, Miss Xiang.

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,080
Now,

148
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,880
I've started to envy you.

149
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,880
Qi...

150
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,320
Han Qilu,

151
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,560
I'm going abroad.

152
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,640
I wish you happy.

153
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,240
Thanks.

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,960
She left the door open.

155
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,120
Have they solved their problems?

156
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,440
I forgot to tell you that

157
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,000
her dad

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,080
paid the redundancy money

159
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,120
back to the workers

160
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
with interest.

161
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,080
So everything is OK now.

162
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,880
Actually, I think she's pitiful.

163
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,200
She is pitiful?

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,320
I'm more pitiful, OK?

165
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Why are you pitiful?

166
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,840
You fed me a mouthful of chili.

167
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,760
Don't you think I'm pitiful?

168
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
What should I do?

169
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,440
What should you do?

170
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,400
I'll shell a shrimp for you.

171
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,520
