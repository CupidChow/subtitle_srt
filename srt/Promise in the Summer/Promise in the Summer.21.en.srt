00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,860
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,880
Qilu,

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,280
you're finally home.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,120
I've been waiting for you all day.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,480
Is there anything
that makes you unhappy?

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,040
Or

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,800
did I do anything wrong?

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
It's getting late.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Go home.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,040
No.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,560
Whatever.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,000
Qilu,

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
I don't understand

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,880
why you've been so cold to me.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,080
Don't forget

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,120
we have an engagement.

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,800
Then let me tell you right now,

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,080
the engagement is canceled.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,840
Why?

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,200
Our marriage was

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
contracted by my dad and your dad

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,280
over ten years ago.

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,760
You don't get to cancel it at will.

25
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,440
To break off the engagement
is my own choice.

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,240
It has nothing to do

27
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,640
with your dad or my dad.

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,240
I tell you what,

29
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,200
I know exactly

30
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,720
who I'm going to spend my life with.

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
That person

32
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,200
isn't you.

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,200
You...

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm on Qilu's side.

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,400
As Han Qilu's mother,

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,880
I agree to call off the engagement.

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,720
We're in modern times.

38
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,080
A marriage contract is ridiculous.

39
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,640
My son

40
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,720
has the right to love anyone.

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,200
You're such bullies.

42
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,720
Bullies?

43
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,920
You won't have the guts to say that

44
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,560
after I find out the truth.

45
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,920
What truth?

46
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Miss Xiang,

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,000
it's getting late.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,800
Please go home.

49
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,560
You'll regret it.

50
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Absurd!

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,000
I told you early that

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,720
I wouldn't accept
such a ridiculous marriage.

53
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,560
I'll choose the one

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,800
I'm going to marry.

55
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,080
Even though you're my father,

56
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,920
you can't arrange my life.

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,160
Are you trying to piss me off?

58
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,640
Would I do any harm to you?

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,800
We and the Xiang Family

60
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,640
share weal and woe.

61
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
Marrying Miss Xiang

62
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,720
is your best choice.

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
If

64
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,160
the family is dirty...

65
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,360
What did you say?

66
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,880
Have you never suspected them?

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,760
Regarding the layoffs
of the fabric factory back then,

68
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,440
I suspect that

69
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,400
they pocketed
the workers' redundancy money.

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,560
Do you have any evidence?

71
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,400
Not now.

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,480
Don't accuse people

73
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,720
without evidence.

74
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,840
But if I find evidence

75
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,280
against them,

76
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,720
you must

77
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,960
cancel the engagement.

78
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,440
As long as you can find

79
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,960
the evidence and prove that

80
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,440
the family is really dirty,

81
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,720
I'll call off the engagement.

82
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,440
Then,

83
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
I'll never interfere in your affairs.

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
An Chuxia

85
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,880
was An Qilu's personal assistant

86
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,440
hired by Mrs. Han.

87
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,040
I don't know why

88
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,400
she would hire her.

89
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,960
But I know that

90
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,160
before An Chuxia
worked as the personal assistant,

91
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,480
she had been doing odd jobs

92
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,120
to make medical expenses for her mother.

93
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,160
And then?

94
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,880
Mrs Han seems to like her very much.

95
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,480
She not only offered her a high salary

96
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,040
but also arranged
her mother's transplant.

97
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,040
What about Qilu?

98
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,240
What's his attitude to her?

99
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,000
It's said that

100
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Han Qilu treats her like she's special.

101
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,760
They used to be

102
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,040
inseparable at school and

103
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
hardly separated by more than a meter.

104
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,600
Have you got anything else?

105
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,240
I've got her address.

106
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,600
She should be living at home

107
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,720
after she moved out of Han's house.

108
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,160
Let's go and check.

109
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,960
Chuxia,

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,440
tell Mom the truth.

111
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
You and Qilu

112
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,680
really...

113
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,480
Mom,

114
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,440
I've told you many times.

115
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,160
His mom was my boss.

116
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,720
But your relationship,

117
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,000
I think...

118
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,600
Mom isn't trying to
interfere in your personal life.

119
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,760
Qilu is a good kid.

120
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
But with the great gap

121
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
between us and them,

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm worried that...

123
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,560
Mom, you really think too much.

124
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,160
Han Qilu and I

125
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,720
are just friends.

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,040
I'll get the door.

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,040
Why are you here?

128
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,440
I need your mom's help.

129
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Fortunately, we've never moved.

130
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
So I still have most of

131
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,040
the notes and receipts.

132
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,240
On paydays those years,

133
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,000
we would go to the finance to sign

134
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and get our salary slips.

135
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,040
Apart from these,

136
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,720
do you still have the contact way
of your former coworkers?

137
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,480
This is the address book.

138
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,280
Back then,

139
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,120
not everyone had a cell phone.

140
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,920
So the factory

141
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,160
had an address book.

142
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,800
But I don't know

143
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,480
if the phone numbers are still valid.

144
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,360
Auntie,

145
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,600
can I borrow the address book?

146
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Of course.

147
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,120
I don't know if I'm helpful.

148
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,040
You did great.

149
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,720
Thank you.

150
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
I think

151
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,880
if we find the treasurer,

152
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,120
we can take him as a breakthrough.

153
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,120
Then we should be able to
testify against the Xiang Family.

154
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,360
You mean the Liang Family?

155
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,240
They moved about eight years ago.

156
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,920
Can you get in touch with them?

157
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,880
I can't.

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Qingyue,

159
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,120
do you remember me?

160
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,920
I'm Chuxia.

161
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
An Chuxia?

162
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,120
Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,280
You remember me?

164
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,880
What can I do for you?

165
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,800
I want to know

166
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,240
if your mom can get in touch with

167
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,480
Mr. Liang, the treasurer of the factory.

168
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,920
It's been three years since my mom died.

169
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,680
We're like

170
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
looking for a needle in a haystack.

171
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,480
Alright,

172
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
let's split up.

173
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,480
If you get any news,

174
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,440
call me immediately.

175
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,440
OK.

176
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,160
No matter what,

177
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,040
see you at your door

178
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
at nine tonight.

179
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,920
Do they live here?

180
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,680
Yes.

181
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,600
But one of her neighbors told me

182
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,120
she left with a guy
early in the morning.

183
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,720
That must be Qilu.

184
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Judging by the description,

185
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
it should be Han Qilu.

186
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,120
An Chuxia.

187
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,540
(Open)

188
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,160
Excuse me,

189
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
are you Liang Baisheng?

190
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,360
You are...

191
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,920
My family ran the
fabric factory before.

192
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,920
What can I do for you?

193
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,120
I want some information.

194
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,160
What happened to the redundancy money
paid by the Han Family?

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,920
You were the treasurer.

196
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,120
I don't believe
you don't have an account book.

197
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,280
It has been ages.

198
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,680
Those are old stories.

199
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,440
Why would I keep an account book?

200
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,120
If you didn't keep one,

201
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,920
weren't you afraid that the Xiang Family
would kick down the ladder?

202
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,680
My time is limited.

203
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,880
If you give me the account book,

204
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,360
I'll get you out of it unscathed.

205
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,720
My phone is just dead at this moment.

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,400
I wonder if Han Qilu finds Mr. Liang.

207
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,080
It's me.

208
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,840
You scared me.

209
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,480
Why did you follow me stealthily?

210
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,840
What do you mean by "stealthily"?

211
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,720
I couldn't get through to you.

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,960
I was worried about you.

213
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm sorry.

214
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,160
My phone is out of power.

215
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,720
I've been on the phone all day long.

216
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,800
So...

217
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,360
I found him,

218
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,600
and,

219
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,160
I got the account book.

220
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,280
You're awesome, Han Qilu!

221
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,400
I checked the account book.

222
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,240
The Xiang Family

223
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,040
really pocketed the money.

224
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,400
Take the account book home

225
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
and show it to your dad.

226
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,040
No rush.

227
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,600
You're almost home.

228
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,480
I'll walk you home first.

229
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,160
My home is right ahead.

230
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
It's close enough.

231
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,040
Go home quickly.

232
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,640
Show it to your dad.

233
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,360
Hurry up.

234
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,840
Go.

235
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,720
Go, go ahead.

236
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,920
It's OK.

237
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,240
OK.

238
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,160
Go, go.

239
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,720
Bye.

240
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,200
Han Qilu, you...

241
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,720
How dare you call him by name?

242
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,360
Who are you?

243
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,480
It doesn't matter.

244
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,360
What matters is that I know who you are.

245
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,720
An Chuxia.

246
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,000
What

247
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,080
do you want?

248
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,200
I don't want anything

249
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,000
other than

250
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,320
