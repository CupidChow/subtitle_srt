=Promise in the Summer=

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,860
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,400
I passed my probationary period.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,800
Are you so happy about it?

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,840
Of course.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,920
What if

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,640
I take off my bracelet
and give it to you?

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,520
Really?

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,960
But

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,160
I'm in a bad mood now.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,640
So when you are in a good mood,

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,000
would you...

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,560
Probably.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,040
Demon.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,280
Why don't you give me your bracelet?

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,520
I can stay away from you, then.

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,680
It's a win-win situation.

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,560
What do you say?

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm serious...

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,440
Do you want the bracelet so much?

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,200
Fine.

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,800
From this moment

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,960
to the last class in the afternoon,

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,920
if you can make me feel better,

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,240
I'll give it to you.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:07,920
Does it make you feel bad

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,640
if I sit here?

28
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,440
What do you think?

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,480
I'm leaving now.

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,880
It doesn't seem right.

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,720
He sent me away

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,600
so easily.

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,360
On top of my absence from class,

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,520
I can't finish my daily task of
staying with him

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,280
for more than eight hours.

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,080
No way.

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,880
I have to go back.

38
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,480
According to military tactics,

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,040
knowing the enemy and yourself,

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,200
you can fight without defeat.

41
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,080
Fortunately, the housekeeper
gave me his information in advance.

42
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,680
Han Qilu.

43
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,720
There's so much.

44
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,360
Hey.

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I'm talking to you.

46
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,920
Are you the newcomer?

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
You're good.

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
I had no sooner
left for a couple of days

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,840
than you threw yourself at Han Qilu.

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,200
You misunderstood.

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm not chasing Han Qilu.

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,800
You've collected his information?

53
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,960
It's quite complete.

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,640
It's useless, though.

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,320
I tell you what,

56
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,800
Han Qilu is mine.

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
I'm the only one that's worthy of him.

58
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
There's something wrong

59
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,880
with her, too.

60
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,400
My file.

61
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,160
I almost walked into your trap.

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,720
You don't seem to be very smart.

63
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,880
It takes you two hours to realize it.

64
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,160
That's only because I...

65
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,400
Wait.

66
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,560
She isn't your girlfriend, is she?

67
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,800
She is your girlfriend for real?

68
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,200
I'm in a very bad mood now.

69
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,680
Do you think I'm heartless

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,400
and awful?

71
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
I can give it to you,

72
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,080
but I'd like a piece of Tiramisu now.

73
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:23,920
OK.

74
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Stop.

75
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,680
Did you pick on her?

76
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,040
I didn't.

77
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,520
I didn't want to
make a fuss with you before.

78
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,520
But from now on,

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
please stop running wild.

80
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
Why do you speak for her?

81
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
That's the last thing I would do.

82
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,400
I just hate it

83
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,760
when people mistake you
for my girlfriend.

84
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,960
So you're saying

85
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,200
Mo Xiwei isn't Han Qilu's girlfriend?

86
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,560
Of course not.

87
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,000
How could Han Qilu the Cold Face

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,520
have a girlfriend?

89
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
That doesn't sound right.

90
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
You mean

91
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,440
Mo Xiwei doesn't want Han Qilu,

92
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,800
but I think...

93
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,440
Yes.

94
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,040
Xiwei has been
into him for over two years.

95
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,200
That explains it.

96
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,440
Mo Xiwei

97
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,080
is quite pretty,

98
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,640
only that she is sharp-tongued.

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,520
Xiwei is a little capricious,

100
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,440
but she isn't bad

101
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,720
in nature at all.

102
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,560
You're overly prettifying her.

103
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,760
Your principles are obviously
guided by beauty.

104
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,480
I despise you.

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,040
Shouldn't you leave now?

106
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,680
Yeah.

107
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,320
I have to go.

108
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Bye.

109
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,640
Let me walk with you.

110
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,800
If only Han Qilu is as good-natured

111
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,920
as you!

112
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,800
Do you think it's worth it

113
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,440
to swallow Han Qilu's insult?

114
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,840
Sure.

115
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,520
Mrs Han told me yesterday that

116
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,280
she had found a kidney donor

117
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,880
for my mom.

118
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
When she gets better,

119
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,560
she can receive a transplant.

120
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,400
That's great!

121
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
So,

122
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,160
I'm going to work part-time now.

123
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,880
Anyway, I have both of the bracelets.

124
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm going to make two incomes.

125
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,680
Go!

126
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,080
Go!

127
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,120
Well,

128
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,520
don't waste it
even if you don't like it.

129
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,160
The Tiramisu cakes Chenchuan sells

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,720
are all made of the best materials.

131
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
The step of
softening the cheese alone...

132
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,960
You know it well.

133
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,760
Yeah.

134
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,360
I worked part-time in Chenchuan's shop.

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,040
I have to say,

136
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,080
Chenchuan is the best boss

137
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,280
I've ever had.

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
If you don't want to waste it,

139
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,120
you can stay here and enjoy it.

140
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,920
Did I say anything wrong?

141
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,160
Han Qilu

142
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,840
is a big scoundrel who wastes things.

143
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,680
Draw a circle to curse you

144
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,560
