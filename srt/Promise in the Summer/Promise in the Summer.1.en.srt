=Episode 1=

00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,460
(Zone A1, Rongchuang Building,
Binhai Street, Huangdao District)

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:22,920
They

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,120
look almost the same.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,040
Hello.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,240
(Miss An,)

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,360
(do all the carers in your company)

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,160
(late for their first day of work?)

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,120
I'm so sorry, Mr. Han.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,680
It's hard

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,120
to locate your house.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,840
I'm near

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,920
the south gate now.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,880
(I've sent someone to pick you up.)

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,130
(Please hurry up.)

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,210
(My son is a special case.)

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,120
Don't worry.

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,960
My manager told me everything.

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,200
Hello.

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,640
Are you Mr. Han's housekeeper?

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,640
You are...

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,920
Miss An?

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,040
Sure. Sure.

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,120
Just call me An.

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,160
She looks so young.

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,320
Let's not

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,760
keep the patient waiting.

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,600
Miss An,

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,880
this way, please.

31
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,240
After you.

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,320
This way.

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,240
Miss An,

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,160
this way, please.

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
(Nowadays, are cerebral palsy patients)

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,080
(so handsome?)

37
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,800
Qilu.

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,400
This is Miss An.

39
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
Qilu is

40
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,360
a little special.

41
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm sorry to trouble you.

42
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,840
It's my job.

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,720
So, I'll

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,920
leave it to you.

45
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,680
Yeah.

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,080
Hello.

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,320
Don't worry.

48
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,920
No matter how special you are,

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll take good care of you.

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,120
Ma'am,

51
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,680
don't worry.

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,640
Miss An is a psychologist

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,960
specially hired by Mr. Han from abroad.

54
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,680
I'm sure she can help Qilu.

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,400
I hope so.

56
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
What are you doing?

57
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,440
Catheterize you.

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,480
Are you sick?

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,400
Clumsy and uncoordinated.

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,520
Definitely cerebral palsy.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,160
Well, Qilu,

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,440
you're the sick one.

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,240
Don't worry.

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,960
Don't come over.

65
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,400
Qilu, be a good boy.

66
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,160
We've received

67
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,840
professional training.

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,000
Come.

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,560
Don't!

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Come.

71
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,020
(What are you doing?)

72
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
What's the noise?

73
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,400
It may be

74
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,560
some special treatment.

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,310
(Stop there.)

76
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,060
(Don't come over. I'm warning you!)

77
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,060
(Take it easy.)

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
I don't want to be disappointed again

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,640
after all that hope.

80
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,120
As a mother,

81
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,080
I haven't stroked

82
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,040
my own son for over ten years.

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,840
Hello.

84
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,000
Hello.

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
You're...

86
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,080
Mr. Han Liuhai invited me over.

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,960
This is my card.

88
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,960
Dr. An.

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,880
Are you Miss An?

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,600
Oh, dear!

91
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't run.

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,120
Help!

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,400
Come here.

94
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,040
Qilu!

95
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,800
Qilu, are you OK?

96
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,160
Mom.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,120
Qilu.

99
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,760
Hello, sir.

100
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,160
(An Chuxia,)

101
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,640
(what the hell are you doing?)

102
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,800
(The patient with severe cerebral palsy
hasn't seen you yet.)

103
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,920
(They called and complained to me.)

104
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,440
(You are fired.)

105
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,040
You don't have cerebral palsy?

106
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,960
No, no, no.

107
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,040
I don't mean to curse you.

108
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,480
I mean he isn't sick.

109
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,160
That's not what I mean.

110
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,120
Mrs Han,

111
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,600
may I have a word with you?

112
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,800
Yeah, sure.

113
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,080
That girl

114
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,520
is able to cure your son.

115
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
What do you mean?

116
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,520
I think

117
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,720
it may be helpful.

118
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,840
Your son

119
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
suffers from skin allergies

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,760
as long as he comes into contact
with women

121
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,080
due to the accident in his childhood.

122
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,400
But, look,

123
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,840
the girl over there...

124
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,320
She kissed Qilu

125
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,160
without causing any allergy.

126
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,080
So,

127
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,280
I want to use her as a medium

128
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,840
of systematic desensitization treatment

129
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,360
for your son.

130
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,840
I see.

131
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,160
This is...

132
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,400
Chuxia,

133
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
I have

134
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
inquired about you.

135
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,600
Your mom is ill.

136
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm so sorry.

137
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,480
You could have come at me.

138
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,960
Why did you tell my mom?

139
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Silly girl.

140
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,240
You misunderstood.

141
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
I'm making you an offer.

142
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,400
Offer?

143
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,800
Yeah.

144
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,040
I'll pay for your mom's treatment.

145
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,720
You

146
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,960
can help with my son's treatment.

147
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,520
What do you say?

148
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,160
I'll pay you

149
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,960
a regular daily wage.

150
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,040
Are you kidding me?

151
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,000
I've transferred your mom

152
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
to a private room.

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,760
Moreover,

154
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,360
you can study with my son

155
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,560
and continue your education.

156
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,580
(Treatment Contract
(Non-disclosure Agreement))

157
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,000
I disagree.

158
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,200
I just want her

159
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,000
to get out of here

160
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,680
immediately.

161
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,000
Qilu,

162
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,960
do you want Mom to kneel down
and beg you?

163
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,320
Fine.

164
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
I'll do it.

165
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,440
Ma'am,

166
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,720
you mustn't do that, Ma'am.

167
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,840
Qilu,

168
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,920
do you have the heart to
see your mom suffer?

169
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,600
Whatever.

170
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,800
This is

171
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,640
an intelligent detection bracelet.

172
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,360
It can record the time
you spend together

173
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,720
and the distance between you.

174
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,240
From today,

175
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,480
you should keep a distance

176
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,680
(Connected)
from each other within one meter

177
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,040
for more than eight hours every day.
