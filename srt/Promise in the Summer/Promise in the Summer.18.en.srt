00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,860
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,920
Red dress?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,960
Do I really have to wear a red dress

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,880
to Han Qilu's birthday party?

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,360
Isn't red a little flashy?

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,200
Where can I find

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,120
a red dress?

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,000
Chuxia, are you there?

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,680
Auntie, come in, please.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,680
Chuxia, look.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,440
Today,

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,640
I saw this

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,360
when I was shopping.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,480
I thought it fit you well.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,120
I really have good taste.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,240
It's beautiful, indeed.

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,840
Auntie, I can't accept this.

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,000
Why can't you?

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,000
You've cured Qilu.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,880
The dress is a token of my gratitude.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,960
If you don't accept it,

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,640
I'll think

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,320
my thank-you gift is turned down.

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,960
No.

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,360
That's not what I mean, Auntie.

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,280
Then you should accept it.

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,280
Bye.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,880
What a coincidence.

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,440
Ma'am.

31
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:31,960
Hush.

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,320
Keep your voice down.

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,600
Ma'am, how was it going?

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,000
I made Chuxia accept it.

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,440
But I was a little nervous.

36
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,760
I don't know if I did well.

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,440
Qilu is too proud.

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,160
I don't know who he is like.

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,200
Like me.

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Like Mr. Han.

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,120
He wouldn't give Chuxia
the dress directly,

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,600
instead, he had to keep it back from her

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
and make me do it.

44
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,520
Qilu might feel embarrassed.

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,520
Anyway,

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,120
I've done my part.

47
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,840
As for the rest,

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,960
he is on his own.

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,360
(After the party,)

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,440
(Han Qilu should go to Xiang Mankui.)

51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,400
What am I doing?

52
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
An Chuxia,

53
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,760
you have a conscience after all.

54
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,480
Mr. Han,

55
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,080
you're awesome.

56
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,160
Of course.

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,880
I'm a capable housekeeper.

58
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,720
Do you need a hand?

59
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,320
No, no, no.

60
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,520
Chuxia,

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,280
you look beautiful in that dress.

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,720
Really?

63
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,480
Qilu must like it.

64
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,640
Well, let me give you a hand.

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,320
OK, then.

66
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Put it here.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,720
Congratulations.

68
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,320
OK. OK.

69
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,200
Thank you.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,760
I'll see you later.

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,480
OK.

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,880
Hello, Mr. Han.

73
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,720
Hello.

74
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,640
Ma'am, good evening.

75
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,920
Where is Qilu?

76
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,080
I don't know.

77
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,000
Wayward boy.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,880
Maybe he's entertaining
his friends somewhere.

79
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,840
All the guests here
are your business partners.

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,320
People would think

81
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,360
it was your party.

82
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,000
Welcome. Welcome.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,520
Welcome.

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
If I were Qilu,

85
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,360
I wouldn't come either.

86
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,120
Congratulations.

87
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,640
Thanks for your kindness.

88
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,040
How's your business going?

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,880
Ma'am.

90
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,280
Have you seen Chuxia?

91
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,880
Chuxia?

92
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,360
I saw her earlier.

93
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Where is she?

94
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,680
The party will start soon.

95
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
Why hasn't she come yet?

96
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,240
I'll find her later.

97
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,120
Qilu.

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,600
Thanks, man.

99
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,080
No problem.

100
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,200
By the way,

101
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,560
have you seen Chuxia?

102
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,760
She should be in her room.

103
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,920
Xiwei went to find her.

104
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,400
How do you feel?

105
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,080
Nervous?

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't worry.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,920
Everything goes according to plan.

108
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,560
Ma'am,

109
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,200
it's almost time.

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,880
Get started.

111
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,880
Dear friends,

112
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,560
welcome to

113
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,120
Qilu's birthday party.

114
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,880
I now declare

115
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,960
Han Qilu's

116
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,320
20th birthday party

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,560
officially begins!

118
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,000
Now,

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
let's welcome Han Qilu

120
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,320
to give us a speech.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,440
Go for it.

122
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,120
Today

123
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,000
is my 20th birthday.

124
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,840
First, I'd like to thank you for coming.

125
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,600
You may wonder why I'm holding flowers.

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,760
It's a surprise.

127
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,720
You'll find out in a minute.

128
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,800
In fact, today,

129
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,800
I have an announcement to make.

130
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,440
Chuxia is gone.

131
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,560
She isn't in her room.

132
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,880
How come?

133
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,960
Where would she go?

134
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,440
When I went in her room before,

135
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,320
she was still there

136
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,920
and had changed into the dress.

137
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,680
Wait.

138
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,200
Dear friends,

139
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,520
it's a good day today.

140
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,400
Please allow me

141
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
to introduce

142
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
my son's fiancee,

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Miss Xiang Mankui.

144
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Meanwhile,

145
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,000
I'd like to

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,520
announce their engagement.

147
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,640
They will

148
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,240
get married after reaching

149
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,440
the legal age of marriage.

150
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,200
That's weird.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
He was planning to confess yesterday,

152
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
then today, a fiancee
showed up out of thin air.

153
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
Chuxia,

154
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,240
we're very grateful to you

155
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,640
for curing Qilu.

156
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,680
So,

157
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,960
what's your plan next?

158
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,800
Mr. Han,

159
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,960
next, I want to

160
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
take good care of my mom.

161
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Good.

162
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,240
You're a dutiful daughter.

163
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,880
Tonight,

164
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,400
I'll announce the engagement

165
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,120
of Qilu and Miss Xiang.

166
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,840
If Qilu is always

167
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,160
with another girl,

168
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,360
it might be inappropriate.

169
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,800
Mr. Han,

170
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,680
I only stayed here to

171
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,400
help with Qilu's treatment.

172
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,200
Now that he gets well,

173
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,680
I should leave.

174
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,120
I don't want Miss Xiang

175
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,480
to misunderstand.

176
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,560
Is this your birthday gift to Qilu?

177
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,320
Qilu has lived

178
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,920
a carefree life since childhood.

179
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,320
Then suddenly,

180
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,400
he came into contact with
an ordinary person full of vigor.

181
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,080
He would feel curious indeed.

182
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,240
But curiosity

183
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
doesn't last long.

184
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
I understand, Mr. Han.

185
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,920
Thank you.

186
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,680
Qilu,

187
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,520
I didn't expect you

188
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,680
to be so considerate.

189
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,400
You even

190
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,960
prepared roses for me.

191
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,560
I like them very much.

192
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,520
Thank you, Qilu.

193
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,400
Qilu.

194
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,200
Unbelievable.

195
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
