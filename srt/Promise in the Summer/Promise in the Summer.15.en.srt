=Episode 15=

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,960
An Chuxia,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,800
what do you mean?

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,720
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,400
I only packed one mattress.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,280
But I've already figured a way out.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,760
Look,

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,560
I've stuck a division line

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,320
in the middle of the mattress.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,080
I promise,

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,920
tonight,

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,720
I won't cross the line

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,800
at all.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,440
I'll definitely not disturb you.

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,880
We'll see.

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,640
Where are you going?

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,280
The beach.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,800
Wait for me.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,920
So small.

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,920
Though it's small,

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,440
it's very

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,960
overbearing.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,520
Overbearing?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
Just like you.

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,520
Brandishes claws

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,600
and runs amuck.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,080
An Chuxia!

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,320
Hey, don't go.

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,520
So beautiful!

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,480
Make a wish.

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,080
What wish?

33
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,480
I wish Han Qilu will recover soon.

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,800
It's your turn.

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,960
OK!

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,880
That's all?

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,800
Let's

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
take photos.

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,880
I'll take some for you.

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,200
Like this?

41
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,640
Yeah.

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,640
Are these OK?

43
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,160
Let me take yours.

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,440
Turn around.

45
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,960
Two hands.

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,480
Two hands are better.

47
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,360
Are you sure?

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,160
This pose doesn't seem to fit you.

49
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,120
Let's just use one hand.

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,440
This one, then.

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:40,920
OK.

52
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,320
Ready?

53
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,280
One, two, three.

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,920
Isn't it good?

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,280
Let's take a photo together.

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,840
OK.

57
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,040
Is it OK?

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,880
Yeah.

59
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,520
Let me take one more for you.

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,200
That's a good spot.

61
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:18,920
Here?

62
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,000
One, two...

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,120
Is that Mo Xiwei?

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,200
Mo Xiwei?

65
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,520
What is she doing here?

66
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,480
She wouldn't try to...

67
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,600
No.

68
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Hey,

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,000
Mo Xiwei!

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,760
You

71
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,000
also come to see the sea?

72
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,240
No, no, don't move!

73
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,640
Mo Xiwei,

74
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,920
we're classmates.

75
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,520
If you have any problems,

76
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,680
you can tell me.

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,480
I'll help you.

78
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,320
You can't help me with anything.

79
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,800
Don't bother me.

80
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,320
No, no, no.

81
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,400
Don't!

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,920
What are you doing?

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,760
Get up now.

84
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,360
Get up now.

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,000
Let go of...

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,480
Get...

87
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,840
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,280
I thought you took it to heart

89
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
after you were turned down.

90
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,200
Hey,

91
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,040
do you think I'm that kind of person?

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,680
You can't do anything right.

93
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,240
I was going to enjoy a diversion.

94
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,000
In the end,

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm soaked through.

96
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,000
You can wear my clothes.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
Your clothes?

98
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,120
Forget it.

99
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,760
Your clothes are so childish.

100
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,920
Who would wear those?

101
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,440
In that case...

102
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Don't look at me.

103
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,640
I never lend out my clothes.

104
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,560
Then...

105
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,880
Be patient.

106
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,240
Your clothes will be delivered soon.

107
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,280
Go.

108
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,200
Let's go get some drinks.

109
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,080
Go ahead.

110
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,960
Leave the rest to me.

111
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,120
Drinks?

112
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,920
I think we've brought them.

113
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,840
Give them a chance

114
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,600
to have some personal time.

115
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,040
You don't understand.

116
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,240
Apart from that,

117
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,320
there were only two of us before.

118
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,200
Now, there are four people.

119
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,360
We'll need more drinks.

120
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,520
Great.

121
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,920
We'll have a jolly time tonight.

122
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,880
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,360
I forget that you don't like people.

124
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,920
It's OK.

125
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,720
Two people's world is good.

126
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,520
Alright.

127
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,360
The tent is ready.

128
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,680
You sleep in that one.

129
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,360
I sleep in this one.

130
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,040
They...

131
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
I don't care.

132
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,040
Xiwei.

133
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
You don't have to pity me.

134
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,960
I don't pity you.

135
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
I care about you.

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,440
Wait for a minute.

137
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,200
It'll be ready soon.

138
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,080
Don't give her this.

139
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
Xiwei never eats this.

140
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,320
What's wrong?

141
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,560
Isn't it your favorite drink?

142
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,440
You remember it clearly.

143
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,800
An Chuxia,

144
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,760
what's your favorite food?

145
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,360
I...

146
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,000
Just a second.

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Almost done.

148
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,160
She...

149
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,720
What's wrong?

150
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,600
Do me a favor.

151
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,040
Sure.

152
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,400
Why do you have this?

153
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,320
Well,

154
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,960
when I packed things before,

155
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,080
It suddenly occurred me that

156
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
Xiwei was about to have her period.

157
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
You're thoughtful.

158
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Please. Please.

159
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,440
Rest assured.

160
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,760
Do you really like Mo Xiwei?

161
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,160
What do you mean?

162
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,280
Han Qilu,

163
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,960
don't think Xiwei...

164
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,360
I want to know

165
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
what you should do

166
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,440
when you like someone.

167
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,920
You,

168
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,240
Chuxia?

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,240
Han Qilu,

170
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,800
it turns out you need help, too.

171
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,560
Can't you figure it out

172
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,880
with your brilliant mind?

173
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,400
There's nothing you should do.

174
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
When you can't stop yourself

175
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,840
from liking someone,

176
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,080
you can't stop yourself from
caring about her,

177
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,080
remembering everything about her,

178
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,760
or being good to her.

179
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,440
Thanks.

180
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Don't thank me.

181
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,520
Thank Chenchuan.

182
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,320
You don't know

183
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,840
how much he cares about you.

184
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,600
He remembers everything about you,

185
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,200
including...

186
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,360
Anyway, he is very good to you.

187
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,360
I know.

188
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,640
But,

189
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,320
I can't control

190
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,760
my feelings.

191
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,920
I know Han Qilu doesn't like me,

192
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,560
but I still like him.

193
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,840
I also know

194
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,400
Chenchuan has liked me for a long time.

195
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,040
But, before...

196
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,600
What about now?

197
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,400
Now?

198
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Sometimes,

199
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,120
I find him cute.

200
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,080
It seems that Chenchuan's effort

201
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,200
has finally paid off.

202
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,520
Alright.

203
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,760
Let's go.

204
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,520
An Chuxia.

205
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,120
I'm sorry.

206
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
I was...

207
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,040
It's OK.

208
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,000
Never mind.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,320
Go.

210
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,800
Aren't you mad at me?

211
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,520
Alright, alright.

212
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,760
Let's go.

213
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,240
Let's go back.

214
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,720
Don't keep them waiting.

215
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Come on.

216
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,200
Thinking about it,

217
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,000
Chenchuan is quite good.

218
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,360
Not everyone can handle

219
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,920
Mo Xiwei's hot temper.

220
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,440
Actually,

221
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,480
I want to ask you a question.

222
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,000
Well,
