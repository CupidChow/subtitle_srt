00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,760
what is the plan for today?

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,520
We came out without any plan.

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,920
Xiwei,

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,600
is there any place you want to go?

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,160
No.

let's each write a place

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,720
and draw lots to decide where we go.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,240

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,320

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,400
I haven't seen Qilu

106
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,040

107
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,240

108
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,160
My daughter is the best.

109
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,480
He must remember you.

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,600

111
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,640
I'll beat him for you.

112
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,440
You mustn't do that.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,720
After all,

114
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
our families will be

00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,320
Qilu is going to be

117
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,000
my husband.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,920
If you beat him,

119
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,120
he might hate me for that.

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,440
My silly daughter,

121
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,560
rest assured.

122
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
I will grant

123
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
your wishes.

124
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,000
Mankui has been abroad for ten years.

125
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400

that I barely recognize her.

127
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,080
I'm flattered, uncle.

128
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,680
Your praise makes me a bit shy.

129
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,360
By the way,

130
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,440
where is Qilu?

131
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,600
Isn't he

132
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,880
home today?

133
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,040
He...

134
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,840
He isn't home.

135
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,640
He went camping

136
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,440
on the beach with a girl.

137
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,760
Why does Qilu...

138
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,080
She is his assistant,

139
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,240
who takes care of his daily life.

140
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,160
They only took one tent

141
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,640
and one air mattress.

142
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,880
Young people always

143
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,560
forget this and that.

144
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,240
They will buy new ones
when they arrive.

145
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,880
I packed up for him.

146
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,040
Are you dreaming away?

147
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,160
I'm thinking,

148
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,080
you're well now.

149
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
It's great.

150
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,880
They will throw

151
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
a birthday party for me in a few days.

152
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,400
After that,

153
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
I'll go out on a trip.

154
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,160
You can go to school as usual.

155
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,440
Mo Xiwei won't bully you again.

156
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,360
Where are you going?

157
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,160
To find a person.

158
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
An important person?

159
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,280
Very important.

160
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,100
(It must be)

161
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,980
(Miss Xiang,
who has been abroad all the time.)

162
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,880
What are you thinking about?

163
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,560
I'm thinking,

164
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,280
after the trip,

165
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,840
Chenchuan should confess to Xiwei.

166
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,320
What kind of confession

167
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,400
do you think is romantic?

168
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,360
(He)

169
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,880
(is planning to confess to Miss Xiang.)

170
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,360
Forget it. Fool.

171
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,280
Have a glass of water.

172
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,000
Take a break.

173
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,760
I'll send you home later.

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,440
Is there something wrong?

175
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,120
No.

176
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,160
You must be hungry

177
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,040

178
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,520
I'll get a cake for you.

179
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,160
An Chenchuan,

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,880
you looked like this

181
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,320
in the car.

182
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,040
And you said nothing was wrong.

183
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,440
What on earth is wrong with you?

184
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,600
Don't lie to me.

185
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,320
Now,

186
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,640
Han Qilu is well.

187
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,480
And you've made it up with him.

188
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,640
Will you go to him?

189
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,360
Do you still want me to go to him?

190
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,520
