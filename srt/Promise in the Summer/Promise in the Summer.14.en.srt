3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,480
Where is the housekeeper?

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,680
He gets sick today.

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,560
I'll drive.

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,280
What are you doing?

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Get in the car.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,280
Do you regard me as your driver?

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,040
Take the front seat.

10
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,480
Why are you staring at me?

11
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,440
Chuxia,

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
they're ugly.

13
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,800
Don't worry.

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll eat all the

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,080
waste cakes later.

16
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,840
I won't waste them.

17
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,160
What's wrong?

18
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,160
I have a stomachache.

19
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,880
I probably ate too much cake yesterday.

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
It's OK. Drive on,

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,440
or we won't be there

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,360
before dark.

23
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,080
Let's find a place to stay first.

24
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,680
Why are you here?

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,440
Where should I be?

26
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,240
In your own room.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is my room.

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,760
Then where is my room?

29
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,640
This is your room, too.

30
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,040
But there's only one bed.

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,080
This is the only spare room
in the hotel.

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,200
If you don't want to sleep here,

33
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,600
you can sleep in the car.

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,320
So you sleep in the bed,

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,840
and I...

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,680
I'll get another quilt.

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,440
When did you buy this?

38
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,520
When you were in the bathroom.

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,240
Thanks.

40
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,640
I don't want you to disturb me

41
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,440
when I'm sleeping at night.

42
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,800
You're noisy.

43
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,640
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,160
The sofa is a bit hard.

45
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,280
Come up to the bed.

46
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,280
It's inappropriate.

47
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,320
With you making so much noise,

48
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,680
I can't sleep well.

49
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,840
I have to drive tomorrow.

50
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,880
Or do you want to drive?

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,040
I don't have a license.

52
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,960
There you go.

53
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,840
Don't worry.

54
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,240
I won't get close to you.

55
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,280
I'll definitely not.

56
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,000
Noisy.

57
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,960
Have you been kidnapped?

58
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,920
Don't be afraid.

59
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,800
Let me untie the rope for you.

60
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,680
You're so ugly in sleep.

61
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,640
I, I...

62
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,720
I'm going to the bathroom.

63
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,540
(Assistant: Didn't find the girl.)

64
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,040
You mean,

65
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,360
Qilu has been

66
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,280
looking for a little girl
over the last few years?

67
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,280
Qilu seems to think that

68
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
it was a little girl about his age

69
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,600
who saved him.

70
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,200
Could there really be

71
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,600
such a little girl?

72
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,240
But when Qilu

73
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,400
was found that year,

74
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,960
he was alone by the roadside.

75
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,360
The doctor said that

76
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,600
it could be Qilu's illusion

77
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,400
in desperation.

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,680
Sounds right.

79
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,080
If there had really been
such a little girl,

80
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,600
he wouldn't have been like this now.

81
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,220
(Keep looking.)

82
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,440
What's wrong?

83
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,080
Are you unhappy?

84
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,280
I feel that you're a bit down.

85
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,240
An Chuxia,

86
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,160
do you know why I hated you before?

87
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Because

88
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,960
when we first met,

89
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,360
I...

90
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,760
That's not the reason.

91
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,920
Because

92
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,560
I knew from

93
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,480
the first day I saw you

94
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,880
that sooner or later,

95
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,120
you would see through my emotions.

96
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,280
This makes me uncomfortable.

97
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,120
So?

98
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,960
So, nothing.

99
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,360
I'll go pack up,

100
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,960
then we can leave.

101
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,760
So you don't hate me anymore?

102
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
The sea!

103
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,240
Beautiful!

104
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,040
Where do you want to put up the tent?

105
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,560
Over there.

106
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,360
I have a question.

107
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,680
Do you know how to put up a tent?

108
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,720
No.

109
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,760
But I can learn.

110
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,680
I'm a fast learner.

111
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
I don't hold much expectation

112
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,600
on your IQ.

113
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,160
I'll do it.

114
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,680
I can help you to put up the tent

115
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,200
and push the trolley,

116
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,280
right?

117
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,360
Go.

118
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,920
Get down.

119
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,120
I'll push.

120
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,320
I'll push.

121
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,760
Didn't I say you had a low IQ?

122
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,320
But the whole tent

123
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,240
was put up with my help.

124
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,880
I'm going to make the bed.

125
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,600
I remember clearly
I packed two mattresses.

126
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,000
Why is there only one?

127
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Do I have to

128
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,200
share the bed with him again?
