3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,280
Are you engaged?

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,440
Yeah.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,800
We've met each other's parents.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,280
His parents said that

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,920
before we went abroad to study,

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,960
we'd better get married first

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,800
lest he would bully me.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,920
Great.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,080
I envy you so much.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,280
It's supposed to be a blessing.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,920
But why do I feel

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,640
a sense of loss?

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,400
Didn't

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,040
Han Qilu

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,360
say anything to you?

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,000
So far,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,520
he hasn't made a formal confession yet.

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,040
Oh?

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,200
Why don't you

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,440
take the initiative?

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,680
Qilu,

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,320
I've got some great news.

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,080
Weren't you nervous
when you got engaged?

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,800
How did you know?

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,240
Actually,

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,200
I was a little nervous at first.

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,560
But then I figured that

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,480
I finally got the girl

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,080
I had loved for years.

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,360
Why should I be nervous?

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,720
I should be more than happy.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,800
Thanks, buddy.

35
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,640
What for?

36
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
I want to tell you solemnly,

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,200
thanks for being not interested

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,440
in my fiancee before.

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,480
You got engaged

40
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,720
quietly.

41
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,200
You didn't even want to tell us.

42
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:41,920
By the way,

43
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,480
what's your plan with Chuxia?

44
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,720
There's no plan.

45
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,720
We are fine now.

46
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,440
My mom

47
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,480
is focused on raising her daughter.

48
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,840
I work as an intern
in my dad's company,

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,280
expecting to lend him a hand early.

50
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,720
I wasn't talking about that.

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
Then what?

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,840
Chenchuan.

53
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:02,840
Xiwei.

54
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,200
Chenchuan.

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,920
Look,

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,040
this is her wedding dress.

57
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,640
Is it beautiful?

58
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,200
It's OK.

59
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,320
I'll show you another photo.

60
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,240
Do you think our engagement venue

61
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
is romantic?

62
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,360
And this pair of shoes

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,960
is Chenchuan's design.

64
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,960
It needs improvement.

65
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,080
Han Qilu,

66
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,360
don't you know ritual is

67
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,480
very important for a couple?

68
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,920
What does that mean?

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,240
You're so dumb.

70
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,080
Luckily, I fell in love
with Chenchuan in time.

71
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,240
Chenchuan,

72
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,480
I'll go find Chuxia.

73
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,240
Chuxia.

74
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,800
What did I do?

75
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,640
Hopeless.

76
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Han Qilu is hopeless.

77
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,200
Forget it.

78
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,960
I choose to

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
lie flat and go to seed.

80
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Don't give up.

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,480
Pull yourself together.

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,640
I will help you.

83
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
How do you help me?

84
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Help...

85
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,240
Han Qilu!

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,600
Well,

87
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,080
let me tell you what ritual is.

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,480
Ritual...

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,200
I know.

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,480
I know. I know.

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,240
Just let me think about

92
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,520
how to hold the ceremony well.

93
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,640
I have to go.

94
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,600
I haven't told...

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
Dad,

96
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
did you see the housekeeper?

97
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,960
I need his help.

98
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,920
No.

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,640
Son, come.

100
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:50,960
Just in time.

101
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,920
Come on.

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,400
Take a look

103
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,080
with Dad.

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
What present should I give your mom

105
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,480
for our wedding anniversary this year?

106
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,800
You

107
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,280
must have been threatened by my mom.

108
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,520
Chuxia is a good girl.

109
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,960
You must cherish her.

110
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,080
Of course.

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,880
I have to go, Dad.

112
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
I need to see the housekeeper.

113
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,760
OK.

114
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,120
Go to bed early.

115
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,520
Silly boy.

116
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,320
Late bloomer.

117
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,080
I've tried,

118
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,640
but failed.

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
He couldn't get the point.

120
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,880
We didn't succeed either.

121
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,880
I wonder who my son takes after.

122
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,720
He's just so dull.

123
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,880
Why are you looking at me?

124
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,320
Regarding

125
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,440
proposal,

126
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,200
engagement,

127
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,960
wedding,

128
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,120
and anniversaries,

129
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,320
I've never missed any of them.

130
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
I've done all the rituals.

131
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,080
How could you say that?

132
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,760
You forgot this year's
Blue Valentine's Day.

133
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,880
It's OK.

134
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,000
Anyway,

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,880
I like him,

136
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,440
and he likes me.

137
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,320
That's enough.

138
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,000
Confession is just a form.

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,520
It doesn't matter.

140
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,520
Form.

141
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,120
Form.

142
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,320
You did well on today's

143
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,400
dress matching lesson.

144
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,440
You should

145
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,960
wear such dresses more often.

146
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,880
It's really beautiful.

147
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,060
Thanks, Mom.

148
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,760
Go ahead.

149
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,120
Chuxia.

150
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,160
Yeah.

151
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
The first time I met you,

152
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,080
I knew we were meant to be together.

153
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,340
(Countdown)

154
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,880
I wish Han Qilu will recover soon!

155
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,320
I've really fallen in love with you.

156
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,800
Will you marry me?

157
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,480
It's too big.

158
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,880
I like it.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,200
