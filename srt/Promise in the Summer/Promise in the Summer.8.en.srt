3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,200
(These are)

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,320
(almost the same
as the simulated questions.)

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,920
Are you dreaming away?

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,920
Is this the idea you and An Chenchuan

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,880
came up with?

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,520
If you dare
put paper scraps in my hair...

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,200
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,640
My bad.

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,680
Give me.

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,120
Xiwei, I...

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,160
Stop it.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,360
I really don't understand

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,400
what charm she has

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,160
that makes you guys...

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,560
I can't betray my friend.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,160
Chuxia made me a copy
of all the simulated questions

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,480
Han Qilu gave her,

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,960
so...

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,640
Wait.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
Did Han Qilu give An Chuxia
the simulated questions?

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,360
Yes.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,320
An Chuxia.

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,560
Chenchuan, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,480
Well,

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,040
we're friends, aren't we?

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,040
And when you're free,

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,200
you can work part-time

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,040
at my bakery.

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,880
Now I just want to

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,080
figure out

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,080
how to make my bakery

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,000
bigger and more popular.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,680
You got another zero
on the make-up exam.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,200
What can I say?

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,040
Sorry, Miss.

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,520
Don't tell me you don't know
how to do it.

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,600
If you don't,

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,000
how could you avoid
all the correct answers?

41
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,400
Hand in a written self-criticism
this afternoon.

42
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes.

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,320
I know everything.

44
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,080
Though you usually pull a long face,

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,800
I know you are a nice guy.

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,160
This time, for Chenchuan and me,

47
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,440
you...

48
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,080
You think too much.

49
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,920
Is it cool to say yes and mean no?

50
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,600
Can't you be a little sincere?

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,000
How can you...

52
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,680
An Chuxia,

53
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,280
you're really noisy.

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,080
I only realize now that

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,880
Han Qilu isn't a demon at all.

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,960
Instead, he is

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,960
a big coconut that can't be pried open.

58
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,440
Chuxia.

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,200
Auntie.

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,000
I've learned about the make-up exam.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,240
To congratulate you on passing the exam,

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,560
I have a gift for you.

63
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,920
Auntie.

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,840
I'll be very sad if you refuse me.

65
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,800
Above all,

66
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,040
there's a surprise inside.

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,680
But, Auntie,

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,640
I haven't finished

69
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,200
the one-minute task yet.

70
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,840
That,

71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
proceed step by step.

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,280
Have a good rest.

73
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,000
Remember to read the content

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
on the iPad before you go to bed.

75
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,120
Surprise?

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,160
How could Auntie do this?

77
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
Such a photo will easily

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,440
give people a wrong impression.

79
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,960
Eek.

80
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
(I mustn't let Auntie down today.)

81
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,960
Keep your hands away.

82
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,560
My mom pressed you again
to finish the task, didn't she?

83
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,360
No.

84
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,120
I just don't want to let her down.

85
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,440
Xi...

86
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,400
(Can't he sleep well every night?)

87
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,480
Haven't you found any clue?

88
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,480
It's been 14 years after all.

89
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,360
It's hard...

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,040
OK.

91
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,440
Don't

92
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,280
tell my parents about it.

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,440
Yes.

94
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,360
What do you want?

95
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,640
Though I don't know
what happened to you,

96
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,840
I think you're unhappy.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,760
You...

98
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,120
Why do you always

99
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,760
bottle everything up inside?

100
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,240
Why do you stretch yourself so thin?

101
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,240
Let me think

102
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,240
how to make you happy.

103
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,360
There it is.

104
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:36,760
Look.

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,280
Is it cute?

106
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,520
Let's have a contest

107
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,240
and see who will
get bitten by the puppy.

108
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,440
Are you a pupil?

109
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,400
I'll start.

110
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,160
It's your turn.

111
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,760
I'll press it again.

112
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
