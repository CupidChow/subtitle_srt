=Episode 19=

3
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,960
It's so humiliating!

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,240
I can't face anyone again.

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Mankui,

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,360
don't worry.

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,160
Dad will settle this account for you.

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,560
If it doesn't work,

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,880
we can always find you a better man.

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,760
I don't want it.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,520
Except for Qilu,

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,760
I don't want anyone.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,200
OK, OK.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,920
No one else.

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,560
I wonder what Han Qilu

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,640
is playing at.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello?

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,840
You mean,

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,200
Han Qilu did that

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,120
for a girl

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,120
called An Chuxia?

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,120
She has been living with the Han family

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,560
and studying

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,680
in Stilan College?

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,560
Isn't she Han Qilu's

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,120
personal assistant?

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,920
Assistant?

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,960
Would an assistant
go to school with him

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,200
or live together with him?

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,600
Suspend the search for the girl.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,760
Help me find another girl first.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,560
Her name is An Chuxia,

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,680
the same age as me.

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,320
Her mom just had

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,600
a kidney transplant.

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,840
Yeah.

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,040
Hurry up.

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,400
Qilu,

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,960
I'm disappointed in you.

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,560
What can I do to satisfy you?

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,560
Get engaged to Xiang Mankui,

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,120
then get married?

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,200
It was settled early on.

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,960
You settled it.

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,320
What does it have to do with me?

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,120
Listen to yourself.

47
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,480
Did Dad do anything wrong to you?

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,600
You only consider your own feelings.

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,920
Have you ever considered me?

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,840
Our families must unite by marriage.

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,440
Everyone has the right to say that

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,600
except you.

53
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,720
Back then,

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,640
how did you leave me alone

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,440
in school?

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
How was I kidnapped?

57
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,280
That was because...

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,880
Because of

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,080
your career.

60
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,480
Marrying me to Xiang Mankui

61
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,520
is also because of your career.

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,440
Which one of us is selfish?

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,080
Qilu,

64
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,200
don't argue with your dad.

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,640
Mom is on your side.

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,080
Are you looking for Chuxia?

67
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,040
Her mom had the surgery

68
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,200
at the hospital I arranged for her.

69
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,040
Though

70
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,160
she has left the hospital,

71
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,040
she will go back for regular checks.

72
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,880
Maybe you can...

73
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,880
Thanks, Mom.

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,640
Enough.

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,480
Hello.

76
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,920
She isn't in the hospital.

77
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
Chuxia didn't come to school.

78
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,880
Her phone is off.

79
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,720
I asked the students' affairs office.

80
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,360
Your dad

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,640
made her drop out of school.

82
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,880
I didn't like Ann Chuxia
sitting next to you,

83
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,720
but seeing Xiang Mankui

84
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,440
sitting next to you
makes me even more upset.

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,040
Xiwei.

86
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Am I wrong?

87
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,480
Can you bear to see Xiang Mankui

88
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,320
sitting in An Chuxia's seat?

89
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,080
Alright.

90
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,040
Help me to find Chuxia.

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,000
If you find her,

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,040
call me immediately.

93
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,800
Don't worry,

94
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,920
we'll call you as soon as
we get any news.

95
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,800
Qilu,

96
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,760
why didn't you come to...

97
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,480
Did I do anything wrong?

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,760
Why do you ignore me?

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,600
Xiwei,

100
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,040
what's wrong?

101
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,600
I'm thinking about Han Qilu.

102
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,760
Don't be paranoid.

103
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,360
I was just thinking about

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,200
why Han Qilu

105
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
asked me to take care of An Chuxia.

106
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
It was because of Miss Xiang.

107
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Yeah.

108
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,440
Chuxia no longer comes to school.

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:19,920
Yeah.

110
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,760
Where can we find her?

111
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,880
She didn't even

112
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,160
register an address.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
It's weird.

114
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,720
I remember now.

115
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,080
Xiwei,

116
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,520
go back to the bakery with me.

117
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:32,960
Hurry.

118
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,660
I...

119
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,520
(Han Qilu,)

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,920
(I hope)

121
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,400
(you can be cheerful)

122
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
(and happy in future.)

123
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,640
(Don't be so lonely)

124
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640

Hello.

140
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,280
Do you remember

141
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,400
Chuxia worked in my bakery

142
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,720
over a year ago?

143
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,760
Yes.

144
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,520
What's wrong?

145
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,200
I was really thoughtful

146
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,720
to have kept her registration

147
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,840
when she started.

148
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,720
She wrote her address on the form.

149
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,960
I'll send you a picture.

150
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,760
OK, thanks.

151
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,720
Chuxia.

152
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,320
Mom.

153
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,520
What's wrong?

154
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,160
You look mope all day long.

155
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,280
Maybe I've been
overworking recently.

156
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm so sorry.

157
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,400
I've been sick for several years

158
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,840
and I have to rely on you.

159
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Mom, don't say that.

160
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,520
We managed to survive, after all.

161
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,160
You're recovering well

162
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,520
without a rejection reaction.

163
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,200
Thanks to your boss.

164
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,960
She is a good person.

165
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,400
She not only found me a doctor,

166
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,960
but also arranged the transplant.

167
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,600
We must thank her.

168
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,920
Shall we visit...

169
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,320
Mom,

170
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,040
look at the time.

171
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,640
You'd better go to bed.

172
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,400
Don't stay up late.

173
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,520
I'll get the door.

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
How did you find me here?

175
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
My mom is home.

176
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,960
Why,

177
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,080
you still want to avoid me?

178
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,400
No,

179
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,160
my mom is going to...

180
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,640
Chuxia,

181
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840
is this your friend?

182
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,200
No.

183
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,400
No, no, no.

184
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,160
Auntie,

185
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Chuxia worked

186
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,200
for my family before.

187
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,160
He...

188
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,080
He is my boss's son, Mom.

189
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,960
The son of my lifesaver.

190
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,480
Thank your mom so much.

191
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,720
It's late, you...

192
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,960
My car

193
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,160
broke down nearby.

194
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,080
I couldn't get a trailer

195
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,840
or take a taxi.

196
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,080
So I have to...

197
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,440
Chuxia,

198
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,000
they've been a great help to us.

199
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,880
Why don't you even invite him in?

200
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,680
Come in, please.

201
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,680
OK, thanks.

202
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,560
Tell me,

203
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,600
after what he did,

204
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,160
how can I explain to the Xiang Family?

205
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Cancel the engagement.

206
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,480
There's nothing to explain.

207
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,720
Our 20 years of friendship
with the Xiang Family

208
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,480
would just...

209
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Don't involve me.

210
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,120
You have a friendship with them.

211
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
I don't.

212
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,000
Qilu must have learned it from you.

213
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,080
So what?

214
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,240
I look down upon the family anyway.

215
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,320
They do things

216
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,720
by fair means or foul.

217
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Every time when I
bring it up to you,

218
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,000
you are unhappy.

219
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,360
It's getting late.

220
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,240
I'm going to have a beauty sleep.
