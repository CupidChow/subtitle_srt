3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,040
Well,

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,040
I've seen

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,120
all the photos and videos.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,880
In the show the night before yesterday,

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,440
Chuxia, or shall I say Cinderella,

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,040
stood in the center of the stage,

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,080
but her prince had never shown up.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,280
Then, in a flash,

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,880
with a loud sound in the sky,

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,920
Qilu made a brilliant appearance.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,160
I heard that

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,160
when you saw Chuxia
standing helplessly on the stage,

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,880
you went up there to be her prince

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,200
without hesitation.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,840
I just didn't want them to

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,360
mess up the stage play.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,200
I'm full.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,400
Enjoy yourselves.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,960
You...

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Chuxia.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,360
Auntie,

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
he told the truth.

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,320
He didn't do that to help me.

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,040
You're

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,200
being duplicitous.

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,120
No.

29
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,160
He was really trying to

30
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,640
help the drama club.

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,440
What about you?

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,840
I...

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,120
I did that for the club, too.

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,200
Auntie,

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,800
you misunderstood.

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,560
I just want to do this job well.

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,120
I'm full.

38
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,760
Excuse me.

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,640
Honey, look at them.

40
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,280
I think it's good.

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,920
As for Chuxia,

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,320
she was right.

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,400
Curing Qilu

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,840
is her job.

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,720
Also,

46
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,440
Qilu is in good form now, isn't he?

47
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,580
(I've passed my probation day today.)

48
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,180
(Han Qilu is a big scoundrel
who wastes things.)

49
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,260
(Wish list: 1. Amusement park;
2. Wanna go camping; 3. See the sea.)

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,120
Wanna go camping.

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,760
He has an engagement with Miss Xiang.

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,920
When he recovers,

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,760
I'll have to go.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,360
We belong to different world, anyway.

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Hello, Chenchuan.

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,480
The bakery?

57
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,720
OK.

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm on my way.

59
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,360
Thanks.

60
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,760
No problem.

61
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,360
I should thank you for coming over

62
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,880
to help me over the weekend.

63
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,040
You're welcome.

64
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,800
I'm your employee, remember?

65
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,040
There's something wrong.

66
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,840
You're supposed to

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,760
finish all these things

68
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,680
last night, right?

69
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,560
Do you have any secret?

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,520
Well...

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't.

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,520
You're blushing.

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
No.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,480
An Chenchuan,

75
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,080
why are you blushing?

76
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,880
Tell me now.

77
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,680
Explain why you're blushing.

78
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,120
You...

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,960
Qilu,

80
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,160
shall we go to the art museum or not?

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,320
I've appreciated the art works.

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,920
Now I feel like eating some cake.

83
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,720
Will you tell me?

84
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,120
Will you tell me?

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,680
Will you tell me?

86
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,920
I will.

87
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
I will. I will.

88
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,760
So,

89
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,920
Mo Xiwei said yes?

90
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,480
She only agreed to give me a chance.

91
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,200
When a girl gives you a chance,

92
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,440
you're halfway there.

93
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,520
Believe me.

94
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,080
It's true.

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,640
I definitely believe you.

96
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,200
You've nailed such a difficult guy

97
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,160
like Han Qilu.

98
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,480
No.

99
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,120
Han Qilu and I belong to...

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,360
Hi.

101
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,360
Why are you here?

102
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,520
Why do you have it?

103
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,280
He gave it to me.

104
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,200
No, no, no.

105
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,920
I thought

106
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,560
since you lived in his house,

107
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,760
it was convenient...

108
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,600
Guess

109
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,240
if I've opened it or not.

110
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,680
A cupcake.

111
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,120
If it doesn't taste good,

112
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,280
then...

113
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,200
No problem.

114
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,440
Hello.

115
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,480
Ma'am,

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,640
you foretell things accurately.

117
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,000
I know

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,080
my own son well.

119
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,480
He has a crush on her,

120
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,760
but he doesn't know what to do.

121
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,560
So he teases the girl he likes

122
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,120
as little boys usually do.

123
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
(It turns out)

124
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,400
(Han Qilu's heart beats, too.)

125
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,560
I'm sorry.

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,480
