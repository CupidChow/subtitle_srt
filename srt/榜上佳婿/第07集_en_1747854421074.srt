00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,200
My heart is lost, including Hope

4
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,100
Every year in yearning causes a upswing

5
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,040
But a beautiful dinner is set after you

00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,820
Illusionists who are finally born

7
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,260
I have never thought thatああ

Episode 30

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,720
Noble Lady Zhong, it's rare for you to leave the palace.

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,280
Why don't you stay in my garden for a while?

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,360
When I marry into the royal family,

15
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,560
I hope you can take care of me.

16
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,480
I'm here to discuss the matter

17
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,240
under the order of the Noble Consort.

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,280
Since it's decided,

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
I'll go back to the palace and report it.

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,120
Okay.

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,640
Third Madam,

22
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,720
where are you going?

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Noble Lady Zhong,

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Brother and Sister-in-law,

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,720
Liang Jun bought some Western Chess flowers

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,160
from the merchant Hu.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,720
If you're interested,

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,720
why don't you go with us?

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,960
Western Chess flowers?

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,440
I've been in the palace for many years.

31
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,960
I rarely see them.

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,560
Then let's go together.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,120
It's inside.

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,320
Please.

35
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
This...

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
This...

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
This is...

38
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Big...

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Big Sister.

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
This is Big Sister and...

41
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Mr. Lu.

42
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Eunuch Yin,

43
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,720
how can you explain this?

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Noble Lady Zhong,

45
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
there must be

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
some misunderstanding.

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
Wake them up.

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Father and Mother,

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
what are you doing here?

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Big Sister?

51
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
The person on the bed is...

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm Lu Ming Shu.

53
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Greetings, everyone.

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Ming Shu?

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Why are you here?

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
You...

57
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
Why are you wearing Shu Jun's clothes?

58
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
This is...

59
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
I'll be back soon.

60
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Today's incident

61
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
is a sacrifice

62
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,720
for the sake of Shu Jun's innocence.

63
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Get up.

64
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
They're all gone.

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Hurry up.

66
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Who is so bold

67
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
to frame my eldest daughter?

68
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Of course,

69
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
it's the one who tried so hard

70
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
to lure you to the flower room.

71
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Mother?

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Is it really you?

73
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
You're wronged.

74
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,720
I want everyone to come and enjoy the flowers,

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
but I never framed Big Sister.

76
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Last time when Ming Shu fell into the water,

77
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
you all accused me.

78
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
I don't know if the day before yesterday,

79
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
I went to the Third Uncle's house.

80
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Lady Liang

81
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
must have stolen the copper oil.

82
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Before I went up the bridge,

83
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
she secretly spilled the copper oil

84
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
and hid the oil bottle

85
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
in Shu Jun's clothes.

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
When you were spreading the copper oil,

87
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
you put the copper oil on your shoe.

88
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
But she was smart.

89
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
She deliberately waited until

90
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
she thought it was time to get married.

91
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Then she sent the shoe to the laundry room.

92
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Nonsense.

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
I would have buried it that day.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Why would it be in the laundry room?

95
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
You also admitted it.

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Lady Liang,

97
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
how much suffering did you cause your eldest sister?

98
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Why did you do this to her?

99
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Since my parents died,

100
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
you have been trying your best to raise me.

101
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
I am very grateful.

102
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
But I know I am not inferior to my eldest sister.

103
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
I just don't have parents to decide.

104
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
So you framed me

105
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
and made everyone think

106
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
that Mr. Lu and I have a private relationship.

107
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
Isn't this the truth?

108
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Don't deny it.

109
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
This is just a trick

110
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
that we cast out the bait

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
and lure the snake out of the hole.

112
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Lady Ying.

113
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Lady Zhong.

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
The fact that I was lured to the flower room

115
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
is indeed a trap.

116
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
But we are prepared.

117
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
If you don't believe me,

118
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
you can send a doctor to investigate.

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Send.

120
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
Answer me, Master.

121
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,720
The flower room is indeed a trap.

122
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Liang Jun.

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
What else do you have to say?

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
What the doctor said,

125
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
I really don't know.

126
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
This is not what I did.

127
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
It's already this far.

128
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
What else do you have to deny?

129
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
I...

130
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Master, Madam.

131
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
I was ordered by Lady Ming Shu

132
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,720
to find this box in Lady Xian Jun's room.

133
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
The object is in it.

134
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Please explain it to me.

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
What is the object?

136
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Xian Jun.

137
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
It's you.

138
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
This is a disaster.

139
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Someone must have put it in my room on purpose.

140
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Maybe

141
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
someone is trying to ruin the whole thing.

142
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
You...

143
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Liang Jun.

144
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
You are so cruel.

145
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Don't worry, Madam.

146
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
This thing

147
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
was indeed put by Xian Jun.

148
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
This box is just a book.

149
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
You came to my house

150
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
to find a helper, right?

151
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
But it's true

152
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
that there is a task.

153
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
I don't know

154
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
if it's in your mind.

155
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
But you were wrong

156
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
in trying to get the object back.

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
You made me see Liang Jun's shoes

158
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
in the bathroom on purpose.

159
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
It's Madam's.

160
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
No.

161
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
It was dirty before.

162
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
She just took it to wash.

163
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
She sent it herself?

164
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
No.

165
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
It's a girl who was cleaning in her yard.

166
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Liang Jun's shoes are covered with oil.

167
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
She will definitely

168
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
ruin the shoes

169
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
if she put oil on them.

170
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
But you have already

171
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
bought the girl from the second yard.

172
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
But Liang Jun

173
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
only wanted to take Madam Shu away.

174
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
She didn't notice you at all.

175
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
She took the oil away secretly.

176
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
I saw that Madam was in good health.

177
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
She stayed in the flower room all day long.

178
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Even the Noble Consort moved away.

179
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Who else is with her?

180
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
It's of course Madam Lu.

181
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Good.

182
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Yin Xian Jun.

183
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
You are the one who is the most hidden.

184
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
These are just

185
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
the guesses of Madam Shu.

186
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,720
I didn't do anything.

187
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
I will never accept your blame.

188
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Physician Yin.

189
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Qiutong.

190
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Third Madam.

191
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Third Madam.

192
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Is this

193
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
the girl from your mother's side?

194
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Yes.

195
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
This is Qiutong, who is with my sister-in-law.

196
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
But how could this

197
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
have anything to do with our mother's family?

198
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
All this has to be said

199
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
from the rumors of Shu Jun's wife.

200
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
This house has been destroyed.

201
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Why would it become a luxury house in the capital?

202
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
It's her

203
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
who bought Mr. Shu at a high price.

204
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
I'm sure you all know

205
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
what happened next.

206
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Qiutong.

207
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Why did you do this?

208
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Master did this for your mother's sake.

209
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
But why did you do this to me?

210
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
I did this alone.

211
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
My mother is innocent and ungrateful.

212
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Please don't be angry with her.

213
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Yin Xian Jun.

214
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
So,

215
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
you are the one who

216
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
spread the rumors of Shu Jun's murder.

217
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
I just used

218
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
the cat that died of illness.

219
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
People might think that it was my sister.

220
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
But she didn't tell anyone.

221
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
And you

222
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
only want to suppress the truth

223
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
for your own sake.

224
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,720
If you say that I'm the one who framed her,

225
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
then you are all accomplices.

226
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Uncle is so disappointed in you.

227
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Disappointed?

228
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Have you ever had any expectations of me?

229
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
He

230
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
was born to be a generous daughter

231
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
and raised him with dignity.

232
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
He died with his parents.

233
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
But he lived with his family.

234
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
He has been raised in your family.

235
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
He has never lost his family

236
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
if he has any benefits.

237
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
And me?

238
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
I just want to

239
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
find a good way for myself

240
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
so that my mother can

241
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
take care of her children in front of others.

242
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Am I wrong?

243
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
Xian Jun.

244
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Stop talking.

245
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Let me talk.

246
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,720
Father.

247
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Father.

248
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Aren't you resting in the villa?

249
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
If I don't come here now,

250
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
we will be in danger.

251
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Father.

252
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
The reputation of the family

253
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,720
has been ruined by you unfilial children.

254
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Lady Zhong.

255
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Now that the truth has been found,

257
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,720
the rest is up to you.

258
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
I'll go back to the palace and report it.

259
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Please rest assured.

260
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
I will keep my word

261
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,720
as I saw it today.

262
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
Thank you, Lady Zhong.

263
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Thank you, Lady Zhong.

264
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Now that the truth has been found,

265
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
we will leave first.

266
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
For many years,

267
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I've been taken care of by my parents.

268
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
But I lost my parents

269
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
and was wronged.

270
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm jealous of you.

271
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
I know I was wrong.

272
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Please punish me.

273
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Liang Jun.

274
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,720
It's easy to admit your mistake.

275
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,720
I hope you can change your mind.

276
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
I know my family is strict.

277
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,720
You are kind and kind.

278
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
But you were unfair

279
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
when you got married.

280
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
You framed the family.

281
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Now that the truth has been found,

282
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
do you really know your mistake?

283
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Xian Jun.

284
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Grandfather.

285
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
I'm not happy

286
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
with what happened.

287
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
You still don't know how to change your mind?

288
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Let her speak.

289
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
For many years,

290
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
I've been silent in the mansion.

291
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
I want to be the one

292
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
who can be seen by you.

293
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
I want to be held in the hand

294
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
and be loved by you.

295
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
I'm just one step away.

296
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,720
I can be the only one

297
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
who can be with you.

298
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Then you can't

299
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
ignore me.

300
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,720
What's wrong with me?

301
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
It's right to be a good person.

302
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
But you were wrong to frame the family.

303
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
You were wrong to equal your power and dignity.

304
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
You were wrong to not know

305
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
your ambition and responsibility.

306
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Your Highness.

307
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
The princess is respected

308
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
but she has a fight in the dark.

309
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Your father has nothing to do with it.

310
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
You're not only

311
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
fighting for the harem

312
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,720
but also the court.

313
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Even if the eldest daughter of the enemy

314
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
marries the princess,

315
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
it's inevitable.

316
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
But at least

317
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
you can fight against some cases.

318
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
The marriage is

319
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,720
a fight in the court.

320
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Xian Jun.

321
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,720
You may be dissatisfied with your uncle.

322
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
But

323
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
whether it's me

324
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
or your aunt,

325
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
they will praise you

326
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
for being gentle and virtuous

327
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
and full of talent.

328
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,720
We've always thought

329
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
of finding a good family

330
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
for you.

331
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
We never thought

332
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
you could marry anyone you want

333
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
including Liang Jun.

334
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
As a family,

335
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,720
we're of the same blood.

336
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
We're different in appearance.

337
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
What you need

338
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
is not to hurt each other

339
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
but to strengthen yourself

340
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
and support each other.

341
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
I know my fault.

342
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Please punish me.

343
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
My brother and sister-in-law

344
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
have no fault in raising me.

345
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
I'm willing to take the responsibility.

346
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
I'll take the responsibility.

347
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
I'm willing to take the responsibility.

348
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
I'll take the responsibility.

349
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
Xian Jun, what do you think?

350
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
I'm a teacher.

351
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
How can I take the responsibility?

352
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,720
The country has its laws and the family has its rules.

353
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
You framed the Lord of Shu

354
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
and violated the family rules.

355
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
According to the family rules,

356
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
you should be sent to the ancestral hall.

357
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Please have mercy, grandfather.

358
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
The marriage

359
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
was not clear to the Lord of Shu.

360
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
He didn't care about

361
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
the feelings of the sisters

362
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
and the situation.

363
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Please forgive them.

364
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Sister.

365
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Sister.

366
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Since the Lord of Shu has spoken,

367
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
I'll punish you.

368
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Xian Jun, Liang Jun,

369
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
you're sentenced to a year in the ancestral hall.

370
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
As for you,

371
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
as a mother,

372
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
you're not qualified to be a teacher.

373
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,720
You're sentenced to a year in the ancestral hall.

374
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Do you accept it?

375
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Thank you, grandfather.

376
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Thank you, grandfather.

377
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Thank you, grandfather.

378
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Is the Grand Tutor going to stay in the mansion

379
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
or go back to the villa?

380
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Of course I'm going back to the villa to rest.

381
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Don't forget that I'm still ill.

382
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Dr. Ning,

383
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
I'm sorry.

384
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Mingshu,

385
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
thanks to you,

386
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
I was able to clear my name.

387
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Madam, you're being too kind.

388
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
The Lord of Shu is kind-hearted.

389
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
I can't let you down.

390
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Do you think you can really go to the ends of the world?

391
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
Fortunately, the King of Rui has made adjustments.

392
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
The palace didn't pursue this matter.

393
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Mother,

394
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
I...

395
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
You'd rather take the risk of changing your mind

396
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
than to push the chain.

397
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Do you have someone in mind?

398
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
I don't know.

399
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
I don't know.

400
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
I don't know.

401
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
I don't know.

402
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
I trusted someone else before,

403
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
but now it's a dream.

404
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
It's because I didn't clear the rumors in time

405
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
that so many problems occurred.

406
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,720
I made my grandfather worried and my family was in danger.

407
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
I know I was wrong.

408
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
Father,

409
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
I'm sorry.

410
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
It's not all your fault.

411
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
It's about your happiness.

412
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
But I've always been

413
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,720
a man of honor to my family.

414
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,720
I value family honor.

415
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
I've never asked you for your wish.

416
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
After that,

417
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I made you suffer so much.

418
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
I was wrong, too.

419
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Father.

420
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Master,

421
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
we were alone before.

422
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
We didn't respect the feelings of the King of Rui.

423
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
We almost made a big mistake.

424
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
After all this,

425
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
I want to get married.

426
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
If there's any other way,

427
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,720
please make another arrangement.

428
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Madam.

429
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Getting married to King of Rui

430
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
was the result of my father's determination

431
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
to reform the family.

432
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,720
But if we exchange our children's happiness,

433
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
it will be a strong and powerful system

434
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
that will be useless to all children.

435
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Shu Jun,

436
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
if you really don't want to be a father,

437
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,720
you can get back together with your grandfather.

438
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
I'm willing to get married to King of Rui.

439
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Shu Jun,

440
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,720
why did you change your mind?

441
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Today's everything made me completely awake.

442
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
I've been sheltered by my family since I was a child.

443
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
I'm well-dressed and have unlimited glory.

444
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
It's not like I came out of nowhere.

445
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
It's the result of my family's efforts

446
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
for the court.

447
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
As a daughter of Ying family,

448
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
I can't just care about myself.

449
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,720
But if you have no feelings for King of Rui,

450
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
I do have no feelings for King of Rui.

451
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
I don't even have any fear.

452
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
But after this,

453
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
he still can be fearless

454
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
and insist on marrying me.

455
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
This firmness

456
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
is enough to let my rumors be destroyed.

457
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
So I'm willing to marry Ying

458
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
not only because I'm grateful,

459
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
but also because I believe

460
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,720
he is a generous and generous person.

461
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
If so,

462
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Ying family's fate

463
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
will be tied together with King of Rui.

464
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
You...

465
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Do you have the courage to face it?

466
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
The Ying family has been in the world for a hundred years.

467
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
It's the wisdom and vision

468
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
of the ancestors to help each other in the court.

469
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
I believe in my father

470
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
and my grandfather's choice.

471
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Okay.

472
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
The Ying family has a daughter like this.

473
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
It's a blessing for the family.

474
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Then,

475
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,720
the marriage is settled.

476
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
The marriage is settled.

477
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
You want to return the case to Su Changhua?

478
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
The late teacher was from the Grand Tutor.

479
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
I don't know if the Grand Tutor has any clues about the late teacher's case.

480
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Do you know

481
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,720
how much the case will cost?

482
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
I'm clear about it.

483
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
I'm not afraid of death.

484
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Just like the late teacher

485
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
agreed to let the Ying family marry King of Rui,

486
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
he is not afraid to push the Ying family

487
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
to the edge of the cliff.

488
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
I'm satisfied.

489
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
The court has many objections to the reform.

490
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,720
I didn't care about the private interests of the Ying family.

491
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
But with your appearance in the evening,

492
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,720
the court seems to have someone in the back.

493
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,720
As for the case of Su Changhua,

494
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
I don't know much about it.

495
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,720
He wrote a confession letter before he was shot.

496
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Plus, his confidant Liu Xiankun

497
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
testified in person.

498
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
No one doubts it.

499
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
But it must be a frame.

500
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
But later,

501
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Liu Xiankun was sentenced to death.

502
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
There is no evidence.

503
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Can you find someone behind Liu Xiankun?

504
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
It's not that easy.

505
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
If you have a heart,

506
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
find someone by his side.

507
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Thank you for your advice.

508
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
It seems

509
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
I don't need to lie down anymore.

510
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
The storm that should come

511
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
will be faced sooner or later.

512
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
I've witnessed the difficulty of a poor woman

513
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
to manage her life.

514
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
I'm not afraid of it.

515
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
I'm not afraid of it.

516
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
I'm not afraid of it.

517
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
I'm not afraid of it.

518
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
I've witnessed the pain of a poor woman

519
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
to be humiliated in front of the world.

520
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Now I know

521
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
even a rich woman

522
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
has her own difficulties.

523
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
I want to ask a woman in the world

524
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,720
how she can get out of that house

525
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
and get rid of her family background

526
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
and find her true self.

527
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
How is it?

528
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
Any news?

529
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Please remind me

530
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
to find someone by Liu Xiankun's side

531
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
before I tell you.

532
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Liu Xiankun?

533
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
No problem.

534
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Leave it to me.

535
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Besides, help me check

536
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
what happened to Yin Xianjun's uncle.

537
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
I'm finally home.

538
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
I'm not as good as my dog.

539
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Right, Zazang?

540
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
You've grown up.

541
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
Don't you miss me?

542
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
Did you eat all my food?

543
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
Zazang.

544
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Mother said you cleaned my room.

545
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
I didn't do anything.

546
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
I just followed the order.

547
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Look at this.

548
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Iron and silver hook.

549
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,720
It even increased the style of my room.

550
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Is there any problem?

551
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
No.

552
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
I like it.

553
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Why do you look like this?

554
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Well,

555
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,720
since I lost my memory,

556
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,720
although you've been with me,

557
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,720
I always feel uneasy.

558
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
I've been thinking

559
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
what I used to be like.

560
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Why I can make some jewelry

561
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
and play some zither.

562
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Zither?

563
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
What else can I write?

564
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
Did I forget

565
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,720
some important people or things?

566
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
I always feel uneasy

567
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
when I think about these things.

568
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Sorry, Uncle Ming.

569
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I was too careless

570
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
and neglected your feelings.

571
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
No.

572
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Your and Mother's love

573
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
made me feel at ease

574
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
and at ease again and again.

575
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Look.

576
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Although the Yin family is rich,

577
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
every woman has her own difficulties.

578
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
I have my mother,

579
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,720
my brother, who supports me in everything.

580
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Even if I forget my past,

581
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
so what?

582
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
I'm the happiest person in the world.

583
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
No matter before or now,

584
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
I'm me.

585
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
My name is Lu Ming Shu.

586
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
I'm Mother's daughter.

587
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
I'm Brother's sister.

588
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
My name and my family

589
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
are the biggest pride and pride

590
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
in my life.

591
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Ming Shu.

592
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
No matter what you want to do in the future

593
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
and what kind of person you want to be,

594
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
I will support you.

595
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
I will do my best

596
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,720
to make you happy and safe.

597
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Then I'll tell you.

598
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
No matter in the future

599
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,720
you are poor or in trouble,

600
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
I will be with you

601
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
and give you strength.

602
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
I'm not like that.

603
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
You said I was a good-for-nothing,

604
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
a good-for-nothing,

605
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
a good-for-nothing,

606
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
and that I treated those scholars

607
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
as if they were my own.

608
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
You miss me so much.

609
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
It seems that my brother

610
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
didn't have a good eye before.

611
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Not good eye?

612
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Then you have to make up for it.

613
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
Who is it?

614
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Sir, it should be here.

615
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Can you see the way?

616
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
It's here.

617
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
It's here.

618
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
How am I today?

619
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
I don't know.

620
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
I thought Lady Lu came up.

621
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Nonsense.

622
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Open the door.

623
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Is Mr. Lu home?

624
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Mr. Lu.

625
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Mr. Song is here.

626
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Mr. Lu.

627
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
He's still in a good mood.

628
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
Greetings, Mrs. Lu.

629
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,720
You and Chang are friends.

630
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
You can come and play more in the future.

631
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
These...

632
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Mr. Song, you've gone too far.

633
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
This is my duty.

634
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Besides,

635
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Mr. Lu and Mrs. Ming Shu

636
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
helped me find out the truth about the Ying family's rumors.

637
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
They helped me communicate with King of Rui.

638
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
I should thank them.

639
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
You're welcome.

640
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
If it weren't for your help,

641
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
things wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

642
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
It's time to eat.

643
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
If Mr. Song doesn't mind,

644
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
why don't you stay and eat together?

645
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
My mother is a good cook.

646
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Then I'll take it.

647
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
Mr. Song,

648
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
try this sweet and sour fish.

649
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
And this.

650
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
My mother's favorite is the goji berries porridge.

651
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
It's fragrant and sweet.

652
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
This is my favorite with Xing.

653
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Mr. Song, try it.

654
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Thank you, Mrs. Ming Shu.

655
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
How is it?

656
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
It's really sweet.

657
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Mother.

658
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
Mr. Song

659
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,760
rarely eats this kind of

660
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,720
thick and light meal.

661
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Today,

662
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
I'll try it.

663
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
How can you?

664
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Ming Shu,

665
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
you're so polite to Mr. Song.

666
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Aren't you afraid that he'll be embarrassed?

667
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Brother Song, we're friends.

668
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Don't be polite to me.

669
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm not polite to you.

670
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
I just want him to

671
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
know my good cooking.

672
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
Besides,

673
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
when we were in the Yin family,

674
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
Mr. Song taught me to play the zither.

675
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
I should be treated like this.

676
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Yes.

677
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
This bowl has a lot of goji berries.

678
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
It's even more rich.

679
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Mrs. Ming Shu,

680
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
other than eating this,

681
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
what else do you like to eat?

682
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
What else?

683
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
I...

684
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
She...

685
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
She likes to swim in the water

686
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
when she's flying.

687
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
She doesn't dislike to eat.

688
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
I don't like to eat.

689
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Cheng,

690
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
you don't have to say that.

691
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Yes.

692
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Mr. Song,

693
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
they're brothers and sisters.

694
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
They're used to fighting.

695
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
I'm sorry to make you laugh.

696
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
It's okay.

697
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
I'm the only son in the family.

698
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
I'm very envious of

699
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
the relationship between brothers and sisters.

700
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
I'm happy to be with you.

701
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Really?

702
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
In this case,

703
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
why don't you

704
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,720
take Mr. Song as your brother?

705
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
In the future,

706
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
you can also take care of him.

707
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
I can't

708
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
argue with you.

709
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
I dare not take the position of brother.

710
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
I don't mind.

711
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
I'm afraid

712
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
I'm not that lucky.

713
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
It's just a joke.

714
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Why are you so serious?

715
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
In my opinion,

716
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
one side is my brother,

717
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
the other side is my best friend.

718
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
They're both beautiful.

719
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Ming Shu is right.

720
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Cheng,

721
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
don't think about

722
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720
taking care of him.

723
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
I'm not.

724
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
I'm not.

725
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
It's my responsibility.

726
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,720
I'll give it to Mr. Song.

727
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Right.

728
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
Yes.

729
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
With my brother,

730
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
how can I let others take care of me?

731
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Stop looking.

732
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
Mother.

733
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Come on.

734
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Have a bowl of pork liver soup.

735
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Pork liver soup?

736
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Ming Shu said you have a bad eyesight.

737
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
He wants to make up for it.

738
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
He asked me to make some pork liver soup for you.

739
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
He said it's good for your health.

740
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
You're too considerate.

741
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Mother,

742
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
do you have anything to say?

743
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Mr. Song

744
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
is interested in Ming Shu.

745
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Do you notice?

746
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
I'm not.

747
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
They just met by chance.

748
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Don't think too much.

749
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
I'm not.

750
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
I'm from here.

751
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
I know nothing.

752
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Mr. Song's eyes

753
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
are obviously interested in Ming Shu.

754
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
I just want to know

755
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
what you think.

756
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
I'm afraid it's not a good thing

757
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
to marry Ming Shu

758
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
with the Song family.

759
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
You're right.

760
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Are you worried about Ming Shu's promotion?

761
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,720
How could it be?

762
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Ming Shu is not good enough for anyone.

763
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Why would he do that?

764
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
I'm just worried that

765
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
if I marry into such a family,

766
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
it'll be more difficult.

767
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
If Ming Shu wants to marry,

768
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
he'll be more confident

769
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
after I get married.

770
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
That's your idea.

771
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,720
Do you know what he thinks?

772
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
Mother, that's all.

773
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
Father,

774
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
drink the soup while it's hot.

775
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Have an early rest.

776
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Lady Shujuan,

777
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
you came to my house.

778
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
I'm so honored.

779
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,720
I just came for nothing.

780
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
I just came for a walk.

781
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
You came for nothing

782
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
and brought so many gifts.

783
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,720
You should come for a walk.

784
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Actually, I'm just being asked

785
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
and being treated.

786
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
And Madam has given me a reward.

787
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
You don't have to thank me.

788
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Who wants to thank you?

789
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
But you were

790
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
talking about the wrong words all the way.

791
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
I'm sorry.

792
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Fine.

793
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
I'll tell you the truth.

794
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
I'm here to thank you.

795
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Thank you for standing by my side

796
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
when no one trusted me

797
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,720
and helped me get rid of my wrongdoings.

798
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,720
I've been disrespectful to you.

799
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Please forgive me.

800
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
From now on,

801
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
I want to be your friend.

802
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
I wonder if you're willing to do that.

803
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
You're really a woman of no value.

804
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
You're so annoying.

805
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
You're the eldest daughter of the Yin family.

806
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,720
How can you be my friend?

807
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
Did she hear wrongly?

808
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
I've been trying so hard

809
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
to tell you these words.

810
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
You're even making fun of me

811
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
with the words I said before.

812
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
Fine.

813
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Since you don't appreciate it,

814
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
let's go our separate ways.

815
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Let's go.

816
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Since we're friends,

817
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
I won't make fun of you.

818
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
You want to open a jewelry store?

819
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
I'm giving you a half-price

820
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
to get the shop under the reward.

821
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Now that I've got the reward,

822
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,720
I'll take action.

823
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,720
That's a good idea.

824
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
But it's not easy for a woman to do business.

825
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,720
It's hard for you to do it alone.

826
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
What?

827
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,720
You want to join the ministry?

828
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,720
I'm the daughter of the Yin family.

829
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
How can I vote for you?

830
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,720
How can I vote for you?

831
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,720
But it's not hard for me to do it alone.

832
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,720
Thank you, Manager Yin.

833
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,720
You're a little strict

834
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
about dressing up.

835
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
But I think it's not necessary

836
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,720
to return the jewelry.

837
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Good idea.

838
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
Since you have such an idea,

839
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
the decoration and decoration

840
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
in the store

841
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,720
will be done separately, right?

842
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
You're starting to pressure me.

843
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Manager Lu.

844
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,720
I've heard about it.

845
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Liu Xiankong's son

846
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
has been missing since he disappeared.

847
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
But his foster daughter Liu Yuanying

848
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,720
failed to escape.

849
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
She was sent to the Ministry of Education.

850
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Now she's the best dancer in the Ministry of Education.

851
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
She's the best dancer.

852
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
She's often invited to her family.

853
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
I was just about to tell you.

854
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
She's been taken to

855
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Minister Lu's mansion.

856
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,720
She said it was for a grace banquet.

857
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Lu's Mansion.

858
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Lu's Mansion.

859
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Who would have thought

860
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
the Liu Yuanying

861
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
that the noble lords of the capital

862
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
have been chasing after

863
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
has become my man?

864
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Don't forget what you said.

865
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Don't worry.

866
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
As long as you serve her well,

867
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
she can do anything.

868
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,720
Go back.

869
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,720
Your wife is waiting for you.

870
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
It's none of your business.

871
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Let alone her,

872
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,720
even the other kids in my house

873
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
are not worthy of your shoes.

874
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
All right.

875
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
It's getting late.

876
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
If we don't leave now,

877
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
the people in the yard will wake up.

878
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Be careful not to be seen.

879
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
So this is how you do it.

880
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,720
Jiangnan.

881
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
Wangjiangnan.

882
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,720
It sounds like a vegetable shop.

883
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
Baihua Village.

884
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
It sounds even weirder.

885
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
What is this called?

886
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
What is this called?

887
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
What is this?

888
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,720
You're still up?

889
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
Brother,

890
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
I'm at the grocery store.

891
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
I'm going to buy some food.

892
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Brother,

893
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
I'm thinking of the name of the store.

894
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,720
I can't make it too plain

895
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
and not too light.

896
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,720
It's so hard.

897
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,720
As long as there's a good name

898
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,720
when you open the store,

899
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
it's a good start.

900
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
I'll help you think of it.

901
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
You care about me the most.

902
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
You're a girl after all.

903
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
I know that

904
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
men and women are different ages.

905
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
In the future,

906
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
whether it's brother Yuwei

907
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
or other men,

908
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
you need to be careful about your socialization.

909
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,720
It's easy to get along with a brother and sister.

910
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
You're so serious.

911
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720
If you want to know the meaning of the name,

912
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
you might as well use

913
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
the white embroidery on the long-sleeved dress

914
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,720
and the long-sleeved dress on the wolf-tongue.

915
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,720
Wolf-tongue has the meaning of jade carving.

916
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
You can tell the store by the pattern.

917
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
It's a combination.

918
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,720
This store is called...

919
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Flower Pavilion.

920
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
How is it?

921
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
It sounds good.

922
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
This is it.

923
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
Flower Pavilion.

924
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,720
We'll meet again in the next life.

925
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,720
The love is still there.

926
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,720
We'll meet again in the next life.

927
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,720
The prosperity is still there.

928
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,720
When the sun rises,

929
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
the sword will be waning.

930
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Fate will decide the fate of the country.

931
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,720
Looking back,

932
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,720
I hope we'll meet again.

933
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,720
If the scenery is beautiful,

934
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,720
the wind will be there.

935
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
A love that is only for a moment,

936
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,720
but it's so confusing.

937
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,720
The long night is over.

938
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,720
I can't stop missing you.

939
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,720
If the sea is as clear as the moon,

940
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,720
the wind will be there.

941
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,720
I can't stop missing you.

942
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,720
It's a pity.

943
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,720
I hope we'll meet again.

944
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,720
