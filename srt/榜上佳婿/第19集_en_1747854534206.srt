Episode 2

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The cake is sold out.

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The sweet and the soft red bean cake.

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The red bean cake is sold out.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Big sister, come and buy some cake.

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Our new red bean cake is still warm.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No need.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Big sister, don't go.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Our red bean cake tastes great.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you miss it, you will regret it.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Try it.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's just a red bean cake.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Who will buy it?

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will buy it for you.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Come to me when you are done.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You are so stubborn.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have no money.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Then you should eat more.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There is such a good thing in the world.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come to me when you are done.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Come to me when you are done.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Who will buy it?

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Who will buy it?

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The red bean cake is sold out.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's just a red bean cake.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
These businessmen are all big.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What did you eat?

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Red bean cake.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There is a red bean cake seller at the door.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He said he would regret if he missed it.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I didn't get his bill.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He gave it to me for free.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Try it.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will go to the kitchen.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He is a traitor.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You two will be in trouble when he arrives.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Here.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,520
Good.

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,200
What are you doing?

43
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,000
Let me go.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Good, centralוף.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We finally get you.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,160
Who are you?

47
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,400
Listen, be good.

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,800
Or you'll be disabled.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,960
You're not going to tie me up?

50
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,520
You're all stiff?

51
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,640
Or I'll sue you to two counts of torture.

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,840
Brother Qian,

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,280
you're being unreasonable.

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,440
We just passed by and saw you fall down.

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,600
We just helped you up.

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,480
Right?

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,880
Right.

58
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,560
You're still hurt.

59
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,360
You're lucky to meet us at night.

60
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,880
Or you'll be really disabled.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,840
Who is it?

62
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,640
Who is it?

63
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,000
You bastard.

64
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,760
If it wasn't for that red bean cake,

65
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,520
would you still not come to see me?

66
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Hurry and untie me.

67
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,120
Untie me.

68
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,920
Qian Si!

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,560
You bastard!

70
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,880
I told you to let me sleep early.

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,280
You should have come earlier.

72
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,320
You should have come earlier.

73
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,440
You should have come earlier.

74
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
You should have come earlier.

75
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
You should have come earlier.

76
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,400
So you're this...

77
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,080
Little tiger, you're so mean.

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,000
You're so mean.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,800
Get lost.

80
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,560
You're a bad person.

81
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,680
What are you doing outside?

82
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,600
Are you going to have a meeting outside?

83
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
What are you talking about?

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,160
What did you do in my room?

85
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
You forgot everything?

86
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,200
You said you were going to find me.

87
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,840
You wanted to bring me 50 taels of silver.

88
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,680
But you didn't even tell me.

89
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,680
You didn't even dare to come.

90
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,440
You...

91
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,120
Good for you, Qian Si.

92
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,200
You even gave him 50 taels?

93
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,320
I told you.

94
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,840
We agreed to break off our legs.

95
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,880
You should have given him 100 taels.

96
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,960
Why did you suddenly break it in half?

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,520
So you're raising this fox.

98
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,880
You're a big liar.

99
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,320
You're a big liar.

100
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,880
You're a big liar.

101
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,080
You're a big liar.

102
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,600
Thank you.

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,640
You're a big liar.

104
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,680
You took money from people.

105
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,800
You fabricated false evidence.

106
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,920
You tried to frame Lu Jian Yuan.

107
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,560
Why don't you go to the government office with us?

108
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm warning you.

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Don't do anything stupid.

110
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,960
No.

111
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,360
I'm from Shaohai.

112
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,800
You guys are breaking the rules.

113
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
There's a law that says

114
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,560
there's no law.

115
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,400
Cut the crap.

116
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
I'm not a thief.

117
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
I'm not a thief.

118
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm not a thief.

119
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
I'm not a thief.

120
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm not a thief.

121
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
I'm not a thief.

122
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
I'm not a thief.

123
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
I'm not a thief.

124
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm not a thief.

125
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,560
You guys are breaking the rules.

126
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,120
The civil servant Lu Ming Shu

127
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,600
accused my brother of slandering.

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,440
The government of Liangzhou has not been investigated.

129
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
So he's been caught.

130
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
It's not fair.

131
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
The civil servant Lu Ming Shu

132
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
is innocent.

133
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,160
He accused my brother of slandering.

134
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,160
The government of Liangzhou has not been investigated.

135
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
So he's been caught.

136
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
It's not fair.

137
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
It's not fair.

138
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
It's not fair.

139
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
It's not fair.

140
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
It's not fair.

141
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Open the carriage of Prince Rui's Mansion.

142
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
No.

143
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
What's this?

144
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Open the carriage of Prince Jun's Mansion.

145
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
No.

146
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Nothing happened, right?

147
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
뮤呢?

148
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,880
Excuse me,

149
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,360
the civil servant Lu Ming Shu

150
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,080
is innocent.

151
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,400
He accused my brother of slandering.

152
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,040
The government of Liangzhou has not been investigated.

153
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
It's not fair.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,980
No, he is your brother.

156
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,680
I just told you he is your brother.

157
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,420
Our Liangzhou House has not touched his body yet.

158
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,100
It's a dash.

159
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,500
Real barrier.

160
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,420
Hurry, get him out.

161
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,140
Quite thear se stars.

162
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,460
No, my Lord.

163
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,420
He takes over.

164
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,620
He's the grandson of Duke Zheng.

165
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,620
Why?

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,680
What?

167
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,520
It's not related to the Zhen Mansion

168
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,600
that Song Fu told us.

169
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,120
But the rumor said

170
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,880
the carriage of Princess Wen'an and Princess Ruoyang

171
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,000
was stopped in the country.

172
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't know if it's a coincidence or a coincidence.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,640
What?

174
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
If Liangzhou Mansion doesn't accept it,

175
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,400
if it's a big trouble,

176
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
tell him to stop and prepare to go to court.

177
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,400
Yes.

178
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,320
Lu Cheng, go to the court to interrogate.

179
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,480
Guards.

180
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,840
Who is the victim?

181
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,280
I, Lu Ming Shu,

182
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,680
report the evil intention of the former four to frame my brother.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,040
I don't want the court to be able to tell the truth

184
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,200
and clear my brother's name.

185
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,440
I...

186
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,240
He's the one who hurt me.

187
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,600
Everyone on the street can testify for me.

188
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,280
Your Excellency,

189
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,160
this case is not a difficult one.

190
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,920
You just need to summon the doctor

191
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,280
to examine the wound.

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,080
Summon the doctor.

193
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,120
Your Excellency,

194
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
the victim is the former four

195
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,720
who suffered a severe fracture.

196
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
The wound was pressed by a carriage

197
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,000
after a tea party.

198
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,720
Lu Ming Shu,

199
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,960
what else do you have to say?

200
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,240
Your Excellency,

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,960
the former four's injury must be hidden.

202
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
But you let the doctor turn the table upside down.

203
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,320
If Liangzhou Mansion can't be fair,

204
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
I'll go to the ancient courtyard

205
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,440
to report to the officials.

206
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,840
Impudence!

207
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,520
You dare to speak ill of me and defame me.

208
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,440
Guards,

209
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,680
give me ten more minutes.

210
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,400
Ten more minutes?

211
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,040
I don't agree.

212
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,800
The court treats women with dignity.

213
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,760
It's a custom in the case.

214
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,440
Your Excellency, have you forgotten it?

215
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,120
Do you want to teach me how to solve cases?

216
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,320
I think it's reasonable.

217
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,920
Beat him.

218
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,080
Stop.

219
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,760
Your Excellency,

220
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,400
this case is full of doubts.

221
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
After King of Rui learned of it,

222
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,080
he ordered me to summon

223
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,840
the doctor of Dali Temple to examine the wound.

224
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,400
Lawyer Lu.

225
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,120
Yes.

226
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,600
Wait.

227
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,040
Liangzhou Mansion is handling a case.

228
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,200
Lawyer Liu is a doctor of Dali Temple.

229
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,400
It's not appropriate to interfere in the case

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,360
of Liangzhou Mansion.

231
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,360
If I go to Dali Temple to appeal,

232
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Dali Temple will take this case.

233
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,760
Your Excellency, what do you think?

234
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,880
Lawyer Liu,

235
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,320
examine the wound.

236
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,360
Yes.

237
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,280
Mr. Zhang.

238
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,840
She made it into a fracture.

239
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,580
According to the wound face,

240
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,960
there are twoворstions of her leg.

241
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,520
It was already inflected.

242
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,640
It should have been inflicted by her arch- observationres.

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,200
She didn't exercise theذ farkah at the ingot.

244
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,120
The wound later has traces of some flesh giving it away to safeguard theんで.

245
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,920
Would it too be too late to be疫wan in both Handong and Damintang?

246
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,720
and some skin and wounds

247
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,000
to keep her alive.

248
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,200
Mrs. Jia,

249
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,320
did you hear that?

250
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,160
In that case,

251
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,160
there is indeed a dispute in this case.

252
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,520
We can't solve the case hastily.

253
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,640
According to our law,

254
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,280
we need to report the case

255
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,960
to the Ministry of Justice.

256
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,040
According to the law,

257
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,760
we should hand this case over to the Ministry of Justice.

258
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,480
But the statement of the Minister of Justice

259
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,960
can prove that Lu Chang has nothing to do with Qian Si's leg break.

260
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,480
We should release Lu Chang first.

261
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,920
I'm willing to be Lu Chang's bodyguard.

262
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,520
Release him?

263
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,880
I can't make the decision.

264
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,760
We need to wait for the Ministry of Justice to recover.

265
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,280
How long will it take for the Ministry of Justice to recover?

266
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,480
We can only wait for the news.

267
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,520
Guards.

268
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,360
Take Qian Si away.

269
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,520
Lu Chang will be locked up.

270
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,720
Retreat.

271
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,480
Brother.

272
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,760
Brother.

273
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,080
Chief,

274
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,240
the situation is getting worse.

275
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,520
How can we wait for Brother?

276
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,400
They are just delaying.

277
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,080
Someone is behind this to stop Brother Lu from escaping.

278
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,920
The purpose is to let him miss the chance.

279
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,920
You have never made any mistake in your journey.

280
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,480
It must be Lu Ze Gang who is still fighting for Lu Wen Cai.

281
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,400
He transferred the hatred to Brother Lu.

282
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,000
He just wants to ruin Brother.

283
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,040
I can't sit around and wait.

284
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,040
How about I go to the Ministry of Justice

285
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,160
to help Brother?

286
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,560
If you rush there,

287
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,720
you won't be able to achieve your goal.

288
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,720
Don't worry.

289
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,120
I'll find someone to help

290
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,760
even if it's to search the capital.

291
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:29,920
Let's go.

292
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,960
If it wasn't for Lu Chang,

293
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
I wouldn't have lost my grace.

294
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,880
I wouldn't have been harmed

295
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,800
by sending him to the Academy.

296
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,520
Chief Lu,

297
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
don't be sad.

298
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,120
The most important thing for scholars is their reputation.

299
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,680
I will

300
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,040
make Lu Chang

301
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,520
lose his qualification to take the exam

302
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,400
and become a useless person for the rest of his life.

303
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,080
Don't worry, Chief.

304
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,040
Don't worry, Chief.

305
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,400
I've used the Ministry of Justice to stall this case.

306
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,040
Lu Chang must be

307
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,080
having no connection with the provincial affairs this time.

308
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,000
It's just that Lu Chang's sister

309
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,800
caused a ruckus in Liangzhou.

310
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,760
Now the Dali Temple is also involved in this case.

311
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,960
I'm afraid that

312
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,600
Lu Chang can't be convicted.

313
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,440
Let him fail the exam first.

314
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,640
Then we'll find a chance to get rid of him.

315
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,160
I'm very grateful

316
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,000
for your help.

317
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,320
Please don't refuse

318
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,720
my request.

319
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,360
Chief,

320
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,640
please don't.

321
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:55,960
Chief,

322
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,520
I hope you can

323
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,280
remind me in the future.

324
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,320
I'll try my best.

325
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,040
Uncle Lin.

326
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,200
Come on.

327
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,080
Why are we here?

328
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,720
We've been drinking all morning.

329
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,360
Let's have some champagne.

330
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,000
I haven't settled brother's problem.

331
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,920
I don't have an appetite.

332
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,600
It's not that you can't drink.

333
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
You'll need to take care of yourself later.

334
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,680
You need to keep your strength.

335
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,280
Your Highness,

336
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,480
two bowls of purple sweet potato.

337
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,400
Okay.

338
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,000
Come on.

339
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,680
Come on.

340
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,160
Come on.

341
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,080
Look.

342
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,960
It's sold out.

343
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,680
I'll go buy some snacks.

344
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,040
Wait for me here.

345
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:47,920
Boss,

346
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,960
do you have some pancakes?

347
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,040
No.

348
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,640
Then some green bean cakes and peach cakes.

349
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,560
Okay.

350
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,000
Boss,

351
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,920
do you want some more?

352
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:02,840
Tian Jia,

353
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
where's that lady?

354
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,560
Isn't she here?

355
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,760
She's gone.

356
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,200
Brother Lin.

357
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,320
Uncle Lin.

358
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,720
Uncle Lin.

359
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,080
Brother Lin,

360
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,960
go after her.

361
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,480
Stop.

362
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,920
Uncle Lin.

363
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,680
Don't scare me, Uncle Lin.

364
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,760
Uncle Lin.

365
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:00,880
Tell me.

366
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,120
Who's behind this?

367
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,960
You never know.

368
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,480
When you're in jail,

369
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,360
I'll have a thousand ways to get you out.

370
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,800
Dream on.

371
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,640
You want to die?

372
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,480
How is she, Doctor?

373
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,520
How's my daughter?

374
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,480
Lin Ai's head was hit hard

375
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,320
and her heart was damaged.

376
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,400
I gave her some medicine to help her recover.

377
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,760
If she doesn't wake up in three days,

378
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,080
I'm afraid...

379
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,080
My poor Uncle Lin.

380
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,600
I'm in a lot of trouble.

381
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,480
Doctor,

382
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,880
please.

383
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,680
Save my daughter.

384
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,640
No matter how much it costs,

385
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,520
please cure her.

386
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,840
I'll try my best.

387
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,160
But I'm not sure.

388
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,280
If I can find Ning Xin Pill,

389
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,760
I can help her.

390
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,240
But this is a precious pill.

391
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,200
It's hard to buy.

392
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,120
Ning Xin Pill can save Uncle Lin?

393
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,760
I have this in my house.

394
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,640
I'll go back to my house.

395
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,360
The

396
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
The

397
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,880
Is this the pill you want?

398
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,880
Yes.

399
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,080
I'll explain it to my mother when I come back.

400
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,520
Wait.

401
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,560
Father.

402
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,840
Where are you going with the pill?

403
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,560
Father, I...

404
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,640
Here.

405
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,120
Give me the pill.

406
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,160
Father,

407
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,920
I'm in danger.

408
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,960
I need the pill.

409
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,360
Is she Lu Ming Shu's wife?

410
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,680
You're always so anxious.

411
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,760
Tell me the truth.

412
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,960
What's the relationship between you two?

413
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,280
I didn't want to reveal it too early.

414
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
But since father asked,

415
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,920
I'll tell the truth.

416
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,400
I love Ming Shu.

417
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
I have to save her.

418
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,320
Ridiculous!

419
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,560
Don't forget your identity.

420
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,800
You're entangled with the situation.

421
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,000
How can you be so nice?

422
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,800
Now the exam is coming.

423
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,560
It's your family's

424
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,360
duty to protect our family.

425
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,360
You need to

426
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,680
be considerate and

427
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,600
do your best to retake the exam.

428
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,600
You can't let those

429
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,760
who are not good do it.

430
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,560
Father, you're being too harsh.

431
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,080
I don't want to be too serious with you.

432
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,360
It's important to save her.

433
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,440
How dare you!

434
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,280
Father.

435
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:53,840
Okay.

436
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,400
You can take the pill.

437
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,120
But promise me

438
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,040
you won't have any relationship with her.

439
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,840
I won't.

440
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,360
Are you going to defy father's order?

441
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,160
Come on.

442
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,840
You're being punished.

443
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,320
Father.

444
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,040
Kneel.

445
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,440
Kneel!

446
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,560
Father.

447
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,240
I've never defied you

448
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,520
since I was born.

449
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
But Ming Shu is my beloved.

450
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,200
I can't give up on her.

451
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,920
It's important to save her.

452
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,400
Father, don't worry.

453
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,880
I'll take the pill

454
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,920
after I come back.

455
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,360
You're all

456
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,240
a traitor!

457
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,720
Please finish the porridge.

458
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,200
Zeng Yi, let me do it.

459
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,560
You've done so much for

460
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
your siblings.

461
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,640
How can I bother you with the medicine?

462
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,400
Zeng Yi,

463
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,800
I'm like a brother to Brother Lu.

464
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
I'm more like a brother to Ming Shu.

465
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,080
We're good friends.

466
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,760
I'll do anything

467
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,480
for you.

468
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,960
Come on.

469
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,920
BSP is sent by Doctor,

470
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,360
he wants to massage

471
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,480
Ming Shu

472
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,560
time after time

473
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,600
to stimulate Ming Shu

474
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,520
before he recovers.

475
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,680
Here.

476
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
I can't recover.

477
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,560
I wonder if Ming Shu and Qing Zhao

478
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,720
have heard the wrong news.

479
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,480
Have you heard it?

480
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,920
The lady who was in the hall yesterday

481
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,280
was harassed by someone.

482
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,200
She was knocked out

483
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,520
after a few steps.

484
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,880
Really?

485
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Brothers of the Yuzi Clan,

486
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,880
are you talking about the lady

487
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,560
who was in the hall yesterday?

488
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,440
Yes, it's her.

489
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,720
Lu Chang, isn't she your sister?

490
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,360
Do you know what's going on with her?

491
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,840
No.

492
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,400
I heard she was beaten badly.

493
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,480
She seems to be dying.

494
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,600
But

495
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,360
the man has been poisoned to death.

496
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,760
It's a good sign.

497
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,200
Can you

498
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,600
help me to see the fake lady?

499
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,040
It's been two hours.

500
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,960
What's the difference between this and the mutiny?

501
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
At least you don't have to go to the park with the wound

502
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,080
and lose the face of the Duke of Zhen.

503
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
Do you only care about your face?

504
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,280
I'm not a girl.

505
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,040
Qingcheng,

506
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,120
just give your father a soft hand.

507
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,160
You're not worth it

508
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,480
to be so infatuated with your father for a girl.

509
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,840
So what if she's a girl?

510
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,560
I only know

511
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,800
that Ming Shu is the best girl in the world.

512
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,880
You bastard,

513
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,200
will you agree or not?

514
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,880
Get on with her!

515
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,880
How do you know her well?

516
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,000
For her,

517
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm no longer a soldier.

518
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,360
Isn't that what you want?

519
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,440
I'll take her in my life.

520
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,800
Take her in your life?

521
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,040
Qingcheng,

522
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,640
don't regret it.

523
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,680
You've suffered enough.

524
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,960
Let's see

525
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,040
what your parents will do to you.

526
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,200
Where's my whip?

527
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,840
Master,

528
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,720
will you hit me or not?

529
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
I'm begging you.

530
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Will you hit me or not?

531
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,160
You've suffered so much for the past ten years.

532
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,760
Qingcheng has been kneeling for two hours.

533
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,040
You can't hit her.

534
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,480
She's just a woman.

535
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,600
I'll be fine.

536
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,520
Mother,

537
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,840
you've been

538
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,240
so long that you don't understand.

539
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,160
You've done this for a woman.

540
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,400
You bastard!

541
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,200
Mother!

542
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,240
Will you hit me or not?

543
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,400
No, I won't.

544
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,440
I won't.

545
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,920
I won't!

546
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
I won't.

547
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,960
You have to take me with you.

548
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,480
Come on!

549
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,160
You have to take me with you.

550
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,120
Take her away!

551
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,120
Take her away!

552
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,640
Take Master away!

553
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,440
Take Master away!

554
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,600
You bastard!

555
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,960
Go, Qingcheng!

556
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,200
Go!

557
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,280
Listen,

558
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,560
if you leave,

559
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,040
don't come back!

560
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,400
I've suffered so much for the past ten years.

561
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,600
You're a loser!

562
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,080
You're the loser!

563
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,240
Yes!

564
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,960
You hit me to death!

565
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,280
Master,

566
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,600
take a break.

567
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,760
You're not a iron man.

568
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,040
And your wound...

569
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,040
But...

570
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,000
It's okay.

571
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
It'll be fine.

572
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,760
Go find a blanket

573
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,480
and cover it with a blanket.

574
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
It won't catch a cold.

575
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,800
Yes.

576
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,840
Yingshu,

577
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,000
wake up, okay?

578
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,920
OK.

579
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,600
Do you want to

580
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,000
get jailed?

581
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,400
There's a case of Lu Moyan

582
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,880
dis abused Daiyuan for financial fraud in Liangzhou Prefecture.

583
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,200
Can you really be at ease?

584
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,400
How dare you, Lu Chang!

585
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,080
You...

586
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,400
How dare you threaten me?

587
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,240
My lord.

588
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,360
Minister Mao wants Lu Chang to come to our province.

589
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
Why don't we let him go?

590
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Then we can...

591
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,800
Lu Chang.

592
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,720
You can't go out

593
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,040
without a reason.

594
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,000
But you have to be punished

595
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,760
for what you did.

596
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,520
Have you made up your mind?

597
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,520
You won't go back on your word?

598
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,240
I'll accept it.

599
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,720
I won't go back on my word.

600
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,000
Ming Shu.

601
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,040
Your brother is still in prison.

602
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
If anything bad happens to you,

603
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,680
what will you do to me?

604
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,040
Ming Shu.

605
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,320
Do you know

606
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
when I first saw you,

607
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,320
I trusted you.

608
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,160
I thought we had a lot of time

609
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,400
to let you

610
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,240
like me slowly.

611
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,360
I never thought...

612
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,040
Ming Shu.

613
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,640
Mother.

614
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,320
Chang'er.

615
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:20,920
Mother.

616
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,720
Chang'er.

617
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
How is Ming Shu?

618
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,720
The doctor said

619
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,480
Ming Shu,

620
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,480
go and see him.

621
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,000
I heard it...

622
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,200
He was sent

623
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,280
to the mausoleum.

624
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,480
It was clear that

625
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,280
he expected his brother to

626
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,960
Roman emperor Al nicer than you.

627
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,520
Ming Shu...

628
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,640
I'm back.

629
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,680
I'm Lu Chang.

630
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,600
Your Brother Chang.

631
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,520
Open your eyes and look at me.

632
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
I know

633
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,880
it's always been me.

634
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
I'm sorry.

635
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,880
You were so good to me.

636
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,320
I let you down.

637
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,440
You know I've never been so afraid.

638
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
I'm afraid I'll never see your smile again.

639
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,560
I'm afraid you'll never hear my feelings for you again.

640
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,160
Wake up, okay?

641
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Min Shu.

642
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,680
Brother, I'm leaving.

643
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,680
I'm leaving.

644
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Min Shu.

645
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Slow down.

646
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,560
It's so hot.

647
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,880
You should take out the shovel.

648
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
I asked Madam Lin to buy some rouge.

649
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
She'll wait for you to come back for dinner.

650
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
You can go now.

651
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
I know.

652
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,640
I'll send the treasure I asked for today.

653
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,680
Keep it for me.

654
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,680
Okay.

655
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,760
Brother Chang.

656
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,480
Try the red bean cake I made.

657
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
It's soft and sweet.

658
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
I don't like this.

659
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,840
There's also

660
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
fresh fish soup.

661
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,840
It's still warm.

662
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
I'm not hungry.

663
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
I was careless.

664
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
Don't move.

665
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Be careful not to hurt your hand.

666
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
You're so big and furry.

667
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
What if they hurt themselves?

668
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
I don't want to start over with me.

669
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,840
I just hope you'll wake up.

670
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Let me make it clear to you again.

671
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Protect you.

672
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
I know

673
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
you can wake up.

674
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
I'll wait for you.

675
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
You'll wake up, right?

676
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Lin Chang.

677
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
We're here.

678
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
Let's go.

679
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840
The moon shines bright

680
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,840
But where can I find

681
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,840
The happiness I've been longing for

682
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,840
The night is too long

683
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,840
My heart is crying

684
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Love and hate are endless

685
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Mother.

686
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

687
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,840
How do I know it's normal

688
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
The moon shines bright

689
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
But where can I find

690
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,840
The happiness I've been longing for

691
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:43,840
The night is too long

692
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Love and hate are endless

693
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
Mother.

694
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

695
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
Love and hate are endless

696
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Mother.

697
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

698
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Love and hate are endless

699
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Mother.

700
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

701
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Love and hate are endless

702
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Mother.

703
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

704
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Your Majesty.

705
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Mother.

706
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
Mother.

707
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
Mother.

708
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,840
Mother.

709
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Mother.

710
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,760
I...

711
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,240
Mishu.

712
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,760
You're awake.

713
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,960
Qingcheng.

714
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,600
It's you.

715
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,440
You're finally awake.

716
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,600
You're so haggard.

717
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,000
You've been here all this time.

718
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,960
It's good that you're fine.

719
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,000
You really look sponsored.

720
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,200
Qingcheng.

721
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,960
You always

722
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,600
take care of me.

723
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
It's not just me,

724
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,880
but Shu Jun, Wenian,

725
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,360
whole fuckabe as well.

726
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,840
They come visit you every day.

727
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,560
Are you thirsty?

728
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,440
Have some water.

729
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,480
Come.

730
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,680
Come.

731
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,440
So, the one who kissed me just now

732
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,080
was Qingcheng.

733
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,240
He...

734
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,640
Dongwang.

735
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,600
Dongwang.

736
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,800
Dongwang.

737
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,960
What are you arguing about?

738
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,320
I've told you.

739
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,200
I want to build the historical book

740
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,600
and present it to the officials.

741
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,800
These books are for Lu Chang to spread the road in the future.

742
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,000
You still come to bother me.

743
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,200
Stop building it.

744
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,320
Lu Chang was framed and imprisoned.

745
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,840
His father also needed a delay.

746
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,800
If we don't think of a solution,

747
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,560
I'm afraid even the provincial governor can't participate.

748
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,600
I only want to protect my brother fromスんなムChang.

749
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,600
Si hecho.

750
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,800
I can't deny your love anymore.

751
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,800
You must wait for me.

752
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
Stop!

753
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Wei Cheng, hold on to me.

754
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Wei Cheng.

755
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
You're awake.

756
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Chancellor.

757
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Don't move.

758
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
You're badly injured.

759
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Don't move.

760
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Or your wound will crack.

761
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Why is the Chancellor here?

762
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,800
Since we met at the academy last time,

763
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,800
I have a deep impression of you.

764
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,800
I was thinking of meeting you before the imperial exam.

765
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,800
But I didn't expect you to come here

766
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
and know about this.

767
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
I see.

768
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Thank you for saving my life.

769
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
All right.

770
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
The Ministry of Justice has come down.

771
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
This won't affect your safety.

772
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,800
I sent a doctor to see your sister.

773
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
She's awake now.

774
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
She's fine.

775
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Don't move.

776
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
You're badly injured.

777
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Thank you for saving my life.

778
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,800
I'll repay you in the future.

779
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
All right.

780
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,800
You're badly injured.

781
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,800
If you don't recuperate,

782
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,800
don't say you're going to the provincial exam.

783
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
I'm afraid you'll lose your life here.

784
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,800
You're going to the provincial exam soon.

785
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
If you don't go out,

786
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,800
you don't have to suffer this.

787
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Why do you take this risk?

788
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,800
There are many things in this world

789
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
that can't be done.

790
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Don't say you're suffering from fatigue.

791
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
Even if you live to the fullest,

792
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
it's worth it.

793
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
All right.

794
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
Good girl.

795
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Let me remind you again.

796
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,800
You're not a citizen yet.

797
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,800
You should study in the imperial examination.

798
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Remember,

799
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,800
the situation in the capital is complicated.

800
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
You should take the risk.

801
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
You should be careful

802
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,800
when you do things.

803
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,160
As for the

804
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
minister's suggestion,

805
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
I'll do it carefully.

806
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
All right.

807
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Lie down.

808
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
I'll leave you alone.

809
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Thank you, minister.

810
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
All right.

811
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
Let's go.

812
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,800
The evidence is sufficient.

813
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
The witness has made a clear confession.

814
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
The investigation is not guilty.

815
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
The case is on the spot.

816
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
Lu Jie Yuan,

817
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
I know you're innocent.

818
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,800
I've reminded the Ministry of Justice many times to make a quick confession.

819
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,800
Now this case is over.

820
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,800
I hope you don't mind the previous case.

821
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
I'm sorry.

822
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
I'm not a citizen.

823
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
I'm just an official.

824
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,800
I'm very grateful.

825
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,800
I'm sorry.

826
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,800
I'm sorry.

827
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
I'm sorry.

828
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm sorry.

829
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,800
I'm sorry.

830
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
I'm sorry.

831
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,800
I'm sorry.

833
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
I'm sorry.

834
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
I'm sorry.

835
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
I'm sorry.

836
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
I'm sorry.

837
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
I'm sorry.

838
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
I'm sorry.

839
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,800

I'm sorry.

843
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
I'm sorry.

844
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
I'm sorry.

845
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
I'm sorry.

846
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
I'm sorry.

847
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
I'm sorry.

848
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
I'm sorry.

849
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
I'm sorry.

850
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
I'm sorry.

851
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
I'm sorry.

852
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
I'm sorry.

853

I'm sorry.

854
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
I'm sorry.

855
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
I'm sorry.

856
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
I'm sorry.

857

I'm sorry.

858
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,800
I'm sorry.

859
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
I'm sorry.

860
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
