Love and Hate

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

The Long Ballad

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 18

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why is there such a hard pillow?

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Who has such a long neck and such a high pillow?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This Yin family...

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This Yin Shu Jun is indeed arrogant and domineering.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I still feel that there is something wrong with this matter.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It seems that I have to take the initiative to take the initiative.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It seems that I have to take the initiative to take the initiative.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's still a different room.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Brother,

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
God scared me.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How did you enter Yin's mansion?

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You...

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
How did you enter?

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This...

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You opened the door without asking the guest.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You even closed the window when you went back to sleep.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You are so careless.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How can I and mother not be at ease?

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You... You entered through the window.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Who... Who is knocking the door?

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Open the door.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Didn't you just say that you didn't ask the guest to open the door?

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now I am here.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Lady Yin Shu, it's me.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Mr. Song.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's really you.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why are you here?

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I also came to Yin's mansion.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I just want to come and see you.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So happy.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For the next period of time,

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I will stay in Yin's mansion.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You came to deal with the poison because you lack money to open the shop?

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You found the shop so quickly.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Where is the shop?

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you need me to help you?

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a coincidence.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That day, you and I met Chunxin on the street.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We drew a picture for her.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
A shopkeeper saw it.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
She went back to her hometown and gave me the shop.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's good.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Brother Song also knows that she wants to open the shop?

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You said that you mentioned to me.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
She is talented and will succeed.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It seems that I am the one who is the brother.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I know it.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's just a coincidence.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How can I hide something from my brother?

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I know that he loves me.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I really like jewelry.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want to know more.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is there any help for the recovery of the soul?

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Soul-disposal syndrome?

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't know.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't want to rely on my brother to support me.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I also want to do what I like with my own career.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Besides, my mother has agreed.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Brother Song is so reasonable.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't think I will refuse, right?

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you say so,

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
if I don't agree,

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
it's not reasonable.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Brother Song is the best.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But it's the opening of the shop.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's another matter to be a partner.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Brother Lu is right.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Although I am willing to stay in Yinfu,

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
but the lady is not easy to meet.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's okay if the job is good.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I can lend you the money to make up for the opening.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Stop.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I have decided.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The lady said

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
if I can find the certificate of the lady's change of temper,

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I will get a reward.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A reward?

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How can I miss such a good thing?

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Besides, you are here, right?

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have something to say.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If she bullies you,

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I will take you away at any time.

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I am not a bullies person.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Besides, after tomorrow's class,

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I will show you your master's name.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Last night,

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I dreamed of my father.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Since he died ten years ago,

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I haven't dreamed of him for a long time.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't be sad, sister.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Everyone will remember the credit that uncle made.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The two wives died.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The husband's wife and father were obsessed with love.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They didn't care about anything.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But since the marriage was decided,

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the wife of the husband was in a bad mood and died.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Have the other two wives

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
never thought of getting married?

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Your wrist is delicate.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It looks more delicate with the gold bracelet.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is new from the aunt.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
First sister thinks it's heavy.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Second sister thinks it's ordinary.

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The aunt gave it to me.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I like it.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It suits you.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Lu Ming Shu, who are you?

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You should go back first.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who are you?

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How dare you break into the Literature Hall?

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
These two are Mr. Lu and Mr. Song.

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Master told me

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
from today on,

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Mr. Lu will teach Mr. Xu for the time being.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Mr. Song will teach you the art of music.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Mr. Lu, I'll make a few friends.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If you have nothing to do,

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll stay here to listen to your class.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Isn't that Mr. Song from the Mansion of Duke Zheng?

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
King of Rui's cousin.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He actually came to teach us in person.

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Second sister, don't be too excited.

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
How can I not be excited?

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What a rare opportunity.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And that Wei Ying.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She's so beautiful.

160
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
She's so beautiful.

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
She's so beautiful.

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
She's so beautiful.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
She's so beautiful.

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
She's so beautiful.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
She's so beautiful.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She's so beautiful.

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And that Mr. Lu.

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's also a talent in art and looks talented.

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But he looks a little cold.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm just a little bit of a beauty.

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm just a little bit of a beauty.

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Jiangnan Xiaoguan in the east of the city.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The taste is very beautiful.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll ask you and Mr. Lu to taste it together.

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll do as you say.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What you learned today,

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Not only is there a good scene of war,

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
but also a good scene of war.

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll also tell you a good story.

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll also tell you a good story.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll also tell you a good story.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll also tell you a good story.

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll also tell you a good story.

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There is a good scene of war.

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There is also a private scene.

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why don't you play the piano for us?

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It will be more interesting.

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, okay.

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay, okay.

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, okay.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll play the piano.

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll play the piano.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll play the piano.

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,720
Captain wisdom is vital in repairing your weapon.

195
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,680
Look at his Childe.

196
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,680
I have to throw this off.

197
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,920
My God would not let go of his children.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,920
I think you're talking about

199
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,280
Mr. Lu.

200
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,800
Please wait, Lady Shu.

201
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,680
What do you come to me for?

202
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,200
I don't mean to hurt you either.

203
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,080
But I am never like this.

204
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,280
If I write it to you,

205
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,400
won't that make me sorry for you from the past?

206
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,800
I heard that when the late Princess Dowager Ying was pregnant,

207
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,480
she was very handy.

208
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,120
Can I ask how you feel

209
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,760
when reading these poems?

210
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,080
To clear the way that the heart becomes cold

211
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,120
when it speaks but imitates muzzles,

212
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,520
I'm afraid you can't go out every month

213
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
on the night of the class.

214
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,880
I'll pay extra attention to you

215
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,120
during the class.

216
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,200
And I'll report your whereabouts

217
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,760
to the music teacher in time.

218
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,040
I've done my duty.

219
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,760
Are you threatening me?

220
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,240
You always keep your word.

221
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,280
Please think twice.

222
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,280
What do you want?

223
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,600
Three rings

224
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,240
will make a big difference.

225
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,240
How dare you!

226
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,520
Miss,

227
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,160
if he reports to the music teacher every day,

228
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,040
you won't have any chance to celebrate your birthday.

229
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,760
Fine.

230
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,760
I'll do whatever you want.

231
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,000
Although we have a teacher and a student,

232
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,640
we're not a couple.

233
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,280
Let's let the half-wit lady

234
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,800
take care of this.

235
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,240
She'll take care of it.

236
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,720
She'll take care of it.

237
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,800
Lady Shujun,

238
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,800
I've made up my mind.

239
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,480
I've come up with another way.

240
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,480
I wonder if you can speak English.

241
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,880
Lady Shujun,

242
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,560
I'm afraid you can't go out every month

243
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,880
on the night of the class.

244
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,280
Lady Shujun

245
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,960
is not interested in her studies.

246
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,240
She must be affected by too many things.

247
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,600
I want to check her residence

248
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,640
and clean up all the things

249
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,920
that are not good for her studies.

250
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,720
The Lady will agree to it.

251
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,600
You dare to do that?

252
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,160
Stop.

253
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,240
I have one more thing to tell Lady Shujun.

254
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,280
I'm the elder brother of Lady Ming Shu.

255
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,760
You're brothers and sisters?

256
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,840
You...

257
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,880
You're just playing tricks on me.

258
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,720
You're right.

259
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll use my pen

260
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,440
to write down the way you treat your sister.

261
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
If you don't agree,

262
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,680
you can go to the English class at any time.

263
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,880
I have no authority,

264
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,800
but I'm very protective.

265
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,800
If someone is rude to my sister,

266
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,080
I won't give up.

267
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,400
Wait.

268
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,840
Shuang Yan,

269
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,280
wait outside.

270
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,840
Lady Shujun's room is really a beautiful room.

271
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,840
It's so luxurious.

272
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,720
I've never seen such a man.

273
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,440
Are you here to

274
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,600
open the eyes of me on purpose?

275
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,520
You're right.

276
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,680
I just want to see

277
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,160
what the room is like.

278
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Who told you to touch my things?

279
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,920
What's wrong with me?

280
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,880
Why don't you go to Lady Shujun

281
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,280
and see who she's protecting?

282
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,280
You...

283
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,560
Is this seal from Lady Shujun?

284
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,520
Write it down yourself.

285
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,480
If you break my things,

286
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,560
I promise I won't save you.

287
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,280
Lady Shujun.

288
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,760
You're so diligent.

289
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,200
Who did you embroider this?

290
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,800
Why don't you tell Lady Shujun?

291
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,720
Give it back to me.

292
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,040
Tell me who you embroidered it for.

293
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,600
Why should I tell you?

294
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,800
I'll keep it if you don't tell me.

295
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,720
I...

296
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,120
Give it to me.

297
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,080
No.

298
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,240
I said, tell me.

299
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,080
Why are you fighting?

300
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,120
Why should I tell you?

301
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,080
Give it back to me.

302
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,280
Why are you fighting?

303
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,000
You...

304
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,080
I won't give it to you.

305
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,880
Give it back to me.

306
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,480
Tell me.

307
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,240
You're fighting.

308
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,400
Should I tell Lady Shujun?

309
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,480
Lady Shujun.

310
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
Why is Lady Shujun angry?

311
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,320
Give it back to me.

312
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,280
Tell me, Shujun.

313
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,880
Tell me.

314
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,120
Give it back to me.

315
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,640
All right.

316
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,320
I'm...

317
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,320
I'm done.

318
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,880
Give it back.

319
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,880
Here.

320
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,600
Get lost.

321
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,480
Go.

322
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:15,960
Go.

323
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,800
Lu Ming Shu.

324
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,560
You did this today.

325
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,680
No one can save you.

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,360
You always say

327
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,960
those silly things.

328
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,520
Like,

329
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,560
get lost.

330
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,240
Get lost.

331
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,320
I'm tired of it.

332
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,560
Can you change another way?

333
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,120
You're so silly.

334
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,160
Are you tired?

335
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,880
What did you say?

336
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,280
The details of the room

337
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,320
can't be fooled.

338
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,680
Lady Shujun.

339
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,560
You're good at calligraphy and calligraphy.

340
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
You're good at calligraphy and calligraphy.

341
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,800
But you always look at me.

342
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,200
What are you pretending?

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,160
I'm pretending.

344
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,840
The angrier you are, the happier I am.

345
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,720
I want everyone to be afraid of me.

346
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,320
Lu Ming Shu.

347
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,120
Don't you want the ransom?

348
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,360
Don't even think about it.

349
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,440
I'll get you out of here.

350
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,280
Don't even think about it.

351
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,400
You're in a hurry to marry King of Rui.

352
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,680
Do you think Lady Yuzhan will let you go?

353
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,520
Without me,

354
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,160
I have no other wife.

355
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,200
What?

356
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,520
You'd better live with me peacefully.

357
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,720
I'll be with you until you get married.

358
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,480
Dreaming.

359
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,480
Fine.

360
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,480
Just keep on playing.

361
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,600
You keep on trying to

362
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,840
fool me.

363
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,520
I'll keep playing with my brother.

364
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,280
The days will pass.

365
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,560
Don't be so happy.

366
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,880
It's a wonderful time.

367
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,440
You...

368
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,400
Here.

369
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,480
I'll drink the tea.

370
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,280
I'm leaving.

371
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,960
Lu Ming Shu.

372
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,120
You'll be the reward for your

373
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,640
today's misdeeds.

374
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,080
Miss.

375
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,120
Mo Mo.

376
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,480
I made this especially for you.

377
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,960
Everyone else can share it.

378
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,120
I made all of this.

379
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,760
Lady Yuzhan.

380
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,120
Look.

381
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
You're so lucky.

382
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,360
If you need any jewelry to be repaired,

383
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,400
you can come to me.

384
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,200
I promise it'll be more beautiful than before.

385
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,920
Really?

386
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,840
I'll open a jewelry shop later.

387
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,800
If you need anything,

388
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
you can come to the workshop.

389
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Of course.

390
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,960
I have a favor to ask.

391
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,040
I'd like to ask you for help.

392
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,720
Just say it.

393
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,480
Lady Yuzhan.

394
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,400
Just say it.

395
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,320
I heard some rumors about Lady Shu.

396
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,280
As her partner,

397
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,520
I want to know something

398
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
to help.

399
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,880
Listen.

400
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,680
Lady Shu used to have a cat.

401
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,720
But she died without knowing what to do.

402
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,760
Have you seen anything?

403
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,520
I've seen it too.

404
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,120
Mother.

405
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,880
For Ming Shu?

406
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,680
Yes.

407
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,160
Yin's pillow is a little high.

408
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,520
I think she can't get used to it.

409
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,280
I'm afraid she'll be back soon.

410
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,680
Bring more clothes.

411
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,400
I've already brought it.

412
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,120
I heard

413
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,040
she's going to open a jewelry shop.

414
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,280
She was shocked.

415
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,960
Even if she forgot herself,

416
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,440
she didn't forget her love for jewelry.

417
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,160
I think she opened the shop

418
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,200
not simply to make some money.

419
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
She also wanted to find herself.

420
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,160
I used to think

421
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,560
she was just a smart and good-natured lady.

422
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,920
Now it seems

423
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,320
she has her own world in her heart.

424
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,600
It's much more generous than I thought.

425
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,800
You didn't know her before.

426
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,720
You always avoided her.

427
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,600
She's always been a good girl.

428
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,800
I'll go first, mother.

429
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,080
I've told you

430
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,600
to come back earlier.

431
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,800
You went to the mansion to give advice

432
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,240
and to give advice.

433
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,720
It's a rare opportunity.

434
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,280
Why didn't you come back?

435
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
I know my mistake.

436
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,800
Please punish me, father.

437
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,880
I'm going to be angry.

438
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,440
I, Song Mingjie,

439
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,640
only have you as my son.

440
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,120
In the future,

441
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,400
you're the only one who can make our family proud.

442
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,680
The imperial examination is coming.

443
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,520
But you wasted your studies.

444
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,680
Do you think

445
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,120
you can afford to treat the ancestors?

446
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,960
I'll remember your advice.

447
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,640
But yesterday,

448
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,360
I was helping my cousin.

449
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,920
Please forgive me.

450
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,640
King of Rui?

451
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,640
You're doing things for King of Rui.

452
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,320
I should support you.

453
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,560
But

454
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,800
the exam is coming.

455
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,240
Don't waste your studies.

456
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,760
Don't worry, father.

457
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,080
I shouldn't be at all free.

458
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,920
It's a family rule to go home before the exam.

459
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,520
You broke the family rule.

460
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,280
What should you do?

461
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,920
I'll kneel in the ancestral hall for an hour

462
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,640
and apologize to my ancestors.

463
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,680
But King of Rui's matter is related to Yin Mansion.

464
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
After I kneel down,

465
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,680
I may have to leave the mansion.

466
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,600
I'll stay in Yin Mansion when necessary.

467
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,200
Please allow me.

468
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,120
Xia Boili,

469
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,760
thank you, father.

470
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,680
Young Master,

471
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,440
be careful.

472
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,520
Come on.

473
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,520
Calm down.

474
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,680
You

475
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,160
are too harsh to the Qing Dynasty.

476
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,320
You always say sorry

477
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
when you make a small mistake.

478
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,920
You don't care about me.

479
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,400
I care about you, too.

480
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,920
If you are a natural,

481
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,000
you'll get used to it.

482
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,000
A child

483
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,360
can't be relaxed at all.

484
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,120
Besides, we are just sons.

485
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,960
We can't make any mistakes.

486
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,000
Look at her.

487
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,680
Look at her now.

488
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,120
She's a good student.

489
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,520
She's a good student.

490
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,040
Isn't it my credit?

491
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,120
I won't be so hard

492
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,280
if you can praise her in person.

493
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
Young Master, are you all right?

494
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,120
I just kneeled for an hour.

495
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,880
It's okay.

496
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,040
You are wise and strict.

497
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,560
But you kneel down for Lady Lu.

498
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,720
You are afraid of kneeling down.

499
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,000
Is it worth it?

500
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,560
You don't understand.

501
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,040
I wonder if you are doing this

502
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,320
for King of Rui

503
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,240
or Lady Lu.

504
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,600
I'm doing this

505
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,160
for you.

506
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,760
It's so dirty.

507
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,640
Take it.

508
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,640
Yes.

509
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,120
Let's throw it out.

510
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,920
It's a small cat.

511
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,280
It won't eat or drink.

512
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,960
I'm starving.

513
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,240
Leave it.

514
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,920
Lady Shuji,

515
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,320
don't you like cats?

516
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,040
My grandfather was sick in bed recently.

517
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,680
I'll treat it as a good deed.

518
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,920
You take good care of it.

519
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,400
Don't get in my way.

520
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,720
Mother, what's up?

521
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,840
Lady Shuji,

522
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,440
Lady Hwa will send someone

523
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,640
to marry you and King of Rui.

524
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,400
Before that,

525
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,120
don't make any more troubles.

526
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,760
The marriage is so important.

527
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,560
Why do you care about me?

528
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,880
What are you talking about?

529
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,480
Have you ever asked me for my opinion?

530
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,560
How do you know I want to marry into the royal family?

531
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,640
It's not a big deal.

532
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,840
It's the order of parents.

533
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,200
You are the eldest daughter of Yin family.

534
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
No matter what,

535
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,040
you can't be single.

536
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,760
In the capital,

537
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,520
except for the princess,

538
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,040
no other lady can compare you.

539
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,080
You should be a decent person.

540
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,720
Marrying into the royal family is your best home.

541
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,280
All right.

542
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,320
Let bygones be bygones.

543
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,080
As long as you are willing to change,

544
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,440
everything will be fine.

545
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't want to be a decent person.

546
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,960
Are you really going to force me?

547
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,000
How can I force you?

548
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,200
It's for your own good.

549
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,280
You...

550
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,400
You are so rich!

551
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,360
Miss.

552
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,200
The marriage thread can't be used by the title.

553
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,200
You have to put down some things.

554
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,080
Go through the unfulfilled ideal because it's in your heart.

555
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,400
Take this thing

556
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,520
to Third Uncle.

557
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,840
And bring me some other things, too.

558
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,000
Yes, Miss.

559
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,840
Yesread.

560
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
You're so thoughtful.

561
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Tomorrow, in the class,

562
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,280
those ladies will be drunk again.

563
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,520
I'm sorry, Miss Min Shu.

564
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,120
Miss Min Shu,

565
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,760
you should try to play a song.

566
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,880
I don't think I can play it.

567
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,120
I forgot a lot of things about my divorce certificate.

568
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,240
I heard about it from you before.

569
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,840
I didn't dare to ask you.

570
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,920
What happened?

571
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Nothing serious.

572
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
I just fell off the cliff.

573
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
It doesn't affect my life.

574
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,360
If you've learned it,

575
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,000
your body will remember the memories you've learned.

576
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
You might as well try it.

577
00:28:43,040 --> 00:29:09,180
The

578
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
No.

579
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Brother Anshan.

580
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,840
There must be something wrong with my playing.

581
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,080
Can you give me some advice?

582
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,360
I'll play it for you.

583
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
No.

584
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,800
Something's wrong with this part.

585
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,640
I don't know what's wrong.

586
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,360
I don't know much about this tune.

587
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,400
Sorry.

588
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
I can't teach you.

589
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Sorry.

590
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,840
I didn't know he was

591
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,680
sincerely teaching me the zither.

592
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,440
I misunderstood him.

593
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,240
If you want to learn the zither,

594
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,640
I can teach you.

595
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,040
Brother Anshan.

596
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,440
Brother Anshan.

597
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,040
Don't worry.

598
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,920
The zither is easy to understand.

599
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,160
Maybe you've got it.

600
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,320
Yes, brother Anshan.

601
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,600
Go do your work.

602
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,880
Brother Anshan is good at teaching.

603
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,160
I'll learn from him.

604
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,080
Take a rest.

605
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,960
I have something to tell you.

606
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,680
Sorry to bother you, brother Song.

607
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,400
Is this my pillow?

608
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,080
I brought it for you.

609
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,720
Brother Anshan is so sweet.

610
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,680
Brother Anshan.

611
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,160
Is this the blessing of being a sister?

612
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,960
If any young lady

613
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,920
can marry you,

614
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,960
she must be so blessed.

615
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,240
Give it back to me.

616
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,480
The water is not as clear as the river.

617
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,400
Give it back to me.

618
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,640
It's natural to remove the sculpture.

619
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,840
Brother Lu is so beautiful.

620
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,040
You're really a fool.

621
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,520
By the way, brother Anshan.

622
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,480
What are you looking for me for?

623
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,800
You checked the study of Lady Shu's room today.

624
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,040
Did you find anything?

625
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
How to say?

626
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,720
Lady Shu is good at painting and painting.

627
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,400
She even embroidered a painting.

628
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,200
It must have been taught by the Yin family.

629
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,960
I really don't understand

630
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,560
why she is so different.

631
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,200
Flower embroidery?

632
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,400
I also heard that

633
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,800
she won't go to the Literature Museum tomorrow

634
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,000
and will meet a distinguished guest.

635
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,000
Brother Anshan.

636
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,680
I didn't expect I could play the piano.

637
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,960
Did you teach it before?

638
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,640
You did like to listen to me play the piano.

639
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,920
If you want to learn it again,

640
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,800
I will teach you well.

641
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,000
I...

642
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,920
I can only teach you.

643
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,880
Why are you here, Sister Shuangying?

644
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,160
My girl

645
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,080
got this good oolong incense.

646
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,880
I'll send it to Mr. Third.

647
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,720
My husband is practicing the elixir.

648
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,720
I can't see him.

649
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,520
Leave it to me.

650
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,800
But this incense is very precious.

651
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,200
Please keep it safe.

652
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,160
Yes.

653
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,880
My girl.

654
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,200
You really have made up your mind.

655
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,680
Once the elixir is in the hands of the Four Heavenly Swords,

656
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,240
there will be no turning back.

657
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,440
You know I don't want to marry King of Rui.

658
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,840
What's there to hesitate about?

659
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,280
I'm not going to marry King of Rui.

660
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,320
If I'm found out about this,

661
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,320
will I get into trouble?

662
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,640
What trouble can you get into?

663
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,080
Here.

664
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,240
My mother likes to put the most expensive things

665
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,440
on the top shelf of the east door.

666
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,240
Do you remember?

667
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,120
Yes, my girl.

668
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,840
I know what to do.

669
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,920
Go.

670
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,000
Greetings, Lady Zhong.

671
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,280
Mr. Song.

672
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,520
Consort Fleur is worried about Lady Shu Jun.

673
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,920
She asked me to greet you.

674
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,960
Please visit her in the palace when you're free.

675
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,760
I'm honored to be able to have your kindness.

676
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,600
But I'm not good at

677
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,560
disturbing Your Highness' affairs.

678
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,280
I hope everything goes well.

679
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,520
I should pay my respects to Your Highness

680
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,840
and visit her.

681
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,960
Lady Shu Jun is generous and polite.

682
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
No wonder she's loved by Your Highness.

683
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,760
Since we've met,

684
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,520
I should go back to the palace and pay my respects.

685
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,640
I, Minghao Gen Tie,

686
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,920
accept your invitation.

687
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:28,920
Please.

688
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,480
Please wait for my good news.

689
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,880
Thank you, Lady Zhong.

690
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,680
Help!

691
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,280
Help!

692
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,960
Help!

693
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,320
Help!

694
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,320
What's wrong with these fools?

695
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,600
Don't damage our lives!

696
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,080
Are you all right?

697
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,040
She doesn't want to show her face.

698
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,320
Lady Yusheng!

699
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,840
Brother Lu.

700
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,580
Brother Lu.

701
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,100
Let her go back to her room.

702
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,220
Please, Brother Song.

703
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,600
We should be Xun Yi clients.

704
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,680
We better support her.

705
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,460
Sure.

706
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,840
The one who fell into the water was not Lady Ban?

707
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,240
Could it be that she fought with Lady Shu last time?

708
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,120
Lady Shu was so angry that

709
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,000
Xiao Cheng punished her.

710
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

711
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,240
Liang Jun,

712
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,600
shouldn't you be in the school?

713
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,720
I've been feeling unwell lately.

714
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,040
I've asked Mr. Lu for a leave.

715
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,040
I'm much better now.

716
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,240
I'm going back to the school.

717
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,040
I'm going back to the school.

718
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,240
But

719
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,360
Lady Ban of Sister Ban Du

720
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
will be fine, right?

721
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
What can be fine?

722
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,840
It's just an accident.

723
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,640
Uncle Yin,

724
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,240
it's about Lady Shu's safety.

725
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,640
It's better to investigate it.

726
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,240
According to what you said,

727
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,840
the incident of falling into the water was related to Lady Shu.

728
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,240
I was ordered by the Noble Consort

729
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,040
to come here for the marriage.

730
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,440
If this really involves Lady Shu,

731
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,240
you must investigate it clearly

732
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,240
in case of any harm.

733
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,040
I hope you can handle it carefully.

734
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,240
Yes. Yes. Yes.

735
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,240
Lady Zhong,

736
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
you're being serious.

737
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,840
It's just a misunderstanding.

738
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,840
But please rest assured.

739
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,840
I will investigate it thoroughly

740
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,440
and not let you be embarrassed.

741
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
In that case,

742
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,640
I won't bother you with your family affairs.

743
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,440
Goodbye.

744
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,240
Yue'er,

745
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,640
go and get a doctor for Lady Shu

746
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
and treat her.

747
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,640
Yes.

748
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,440
The End

749
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,440
You're awake.

750
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,840
Brother,

751
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,240
I remembered something when I fell into the water.

752
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,640
Maybe it's about the past.

753
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,040
The past?

754
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,440
What's the matter?

755
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,240
The matter...

756
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,040
The matter seems like you saved me.

757
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,040
I can't remember the matter.

758
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
It's okay if you can't remember.

759
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,240
Let's stop thinking about it.

760
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,840
Let's drink some ginger tea to warm up.

761
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,440
Go.

762
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,440
Here.

763
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,640
Thank you.

764
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,240
I thought you were just being too much.

765
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,440
If you almost died,

766
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,040
I wouldn't agree to let you stay in Ying Mansion.

767
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,640
I...

768
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,440
I just slipped and slipped into the lake.

769
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,840
I promise I won't do that again.

770
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,040
You still think it's an accident?

771
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,640
Someone spilled the oil on the bridge.

772
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,040
The oil is a liquid.

773
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,840
If someone spilled it,

774
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,240
they would report to the authorities

775
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,840
and make a notice to eliminate the hidden danger.

776
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,640
You mean

777
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,240
someone deliberately set me up?

778
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
Now that it's come to this,

779
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,040
I won't hide it from you.

780
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,640
I came to Ying Mansion

781
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,640
to investigate Lady Shu.

782
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,040
She will be questioned by the imperial censor later.

783
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,040
If she did it,

784
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,640
I will report to King of Rui

785
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
to remove the seal.

786
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,240
But I don't think it's her.

787
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840
Today is the day she met Lady Zhong.

788
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
It's about the reputation of the whole Ying Mansion.

789
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,840
How could she be so powerful?

790
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
It's really not me.

791
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,440
The lady who was poisoned was drowned in the oil.

792
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,640
Your mother sent someone to investigate.

793
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,840
Only the number of copper and oil in your uncle's house

794
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
is not right.

795
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,440
There is no copper and oil in his house.

796
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,840
It has nothing to do with me.

797
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,840
Before the incident,

798
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,240
only the double eyes around you

799
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,440
came into his yard.

800
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
The whole Ying Mansion

801
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,440
only sees you as the half-poisoned lady.

802
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,040
Who else can it be except you?

803
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,240
You are the one who put me first.

804
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,840
You said it was me without checking.

805
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
This is not my doing.

806
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,640
I will never admit it.

807
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,640
You...

808
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,040
Your Majesty,

809
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,440
are you not willing to marry the royal family

810
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,040
and deliberately make such a mess?

811
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,640
I said it wasn't me.

812
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,240
Why don't you believe me?

813
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,240
How can I believe you?

814
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,840
The rumor was false.

815
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,440
I was afraid you would investigate it

816
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
because of the blackmail.

817
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
But the result

818
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,440
really disappointed me.

819
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
How could you become

820
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,040
what you are now?

821
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
I'm sorry.

822
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
I'm sorry.

823
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
Your Grace,

824
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,640
please allow me

825
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,040
to say a few words.

826
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,040
Go ahead.

827
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,440
May I ask if anyone has seen

828
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,040
the double eyes taking copper and oil from his yard?

829
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
No.

830
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,640
I think

831
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
it's right to catch the thief and get the stolen goods.

832
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,440
The double eyes

833
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,840
only went to his yard.

834
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,240
They didn't get the copper and oil.

835
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,640
They have no evidence.

836
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,640
If we want to investigate,

837
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,440
we should investigate the whole mansion.

838
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
We can't let the one who is evil go.

839
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,840
We can't blame the innocent

840
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,240
for not being a ghost.

841
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,840
Your Grace,

842
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
we found the copper and oil in his yard.

843
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,440
Where did you find it?

844
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,040
I found it

845
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
in the house of Lady Shu.

846
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,240
How could it be?

847
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,640
You're a traitor.

848
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,840
Now the evidence is clear.

849
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,440
What else do you have to say?

850
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:21,840
I...

851
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
Do you still want to deny it?

852
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,640
The things you did before

853
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
haven't been settled.

854
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
Now you

855
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,840
are trying to kill people.

856
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,040
Luckily, Lady Shu is alive.

857
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,840
Otherwise, the love between Yin family

858
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,040
will be ruined by you.

859
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,240
You can't tell right from wrong.

860
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,640
Why are you talking about love?

861
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,440
You...

862
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,240
You...

863
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,840
Your Grace.

864
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,440
Your Grace.

865
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,040
Please spare the lady.

866
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,440
I'll go to the Third Master.

867
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,640
Shut up. Don't say anything.

868
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,040
They won't believe anything you say.

869
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,840
I...

870
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,840
Guards.

871
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,640
Take them to the ancestral hall

872
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
to be punished.

873
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,640
Yes.

874
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,840
Master.

875
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
If Lady Shu did it,

876
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,840
it's too obvious

877
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,640
to leave the oil bucket in her room.

878
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,640
Your Grace.

879
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,640
Your Grace.

880
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,640
Your Grace.

881
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,440
Your Grace.

882
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,240
Why are you shouting?

883
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,240
Tell me.

884
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
What's the matter?

885
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,840
The news of Lady Shu's murder

886
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,840
has spread.

887
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,040
And Mr. Shu

888
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,240
has made a story.

889
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,640
The murder of Lady Shu

890
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,040
have you heard of it?

891
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
What did he say?

892
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,840
I've sent Qingzhao to investigate.

893
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,840
He said

894
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,440
it's not decided yet.

895
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,040
But the Heaven Sword also said

896
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,840
that you have no idea

897
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,040
about He Bazi.

898
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,040
In my opinion,

899
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,040
we should just forget it.

900
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,040
I married Yin family

901
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,640
for the support of Grand Tutor Yin

902
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,240
and for the reputation of the court.

903
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,640
As for who the one who married Yin family is,

904
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,840
what does it have to do with it?

905
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,840
My niece is a noble woman.

906
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,040
But the great thing in Yucheng

907
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,840
must be taken into consideration.

908
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,840
Yin Shu's reputation is ruined.

909
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,840
I'm afraid the court

910
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,440
will take this opportunity

911
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,840
to punish you.

912
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,840
In my opinion,

913
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,440
it's not that difficult to do.

914
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,440
He has more than one wife.

915
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,840
The other two of you

916
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,960
have下落了一 rev 陆 Boulder

917
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,400
as the second daughter of Saturday communities.

918
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,840
Brian never introduced

919
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,440
ofı er wife in the licensing format.

920
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,600
I understand.

921
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,440
What is to blame

922
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,440
is only the baby's character.

923
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,840
Your Aut scandals

924
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,240
have made me worried.

925
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,240
Yin Bürger

926
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,440
has no choice

927
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,120
Sir, sir, Sir, what?

928
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,360
Remember my gesture.

929
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,040
We will never miss our chance.

930
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,800
We know it's not the end.

931
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:09,220
We have the

932
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,220
The End
