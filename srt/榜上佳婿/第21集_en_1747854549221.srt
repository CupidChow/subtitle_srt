00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Go Go Squid Now

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

I will never forget the time when we were young.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

25

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will never forget the time when we were young.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Long Ballad

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 18

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Please forgive me, King of Rui.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I am not a brother or sister with Ming Shu.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Her surname is Jian.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
She is the daughter of Jiang Lin's rich merchant, Jian Jinghai.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Jiang Lin's Jian family?

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Jiang Lin's Jian family?

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But the owner of the case of the case of Jiang Lin's destruction

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
who went to the death of Qiu Mo

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If I remember correctly,

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
this case is a case of a bandit.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Bandit is a slander.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Jian's family was killed because of this.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Or because they have evidence

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
to prove the innocence of the master.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you guess,

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I am afraid all the officials of Jiang Lin's family

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
have problems.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This case is heavily involved.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Do you have evidence?

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
King of Rui,

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I have no evidence.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So I dare not speak out.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But I guess

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
that day when Ming Shu was in the cliff,

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
he must have heard or seen something

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and then he was killed.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But he got a soul-dead.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He lost his memory.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It makes sense.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Jian Ming Shu

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
is probably the important witness of this case.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
His identity

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
should not be exposed too early.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Otherwise, it may lead to danger.

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You tell me honestly.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Did you hear that I

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
have accepted the position of Minister of Rites

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and then you told me this?

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I lied to King of Rui

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and was punished.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But since I met King of Rui,

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I found out that King of Rui was upright

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and kind.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's hard to get.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I admire him.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I have a sense of honor.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I hope King of Rui

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
can give me a chance to make up for my mistake

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and let me go to Dali Temple

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to investigate this case and clear the wrongs for the master.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Lu Cheng,

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
look at you.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You are so weak.

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You are so weak.

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
King of Rui, I appreciate it.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I am sorry.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You owe me a favor today.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
After the TV show is aired,

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
you can come to me

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and be the Minister of Rites

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and serve me well.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thank you, King of Rui.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The first item sold by Hualang Pavilion

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
is this

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
colorful phoenix hairpin.

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's very beautiful.

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's very beautiful.

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The phoenix hand

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
is made of western red gems.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's made of silk.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's very elegant.

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's worth a hundred taels.

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's worth a hundred taels.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's worth a hundred taels.

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's worth a hundred taels.

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's worth a hundred taels.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's worth a hundred taels.

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Everyone,

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
please give it a try.

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The higher the price, the better.

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's start.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll give you 200 taels.

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
280 taels.

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How did Lu Cheng take pictures of Princess Rui?

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's said that

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Princess Rui was a half-boss of the Guizhong.

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Half-boss?

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Please give it to Princess Rui.

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's Mr. Jiang.

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Shu Jun.

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Please pay attention to your manners.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
How can you call a girl your friend?

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Shu Jun.

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I know you're still angry with me.

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I came here today

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
to make up for your mistake.

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What I did before

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
was all for the sake of the people.

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I will only regret it

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
when I think about it later.

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If I can't ask for your forgiveness today,

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't forgive myself in my life.

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mr. Jiang has always been proud of himself

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and cherished his dream.

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What's wrong with such a noble man?

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Shu Jun.

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't hit me.

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I really regret it.

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Your Majesty, you can go to the scene of the auction.

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's also for the support of Princess.

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Princess will be very happy.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Shu Jun.

147
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Do you remember our vows?

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Shut up.

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You broke the engagement and caused chaos.

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Do you think I, Yin Shu Jun,

151
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
is still as naive as before

152
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
because of your words

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and I can forgive your shameless behavior?

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I have to thank you for your ungratefulness

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
so that I can marry King of Rui.

156
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yin Shu Jun.

157
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yin Shu Jun.

158
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let go.

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let go.

160
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How dare you!

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
King of Rui.

162
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I just...

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
King of Rui, don't misunderstand.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I just...

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You are rude to Princess.

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
How should you deal with it?

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You should be punished for being rude.

168
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If you are punished, you will be beheaded.

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
King of Rui.

170
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
King of Rui.

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I dare not.

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I just want to talk to Princess.

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
King of Rui, please spare my life.

174
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You offended Princess

175
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and you offended me.

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Tie your hands and feet and lock them up.

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Inform the Jiang's Mansion to come and get the person.

178
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The Jiang's family will never enter our mansion.

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Shu Jun.

181
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Shu Jun.

182
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
King of Rui, I...

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I didn't expect Princess

184
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
to be so satisfied with our marriage.

185
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I didn't see it clearly.

186
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Congratulations, Qu Nianzi.

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You have won the title of Zifeng official.

188
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The last 350 taels of silver is registered here.

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Congratulations.

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Congratulations, Qu Nianzi.

191
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Congratulations.

192
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Ming Shu Nianzi.

193
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Can I have a word with you?

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What's the matter, Nianzi?

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well...

196
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's about the privacy of the royal family.

197
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's about the privacy of the royal family.

206
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's not convenient for people to ask.

207
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Ming Shu Nianzi.

208
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In the jewelry,

209
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
is there a man's room?

210
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yes.

211
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There are many accessories.

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Great.

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
My husband is here.

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'd like to ask you to

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
help me choose.

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
In this case,

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'd like to ask you to tell him his favorite.

218
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay.

219
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He's so handsome.

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He must be a talented man.

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You have a good taste.

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Mr. Song is the second place in the competition.

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So,

224
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
your husband is Mr. Song.

225
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Wait a minute.

226
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Wait a minute.

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I think this one is very good.

228
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The jade on it is exactly match with the flower.

229
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But I'm afraid I can only ask for a price.

230
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
500 taels.

231
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How much?

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Are you trying to fool me?

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's not about buying or selling.

234
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It depends on whether you want to do it for the sake of the people.

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You...

236
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Ming Shu.

237
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Mrs. Lu.

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This...

239
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's about the state.

240
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Our family will do our best.

241
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't worry.

242
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't talk about 500 taels.

243
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Even if it's a thousand taels, I'm willing to.

244
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
A thousand taels?

245
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Mrs. Lu is generous.

246
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
She's really good at it.

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I admire her.

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Mrs. Lu.

249
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Please register the good money in the house.

250
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
A thousand taels.

251
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Can I talk to Mr. Song alone?

252
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Mrs. Lu.

253
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you and I are together,

254
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm afraid it will lead to a misunderstanding.

255
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If you have something to say,

256
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
you can say it in front of Mrs. Ming Shu.

257
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's right.

258
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
As a noble lady,

259
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
how can you forget the big room for men and women?

260
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's right.

261
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No.

262
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I just want to talk to Mr. Song.

263
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Open it.

264
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Then...

265
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This painting

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
is indeed what I went to the Lu Mansion to do.

267
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But other than that,

268
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I have nothing to do with Mrs. Lu.

269
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Besides, I belong to her.

270
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Please don't misunderstand Mrs. Lu.

271
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I thought I would send Mr. Song,

272
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
but my staff refused.

273
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Mrs. Lu.

274
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Your jade pendant.

275
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You...

276
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Your jade pendant.

277
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Today's jade pendant is a success.

278
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We should thank you in person.

279
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Mrs. Lu is so kind to you.

280
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Ming Shu.

281
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What the public said

282
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
is to save others.

283
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

284
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I know.

285
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Since you said you wanted to be with me,

286
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you don't have to care about my feelings.

287
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's annoying.

288
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

289
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Today's jade pendant is a success.

290
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Let's find a restaurant to celebrate.

291
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Actually, there's nothing to clean up.

292
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You can go first.

293
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Thank you, Yuan Ying.

294
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Go.

295
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let's go.

296
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
My brother was punished by King of Rui.

297
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The Jiang family is getting worse.

298
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What should I do?

299
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I remember this gentleman

300
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
was the leader of the wine party.

301
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
His future is unpredictable.

302
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So what if he's still a Hanmen?

303
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Three hundred and fifty taels.

304
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Four hundred taels.

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
One thousand taels.

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Today, only you donated one thousand taels.

307
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes.

308
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't worry, I'll remember it.

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yuan Ying.

310
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Where's Ming Shu?

311
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He went out with Mr. Song.

312
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Today, Mr. Song said in public

313
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
that he had someone he liked.

314
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The famous person is all for Ming Shu.

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Try this sweet soup.

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Thank you for helping me today.

317
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm warning you.

318
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We're husband and wife.

319
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We should share the same heart.

320
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He offended you with his words.

321
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He offended me with his words.

322
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What's the big deal?

323
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm just curious.

324
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Did you ever regret meeting Jiang Wenrui?

325
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I can't go back to the past

326
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
if I don't regret it.

327
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Instead of regret,

328
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'd rather let it go.

329
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Did you let it go?

330
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm a little girl.

331
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I shouldn't be sad.

332
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's just

333
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that man who didn't care about anything

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and loved and hated Yingshu Jun

335
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
is still in the past.

336
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Right?

337
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Your Majesty,

338
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I've let go of the past.

339
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
From now on,

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll be your wife.

341
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll be your maid

342
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and your maid.

343
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Please rest assured.

344
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But I don't want only these.

345
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Since you're tired,

346
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
rest early.

347
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

348
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What time is it?

349
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
There's a monkey in the house.

350
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's so powerful.

351
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Don't worry.

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Please send me to the entrance.

353
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
There won't be any problem.

354
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Do you want to come up and have a seat?

355
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
How's the view up there?

356
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This man is really different from what I see in high places.

357
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You

358
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
like Song Xingzhao?

359
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I like him.

360
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But I don't know the price of a relationship.

361
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Do you mean

362
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I should avoid him in the future?

363
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
My lady,

364
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
you don't have to avoid anyone.

365
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's your freedom to like someone or to date someone.

366
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Even you can't interfere.

367
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

368
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Brother,

369
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
your eyes

370
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
are so gentle.

371
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If you still don't show your affection to him,

372
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
please don't agree to it now.

373
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I mean

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
maybe after I get into the market,

375
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll stand on the foot of the court

376
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and have more power to your marriage.

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Then, even if I'm more than happy,

378
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I can't take your reputation as my bargaining chip.

379
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I know you're like this.

380
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But

381
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
can you promise me?

382
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll think about it.

383
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You still want to think about it?

384
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Wait.

385
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Did you forget something on it?

386
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Put me down.

387
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Lu Chang,

388
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
how can you bully me?

389
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Leave me alone.

390
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What did you call me?

391
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Put me down.

392
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Or I'll tell my mother that you bullied me.

393
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Mother.

394
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Mother.

395
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Then you have to promise me first.

396
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
To be honest,

397
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I've made an appointment with Qingchang

398
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
to enter the market.

399
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm going to get along with her like before.

400
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Really?

401
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm not lying to you.

402
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You said that lady was selling flowers in the Flower Pavilion.

403
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Isn't it?

404
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
She's a businesswoman.

405
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
She smiles all day.

406
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
How can she match with the family of our generation?

407
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I always thought

408
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
my son has a high standard.

409
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I didn't expect him to have such a woman.

410
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I really can't figure it out.

411
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Xiaolang said in public today

412
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
that he had a crush on her.

413
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
He's lost his mind.

414
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
From now on,

415
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I think he's thinking about the future.

416
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
How can he get another woman

417
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
like her?

418
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Madam,

419
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
don't worry.

420
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We can't persuade Xiaolang.

421
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We'd better start from that lady.

422
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll meet her in person tomorrow

423
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and knock on her door.

424
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Let her know

425
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
what is the right thing to do.

426
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Don't dream about it.

427
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay.

428
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Thank you, Madam Sun.

429
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Don't worry.

430
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Be careful.

431
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Thank you.

432
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Thank you.

433
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You're welcome.

434
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I have something to do.

435
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
See you.

436
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Thank you.

437
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
See you.

438
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Let me see you out.

439
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Brother Wei,

440
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
did you forget something?

441
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
No.

442
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yuqing,

443
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
would you like to talk to her?

444
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Mr. Lu,

445
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,080
I'll make some tea for you.

446
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,200
Okay.

447
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,240
Yuqing,

448
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,040
we've been

449
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,320
together for almost 18 years.

450
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,800
You've suffered

451
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,000
all these years.

452
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,880
You came for two children?

453
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,200
No.

454
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,240
Don't get me wrong.

455
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,560
I'm not here to fight for your child.

456
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,720
But

457
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,720
a few days ago,

458
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,000
I saw

459
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,480
Lu Chang

460
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,960
and Ming Shu.

461
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,760
They were so smart.

462
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,120
You raised them well.

463
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,520
I

464
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
feel guilty to you.

465
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,440
They're my own children.

466
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,960
I should teach them well.

467
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
You don't have to thank me

468
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,160
or feel guilty to me.

469
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,600
Lu Chang,

470
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,440
I saw you

471
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,160
when we were children.

472
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,760
But Ming Shu,

473
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,280
when we were separated,

474
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,760
you were just pregnant.

475
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,480
I've never seen

476
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,040
this child.

477
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,600
What's the purpose

478
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,360
of your visit today?

479
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,000
Yuqing,

480
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,360
I think these two children

481
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,920
don't know

482
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
I'm still alive.

483
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,240
Yes.

484
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,040
I told them

485
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,200
their father was dead.

486
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,720
Yuqing,

487
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,480
you're...

488
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,400
Tell me

489
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
how I should tell them.

490
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,440
How should I tell them about your identity?

491
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,760
When we got married,

492
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
I didn't know you were Lu's son.

493
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,520
After we separated,

494
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,480
you're married again.

495
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,800
We've been together for 18 years.

496
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,440
I didn't know you're

497
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,640
the superior minister.

498
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,360
Yuqing.

499
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,280
Tell me how I should tell them.

500
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,160
Lu Wenhan.

501
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:17,100
It's really a

502
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,800
nice place.

503
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,440
persistently designing

504
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,680
constables' drawing,

505
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,960
he wasn't able

506
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,920
to heal Leng Ziyan

507
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,720
like anyone else.

508
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,680
But today he was wrong.

509
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,800
You must be smart to understand

510
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,240
what kind of mansion the Duke Mansion is.

511
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,720
The marriage of Xiaolang

512
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,200
is under the supervision of the nobles

513
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,000
and the old state.

514
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,120
The girl you will marry

515
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,080
will be the most beautiful girl in the capital.

516
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,240
Please

517
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,160
understand Mrs. Song's painstaking effort

518
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,320
and stay away from Xiaolang.

519
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,680
Otherwise...

520
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,480
Otherwise what?

521
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,440
You always mention the differences between families.

522
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,440
But in my eyes,

523
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,240
royal family, nobility and common people

524
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,320
are all the same.

525
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,000
There is no difference between high and low.

526
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,640
If you use this to fool me,

527
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,160
please leave now.

528
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,960
It's not easy to leave.

529
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,600
What a smart girl!

530
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,600
My lady,

531
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,240
I'll tell you the truth today.

532
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,840
According to your family background,

533
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,400
even if your brother is the first rank official,

534
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,400
he doesn't deserve my Xiaolang.

535
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,600
I hope you can be good to yourself.

536
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,200
You said I was going to marry your Xiaolang.

537
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,760
What can you do to me?

538
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,360
You...

539
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,240
You...

540
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,080
You shameless woman!

541
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,160
Is this how your family calls you?

542
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,440
You are indeed the daughter of a widow.

543
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,400
You have a mother and no father.

544
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,360
Then I'll educate you for your parents.

545
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,160
What are you doing?

546
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,400
You old woman!

547
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Go back and tell that Song Mingjie old woman

548
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,600
that my daughter Lu Wenhan

549
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,960
is married to the royal family.

550
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,360
What is her Song family?

551
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,760
What can't she marry?

552
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,640
Get out!

553
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,640
Wenhan?

554
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,640
Go, go, go.

555
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,360
Don't be afraid.

556
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,440
I'll help you.

557
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,600
If you really want to marry that Song's son,

558
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,600
I'll make him come to marry you.

559
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,040
I...

560
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,480
No.

561
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,720
He can't.

562
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,200
Brother,

563
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,680
he said he's my father.

564
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,200
But he's not the same.

565
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,880
Help her, please.

566
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,440
I still have something important

567
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,280
to tell Minister Lu.

568
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,520
Go ahead.

569
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,880
Lu Ask?

570
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,240
Lu Ask!

571
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,120
She startedNet of Scold

572
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
twenty years ago.

573
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,640
a embroidered woman in Wenzhou.

574
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,680
In order to escape from the marriage,

575
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,240
she was saved by your father.

576
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,080
Lu Wenhan

577
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,720
was the eldest son of the Lu family.

578
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,680
He was also angry with your grandfather

579
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,040
and ran away from home.

580
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,720
He never came home for many years.

581
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
Mother didn't know his real identity at that time.

582
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,360
He hid his identity

583
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,400
and married me without a care.

584
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,680
When Chang was four years old,

585
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,400
I was pregnant again.

586
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,000
Not long after, a big flood broke out in Wuhu.

587
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
He was on the Yizhou Island.

588
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,000
We both experienced life and death

589
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,760
before we escaped from the danger.

590
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,960
Was I the child that mother was pregnant with?

591
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,200
Of course, that child couldn't be saved.

592
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,000
But he could only make mistakes.

593
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,280
Who else could it be?

594
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,080
Mother.

595
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,480
After that,

596
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,080
I looked for Lu Wenhan everywhere.

597
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,480
I only found him two years later.

598
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,520
But I found out that he had another identity.

599
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,120
He had already moved to another room in the capital.

600
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,280
I took you to Jiangli with all my might.

601
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,520
After that,

602
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,920
I never went to see him again.

603
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,720
Mother.

604
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,760
Since he had no feelings,

605
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,480
we'll just pretend that he never came.

606
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,000
You can't say that.

607
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,680
I heard from him today

608
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,320
that he didn't look for us at that time.

609
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,720
He just thought that we had already left the disaster

610
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,200
and your grandfather was ill.

611
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,120
So he went back to the Lu family to take over the family business

612
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,320
and get married.

613
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,200
He and I have no feelings anymore.

614
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,800
We have no relationship with each other.

615
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,640
But you two are different.

616
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,480
Do you want to be patient with this father?

617
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,400
You decide for yourself.

618
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,760
I dare not to give birth to him.

619
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,120
From now on,

620
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,960
you don't have to let go of this child.

621
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,080
I used to be mother's son.

622
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,240
I will only be mother's son in the future.

623
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,880
Come on.

624
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,360
Ah Xiu, you're right.

625
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,240
He didn't have to take more stress out of me.

626
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,680
We two made it through together.

627
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,280
Now everything is going well.

628
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,860
Dhruva has made of his daughter

629
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,120
heretch moetenarlika.

630
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,560
From now on, we'll take good care of you.

631
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,760
Don't ride that Lu family shine.

632
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:40,920
Okay?

633
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,000
Mom said everything is fine with her.

634
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,120
Can throw away clothes

635
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,440
and myself.

636
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,080
We're both innocent.

637
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,120
A Nope girlfriend.

638
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,160
Who?

639
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,520
I feel the same way.

640
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,200
How should I feel now?

641
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
She's too strong.

642
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,120
Mom has blade lies.

643
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,080
I'm sorry.

644
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,880
Brother,

645
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,320
you don't have to

646
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
force yourself in front of me.

647
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,640
I know you're upset.

648
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,840
Just tell me

649
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,760
what you want to say.

650
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,680
I've always known

651
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,280
my father didn't die.

652
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,640
I just didn't expect

653
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,120
you to be the Minister of the Imperial Court.

654
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,200
You know that?

655
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,480
I was four years old.

656
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,120
I don't remember much.

657
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,720
But I remember clearly

658
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,240
that one day, my mother brought me

659
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,800
to a noble family.

660
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,680
She said she wanted to find my father.

661
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,840
But she was kicked out.

662
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,000
She cried and dragged me away

663
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,800
so that I wouldn't turn back.

664
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,720
All these years,

665
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,000
my father's life was in danger.

666
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,000
I know it's my mother's determination.

667
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,920
I never broke her.

668
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,040
She never suffered.

669
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,840
But I know

670
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,240
how much she suffered.

671
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,240
Brother, you're right.

672
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,880
I lost my memory,

673
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,800
but I know

674
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,160
I've already taken the responsibility of taking care of my family.

675
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,040
Brother,

676
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,280
you've suffered so much.

677
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,480
And you've suffered alone every time.

678
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,680
I feel bad for you.

679
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,200
So even if she's a noble family,

680
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,760
it doesn't matter to me.

681
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,360
I have you and my mother.

682
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,160
That's enough.

683
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,560
But you...

684
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,560
What do you think?

685
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,960
I...

686
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,160
I lost my memory.

687
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,280
I can't remember the past.

688
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,840
I'm not excited

689
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
or angry

690
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,080
with that Minister Lu.

691
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,960
I even think

692
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,880
my father shouldn't be like that.

693
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,080
But if he's not like that,

694
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,240
what would he be like?

695
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,040
It's okay.

696
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,600
If you can't remember, then forget it.

697
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,040
I...

698
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,400
So for me,

699
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,680
you're the same.

700
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,680
You and my mother are the most important.

701
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,400
It doesn't matter if I can't find my father.

702
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,680
It's so sudden today.

703
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,880
If...

704
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,000
If there's something more unexpected in the future,

705
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,840
can you bear it?

706
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,280
For example?

707
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,880
What did I tell you?

708
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,560
Lu Wenhan

709
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,680
was a tyrant in the capital.

710
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,480
He's been a guard for decades.

711
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,680
He's always been a coward.

712
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,120
When my father saw him,

713
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,720
he had to call him Brother Lu.

714
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,480
Why did you bother him?

715
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,040
How would I know

716
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,400
that Brother Lu Chang

717
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,880
is the daughter of Minister's son?

718
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,520
Even so,

719
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,800
even if Lu Mingxu

720
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,560
is a phoenix,

721
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,840
he can't change

722
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,520
the fact that he's a guard.

723
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,720
I mean...

724
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,600
I can only say this

725
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,040
at home.

726
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,880
I can't go out and make trouble.

727
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,440
I think

728
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,640
you should take her

729
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,120
to her house

730
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,120
and apologize to her.

731
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,080
I...

732
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,920
I'll apologize to Mingxu.

733
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,600
Mother,

734
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,400
you sent someone to humiliate Mingxu

735
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,680
and humiliate her.

736
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,960
How could you do this?

737
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,640
It's not what you did in the Mansion of Duke of the State.

738
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,440
You actually blame me

739
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,600
for that kind of woman?

740
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,840
It has nothing to do with you.

741
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,120
Mingxu is the one who suffered.

742
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,480
It has nothing to do with

743
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
whether she's the daughter of Minister's son.

744
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,000
You're kind and reasonable.

745
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,480
You should be respected and kind.

746
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,280
If you humiliate her again,

747
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,480
I'll never forgive you.

748
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,960
Stop right there!

749
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,920
What's so good about that Lu Mingxu

750
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,640
that you talk to me like this?

751
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,160
Look at him!

752
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,000
What am I looking at?

753
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,160
You're the one who's used to it.

754
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,480
Now that we're back to the point,

755
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,640
Lu Wenhan

756
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,160
is the Minister's daughter.

757
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,240
The position of the court is in her hands.

758
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,640
Since she's her daughter,

759
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,400
what can we Song family say?

760
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,960
You'd better think about

761
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,520
the apology.

762
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,560
You...

763
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,400
I'll do whatever you say.

764
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,800
I won't allow

765
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,600
such a wild girl

766
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,720
to be my daughter-in-law.

767
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,760
Listen,

768
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,520
this family

769
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,320
has neither me nor her.

770
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,480
Jinmei!

771
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,160
Jinmei!

772
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,560
Jinmei!

773
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,240
Hurry up!

774
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,760
Pack my luggage!

775
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,720
Pack my luggage!

776
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,480
I can't take

777
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,320
this home anymore!

778
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,320
Minister.

779
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,320
Minister.

780
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,760
Please wait.

781
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,520
What's the matter, Minister Song?

782
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,400
Mr. Lu.

783
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,240
Some days ago,

784
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,040
my husband

785
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,320
had an affair.

786
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,360
I already knew it.

787
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,960
I don't know

788
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,560
if we're in love.

789
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,080
So I offended Mr. Lu.

790
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,320
By the way,

791
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,040
I've already served

792
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,240
my husband.

793
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,320
I hope Mr. Lu

794
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,240
won't take it

795
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
to heart.

796
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,080
Mr. Song.

797
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,480
You have the time to apologize.

798
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,400
Why don't you go home

799
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,920
and take care of your family?

800
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,720
My daughter-in-law

801
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,840
will take care of her.

802
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,680
You don't have to

803
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,800
be so strict.

804
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,760
Goodbye.

805
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,440
Yep.

806
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,000
I...

807
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,960
I...

808
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,240
Dear.

809
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,400
You have to be cautious

810
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,640
before entering the inn.

811
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,480
Do not make any mistake.

812
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,160
Your Majesty.

813
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,640
Long live Your Majesty.

814
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,440
You are all the backbone

815
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,920
of our country.

816
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,560
No need to be polite.

817
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,480
Come on.

818
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

819
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,120
Your Majesty.

820
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,200
As the saying goes,

821
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,760
those who don't follow the law

822
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,840
will be the most powerful in the world.

823
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,880
Wu Da'an has his own system.

824
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,840
He is well-known

825
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,520
and fair.

826
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,880
He will rule the country.

827
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,400
So I want to ask you

828
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
whether the old case

829
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,520
is because of the old betrayal

830
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,160
or because of the re-election.

831
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,360
You can make your comments.

832
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,320
There is no everywhere for you to use the invented technique.

833
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,400
Any usually

834
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,320
depends on its position and Budget.

835
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,320
If youintelligent about the old cases,

836
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,920
you won't be able to ça干

837
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,060
with choir.

838
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,960
еди do as I command.

839
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,440
However, you can have a clear record about the master wanted.

840
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,320
The law is also DIALOGUE.

841
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,260
Jia NI TE 오래

842
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,400
a mass Secret fantasies

843
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,600
Which method to use...

844
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,200
Brilliant!

845
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,040
Great!

846
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,680
You're a good man.

847
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,320
If you're a traitor

848
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,680
or a dictator

849
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,440
and you're accused of being innocent,

850
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,600
the world will be in chaos.

851
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,360
So,

852
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,920
what you said about the long-term law

853
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,680
is the way to rule the country.

854
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,200
Great!

855
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,480
Great!

856
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

857
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,360
Your Majesty,

858
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,240
I've learned a lot from my students.

859
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,960
There will bees fuiatu secrets

860
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,920
by Hollywood Channel.

861
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,880
If aggressor companies

862
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,200
believe there are sesi mumbling pollution by law in China,

863
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,840
they'll beWORTHY monster.

864
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,640
It's the same as nailing on the head.

865
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,520
In other words,

866
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,920
there're three ways.

867
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,680
Firstly,hrade the viagra

great power.

870
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,720
Secondly,

872
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,680

vilaiaginadi.

876
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,120
The 160 act

877
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,320
is a perfect bet for His Majesty.

878
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,400
It explains the benevolence of His Majesty

879
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,680
and the game plan.

880
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,080
I've heard everything.

881
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,760
Now I'll announce the first three chariots.

882
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,680
The winner of this exam is...

883
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
What are you doing?

884
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,080
Today is the top three.

885
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,480
It's a good day to ride a horse.

886
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,080
The whole hall is full of people.

887
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,880
The whole hall is full of people.

888
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,480
It's a good day to ride a horse.

889
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
The whole hall is full of

890
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,280
no matter the nobles or the common people.

891
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,080
Everyone wants to see the style of Zhuang Yilang.

892
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,480
Of course, I'll help you

893
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,880
to dress up as a man.

894
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:27,880
I...

895
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,680
The whole hall is full of men.

896
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,080
How can you be behind?

897
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:35,480
Don't move.

898
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,880
Don't move.

899
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,080
Okay.

900
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,280
You forgot to feed me.

901
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,680
I'll feed you.

902
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,880
You don't need this, do you?

903
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,880
It smells good.

904
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
Don't move.

905
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,280
Don't move your face.

906
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,080
You're so pure and innocent.

907
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,480
You're not like others.

908
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,280
Okay.

909
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,480
Brother.

910
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,280
The last step.

911
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,080
Just right.

912
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,080
No...

913
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,480
No...

914
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,480
Come here.

915
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,680
No...

916
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,120
Naughty clearly rides a horse across

917
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,000
the ->

918
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,680
The shooting star unusually

919
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,080
Derek-like

920
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:17,080
The snow has appeared and the moon has gone

921
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,080
Missing is like a flower, like a flower, like a waste

922
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,080
The snow is full of snow, only the moon is full

923
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,080
Only then can I reach the end of the world

924
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,080
If memories are like the winter of the six years

925
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,080
The moon hides my blood

926
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,080
The stars are clear, the wind is blowing, the next life is a miracle

927
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,080
The beauty is in the bustle, the world is too unfathomable

928
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,080
The frost is like the four seasons, the snow is falling

929
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,080
The moon hides my blood

930
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,080
The world is too unfathomable

931
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,080
The world is too unfathomable

932
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,080
The moon hides my blood

933
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,080
The wind is blowing, the next life is a miracle

934
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:45,080
The world is too unfathomable

935
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:51,080
Don't miss the white hair

936
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:58,080
Once the heart is like a flower, the next life is a miracle

937
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:04,080
The beauty is in the bustle, the wind is blowing

938
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:09,080
The world is too unfathomable

939
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:16,080
The world is too unfathomable

940
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:22,080
The wind is blowing, the next life is a miracle

941
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:28,080
The world is too unfathomable

942
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:35,080
If the scenery is clear, can I return to the wind

943
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:42,080
A kind of love is lost in the heart

944
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,080
The long night is full of books

945
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:54,080
I can't count the輪廓 of missing you

946
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:01,080
If the sea is long, the moon is long, the song is long, the song is long

947
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:08,080
The more I look, the more I forget, the more I hate

948
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:18,080
I'm willing to forget the past, the past is like a dream
