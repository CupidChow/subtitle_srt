00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

42
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,580
Is it true that I'm an ordinary adult?

43
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,440
There are so many AIDS patients around.

44
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:39,980
I heard that my

45
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,980
journal's followers

46
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,380
I just don't know when the wedding will be held.

47
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,140
The official has made an oral order.

48
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,860
The wedding will be held next month.

49
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,460
You deliberately mentioned the wedding date.

50
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,820
Is there another meaning?

51
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,580
That's right.

52
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,340
After leaving Yin Mansion,

53
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,020
I asked my friend to check it privately.

54
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,700
I found out that Yin Xianjun was promoted behind the scenes.

55
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,140
There are other people who are fighting for the marriage.

56
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,260
Who are they?

57
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,620
Yin Xianjun's aunt

58
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,260
is from the Tianshi family.

59
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,420
She is the head of the imperial censorate

60
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,500
and the son of Tian Chongju.

61
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,220
Fortunately, Yin Xianjun

62
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,500
doesn't know this.

63
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,500
He thinks that the Tianshi family

64
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,700
really loves him.

65
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,580
Your Majesty,

66
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,140
isn't Tian Chongju the trusted man of Prince Yu?

67
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,980
The Tianshi family

68
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,540
also works for Prince Yu.

69
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,740
In this way,

70
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,020
Tianshi has always been loyal before.

71
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,540
Now it seems

72
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,420
he has fallen for Prince Yu.

73
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,900
The new government

74
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,580
has always been the Prince Yu's fan of the court.

75
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,380
Now he is also interested in Prince Rui's marriage.

76
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,980
I think his ambition and means

77
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,780
should be obvious to you.

78
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,060
I understand what you mean.

79
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,220
You are well-versed in the court situation and strength.

80
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,980
You will be successful in the future.

81
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,660
Say it.

82
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,180
What do you want?

83
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,220
It doesn't take long to serve Prince Rui.

84
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,740
But there is one thing

85
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,300
only Prince Rui can help.

86
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,540
Go ahead.

87
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,140
I heard that the official family

88
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,220
intends to let Prince Rui lead the Dali Temple.

89
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,980
I want to ask Prince Rui

90
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,500
to investigate an old case.

91
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,260
Is it the case of Su Changhua's corruption

92
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,220
in the mansion of Jiang Lin?

93
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,540
Since I want to use you,

94
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,660
how can I not understand your experience?

95
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,700
The past is just for people.

96
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,820
The past is a trap.

97
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,380
Please help me to get justice.

98
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,540
I have checked the files.

99
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,940
This case is a solid evidence.

100
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,180
Among the witnesses pointing to Su Changhua,

101
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,660
there is a popular friend

102
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,100
who is his new wife.

103
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,580
If Su Changhua is innocent,

104
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,380
how is his new wife related to the corruption?

105
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,740
I have found out

106
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,340
the whereabouts of Liu Xiankun's adopted daughter.

107
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,300
Maybe I can get some clues from her.

108
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,340
I wanna know the cause.

109
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,900
If I wanna investigate the case,

110
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,420
I need full reasons.

111
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,780
It depends on whether

112
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,140
you're capable or not.

113
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,980
Why are you so worried?

114
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,100
I'm thinking about Brother Lu.

115
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,820
What?

116
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,140
About him?

117
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,460
When I saw Brother Lu talking about the government affairs,

118
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,180
he was a little angry,

119
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,620
but he was also very serious.

120
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,660
I only feel like

121
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,100
I'm writing a poem to clear my mind

122
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,220
and drinking some wine to calm down.

123
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,580
You've done a great job

124
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,580
in solving the case.

125
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,580
It's hard to...

126
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,300
Fei Ye,

127
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,420
I mean

128
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,100
I didn't feel like

129
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,100
talking about the government affairs with them.

130
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,620
You mean

131
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,540
you don't want to get involved in the case?

132
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,700
Well,

133
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,340
how is that possible?

134
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,260
Probably because I personally participated in the Yin family case.

135
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,660
I have a better feeling about it.

136
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:49,180
Then I'll can tell the 것도

137
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,540
I know something,

138
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,580
Put yourself down,

139
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,260
or someone will blame you for it.

140
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,340
You are the one who's been trying to stop me.

141
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,340
Gou.

142
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,940
Ai.

143
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
Heng.

144
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
Shu.

145
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,060
Good.

146
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,180
Lu Chang.

147
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,220
What is a gentleman?

148
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,220
A gentleman

149
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,540
can be a man

150
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,820
or a woman.

151
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
He has principles

152
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,620
and perseverance.

153
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,660
This is the foundation of a person.

154
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,460
Do you understand?

155
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,740
I understand, sir.

156
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,340
No.

157
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
Sir.

158
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,060
This is the three-day effort of the student.

159
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,860
Written by those leit hearts.

160
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,420
Previously, it was empty.

161
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,580
If the plan can't fulfill the citizens' wishes

162
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,180
and they have doubts,

163
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,340
they'd want every resort.

164
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,260
So is it.

165
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,660
Sir Su and I

166
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,900
are not only torture実 lets people down.

167
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,180
Only I need his mercy.

168
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,380
Fish datped to wind at all times.

169
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,780
He must raising learned ones

170
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,940
for the den penetration.

171
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,220
This is his grease.

172
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,180
Just a yield

173
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,220
66 free inch from himself.

174
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,420
Marry in marriage,

175
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,900

176
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,780

177
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,500
So much.

178
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,740
I honestly

179
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,060
don't need his mercy.

180
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,300
Mr. Tian바절

181
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,340
and mine

182
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,780
must bear Ilir brother and sister'sdan for a year.

183
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,540
Open the door.

184
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,740
The door is not locked.

185
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,780
Brother Ying.

186
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,740
Sister Mingshu.

187
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,940
Sit.

188
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,860
Have you got any news about Lu's family?

189
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,740
I've got some news.

190
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,220
Minister Lu

191
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,220
plans to invite officials from the Ministry of Rites

192
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,580
to attend the banquet for Lu Wencai.

193
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,540
The ghost is very important.

194
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,380
Not only did he invite the person who is more arrogant to show his will,

195
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,780
but also invited a couple

196
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,620
who are common people.

197
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,660
A couple?

198
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,420
Yes.

199
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,380
The musician is known for his dance.

200
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,100
I heard he's famous for his official dance.

201
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,340
He'll be in Lu's Mansion in a few days.

202
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,220
What do you think of my music?

203
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,180
Brother, you want to pretend to be an artiste

204
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,140
and enter the Lu family?

205
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,660
As long as I can find a way

206
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,020
to make this couple go,

207
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,580
I can replace them.

208
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,260
Even so,

209
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,460
the lady won't be able to play with you.

210
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,700
You can't do anything alone?

211
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,700
So I have to trouble you

212
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,100
to find a young lady for me.

213
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,380
It's a short time.

214
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,820
Where can I find a lady

215
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,020
who is good at dancing and has a good mouth?

216
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,060
Your brother will make it difficult for me.

217
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,180
You have one right in front of you.

218
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,180
You can't dance the official dance.

219
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,460
Your dance...

220
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,820
I'll learn it if I can't.

221
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,140
I'll practice more if I can't dance well.

222
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,820
I don't believe it. I can't learn it.

223
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,940
That's right.

224
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,980
You're a loser.

225
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,300
Why bother?

226
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,860
Why bother finding another lady?

227
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,020
No.

228
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,060
She has to work on the opening ceremony.

229
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
I'm going to redecorate this shop.

230
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,100
I've arranged it.

231
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,300
It won't affect it.

232
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,020
No.

233
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,460
How can I be a couple with a famous artiste?

234
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,300
I need to talk about it again.

235
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,900
Why not?

236
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,740
Go back to sleep.

237
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,180
Miss,

238
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,140
do you think King of Rui will agree to the engagement?

239
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,740
Since he wants to marry Yinfu,

240
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,820
he will definitely give him this opportunity.

241
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,940
King of Rui

242
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,500
Your Highness.

243
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,500
We're not married yet.

244
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,540
I wonder why Lady Shu Jun wants to meet me.

245
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm here to thank you.

246
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,140
Don't mention it.

247
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,060
It's okay. Sit down.

248
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
I was entangled by rumors.

249
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,100
You didn't fear the rumors and insisted on the engagement.

250
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,820
I'm very grateful.

251
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,420
Who said I didn't mind?

252
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,300
I think the name of the eldest daughter of Yin family is not fake.

253
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,980
But if the rumors spread out

254
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,780
if we want to get married,

255
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,780
it will be a shame for me.

256
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,780
But I don't know why Lady Shu Jun

257
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,100
has been tolerating the rumors for so long.

258
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,300
It's been so long.

259
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,460
King of Rui wants to marry me

260
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,300
to maintain the reputation of the marriage?

261
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,580
Not for reputation,

262
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,180
but for love?

263
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,900
Lady Shu Jun,

264
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,500
do you have feelings for me?

265
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,660
King of Rui said so.

266
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,180
I'm happy.

267
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,820
But don't worry, King of Rui.

268
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,700
I'll do my best

269
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,020
to do what you should do.

270
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,340
I won't be criticized by others.

271
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,380
That's good.

272
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,740
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

273
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,100
I have one more thing to tell you.

274
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,980
Why don't you tell me now?

275
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,220
What is it?

276
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,460
After I get married,

277
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,220
I don't want to be in the mansion every day

278
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,660
to annoy King of Rui.

279
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,060
I want to enter a jewelry store with my friends.

280
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,780
I don't know if King of Rui can take it.

281
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,540
As long as you do your duty as a princess,

282
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,620
and care about the reputation of the mansion,

283
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,380
as for the rest,

284
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
I can ignore it.

285
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
Thank you, King of Rui.

286
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,460
She left first.

287
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:31,900
King of Rui,

288
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,540
is it rude to allow the princess to do business outside?

289
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,700
Rude?

290
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,780
I've been doing that for so many years.

291
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,660
It doesn't matter if it's a ritual or a ritual.

292
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
Shouldn't you change it?

293
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,940
I'm sorry.

294
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,220
Greetings, Childe Lu.

295
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,660
Don't worry.

296
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,020
I'm a good speaker.

297
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,700
I heard you're going to marry Childe Lu.

298
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,340
I'm familiar with this.

299
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,660
Please have some tea.

300
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,180
Sir.

301
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,940
Sir.

302
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,020
Xiu.

303
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:30,980
Mingshu,

304
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,020
we've made up our minds.

305
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,820
It's you.

306
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,500
Just say it.

307
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,140
No one is more suitable than me.

308
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,940
Thank you.

309
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,460
Sir,

310
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,740
you're welcome.

311
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,220
What did you call me?

312
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,420
Sir.

313
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,020
Why are you so careless?

314
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,220
You're acting like a child.

315
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,940
Lu Mingshu,

316
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,660
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,940
No.

318
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,180
You can't even take it.

319
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,540
Don't push me back when you get to Lu's Mansion.

320
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,020
Good girl.

321
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,340
You'll be like this when you get back.

322
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,140
Am I?

323
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,100
Am I so small?

324
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,900
Why do you look more like her?

325
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,540
More like her?

326
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,140
Let me give you another hand.

327
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,500
The problem is solved.

328
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,580
But you...

329
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,660
What should we do?

330
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,940
Come on.

331
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,660
Come on.

332
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,180
Lady Mu Qing.

333
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,100
Childe Wen Sheng.

334
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,100
This is the place

335
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,900
where the dancers perform.

336
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,860
They're both handsome and unruly.

337
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,700
They're not from the martial arts world.

338
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,660
I heard that Mu Qing's Guanju dance is a piece of art.

339
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,420
It's even more amazing to use Wen Sheng's Taso song.

340
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,300
But look at his attitude.

341
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,220
He doesn't look like a man who practices martial arts.

342
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,020
I've heard that

343
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,820
you two are good at dancing.

344
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,420
You're the best.

345
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,260
But you're not as good as I thought.

346
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,420
Would you like to have a rehearsal

347
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,260
to show your appreciation?

348
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,180
So that I can go back to my master's home.

349
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,260
Since I took part in the martial arts competition.

350
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,740
Are you interested to take part in such a competition with me?

351
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,580
Come with me.

352
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,580
Come on.

353
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,060
It's not from what you said.

354
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,340
You lookض

355
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,660
Childe Wen Sheng's tה使 wirklich là fits.

356
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,300
Come.

357
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,860
Great.

358
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,660
The violin and the dance are wonderful.

359
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,060
It's really wonderful.

360
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,860
The violin and the dance are wonderful.

361
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,900
You two are really talented.

362
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,940
Now I can go to report to the master.

363
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,340
Ha ha.

364
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,300
Fortunately, you changed the dance.

365
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,420
You're not good at dancing.

366
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,340
But you're good at spinning.

367
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,260
Why don't you change some moves?

368
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,060
If others ask,

369
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,180
just say you will adjust

370
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,220
your feelings for this dance.

371
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,980
I was nervous at first.

372
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,260
I did sweat for you.

373
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,100
Since I'm coming,

374
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100
I must practice well.

375
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,900
But the dance

376
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,380
almost made me vomit.

377
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,140
You've been practicing for so long.

378
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,820
Thank you for your hard work.

379
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,700
We're brothers.

380
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,860
You're welcome.

381
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,460
Sir.

382
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,100
Did I dance well?

383
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,020
The official is here.

384
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,740
You're going to sleep on the floor?

385
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,100
No, no.

386
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,260
It's cold on the floor.

387
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,340
You have to take the exam.

388
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,660
What if you catch a cold?

389
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,660
I'll sleep on the floor.

390
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,660
I'm not that weak.

391
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,340
I don't want my sister to sleep on the floor.

392
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,180
Go.

393
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,260
I like to sleep on the floor.

394
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,900
Mr. Wen.

395
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,060
Mr. Wen.

396
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,940
Go.

397
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,220
The official is visiting you at night.

398
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,140
What's the matter?

399
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,180
This is the music score

400
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,260
for the next few days.

401
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,420
You two can practice more.

402
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,820
Put it there.

403
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,060
It's only a few days left.

404
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,380
Why don't you practice, sir?

405
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,020
Don't call me that.

406
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,220
I'll listen to you no matter what you say.

407
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,340
Wen Sheng.

408
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,340
Wen Sheng.

409
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,860
Who's calling you that?

410
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,340
Brother Ying is calling me.

411
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,020
Go to sleep.

412
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,540
I...

413
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,420
Be good.

414
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,060
Thank you for helping me.

415
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,380
You're welcome.

416
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,220
The reason why you look so familiar

417
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,500
is that you've seen me before.

418
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,540
I wonder where you are from.

419
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,940
Why do you ask?

420
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,260
I just saw you.

421
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,300
You're elegant and talkative.

422
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,860
I think you should be from my uncle's family.

423
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Am I right?

424
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,580
You're not a servant.

425
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,740
How dare you tease me?

426
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
Calm down, my lady.

427
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,980
I didn't mean anything.

428
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,540
You're a big lady.

429
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,300
I'll tell the official

430
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,580
and drive you out of the mansion.

431
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,060
I'm not a servant.

432
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,300
You're here to talk about other people's affairs.

433
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,620
Go and practice now.

434
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,700
Lady Yuan Ying.

435
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,020
Don't be so hard on her.

436
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,500
She...

437
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,700
She's just like that.

438
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,900
She likes to be with those beautiful ladies.

439
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,220
But don't worry.

440
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,020
She's just a coward.

441
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,220
She wouldn't do anything.

442
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,260
I'll teach her a lesson today.

443
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,540
We've been running around.

444
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,860
It's not easy.

445
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,940
Please forgive her.

446
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,660
Take good care of her.

447
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,620
Don't cause any trouble.

448
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,300
Don't worry.

449
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:06,980
If you keep doing this,

450
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,380
I won't care about you anymore.

451
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,620
What did you say to her?

452
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,820
You scared her to death.

453
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
I didn't say anything too harsh.

454
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,020
She was too self-conceited.

455
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,700
But that also shows

456
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,940
that she wants to hide something.

457
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,980
She's already been careful about you.

458
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,100
I'll do the rest of her work.

459
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,700
It's more convenient for girls.

460
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,020
She... She knows she's wrong.

461
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:31,860
Come on.

462
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,260
Go and practice now.

463
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,540
I'll teach you a lesson.

464
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,100
Wen Sheng.

465
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,020
Did you see Liu Yuanying?

466
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,460
What's your suggestion, Miss Ye Rong?

467
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,740
I'll tell you the truth.

468
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,380
If you're sincere,

469
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,740
you'll get what you want.

470
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,100
Really?

471
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,380
They say Liu Yuanying is a good girl.

472
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,500
Many officials and nobles are after her.

473
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,980
She's always in the dark.

474
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
In fact,

475
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,860
she and that man from the Lu family

476
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,740
are secretly having an affair.

477
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,700
You mean Lu Wencai?

478
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,740
Who else?

479
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,140
Thank you for your advice, Miss Ye Rong.

480
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,900
Liu Yuanying is in the Ministry of Education.

481
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,740
She's so unruly.

482
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,860
How could she be so easily fooled by Lu Wencai?

483
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,780
But I don't think Ye Rong is a joke.

484
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,700
Here.

485
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,980
Here you are.

486
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,140
Thank you, Mister.

487
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,780
As long as you

488
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,380
take good care of her,

489
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,220
you'll have enough money and jewelry.

490
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,900
Miss Yuanying,

491
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,060
have a good rest.

492
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,220
I'll leave you alone.

493
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,260
Wait.

494
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,260
Here's the bracelet.

495
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,980
It's...

496
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,580
It's too precious.

497
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,620
Just take it.

498
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,260
Thank you, Miss Yuanying.

499
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,420
I didn't expect that.

500
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,620
I didn't expect that.

501
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,020
I didn't expect that.

502
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,020
I didn't expect that.

503
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,020
I didn't expect that.

504
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,420
I didn't expect that.

505
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,860
But she seemed unwilling.

506
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,380
She just received the bracelet and gave it to someone else.

507
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,620
If she's the one who gave it to someone else,

508
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,940
why wouldn't she cherish it?

509
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,980
In terms of family background,

510
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,860
Lu Wencai is not of good quality.

511
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,500
I don't think Liu Yuanying is that kind of person.

512
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,900
It's really a big problem.

513
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,460
Could it be that she's being forced?

514
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,580
Then why didn't she report to the government?

515
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,380
She's an official.

516
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,140
She can't be so easy to deal with.

517
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,580
If she's on the stage,

518
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,580
Lu Wencai won't get any benefits.

519
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,580
What if it's a threat that's not easy to announce?

520
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,420
I'll talk to her tomorrow.

521
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,060
She's very alert.

522
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,020
Don't alert her.

523
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,300
Besides,

524
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,900
we have to lure that maid away.

525
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,460
Zi Yuan

526
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,500
always peeks at you.

527
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,460
He's seen you several times.

528
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,940
What do you want?

529
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,780
Sir,

530
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,740
have you ever heard of

531
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,580
the beauty of the South?

532
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,660
Lu Mingshu.

533
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,860
It's a wedding dress of Mr. Wen Sheng.

534
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,700
Your Highness.

535
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,100
Zi Yuan.

536
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,180
Zi Yuan isn't here.

537
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,300
You must be tired from the long night.

538
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,340
Then let's talk outside.

539
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,380
Two people are waiting for you.

540
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,180
motivations

541
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,140
Magistrate,

542
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,460
do you want to have a life?

543
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,480
What are you looking for?

544
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,660
I'm here to warn you

545
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,140
to watch out for Ye Rong,

546
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,860
my friend said

547
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,220
I'm much better known

548
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,260
than him in the church.

549
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,580
Since you know it,

550
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,020
I have nothing else to do.

551
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,540
I think the model you just played

552
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,180
is your childhood toy.

553
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,420
Who are you?

554
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,820
Why do you want to approach me?

555
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,220
What do you mean?

556
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,860
You're not Mu Qing.

557
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,460
The church has seen Mu Qing's sister.

558
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,260
They said she had a red mole on her right hand.

559
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,940
But you didn't have any.

560
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,340
Lady Yuanying.

561
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,300
You haven't answered my question.

562
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,260
Please make it clear.

563
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,100
Why do you approach me?

564
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,500
Lady Yuanying.

565
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,500
If I say

566
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,780
Mu Qing is a name

567
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,580
but not a person,

568
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
do you understand?

569
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,780
You're a dancer, too.

570
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,500
You've had a time when you were sick

571
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,060
but had to perform.

572
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,380
We've been running around to survive.

573
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,580
But we're human, too.

574
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,780
We'll get sick and feel bad.

575
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,700
What can we do?

576
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,180
Guo'er.

577
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,940
I'm Mu Qing.

578
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,180
But I'm not Mu Qing.

579
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,580
Now that you know our secret,

580
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,060
you'll take care of

581
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,820
our lives.

582
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,700
Please don't tell anyone

583
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,460
about it, okay?

584
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,940
No.

585
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,340
I can promise to keep your secret.

586
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,900
But in the future,

587
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,300
you have to take care of this.

588
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,540
Thank you for reminding me.

589
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,220
We didn't mean to approach you.

590
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,700
We're just afraid you'll get hurt by others.

591
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,180
I got it.

592
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,340
Thank you for reminding me.

593
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
I don't like to be close to others.

594
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,460
You can go.

595
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,460
Luckily, we figured out the right way in advance.

596
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,460
Otherwise, he would have asked us.

597
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,460
But it's good for him to know our secret.

598
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,460
Let him show some mercy to us.

599
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,460
He really doesn't like to communicate with others.

600
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,460
It's not easy to get close.

601
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,460
He gets anxious when I touch him.

602
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,460
Could it be related to his missing brother?

603
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,460
Or maybe Lu Wencai is threatening him.

604
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,460
We have to try to gain his trust.

605
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,460
We have to let him tell us the truth.

606
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,460
Eat.

607
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,460
Eat.

608
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,460
This is delicious.

609
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,460
Where did you get it?

610
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,460
I know you like it.

611
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
I bought it in front of Lu's house.

612
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,460
Let me do it.

613
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,460
The round eye is easy to stick on the flesh.

614
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,460
It needs to be removed little by little.

615
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,460
Are you patient?

616
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,460
You care about me so much.

617
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,460
Are you going to make me a round eye forever?

618
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
Why not?

619
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,460
I made it.

620
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,460
Try it. It's sweet.

621
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,460
You go out first.

622
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,460
Yes.

623
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
I'm going to the garden.

624
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
I'll go with you.

625
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,460
Okay.

626
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,460
I'll go with you.

627
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,460
You look different today.

628
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,460
No.

629
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,460
I went to my mother's place to ask her how she is.

630
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,460
She got a new flower shop.

631
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,460
She tried it on me.

632
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,460
They all said it was pretty.

633
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,460
They also asked me to put it on the banquet two days later.

634
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
You can have a look.

635
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,460
It's a new flower shop.

636
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
Did you get a lot of wrinkles on your face recently?

637
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,460
Buy some good powder and wipe it.

638
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,460
You don't know how to clean up.

639
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,460
You don't even know your servants.

640
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,460
You can't go out.

641
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,460
I'll go with you.

642
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,460
I'm going to the garden.

643
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,460
I'll go with you.

644
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,460
I'll go with you.

645
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
I'll go with you.

646
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
This is a gift from the Noble Consort.

647
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,460
It's a rare piece of your noble flag.

648
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
It's gorgeous and elegant.

649
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,460
What kind of mirror is this?

650
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,460
Everyone's wrinkles on their faces are so clear.

651
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,460
You know that I hate this the most.

652
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,460
Madam.

653
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,460
You also have a lot of wrinkles on your face.

654
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,460
I'll go with you.

655
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,460
I'll go with you.

656
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,460
I'll go with you.

657
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,460
I'll go with you.

658
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,460
Don't be angry.

659
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,460
I have something to say.

660
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,460
I've been cold to you recently.

661
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,460
It's not because of this.

662
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,460
Someone is secretly playing tricks on you.

663
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,460
He has taken your heart away.

664
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,460
Wuji?

665
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
Liu Yuanying?

666
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,460
Good.

667
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,460
No wonder she's always wandering in the garden.

668
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,460
It turns out to be a dog-picking thing with a humble Wuji.

669
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,460
Who said it's not?

670
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,460
I...

671
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,460
I'm the wife of the legitimate wife of the Lu family.

672
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,460
How can I be with a Wuji?

673
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,460
I'm angry when I think about it.

674
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,460
Madam, this is not your fault.

675
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,460
We should teach that Wuji a good lesson.

676
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,460
Let him know what it is to be a slave.

677
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,460
You're right.

678
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,460
I'll go with you.

679
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,460
I'll go with you.

680
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,460
This is the gift from the Noble Consort.

681
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,460
It's a great disrespect.

682
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,460
Should we find someone to repair it?

683
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,460
I'll go with you.

684
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
How's your dress today?

685
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,460
I've already confirmed

686
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,460
that you're the most noble lady in the capital.

687
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,460
You don't have to wear this mirror.

688
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,460
You're having a wedding banquet in the spring.

689
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,460
You'll be the most handsome man in the capital.

690
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,460
Especially the bride with a groom and a groom's wife.

691
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,460
When a group of men and women get together,

692
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,460
they don't know which one to choose.

693
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,460
There are many flowers and plants in Minister Lu's mansion.

694
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,460
I don't know which one to choose.

695
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,460
I'd rather enjoy the flowers and plants.

696
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,460
Don't be so mean.

697
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,460
You know what I mean.

698
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,460
At the banquet,

699
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,460
if you want to choose a bride,

700
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,460
you must tell me.

701
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,460
I'll help you.

702
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,460
But we have a condition.

703
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,460
Choose the best one.

704
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Here you are.

705
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
Please.

706
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Okay.

707
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,460
You don't have to worry about others.

708
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,460
I know you've been close to Mr. Song for a long time.

709
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,460
Your father also agreed to marry Mrs. Song.

710
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,460
This banquet is mainly based on Mrs. Song's opinion.

711
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,460
Do you understand?

712
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,460
I know.

713
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,460
Here they are.

714
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,460
Third Lady.

715
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,460
Hurry.

716
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,460
Greetings, Mrs. Song.

717
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,460
Greetings, Mrs. Song.

718
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,460
Mr. Song.

719
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
This is the third lady.

720
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,460
You've made a great success.

721
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,460
I'm sure there are many talented people in the capital

722
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,460
who want to marry your family.

723
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
You're right.

724
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,460
I've been raising you like a flower for ten years.

725
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,460
I hope I can meet a lucky person

726
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,460
who will take care of me.

727
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,460
I'm content to be a mother.

728
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,460
Mr. Song.

729
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,460
I heard that you like to play the piano.

730
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,460
I can play it occasionally.

731
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,460
If you have a chance, please give me some advice.

732
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,460
I'm not good at it.

733
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,460
I'm afraid I can't be your coach.

734
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,460
Let's not stand here.

735
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,460
Let's go in.

736
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,460
Which one is Liu Yuanying?

737
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,460
This is the gong

738
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,460
that Her Highness the Noble Consort gave to our Madam.

739
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,460
Madam heard that you were a great dancer.

740
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,460
She wants you to dance the heavenly fairy dance at the banquet.

741
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,460
In a fairy-like and auspicious way,

742
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,460
put this gong on her head

743
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,460
and show it to the guests.

744
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,460
Yes.

745
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,460
Madam said that

746
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,460
you should be a good dancer.

747
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,460
I'm not good at dancing.

748
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,460
I'm not good at dancing.

749
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,460
You're hurt.

750
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,460
Liu Yuanying, you're so shameless.

751
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,460
Her Highness asked you to dance the heavenly fairy dance.

752
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,460
I have to tell Her Highness

753
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,460
not to say anything bad.

754
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,460
Can't you see it?

755
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,460
This is bad.

756
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,460
She gave you the bad one on purpose

757
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,460
to target you.

758
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,460
If you go to her now,

759
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,460
I'm afraid she'll put the blame on you

760
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,460
and deliberately make you dizzy.

761
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,460
Why did she do that?

762
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,460
I've never seen her.

763
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,460
When did she provoke her?

764
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
Now the whole Nengin Garden

765
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,460
is spreading the news about you and Mr. Lu.

766
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,460
How could Her Highness not know?

767
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,460
Maybe she hates you the most now.

768
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,460
Don't be afraid.

769
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,460
I have the confidence to repair this hairpin

770
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,460
and help you get through this.

771
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,460
Do you believe me?

772
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,460
Don't make a fuss.

773
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,460
Give me some time.

774
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,460
I'll send it back to you

775
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,460
before you get angry.

776
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,460
Look at this dance.

777
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,460
Not bad.

778
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,460
The dance is so good.

779
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,460
Not bad.

780
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,460
A jade 있어요.

781
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,460
Okay.

782
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,460
Okay.

783
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,460
Okay.

784
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,460
Okay.

785
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,460
Okay.

786
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,460
There's a bell and it's not ringing.

787
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,460
Mr. Long,

788
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,460
you're good at dancing and you're a killer.

789
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,460
You're a talented woman.

790
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,460
My hands are getting cold.

791
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,460
Stop.

792
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,460
I don't know you.

793
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,460
Are you new here?

794
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,460
Mr. Long.

795
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,460
Wait.

796
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,460
What's in the box?

797
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,460
Nothing.

798
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,460
You...

799
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,460
Good.

800
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,460
You dare to steal the cloth that the noble consort gave.

801
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:45,460
I'm willing to go with the wind.

802
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,460
I want to be with you in the world.

803
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:58,460
I want to be with you in the world.

804
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:05,460
I want to be with you in the world.

805
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:42,460
I want to be with you in the world.

806
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:48,460
I want to be with you in the world.

807
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:58,460
I want to be with you in the world.

808
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:14,460
I want to be with you in the world.
