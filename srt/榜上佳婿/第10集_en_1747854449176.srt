00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Is it you?

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Ah Xiu!

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is it you?

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What's going on?

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Am I possessed?

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why is it still not good?

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't worry, sir.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It will be fine.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,440
Where is my brother now?

66
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,440
You haven't been out for so many days in the Lu family.

67
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,760
I brought you some snacks at Longfeng House.

68
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,160
Pancakes?

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,360
osmanthus cake?

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,240
This is...

71
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,480
chestnut cake.

72
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,800
These are all my favorites.

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,120
Prince Yihuai, you're so nice.

74
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,960
You're so cute.

75
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,360
Slow down.

76
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,600
If you keep being like this,

77
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,920
and let others see you,

78
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,120
aren't you afraid of damaging

79
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,080
your reputation as the son of the legitimate son of Duke Zhen?

80
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,760
Even if it's spread,

81
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,080
according to the story,

82
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,160
I'm the one who loves and ignores everything.

83
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,480
In my opinion,

84
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,080
this is a good thing.

85
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
I don't know.

86
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,120
Mr. Song is really a good man

87
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,520
who values friendship and responsibility.

88
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,120
Ms. Ming Shu.

89
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,760
It's just that what I said that day

90
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,440
wasn't all a joke.

91
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,840
If I'm willing to be a man,

92
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,000
no matter what kind of birth he was born with,

93
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
what kind of identity,

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,160
I will marry him.

95
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,840
We know each other.

96
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,720
We will never change because of others' eyes.

97
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,560
I don't know

98
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,360
which lady will have this honor in the future.

99
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Actually, that lady...

100
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,040
She's here.

101
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,600
Brother Song is here.

102
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,760
Mr. Song brought a lot of delicious food.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,600
Come on.

104
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,840
Come and sit.

105
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,040
Try it.

106
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,840
Thank you for your kindness.

107
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,480
I'm so happy.

108
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,320
I'm so happy.

109
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,200
I'm so happy.

110
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,160
I'm so happy.

111
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm so happy.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,920
I'm so happy.

113
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm so happy.

114
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm so happy.

115
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
I'm so happy.

116
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
I'm so happy.

117
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,680
But there are a lot of people here.

118
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,760
Brother Song should come less often.

119
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,440
It's just that Song Xie ate something.

120
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,560
It's okay.

121
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,920
After all, we still take advantage of others' reputation.

122
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,920
Brother Song is of a high status.

123
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,880
It's inevitable that people will doubt him.

124
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,800
What do you think, Brother Song?

125
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,840
What you said is right.

126
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,280
I didn't think it through.

127
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,680
I've decided.

128
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,960
I'm willing to cooperate with your plan.

129
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,960
Luo Wencai is really lying to me.

130
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
That jade pendant was obtained from somewhere else.

131
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,800
He set up a trap for me on purpose.

132
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm the only one who's stupid.

133
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,800
He lied to me.

134
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
Have you heard about your brother?

135
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,440
He can't make it clear.

136
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,520
He can't say anything after that.

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,840
Since you've agreed to

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
point out Luo Wencai at the banquet,

139
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,360
there are some things

140
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,000
that we won't hide from you.

141
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
So,

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,360
the green plums and the red plums

143
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,480
are all fake?

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,640
That's right.

145
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
The reason why you came to the Lu Mansion

146
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,360
disguised as someone else

147
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,840
is to spy on your father.

148
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,920
According to my judgment,

149
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,480
your father

150
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,200
framed Mr. Su for corruption.

151
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,880
He might have been forced to do so.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840
What do you want to do?

153
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,320
Mr. Su's crime

154
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,600
has a lot to do with your father's testimony.

155
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,040
If your father was forced to do so,

156
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,320
he died of a stroke.

157
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,160
Don't you want to know the truth?

158
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,280
Of course I do.

159
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,000
But it's hard to find the truth.

160
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,160
How can I find the truth?

161
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,520
Don't worry about it.

162
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,240
I'll find out the truth.

163
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,320
If it proves that your father

164
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,360
was forced to do so,

165
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,800
maybe your brother

166
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,120
can clear up the blame

167
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,120
and get rid of the maidservant.

168
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,000
In this case,

169
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,600
you can leave the school.

170
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,840
Your father doesn't have to hide anymore.

171
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,480
I believe you are all good people.

172
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,040
You helped me so much.

173
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,480
I should repay you.

174
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,040
I'm grateful to you.

175
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,200
Thank you, Mrs. Yuanying.

176
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,560
My brother and I

177
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,320
have lived in the hometown since we were kids.

178
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,880
Until a year ago,

179
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,720
we were suddenly kidnapped.

180
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,360
But I don't know who they are.

181
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,400
I just heard

182
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,240
they threatened my brother

183
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,120
with the lives of my sister.

184
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,840
But I don't know

185
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,120
what exactly it was.

186
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Your father agreed?

187
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
Now I think

188
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,320
it should be Mr. Su's fault.

189
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,440
Later, the kidnappers released us.

190
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,160
But we didn't get far.

191
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,920
The government officers came to arrest us.

192
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,160
I led the government officers away and let my brother run away.

193
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,160
But I was caught by the government officers.

194
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,800
Then I was sent to the government slave for no reason.

195
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,920
I was caught in the trap.

196
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,240
My brother didn't know what to do.

197
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,840
Don't worry.

198
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
My brother will definitely make a good use of this case.

199
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,560
There are still many days left.

200
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,720
We have to wait for the future.

201
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,440
First,

202
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,680
I have to get rid of Lu Wencai.

203
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,800
What do you want me to do?

204
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,040
Come on.

205
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,720
Come on.

206
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,320
Come on.

207
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,960
Come on.

208
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,520
Come on.

209
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,160
Come on.

210
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,720
Come on.

211
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,440
Mr. Song.

212
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Mr. Song.

213
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,200
Mr. Song.

214
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,160
Come on. This way, please.

215
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,200
Mr. Song.

216
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,840
Mr. Song.

217
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,440
Come on.

218
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,560
Come on.

219
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,160
Mr. Song.

220
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,840
Mr. Song.

221
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,320
Come on.

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,920
You're here.

223
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm so happy.

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,280
You're welcome, Mr. Song.

225
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,240
I'm flattered.

226
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,360
You're so generous.

227
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,600
Even the grandson of Duke Zheng is here.

228
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,160
Come on.

229
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,920
Raise the cup.

230
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,880
Everyone.

231
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,920
My son is a good son.

232
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll be your colleague in the future.

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,920
I'll rely on you to support me.

234
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,440
Mr. Lu.

235
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,920
You're welcome.

236
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
You're welcome.

237
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
You're so nice.

238
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Come on.

239
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,520
Please sit down.

240
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,040
Please.

241
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,000
Please.

242
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,680
Please.

243
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,520
Mr. Lu.

244
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,800
I heard that tonight,

245
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,240
there's a dance of the Flying Sky

246
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,840
performed by Liu Yuanying, the famous dancer of the Ministry of Education.

247
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,880
We're looking forward to it.

248
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,280
Don't worry.

249
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,480
Please watch it.

250
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,600

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,180
Good.

252
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,900
Really good.

253
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,080
She's so handsome.

254
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
You're so goth.

255
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,320
Episode 11

256
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,120
You found her?

257
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,880
See what's new?

258
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,360
hate of inferiority of thorny statue

259
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,180

268
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,120
Whoever knows

269
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,320
Why is it doesn't sounds correct

270
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,480

275
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
By the way

276
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,880
I heard this tale

277
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,060
There is bowsichu

278
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,400

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,440

280
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,480

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,480

282
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,120
Pre parcels

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:50,960

284
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,080

285
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,340
There wereicate

286
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,900
I...

287
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,020
My lady.

288
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,980
What's wrong?

289
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,700
Something happened to An Yingyan.

290
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,660
Since she's injured,

291
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,900
why don't you take her to the hospital?

292
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,820
Wang Wenchi,

293
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,940
go get a doctor

294
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,940
to check her condition.

295
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,020
Yes, sir.

296
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,180
Minister,

297
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,220
it's not appropriate.

298
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,300
Liu Yuanying is a member of the Ministry of Education.

299
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,540
If there's a problem,

300
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,460
she should be investigated.

301
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,460
But it happened in the Lu's Mansion.

302
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,100
If we don't investigate it,

303
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,340
it'll be a loss for the Lu's Mansion.

304
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,940
Miss Yuanying,

305
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,900
if you don't explain it clearly,

306
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,420
it'll ruin the reputation of the Lu's Mansion.

307
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,940
You can afford it.

308
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,700
Miss Yuanying,

309
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,260
all the guests here

310
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,580
are important officials of the court

311
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,460
and the pillar of the country.

312
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,460
None of them can't help you with justice.

313
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,980
The supervisor is here, too.

314
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,180
Minister Chen, please tell me

315
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,300
what should be the law?

316
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,580
The official has the right to punish

317
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,140
the officials who are injured during the show.

318
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,980
It's related to you.

319
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,420
It's not related.

320
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,020
In that case,

321
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,340
Miss Yuanying,

322
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,620
you can tell us.

323
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,740
We'll give you an explanation.

324
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,340
Well,

325
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,900
you pay me

326
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,500
20,000 yuan for your own defense.

327
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:35,500
The two of us

328
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,820
sent you in in the prime of life.

329
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,940
It's worth it.

330
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,100
Don't you say no to a stray cat?

331
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,340
Don't you say no to a stray cat?

332
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,340
Don't you say no to a stray cat?

333
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,300
I...

334
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,100
I didn't touch it.

335
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,820
Why are you trying to force me?

336
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,980
Father,

337
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,940
he's clearly framed.

338
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,380
Don't talk nonsense.

339
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,220
There are so many ladies here.

340
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,780
How dare I talk nonsense?

341
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,220
It's the son of the Lu family

342
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:14,040
who took advantage of the

343
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,940
Fang Si's entry into the house and rehearsal.

344
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,140
If you have no evidence,

345
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,580
you'll be charged with defamation.

346
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,340
But...

347
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,100
How can I prove it?

348
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,980
I know where the birthmark is on Mr. Lu.

349
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,700
There's a black birthmark

350
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,340
at the bottom of his butt.

351
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,460
What are you talking about?

352
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,100
He's lying.

353
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,180
Everyone,

354
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,260
I don't have such a birthmark at all.

355
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,660
You're just in time.

356
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,740
Everyone,

357
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,300
this is my wife, Wang Shi.

358
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,340
My wife,

359
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,460
tell everyone

360
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,940
that this bitch framed me.

361
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,260
It's been a while.

362
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,820
Do you still want to turn things around

363
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,940
and confuse everyone?

364
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,460
Do you hear me?

365
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,180
You turn things around and confuse everyone.

366
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,660
I'm talking about you,

367
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,620
Hong Wencai.

368
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,940
The reason is that

369
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,020
you're not bad at all.

370
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,780
You're a man.

371
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,820
You're a man.

372
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,660
You're a man.

373
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,340
You're a man.

374
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
You're a man.

375
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,580
You're a man.

376
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,100
This...

377
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,180
It's embarrassing.

378
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,580
You're a man.

379
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,140
What do you think you're doing?

380
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,580
Two years ago,

381
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,460
Xiang Yu, the maid,

382
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,740
was pregnant after she was captured.

383
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,100
Mr. Lu didn't even let her off.

384
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,100
She died of miscarriage.

385
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
She lost both her life and life.

386
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,820
Here.

387
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,020
This is the autopsy document of Xiang Yun.

388
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,580
There are still two official documents.

389
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,580
I heard that you raped her.

390
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
I felt unfair.

391
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,620
So I went around the mansion to find out.

392
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,700
Now the document is in your hands.

393
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,020
What else do you have to say?

394
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,580
Everyone,

395
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,540
Xiang Yun is my former maid.

396
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,300
I can also testify for this matter.

397
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,380
Lu Wencai,

398
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,620
how many women have you

399
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,660
been harassing for so many years?

400
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,100
I'm not a maid.

401
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,700
How many women have you been harassing?

402
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,220
You dare to do it or not?

403
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,100
You're worse than a woman.

404
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
You bitch.

405
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,340
How dare you insult me?

406
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,380
Lu Wencai,

407
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,740
I want to divorce you.

408
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,660
You...

409
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,700
You're so mean.

410
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,980
You should divorce her.

411
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,620
You're so mean.

412
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,420
Mr. Lu,

413
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,340
what the other man did

414
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,740
is against our law.

415
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,540
What do you think?

416
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,580
It's a serious matter.

417
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,300
There may be a misunderstanding.

418
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,300
The law of the Great An is established.

419
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,260
If you're forced to do it,

420
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,700
you'll be punished for it.

421
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,300
You'll be punished for it for more than ten years.

422
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,380
You can only be punished

423
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
if you don't leave the prison.

424
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,700
You're the first to be punished.

425
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,980
You can't be an official.

426
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,180
You're the first to be punished.

427
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,780
You're the second to be punished

428
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,140
for raping Xiang Yun.

429
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,500
You're the third to be punished

430
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,900
for hurting Xiang Yun's child.

431
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,780
Mr. Lu,

432
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,940
you're trying to break the law.

433
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,620
How dare you!

434
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,140
You're just a lowly servant.

435
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,020
How dare you!

436
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,420
That's right.

437
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,900
I'm just a lowly servant.

438
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,620
I know the law is strict.

439
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,660
I can't offend you.

440
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,820
You're the third to be punished.

441
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,980
You're not worthy of it.

442
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,180
It seems that

443
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,500
you know the law.

444
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,900
It's better to cover up for it.

445
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,540
You...

446
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,660
You're talking nonsense.

447
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,860
You're talking nonsense.

448
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,180
You're right.

449
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,300
Mr. Lu,

450
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,540
Mr. Lu is a man of your name.

451
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,740
Tell the Yuan Ying and the Ministry of Education

452
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,500
that Mr. Lu is a criminal.

453
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,740
You're to be punished.

454
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,140
As for Yuan Ying,

455
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,220
please send her back to the Ministry of Education.

456
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Supervisor,

457
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,300
am I right?

458
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,260
You're law-abiding.

459
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,540
You're not to be punished.

460
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,460
The entry of the Prince of Yuan Ying

461
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,940
is a crime.

462
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,420
What?

463
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,500
The entry of the Prince of Yuan Ying?

464
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,140
This is a crime?

465
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,220
Who told you that?

466
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,940
The entry of the Prince of Yuan Ying

467
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,420
is a crime.

468
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,300
Yes.

469
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,980
Mother.

470
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,860
I heard that you've been

471
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,820
asking about your husband's identity in the yard.

472
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,060
Is that true?

473
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
You've misunderstood.

474
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,620
I was just asking.

475
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,260
I have a question.

476
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,500
Can you

477
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,780
explain it to me?

478
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,140
Yuan Ying,

479
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,100
did you expect that

480
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,580
the person who hurt you

481
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,700
would help you?

482
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Thank you, Madam.

483
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,500
If you hadn't given me the document

484
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
and helped us to prove Lu Wencai,

485
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,220
I'm afraid that

486
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,140
we would have to make more efforts.

487
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,140
You said that

488
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,580
as women, we are in the same boat.

489
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,380
Why bother each other?

490
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,060
I thought about it for a long time.

491
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,220
That's why I decided to help you.

492
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,180
Thank you, Madam.

493
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,860
I was confused.

494
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,940
It's my fault.

495
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,660
I made it difficult for you.

496
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,220
After all,

497
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,220
we are all suffering here.

498
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,740
I helped you escape today.

499
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,380
I hope one day

500
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,820
I can get rid of it.

501
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,020
All right.

502
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,820
You can go back to the Ministry of Revenue.

503
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,540
Take care, Madam.

504
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,500
Madam.

505
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,500
Madam.

506
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,500
Madam.

507
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,980
I'm the King of Yin and Yin.

508
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,900
But you can't leave me alone.

509
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,700
You...

510
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,260
It's all Wang's fault.

511
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,500
He's just a lowly servant.

512
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,980
He even wants to divorce me.

513
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,500
I'll divorce him tomorrow.

514
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,340
You're a bastard.

515
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,740
Your father-in-law is about to

516
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,100
take the Minister of Revenue.

517
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,900
Now you are the King of Yin and Yin.

518
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,780
You can only do what you want.

519
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,900
If you want to divorce him,

520
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,060
don't say you can't get

521
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,220
your father-in-law's help.

522
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,660
It's already a good thing

523
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,140
that he doesn't want to be your partner.

524
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,980
If you can't even

525
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,700
keep your wife,

526
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,380
don't be the descendant of our family.

527
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,100
Go back to the ancestral house

528
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,220
and live a good life.

529
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,740
Go, go.

530
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,220
Madam.

531
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,780
I was wrong.

532
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,180
I'm also to blame now.

533
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,900
If you don't stop, hit me.

534
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,660
Hit me.

535
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,420
Hit me hard.

536
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,660
Didn't you already dislike me

537
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,860
for being old and fat?

538
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,860
It's all my fault.

539
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,860
Your beauty

540
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,100
is not as good as my family.

541
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,580
As long as you don't agree,

542
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,420
you can decide

543
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,060
everything in this room.

544
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,980
Okay.

545
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,060
I want you to give me

546
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,780
all the properties under your name.

547
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,500
I also want you to write a letter of repentance

548
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,620
and write down all your previous crimes

549
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,860
on paper

550
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,140
and sign it.

551
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,220
I don't care what you do

552
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,100
in the future.

553
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,740
But in this mansion,

554
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,860
you can't do anything

555
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,140
to disturb my mood.

556
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,460
Otherwise,

557
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,500
I'll divorce you immediately.

558
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,580
Of course.

559
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,500
Of course.

560
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,420
It's the right thing to do.

561
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,020
It's the right thing to do.

562
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,820
Let's rest early.

563
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,740
You can go out.

564
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,220
Okay.

565
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,220
I'll go out.

566
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,620
I'll go out.

567
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,300
My lady,

568
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,100
rest early.

569
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,100
My lady,

570
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,860
are you really unreasonable?

571
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,580
www. jointshif立, qianhuoran.wordpress.com

572
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,880
My father

573
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,780
's opinion is actually clear

574
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,580
about what happened today.

575
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,980
Even so,

576
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,420
he still wrote to me

577
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,700
to maintain his duty

578
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,220
and care for the glory and reputation of the family.

579
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,540
Don't be reckless.

580
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,100
It must not be reasonable.

581
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,340
Why not?

582
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,460
My father is about to give birth.

583
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,700
If anything happens now,

584
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,740
he's afraid it will affect his future.

585
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,900
If I insist on making a compromise,

586
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,660
I'm afraid that from now on,

587
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,860
my family

588
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,860
will be ruined.

589
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,860
Although I can't make a compromise,

590
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,140
I won't be able to

591
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,180
live in peace like before.

592
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,500
I'm going to start planning for myself.

593
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,300
I'm going to take over

594
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,260
everything in the mansion.

595
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,420
Xiangxuan,

596
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,380
pack her things

597
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,620
to the side room later.

598
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,940
From now on, this master bedroom is ours.

599
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,220
Okay.

600
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,740
Judging from Liu Yuanying's statement,

601
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,780
someone must have used her sister's life

602
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,780
to threaten Liu Xiankun

603
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,700
and let him frame Mr. Su.

604
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,020
Liu Xiankun can only compromise

605
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,060
to save a pair of children.

606
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,020
So,

607
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,660
the case of Su Changhua

608
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,020
is suspicious.

609
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,020
I'm sure of it.

610
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,820
After I take over the position,

611
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,260
once the time is right,

612
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,900
I'll report to the authorities

613
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,780
to investigate Su Changhua's corruption case.

614
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,300
Thank you, Prince Rui.

615
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,180
Put this at the door.

616
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,980
Thank you.

617
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,580
Put this behind the screen.

618
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,660
Put this on the second floor.

619
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,780
One, two, three, four.

620
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,700
One, two, three, four.

621
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,220
Don't put it here.

622
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,380
Lady Mo Qing.

623
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,060
Lady Mo Qing?

624
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,540
Lady Mo Qing,

625
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,180
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

626
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,020
Yes.

627
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,380
I'm happy to see you.

628
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,580
Actually,

629
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,020
my name is Ming Shu.

630
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,180
I was forced to go out

631
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,300
and made a mistake.

632
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,900
Please don't blame me.

633
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,020
You're so straightforward.

634
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,660
I don't want to ask too much.

635
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,220
By the way,

636
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,780
this shop...

637
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,900
This is the shop I just opened.

638
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,420
I want to open a jewelry shop.

639
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,220
If you're free later,

640
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,180
you can check it out.

641
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,380
To be honest,

642
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,020
I really envy you.

643
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,500
You can decide

644
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,740
what you want.

645
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,380
You can do it too.

646
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,180
You mean me?

647
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:19,980
Look at this.

648
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,660
Look at this.

649
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,660
Although we can't leave the house,

650
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,500
although there are many people around us,

651
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,660
so what?

652
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,860
If we only see what's in front of us,

653
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,380
we won't be happy.

654
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,020
But we're not only living

655
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,300
for the sake of suffering.

656
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,900
We have to find some fun in it.

657
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,660
Fun?

658
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,660
Like doing business.

659
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,220
Eating and sleeping

660
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,060
are all happy things for me.

661
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,980
Sometimes I'm quite envious

662
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,060
of your home.

663
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,660
You can play the zither,

664
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,460
paint, tea, and incense.

665
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,460
You're all good at everything.

666
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,020
It's not like you can escape from it.

667
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,620
Actually, you're right.

668
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,380
I've always liked pipa.

669
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,460
But I haven't touched it

670
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,900
since I married into the Lu family.

671
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,660
From now on,

672
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,980
I don't want to care about

673
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,140
those things around me.

674
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,820
I also want to think

675
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,740
what I like.

676
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,700
Thank you.

677
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,220
Thank you.

678
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,740
Mother.

679
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,420
Are you sewing clothes for Grandma Li?

680
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,420
Yes.

681
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,340
Old Mrs. Li is old.

682
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,700
She's not young.

683
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,980
We can help her.

684
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,660
Don't stand there.

685
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,180
Sit.

686
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,940
You're awake.

687
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,460
Sit.

688
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,620
I'm good at sewing.

689
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,980
But I can only

690
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,300
do some chores at home.

691
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,740
I'm a bit lazy.

692
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,940
It's not easy for a woman to work outside.

693
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,380
I'm satisfied

694
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,740
that I can help you.

695
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,060
But things are different now.

696
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,380
I'm about to start my own business.

697
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,540
I'm not going to

698
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,260
live in your home anymore.

699
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,420
Will you help me

700
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,500
to make embroidery for Flower Pavilion?

701
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,500
Well...

702
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,620
I've lived in the exhibition for years.

703
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,180
I'm afraid I can't make it.

704
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,140
Don't worry.

705
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,500
I'm not a family member.

706
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,700
I know your craft.

707
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,140
In the capital,

708
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,900
there are many women

709
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,260
as talented as you

710
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,420
who are not good at home.

711
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,860
I hope you can find them

712
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,500
and let them be free from their home.

713
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,180
So they can have more memories

714
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,900
and be appreciated by the world.

715
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,580
Okay.

716
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,660
With your words,

717
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

718
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,460
Mom.

719
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,620
You promised me.

720
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,260
Okay.

721
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,180
Brother.

722
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,860
You're writing...

723
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,380
A note of A-in?

724
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,300
It's about the Lijinglu family.

725
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,980
I'd rather talk about it in detail.

726
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,100
What's up?

727
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,860
I'm not used to

728
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,260
these random samples.

729
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,380
Brother, you should write

730
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,820
the signature of Flower Pavilion.

731
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,140
I can help you.

732
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,220
But as your manager,

733
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,020
don't you want to write it yourself?

734
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,740
I'm not a calligrapher.

735
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,360
First,

736
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:11,720
prepare your

737
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,080
my произages

738
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,560
with my

739
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,320
own me.

740
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,820
Vanishing like the conclusion

741
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,660
Save pain, kill desolation

742
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,640
Love is like lovers

743
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Tampered from a distance

744
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:50,400
Yet the

745
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,400
the sky is clear.

746
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,720
Speaking of which,

747
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,000
that Lady Yuan Ying

748
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,560
happened to meet you.

749
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,600
Otherwise, she wouldn't know

750
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,160
how long Lu Wen Cai would keep lying to her.

751
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,880
She was helpless

752
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,080
and was in a critical situation.

753
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,440
She was looking for her brother

754
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,680
but no one helped her.

755
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,040
She was used by a bad person.

756
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,840
She was in a dilemma

757
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,240
just like me.

758
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,400
Luckily, she met you.

759
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,480
You mean

760
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,520
I'm a living Bodhisattva

761
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,960
without suffering?

762
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
You're so talkative.

763
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,200
However,

764
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,200
this incident

765
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,800
gave me some inspiration.

766
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,640
Since ancient times,

767
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,960
men and women are inferior to each other.

768
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,040
Many women are helpless

769
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
when they're in a dilemma.

770
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,120
If we can

771
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,000
make some

772
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,440
efficient and urgent requests

773
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,040
to help the trapped women

774
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,080
get rid of their worries,

775
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,720
it will help more people

776
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,680
get rid of their troubles.

777
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,280
It's a good idea.

778
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,240
We can make a

779
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,480
Women's Club for Flower Pavilion.

780
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,080
All the members of the Club are sisters.

781
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,680
When they meet good things,

782
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,920
they can be happy together.

783
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,920
When they meet difficulties,

784
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,320
they can work together

785
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,120
and solve their problems together.

786
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,920
That's great.

787
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,760
Let's make a group.

788
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,840
By the way,

789
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,480
I have another thing to ask you.

790
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,200
What is it?

791
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,320
I...

792
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,120
Mr. Cui Li's feng shui stone

793
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,720
was supposed to be put in his hand six months later.

794
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,280
He gave it to me in a generous way.

795
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,160
He's so lucky.

796
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,040
Mr. Cui Li,

797
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,680
this is...

798
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,240
Sir,

799
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,000
Where...

800
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,640
Where is the wolf?

801
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,560
Come on, leave.

802
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,540
Enterprise

803
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,160
Master.

804
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,880
Father.

805
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Enterprise

806
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,420
Father.

807
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,760
I've learned a lot from reading today.

808
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,600
I hope you can teach me.

809
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,920
Come to my study when you have time.

810
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,200
Yes.

811
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,360
Young Master.

812
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,560
Master is far away.

813
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,200
I think you're thinking too much.

814
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,280
You were injured and lost your memory.

815
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,240
You've forgotten the past.

816
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,840
So you've lost

817
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,600
your brother and sisterhood.

818
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,920
So your brother

819
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,640
is no different from a normal man.

820
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,280
Besides,

821
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,080
you're too close to your brother

822
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080
when you pretend to be a couple.

823
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,480
That's why you have a different feeling for him.

824
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,680
Is that true?

825
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
I don't think it's a big deal.

826
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,240
Just be at ease.

827
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
Don't be so picky.

828
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,360
But speaking of that,

829
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,200
you two are really different.

830
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,280
What if you're not

831
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,560
brothers of the same mother?

832
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,360
I once ran away from the same road

833
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,240
and followed the frosty road.

834
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,880
This is about Mr. Ling Chuan.

835
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,440
When did I memorize his story?

836
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,440
If you like Qingzhu,

837
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,360
I'll let someone take you to his house.

838
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,360
No need.

839
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,440
No need.

840
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,160
I just have a feeling.

841
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,920
Be careful.

842
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,160
It's a little heavy.

843
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,560
Mrs. Yun Shu.

844
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,320
Mrs. Yun Ying.

845
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,040
What's the matter?

846
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,800
I suddenly remembered something.

847
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,200
I wonder if it'll help you with Mr. Su's case.

848
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,160
Please tell me.

849
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,280
I went back to think about it.

850
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,000
The maid in the house once said

851
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,800
that after Mr. Su was taken away,

852
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,280
he was forced to leave the house.

853
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,400
I don't know if it's true.

854
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,240
I don't know.

855
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,000
After Mr. Su was taken away,

856
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,320
the owner of the gold shop,

857
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,880
Jian Jinhai, went to see my father.

858
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,440
He even scolded him.

859
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,000
He's blaming Mr. Su for his unfairness.

860
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,960
I wonder if he knows the clue.

861
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,200
It seems that Mr. Su and Jian Jinhai

862
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
are very close.

863
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,040
I'll tell my brother about it.

864
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,800
And

865
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,760
you were on the favor party

866
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,280
for Lu Wencai.

867
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,200
I'm grateful for that.

868
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,680
Thank you so much.

869
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,320
I'm also saving myself.

870
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,840
It's all thanks to you.

871
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,280
I can't believe that the Women's Club

872
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,640
and these chess pieces are so similar.

873
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,480
You're really a good player.

874
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
You're so close.

875
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,400
Although I'm in the school,

876
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,200
I'm willing to do my best for the Women's Club.

877
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,160
Where's Ming Shu?

878
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,120
He can't be here.

879
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
He's not here.

880
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
He's not here.

881
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
He's not here.

882
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
He's not here.

883
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
He's not here.

884
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
He's not here.

885
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
He's not here.

886
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
He's not here.

887
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,240
He's not here.

888
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
He's not here.

889
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
He's not here.

890
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
He's not here.

891
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
He's not here.

892
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,240
He's not here.

893
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
He's not here.

894
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,240
He's not here.

895
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,240
He's not here.

896
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
He's not here.

897
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,240
He's not here.

898
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,240
He's not here.

899
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,240
He's not here.

900
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,240
He's not here.

901
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
He's not here.

902
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,240
He's not here.

903
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,240
He's not here.

904
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,240
He's not here.

905
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
He's not here.

906
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
He's not here.

907
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
He's not here.

908
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
He's not here.

909
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
He's not here.

910
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
He's not here.

911
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
He's not here.

912
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
He's not here.

913
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,240
He's not here.

914
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
He's not here.

915
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
He's not here.

916
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
He's not here.

917
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
He's not here.

918
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
He's not here.

919
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,240
He's not here.

920
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
He's not here.

921
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
He's not here.

922
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
He's not here.

923
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,240
He's not here.

924
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
He's not here.

925
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:58,400
What can you tell me,

926
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,760
Leave Xu Feng to me, or I'll become former

927
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,840
L 사고

928
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,680
I will

929
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,660
Now the flowers bloom in the ends of world

930
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:12,140
The

931
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,880
the

932
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,880
the

933
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:28,360
the

934
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:33,360
Looking back in despair, I'm already in pain

935
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:40,360
If the scenery is clear, can I return to the wind?

936
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:46,360
A kind of love that is left behind, and I'm lost in my heart

937
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:57,360
Counting the long night, I can't count the time I spent thinking about you

938
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:05,360
Looking back in despair, I'm already in pain

939
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:12,360
If the scenery is clear, can I return to the wind?

940
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:22,360
A kind of love that is left behind, and I'm lost in my heart
