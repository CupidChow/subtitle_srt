00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Ever Falling in Love

00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,960
The snow falls

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,960
The snow falls

4
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,960
The snow falls

5
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,960
The snow falls

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,960
The snow falls

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,960
The snow falls

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,960
The snow falls

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,960
The snow falls

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
The snow falls

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,960
The snow falls

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,960
The snow falls

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,960
The snow falls

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,960
The snow falls

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
The snow falls

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,760
I in complete dis unterschied

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,160
since ancient times

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,080
from the beauty gold

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,960
beyond the sea

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,960
ging g in the clearing

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
The mathematically oriented

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,560
to believe that

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,360
Its

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
Episode 16

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
A'ci.

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,360
It's really you, A'ci.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
You're still alive.

28
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Where have you been all year?

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Let A'ci get better.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
After we separated,

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360
I secretly ran to the capital.

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,360
I was rescued by the people in the back.

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:21,040
I took the jade pendant to the

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,600
capital.

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Damn it!

36
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,620
Too carefully.

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
They can't make it,

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
I have to force them.

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,460
Yes, Madam,

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
but I heard from the manager

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
aosaic's brother

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,620
is looking for her.

43
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Her brother?

44
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,320
That's a prostitute.

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,360
She must live in the East.

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,360
Maybe her identity can prove useful.

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,200
I've ruined my future.

48
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,760
I'm wronged.

49
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,400
Do you understand?

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,040
He's framed you.

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,400
If I don't kill him,

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,280
I'll be a dead man.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,400
I sneaked into the academy

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,920
to avenge my father.

55
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,360
A'ci.

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,320
Don't cry.

57
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,120
We

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,880
want to do good deeds.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
A'ci, in this world,

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,720
you're the only family.

61
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,480
You're the only reason for me to live.

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,920
How can you leave me alone?

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,720
My Lord.

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,480
My Lord.

65
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,280
My Lord.

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,720
My Lord.

67
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,320
My Lord.

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,240
A'ci.

69
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,680
If you do this,

70
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,120
don't go to find me.

71
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,440
Otherwise,

72
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,000
you won't let me

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,600
lie to you.

74
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,440
My Lord.

75
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,840
It's your fault.

76
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,120
I only have you.

77
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
If you die,

78
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,200
I won't live.

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
A'ci.

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,880
Promise me.

81
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,920
Don't cry.

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
Okay?

83
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,440
Don't cry.

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,280
My Lord.

85
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,280
My Lord.

86
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,640
A'ci, look at me.

87
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,600
My Lord.

88
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,400
A'ci, look at me.

89
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
My Lord, look at me.

90
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,080
My Lord, look at me.

91
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,320
My Lord.

92
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,960
My Lord.

93
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,040
My Lord.

94
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,200
I'll go out right now.

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,480
Let me die.

96
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,520
What are you doing?

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,840
My father and my father are dead.

98
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,120
What's the point of me living?

99
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,040
Yuan Ying.

100
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,720
Your father was forced to frame his friends

101
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,240
because of someone else's conspiracy.

102
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm afraid he's regretting it until he dies.

103
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,640
His family will be in trouble.

104
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,480
We must find out the truth.

105
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,560
We're not meant to be.

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,280
Although we're not related by birth,

107
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,080
but we're truly D Indonesia's разные emotions.

108
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,240
Pang ...

109
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,920
Ms. Su ...

110
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:56,320
It's the dust from the

111
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,760
What can I help you with?

112
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,400
You got hit by a heavy object.

113
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,480
According to Zhang Song,

114
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,240
he was a murderer twice.

115
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,520
Once, he was a embroiderer in the Huan Tao Hall.

116
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,400
Once, he was a whore in the Mingli Hall.

117
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,360
He accidentally picked up the embroidery.

118
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,240
He accidentally heard about the whore

119
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,920
in the Mingli Hall.

120
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,880
Do you think it's a coincidence?

121
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,720
It's like

122
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,240
someone stabbed him

123
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,520
when he wanted to kill him.

124
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,680
Maybe it's the Heaven's help.

125
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,560
Is it the Heaven's help or the human's help?

126
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,400
Xie Xi's embroidery is very precious.

127
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,040
He must have made it carefully.

128
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,520
He wouldn't have done it casually.

129
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
But he fell down

130
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,400
and was picked up.

131
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,160
I asked Madam Lin about the whore.

132
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,040
He had retired earlier.

133
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,600
He came to repair the mountain for someone else.

134
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,080
Unless someone asked him to do it on purpose,

135
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,280
Xie Xi was close to you.

136
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,360
You had the chance to meet his personal belongings.

137
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
You must have copied the retirement record.

138
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,320
What do you mean?

139
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,320
You gave Zhang Song the embroidery.

140
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,920
You also revealed the eviction to Zhang Song on purpose.

141
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
You are the one who pushed the blame.

142
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,680
Lu Ming Shu.

143
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,800
I don't have time to listen to your nonsense.

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,360
I haven't finished yet.

145
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,400
Xie Xi is loyal to you.

146
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,680
Lu Wen Cai is threatening you.

147
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,160
You used Zhang Song's revenge

148
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,440
to kill him.

149
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,080
Your reasoning

150
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,080
seems reasonable.

151
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,120
It's just your speculation.

152
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,640
You have no evidence.

153
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,520
People are watching.

154
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,920
Heaven is watching.

155
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,040
You know

156
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,640
whether I'm right or wrong.

157
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,040
Ming Shu.

158
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,600
You really wronged me.

159
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,800
How could I do that?

160
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,160
But

161
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm curious about one thing.

162
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,960
If you killed the family and ruined the people,

163
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,040
would you care about the means to revenge?

164
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,560
What do you mean?

165
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,920
Do you know...

166
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,760
Get out.

167
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,440
You go out first.

168
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,920
I have something to talk to him alone.

169
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,760
Brother Lu.

170
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,240
I heard from Ying Xun

171
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,880
that you asked King of Rui for mercy.

172
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,640
King of Rui decided to let me go.

173
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,520
Thank you.

174
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,160
I promised to help you.

175
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,960
I don't want you to go back to the school.

176
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,040
I did what I said.

177
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,320
But what about what you promised me?

178
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,000
Sorry, Brother Lu.

179
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,120
It's because of the fact that

180
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,520
Ming Shu thought I was killed.

181
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,200
I felt wronged and sad

182
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,440
and couldn't say anything.

183
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,360
I said something wrong.

184
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,640
Don't blame me.

185
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,240
You're always calm.

186
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,560
Why are you so distracted

187
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,400
because of a few words today?

188
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,960
After all these,

189
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,360
I'm no longer the one you know.

190
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,160
I'm Su Tang Li, who is out of the world.

191
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,480
Tang Li.

192
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,920
I know you want to help the En family.

193
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,680
But it's not the same as revenge.

194
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,800
If you make a mistake because of this,

195
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm sure the En family won't rest in peace.

196
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,680
Brother Lu.

197
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,320
Don't you believe me?

198
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,760
It doesn't matter whether you believe me or not.

199
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
What matters is that

200
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
you have to know what you're doing.

201
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Su Tang Li

202
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,960
Ah Xiu.

203
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,840
Are you still worried about Miss Su?

204
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,720
If it's as you said,

205
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,320
even if she doesn't have blood on her hands,

206
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,560
she must be in a bloody state.

207
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,480
She asked me

208
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,600
if I was killed by someone

209
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
and the family was destroyed,

210
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
would I care about my revenge?

211
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
I don't know why

212
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,760
I care about this.

213
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,640
What do you think?

214
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,760
I won't let her go.

215
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,240
But I don't want to be such an imagination.

216
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,680
After all,

217
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,320
the person I care about most is by my side.

218
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,120
Ah Xiu.

219
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,200
You and mother should be fine.

220
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,920
You have to be with me for the rest of your life.

221
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,320
Okay.

222
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,400
Su Changhua

223
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,560
Your Majesty.

224
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,480
According to the witness of Su Changhua's case,

225
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,000
Liu Xiankun's daughter said

226
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,800
Liu Xiankun used to testify that Su Changhua was corrupt.

227
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,800
He was forced to do so.

228
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,640
I'm so bold as to ask Your Majesty to review this case.

229
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,720
Su Changhua

230
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,880
I will review it.

231
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,920
Your Majesty.

232
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,560
Su Changhua's case has been settled.

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,120
If it's a rash case,

234
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,520
I'm afraid the public will criticize it

235
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,520
and damage the court's reputation.

236
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,880
You're wrong.

237
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,280
The old case should be reviewed.

238
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,480
If it's a rash case,

239
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,360
it will damage our reputation.

240
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,120
Your Majesty.

241
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,640
Su Changhua's case was reviewed by the three departments.

242
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,520
It was settled after repeated inspection.

243
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,320
What King of Rui said

244
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,440
is that

245
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,920
the three departments are wrong?

246
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,000
If the old case is reviewed,

247
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,840
will the former witness

248
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,840
stop the trial?

249
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,000
I dare to ask King of Rui

250
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,360
whether he is ready to recommend

251
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,240
the candidate in advance.

252
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,640
I'm afraid this is your real purpose.

253
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,800
Lord Han.

254
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,720
Why do you guess

255
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,920
and listen to me?

256
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,880
Grand Tutor.

257
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,600
Enough.

258
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,000
It's not urgent.

259
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Let's discuss it later.

260
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,360
Yes.

261
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,920
Gordon.

262
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,000
His Majesty simple-minded.

263
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,280
Royal 就上他心心监管

264
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,700
You haven't eaten food for a long time today.

265
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
You should have something to eat.

266
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,920
Royal HK if you get upset

267
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,780
Okay, let's go.

268
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,280
Your Majesty, why are you angry?

269
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,080
These old men

270
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,420
don't even intersection to prove up front,

271
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,700
telling me

272
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,660
it's about my personal interest.

273
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,360
These are all

274
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,680
is that he's not one of them.

275
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,920
Though Prince Yu is in every species,

276
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
he's an extrSeton,

277
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,440
which means I don't care

278
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,720
those minstrels'PUP.

279
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,040
I'd rather fear that

280
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,280
the court歌关无名遍之心

281
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,680
cannot tolerate its salsa.

282
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,000
It makes pooroughs dreadful.

283
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,080
How the King is held

284
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,600
concerns the superior law

285
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,880
and the downfall of the citizens.

286
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,040
Other people are so cold and cold.

287
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,120
Why do you care?

288
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,600
I don't care about my reputation.

289
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,720
I'm just worried that

290
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,760
what I'm planning is not going to work.

291
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,640
On the contrary,

292
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,680
they are so opposed to

293
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,720
proving that what you're planning

294
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,040
is at the critical moment.

295
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,080
What should be done is not important.

296
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,320
You just need to keep doing it.

297
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,440
Yes.

298
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,760
They are so angry and angry

299
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,400
because I

300
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,600
have been fighting for their school.

301
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,920
I don't need to fight for their nonsense.

302
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,200
Your Majesty, you are not planning this

303
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,360
on purpose.

304
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,520
I hope you can take care of yourself.

305
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,680
Have a meal.

306
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,600
Thank you.

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,640
This is my duty.

308
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,800
How about having a meal together?

309
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,720
I have already used it.

310
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,120
Then I won't bother you.

311
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,200
Don't stop me.

312
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,720
I'll scold her face to face.

313
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,520
Your Grace.

314
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,840
You are being so selfish.

315
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,960
You think you can get away with it

316
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,160
by going out?

317
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,040
Don't stop me.

318
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Ming Shuai, hurry up.

319
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,800
You were so angry

320
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,640
in front of Su Tangli.

321
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,880
Why did you ignore her

322
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,760
when you ran to Xie Xi?

323
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,960
Of course I did.

324
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,960
I want to cancel the engagement.

325
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,200
I want the whole world to know

326
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,880
that Xie Xi betrayed me.

327
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,080
Fine. Go.

328
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,320
Go and tell everyone

329
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,160
that if they know that

330
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,720
this lady is a contractual master,

331
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,120
they will feel sorry for Xie Xi.

332
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,040
What should I do?

333
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,040
So you need to calm down.

334
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,280
Ming Shuai,

335
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,880
I really like Xie Xi.

336
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,080
If you are in trouble,

337
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,280
what will you do?

338
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,280
I will not waste my time

339
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
and ruin the engagement.

340
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,480
I will let her go

341
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,920
and be free.

342
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,040
Is that okay?

343
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,400
Let her go and be free?

344
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,120
Okay.

345
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,000
I like you, silly girl.

346
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,720
I will cancel the engagement.

347
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
But I will not let her go.

348
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
I will not let her

349
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
humiliate me.

350
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,960
I will make her pay for it.

351
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,600
Don't forget.

352
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,080
This is the trial of King of Rui and King of Yu.

353
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,520
It has already disturbed the court.

354
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,800
The official will severely punish

355
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,760
the Duke of Yongqing.

356
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,280
Why do you have to go there in person?

357
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,280
How can I solve the problem?

358
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,320
You are so stubborn.

359
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,520
Sit down.

360
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,240
Wen An is right.

361
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,280
Xie Xi is very scheming.

362
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,880
We should be more careful

363
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,800
so that she can find excuses for her mistakes

364
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,960
and get back at Wen An.

365
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,000
What Ming Shu said

366
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,320
is exactly what I think.

367
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,640
You still have the nerve to say it.

368
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,040
If you can think of this,

369
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,080
I will stop you.

370
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,240
Ming Shu,

371
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
what should I do?

372
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,200
Okay.

373
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
That's it.

374
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,800
It's rare for us to get together.

375
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,040
How about we drink

376
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,320
without getting drunk today?

377
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,960
I'll drink with you.

378
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,640
I won't drink alone.

379
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,680
I'll watch you drink.

380
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,280
What?

381
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,320
King of Rui won't let you

382
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,480
drink with your sister.

383
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,800
I'll find a reason.

384
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,720
No.

385
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,880
Okay.

386
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
I'll tell you the truth today.

387
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,080
I'll go back to the Flower Pavilion for Ming Shu.

388
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,080
I'll drink with you.

389
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,320
You said it yourself.

390
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,440
Come on.

391
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,600
Cheers.

392
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,640
I'll pour it for you.

393
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,720
Honestly,

394
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,720
the Women's Club of Flower Pavilion

395
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,880
is interesting.

396
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,280
Even the hostess

397
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,720
can seek help inside.

398
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,480
Not to mention the common women.

399
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,760
Ming Shu,

400
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,160
I have a little...

401
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,280
The hostess wants to join the Flower Pavilion.

402
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,400
To be honest,

403
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,520
I can always see

404
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,120
women being insulted.

405
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,920
No matter their status or status,

406
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,880
they always

407
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,200
ask for help

408
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,760
under the rules of the world.

409
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,760
With the Flower Pavilion,

410
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,320
we can expect

411
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,960
when we encounter danger.

412
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,240
It's interesting.

413
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,880
I must join.

414
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,560
To be honest,

415
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,000
I really think the hostess is a good sister.

416
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,480
If you can come to the Flower Pavilion,

417
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,760
it's like a tiger.

418
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,960
Let's change the Flower Pavilion

419
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,560
into a answer.

420
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,520
Let's change the answer.

421
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,400
Come on.

422
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,800
Your Majesty,

423
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,560
listen to me.

424
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,440
I haven't seen

425
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,560
such a kind sister

426
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,160
for a long time.

427
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
How about

428
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,120
we make a deal today?

429
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,680
How about it?

430
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,760
That's great.

431
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm honored.

432
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,480
May we

433
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,920
live a long life.

434
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,000
Everything is fine.

435
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,640
Great.

436
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,920
Even if we are abandoned,

437
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,520
we can live a life of happiness.

438
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,480
Besides,

439
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,440
we have sisters.

440
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,520
We are not lonely.

441
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,240
Come on.

442
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,880
Cheers.

443
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,720
Cheers.

444
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,760
We won't go home until we are drunk.

445
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,280
Great.

446
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,480
Pour it for the secretary.

447
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,960
For you.

448
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,520
Drink it.

449
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,280
You must drink more.

450
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,240
You too.

451
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,160
The salt of the King of the Sixth.

452
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,560
Cheers.

453
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,840
The Princess Consort will come out later.

454
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,680
She said we were just passing by.

455
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Did you hear that?

456
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
Yes, I did.

457
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
Be careful.

458
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Slow down.

459
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
Be careful.

460
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Be careful, Your Highness.

461
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,680
Yes.

462
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Be careful.

463
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Be careful.

464
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Be careful.

465
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Be careful.

466
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Be careful.

467
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Be careful, Your Highness.

468
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
Yes.

469
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Be careful.

470
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Be careful.

471
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Be careful.

472
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,680
You are drunk.

473
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
Impossible.

474
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
You can't drink.

475
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
Don't drink.

476
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
I won.

477
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,680
What are you looking at?

478
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Go to the street.

479
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
Why is the King here?

480
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
We just passed by.

481
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
What about

482
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
the secretary?

483
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
I'll take the Princess Consort back to the mansion.

484
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
You

485
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,680
take the Princess Consort's carriage

486
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
to send the little lady home.

487
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,180
Yes.

488
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Let's go, Mingshu.

489
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,680
Mingshu.

490
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Mingshu.

491
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Mingshu can't drink much.

492
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
She's drunk.

493
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,680
Let's continue drinking.

494
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Mingshu.

495
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
Mingshu.

496
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
Continue drinking.

497
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Mingshu.

498
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
Mingshu.

499
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,680
I think you're right.

500
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Life is not easy.

501
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,680
You should stay away from those people.

502
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
King of Rui

503
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
is not that kind of person.

504
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
Don't worry.

505
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
King of Rui?

506
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
He...

507
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
He...

508
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
What's wrong with him?

509
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,680
He doesn't know women.

510
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
He's always wearing that face.

511
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I've never seen a woman

512
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
in his whole life.

513
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
He

514
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,680
only knows about the court.

515
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
He has no love, no blood,

516
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
no blood.

517
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,680
He doesn't even have a lover.

518
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
He's pitiful.

519
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
So I'm a pitiful person

520
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
in your heart.

521
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
But

522
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,680
King of Rui respects me.

523
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,680
He's a gentleman.

524
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,680
The blood is like my King of Rui.

525
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
It's like a cloud.

526
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Anything else?

527
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,680
What's good about King of Rui?

528
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
If we can

529
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
keep being like this,

530
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
and not disturb each other,

531
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,680
it's a good thing.

532
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Don't think about it.

533
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Please wait, Princess Rui.

534
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
Mr. Lu.

535
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Mr. Lu.

536
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
King of Rui sent me

537
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
to send Miss Ming Shu back.

538
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
Please take her home.

539
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Why are you drinking so much?

540
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,680
It's you.

541
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
Mr. Qinghan,

542
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
I dreamed about you again.

543
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Why are you

544
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,680
in my dream again?

545
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Don't move, Ming Shu.

546
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
Don't move, Ming Shu.

547
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
You're so blurry

548
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,680
that you don't let me see clearly.

549
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Please show me your face.

550
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
Don't move.

551
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
How can you treat Mr. Qinghan like this?

552
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
Why don't you let me see clearly?

553
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,680
You make me worried.

554
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
What are you worried about?

555
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,680
I'm worried that you're my brother.

556
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Why are you worried about your brother?

557
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
How can I be your brother?

558
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,680
I can't like my brother.

559
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
What kind of person do you think your brother is?

560
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Why don't you talk?

561
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
You said I was your most important person.

562
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,680
Did you forget?

563
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,680
Qingcheng, is that you?

564
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
No.

565
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
This...

566
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,680
She drank so much.

567
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Mother,

568
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
make her some soup.

569
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Hurry up and go in.

570
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,680
Pour me another cup.

571
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
You're all in the wine.

572
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
I'm sorry.

573
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
I'm not a bad person.

574
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Don't be afraid, Madam.

575
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
I'm a martial artist.

576
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
I can't fight back when I see you.

577
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Please forgive me.

578
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,680
I misjudged you as a spy.

579
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
I'm sorry.

580
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
Please forgive me.

581
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
I'm a martial artist.

582
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
I hit you hard.

583
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
It's good that you're fine.

584
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
I'm fine.

585
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
Who is it?

586
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
It's okay.

587
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Thanks to you.

588
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
Thank you very much.

589
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Qingcheng.

590
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
Qingcheng.

591
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
Qingcheng.

592
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Qingcheng.

593
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Qingcheng.

594
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Qingcheng.

595
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
Qingcheng.

596
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Qingcheng.

597
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
Qingcheng.

598
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Qingcheng.

599
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Qingcheng.

600
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
Qingcheng.

601
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
Qingcheng.

602
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Qingcheng.

603
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Qingcheng.

604
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
Qingcheng.

605
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
Qingcheng.

606
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Qingcheng.

607
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
Qingcheng.

608
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Qingcheng.

609
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
Qingcheng.

610
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,680
Qingcheng.

611
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Qingcheng.

612
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Qingcheng.

613
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Qingcheng.

614
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Qingcheng.

615
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Qingcheng.

616
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
Qingcheng.

617
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Qingcheng.

618
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,680
You're awake.

619
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
I'm sure you're awake now,

620
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Mr. Qingshan.

621
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Then you take a good look at it,

622
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,680
who exactly is Mr. Qingshan?

623
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,280
No.

624
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,560
No.

625
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,240
You're not Song Qingzhao.

626
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,440
You're like a star.

627
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,120
I'm not Song Qingzhao.

628
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,120
I'm Lu Cheng.

629
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Lu Cheng.

630
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,800
Lu Cheng.

631
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Lu Cheng is my star.

632
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,480
How can you be?

633
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,760
Anxiu.

634
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,320
Anxiu, no.

635
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,320
No.

636
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,720
I know.

637
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,440
Those memories are painful

638
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
to you.

639
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,480
Sometimes I hope

640
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,160
you won't remember them for the rest of your life.

641
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,480
But sometimes...

642
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,200
For all my life.

643
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,320
I'm too selfish.

644
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
I've been investigating.

645
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,960
Zeng's family hasn't been reformed.

646
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,520
They lived in Jiangling before they died.

647
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,080
They moved to the capital not long ago.

648
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,480
There are only Zeng's family,

649
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,080
Lu Chang, and Lu Ming Shu in the family.

650
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,120
It seems that it was Yu Qing.

651
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,520
It's all my fault.

652
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,240
I always thought that they died

653
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,480
in the flood of that year.

654
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,960
All these years,

655
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,320
we've been separated by seven miles.

656
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,440
I've been investigating.

657
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,280
The people who were involved in the flood

658
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,720
have been separated by seven miles.

659
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,360
I've been found by a man

660
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,680
when I was investigating.

661
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,680
What man?

662
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,960
I don't know.

663
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,560
All right.

664
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,240
Continue to investigate.

665
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,400
Yes, sir.

666
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,200
Congratulations to the East King for being able to reunite with his family.

667
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,040
There's no joy in that.

668
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Speaking of which,

669
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,960
it's all my fault that I was too busy with official affairs.

670
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,760
When they were in trouble,

671
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,120
I couldn't return to them in time.

672
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,160
So,

673
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,560
we've been separated for more than ten years.

674
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,680
All these years,

675
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,600
he's been alone with two children.

676
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,000
He must have experienced the hardships of the world.

677
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,240
He must have been very hard.

678
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
East King,

679
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,720
bring the wife and child back.

680
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,440
You can make up for it.

681
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,000
I know Yu Qing's temperament.

682
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,480
He's a strong man.

683
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,760
I'm afraid it's not easy for him to forgive me.

684
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,720
Although East King was wrong,

685
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,480
it's understandable.

686
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,000
If you treat them with sincerity,

687
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,280
and give them a good relationship,

688
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
you will definitely accept East King

689
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,680
and reunite with him.

690
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,000
I hope everything goes well.

691
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,960
I will.

692
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
I will.

693
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,200
Aunt,

694
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,200
are you okay?

695
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,600
Are you sick? I need to see a doctor.

696
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,800
Aunt,

697
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
I'm Wei Zhu.

698
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,040
I'm here to see you,

699
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,400
your son's friend.

700
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,960
economic situation.

701
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,720
I tried to talk to you,

702
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,040
Can you see me?

703
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,120
I...

704
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,440
I...

705
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,280
You finally came back.

706
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,320
Look at...

707
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,280
It's him.

708
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,200
You have a good future wife.

709
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,560
And you were not at home.

710
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,240
Come.

711
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,760
Startle.

712
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
The former name of the bride

713
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,120
is gone, right?

714
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
My son.

715
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,920
Brother,

716
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,680
I'm sorry.

717
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,680
Did you send me back last night?

718
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,200
I didn't lose my mind, right?

719
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,360
You don't remember?

720
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,800
I just drank a little bit.

721
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,200
I promise I won't do that again.

722
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,720
Not this time.

723
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,720
It's good that you don't remember it.

724
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,040
Go up now!

725
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,560
What are you doing?

726
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,360
Your Highness.

727
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,760
I was rude

728
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
and made this bastard

729
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,160
commit such a crime.

730
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,440
Today,

731
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,400
I'll take him to the court

732
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,080
and atone for his crimes.

733
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,160
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

734
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,120
Please forgive me.

735
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,080
Bear with it.

736
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,120
,"Bear with it."

737
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,360
Father,

738
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,080
I'm deeply upset.

739
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,800
Father,

740
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,200
Father,

741
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,200
Father,

742
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,720
Father,

743
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
Father says

744
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,280
I can't take it.

745
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,240
Apologize to the county chief.

746
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,200
Yes.

747
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,280
I'm sorry.

748
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,320
I apologize to you.

749
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,840
But I was blinded by that drunk slave.

750
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,560
I always have you in my heart.

751
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,320
Xie Lang.

752
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,800
I know you have me in your heart.

753
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,640
But you are willing to violate the law

754
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,680
for that Su lady.

755
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,960
I guess

756
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,520
she's in front of me.

757
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,600
Mr. Xie.

758
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,960
I don't want to make it difficult for you.

759
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,320
I'm willing to cancel the marriage

760
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,160
and make it possible for you and that Su lady.

761
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,560
Wen'an.

762
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,240
Wen'an.

763
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,200
Listen to me.

764
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,240
Listen to me.

765
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,560
The county chief is frightened.

766
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,800
Don't let him scare her.

767
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,760
Wen'an.

768
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,560
Listen to me.

769
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,200
Don't move.

770
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,120
Listen to me.

771
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,440
How could you do this?

772
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,800
You're a heartless man.

773
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,440
Wen'an, you're so rude.

774
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,720
How dare you do this outside?

775
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,800
You're a heartless man.

776
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,680
It's my fault.

777
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,920
I'm sorry.

778
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,640
I'm not a heartless man.

779
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,920
I'm not a heartless man.

780
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,400
Wen'an.

781
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,960
Enough.

782
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,280
Don't embarrass the county chief.

783
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,560
Kill this heartless man.

784
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,520
Kill him.

785
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,640
Wen'an.

786
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,360
Your Majesty.

787
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,440
I'm sorry for my son's misdeed.

788
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,400
I was wronged by that criminal.

789
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,320
I made a mistake by misdemeanor.

790
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,600
Please forgive me for my loyalty for years.

791
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,280
Please forgive me for my son's misdeed.

792
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,760
Your Majesty.

793
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,040
You must not forgive him.

794
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,960
Xie Xi and the criminal were in a private relationship.

795
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,920
He used the identity of Marquis Yongqing to forge the document.

796
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,040
He broke the law and was punished severely.

797
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,120
My daughter

798
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,520
has been deeply in love with him for years.

799
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,320
But he was deceived and disloyal

800
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,160
by the imperial decree.

801
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,320
Marquis Yongqing has no way to educate his son.

802
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,920
He has the right to make a decision.

803
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,000
I beg Your Majesty to cancel the marriage

804
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,320
and punish Marquis Yongqing severely.

805
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:33,960
Your Majesty.

806
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,680
Marquis Yongqing is a public figure in the court.

807
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
And King of Rui was a martial artist when he was young.

808
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,720
He disobeyed Marquis Yongqing.

809
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,560
I hope Your Majesty can forgive him

810
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,200
for his past misdeed.

811
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,640
King of Rui.

812
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
Marquis Yongqing has done a good job

813
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,040
for you.

814
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,640
What's your opinion on this?

815
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,200
Your Majesty.

816
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,560
I failed to repay His Majesty's kindness.

817
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,400
I was wronged by the court.

818
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,960
I was wronged by the law

819
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,600
and was punished severely.

820
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,600
I agree.

821
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,800
I agree.

822
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,120
Marquis Yongqing's son Xie Xi

823
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,320
broke the engagement with the princess of Wen'an

824
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,680
and became a commoner.

825
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,680
He couldn't take part in the imperial examination.

826
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:57,020
Marquis Yongqing was a

827
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,040
He used a playboy

828
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,320
to make King of Rui lose the support of Marquis Yongqing.

829
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,840
He's so poor.

830
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,680
Your Highness is wise.

831
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,560
It's a pity

832
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,880
that King of Rui is well-known

833
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,960
but he didn't ask for the money.

834
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,720
It's a bit surprising.

835
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,480
So what?

836
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,440
King of Rui could escape the strictness

837
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,080
of the law.

838
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,160
But he abandoned the Xie family

839
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,600
and fell into the eyes of others.

840
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,440
He's so heartless.

841
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,840
In this case,

842
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,320
the officials

843
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,200
will definitely fall for you.

844
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,040
Thank you.

845
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,680
How?

846
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,680
How?

847
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,680
You're really a sinner.

848
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,680
I saved your life.

849
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,680
You made me fall into this hell.

850
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Where's your conscience?

851
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Conscience?

852
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,680
You didn't protect the Crown Prince.

853
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
You made me your wife.

854
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
You even gave me a reason to fall into the cliff.

855
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
Have you ever thought about your conscience?

856
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,680
In the court, you risked your life to protect yourself.

857
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,680
When I was in the dead,

858
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,680
have you ever thought about your conscience?

859
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,680
Protect me?

860
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Love me?

861
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,680
Turn over a new leaf for me?

862
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,680
These are just the words

863
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
you said to your daughter.

864
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,680
You're a son of a bitch.

865
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,680
Once there's a change,

866
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
I'll be the first one to sacrifice.

867
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,680
Xixi,

868
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,680
you're not qualified to blame me.

869
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
Between you and me,

870
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
it's fair.

871
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,680
You've always treated me like a god.

872
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,680
You pretended to be weak and pitiful in front of me.

873
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,680
I never thought you were such a snake.

874
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,680
That's because I saw through your evil mind.

875
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,680
It's just a shadow.

876
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
To tell you the truth,

877
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,680
I've been using you.

878
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,680
I've never liked you.

879
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,680
I used to think you were fake.

880
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,680
I only have a bad feeling for you.

881
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
You shouldn't blame me.

882
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,680
It's all your own fault.

883
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,680
Bitch.

884
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
I want you to die.

885
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,680
The Mansion of Prince Yu.

886
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,680
The Mansion of Prince Yu.

887
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,680
Don't let love slip by.

888
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,680
Once the heart is like a candle,

889
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,680
flowers will bloom and wither.

890
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,680
The path of love will always be followed by the wind.

891
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,680
I will keep the love story as it is,

892
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,680
and live my life with you.

893
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,680
When the day breaks,

894
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,680
we will meet again.

895
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,680
Looking back,

896
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,680
I will feel the pain.

897
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,680
If the scenery is beautiful,

898
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,680
I will return to the past.

899
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,680
I will keep the love story as it is,

900
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,680
and live my life with you.

901
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,680
When the day breaks,

902
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,680
we will meet again.

903
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
Looking back,

904
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,680
I will feel the pain.

905
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,680
If the scenery is beautiful,

906
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,680
I will return to the past.

907
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,680
Looking back,

908
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,680
I will feel the pain.

909
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,680
If the scenery is beautiful,

910
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
I will return to the past.

911
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,680
Looking back,

912
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,680
I will feel the pain.

913
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,680
If the scenery is beautiful,

914
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,680
I will return to the past.

915
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,680
Looking back,

916
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,680
I will feel the pain.

917
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,680
If the scenery is beautiful,

918
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,680
I will return to the past.

919
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,680
Looking back for a long time,

920
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,180
I cannot remember how my past experiences are.

921
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,680
So I locked my eyes on the love story of the first time.
