Episode 16

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The Prince Yu's Mansion.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Su Tangli, you are so capable.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You are the only one who can beat the Prince Yu.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I understand.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's you.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You stole my embroidery and designed it

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to let Zhang Songjian to make me the emperor.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You made the Prince Yu the emperor.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Su Tangli, you are so despicable and shameless.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't forget.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You are a commoner.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Since you know I am the one who is the Prince Yu,

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you should show some respect.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't show up in front of me again.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Su Tangli, I am not done with you.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Prince Rui has ordered me

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
not to go to the Academy.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Lady Su, you are so strict.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Since His Highness has decided to take you in,

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
it will be disrespectful if you ask more.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Thank you for your advice.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Lady Su, please go in.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Thank you.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Father,

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I will take Prince Yu's hand to avenge you.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
One day,

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will be more than 100 times more

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
guilty than you.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Guards.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Please go in.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Go in.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Go in.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Go in.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Go in.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Guards,

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
send Prince Yu to the Academy.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I am a servant of Songlin Academy.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I am here to deliver some snacks for His Highness.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let him in.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Go in.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Guards.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Tea cups will be broken for no reason.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
How dare you ask me about the design?

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What crime should I be punished for?

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I dared to make this plan

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
because I heard a little bit about the situation

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
between His Highness and King of Rui.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I am willing to follow your will

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and work for you.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I am willing to arrange those

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
fancy dishes in the Academy.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But why do you think you can get into my business?

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I just...

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I am willing to offer

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the House of Marquis Yongqing to His Highness.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I dare to ask you,

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
is there any progress

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
on His Highness?

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Tang Li has just come out

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
from the Academy.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I am afraid

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
he might not be able to

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
get in touch with His Highness.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I am afraid

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
he might not be able to

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
get in touch with His Highness.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I am afraid

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
His Highness might not be able to

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
get in touch with His Highness.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I hope you can give me some advice.

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No need.

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
As for the credit you gave me previously,

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I will remind you of it.

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Do you know

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
the sky was bright when His Highness was born?

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is the most beautiful thing in the world.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Everyone knows it.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Remember.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Brightness is the forbidden word.

116
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's all.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You saw it.

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Family rules.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Family rules.

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If you have a family rule,

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
you should be punished

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
for making mistakes.

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's still late.

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You should leave now.

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I am willing to do anything.

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Thank you for your permission.

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I remember that

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Lady Su was a descendant of Su Changhua.

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
She was a good student

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and was taught by the saints.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now she is studying

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
from my point of view.

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Am I right?

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I am not a good student.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I am just a student.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I am just a student.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I am just a student.

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I am just a student.

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I am just a student.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Are you happy

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
or do you want to kill yourself?

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I know you are real.

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I know you are sincere.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You can be honest

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
but why do you have to reject sincerity?

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's true that I am not sincere.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But I have one thing that I don't understand.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You chose to rely on me instead of King of Rui.

150
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
King of Rui can't do what I can do for you?

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
King of Rui is the only son of the Xie family.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But when my father was in trouble,

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
the Xie family was so unjust to my father.

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's not King of Rui's attitude.

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Now King of Rui is still

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
so cold to the Xie family.

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How can such a cruel person

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
be worthy of surrender?

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I can't surrender.

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Besides, if I surrender to King of Rui,

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I have to continue to face

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
the fake Xie Xi.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's better to take the opportunity to kill this eye.

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I will pave the way for you.

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
you are also the reason

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
why you surrender to me.

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Your Highness.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Your Highness, why are you so stubborn?

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If I say

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I have a better opinion of you

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
between King of Rui and you,

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
do you still want to ask more?

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I never lack a woman who is beautiful.

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If you want me to keep you,

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
let's see if you can be useful to me.

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Tang Li

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
will not let you down.

179
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Mother.

180
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Such a big thing happened.

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Why do you have to come to see me?

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm so worried.

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry to make you worried.

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But King of Rui is in the palace.

185
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I will be visited by the officials

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
if I make any mistakes.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm afraid I will drag you down.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
All right, all right. Get up.

189
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Why don't you protect the Xie family

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and lose a minister of the Ministry of War?

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What kind of loss is this?

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Mother, you don't know.

193
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If I beg for the Xie family's mercy,

194
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I will say it's a way to discipline the king.

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In the big picture,

196
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
it's to break the party and win the private.

197
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
This is a big trick of the officials.

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's also the situation that King of Rui wants to see.

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But you are doing this,

200
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
won't let the Xie family be sad?

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Mother, don't worry.

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The Princess has taken the responsibility of the Xie family

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
to prevent the people from disbanding.

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You are really a woman

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
from a family of scholars.

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You are really a woman from a family of scholars.

207
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You have a lot of experience.

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It seems that

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
the Princess I chose for you is not bad.

210
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
How long have you been married?

211
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
When can I hug my grandson?

212
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I will try my best.

213
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I will try my best.

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
By the way,

215
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I heard that the officials are interested in the Spring Festival Gala.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I and Qingzhi are going out of the city to prepare

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
to make up for the current situation.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm leaving.

219
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay, go.

220
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The officials have been invited by me.

221
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I will go out of the city tomorrow

222
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
to prepare for the Spring Festival Gala.

223
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes.

224
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How is the Princess?

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
She is always stable.

226
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Everything in the mansion is arranged properly.

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
At this time,

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
if there is no medicine,

229
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
she should still be in the Flower Pavilion.

230
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Recently,

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
she seems to be out early and return late.

232
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There are few opportunities for me to meet her.

233
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Is she avoiding me?

234
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Is she?

235
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I...

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm drunk.

237
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Your Majesty, you can't take advantage of me.

238
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Your Majesty,

239
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm drunk.

240
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm drunk.

241
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Your Majesty,

242
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
you can't take advantage of me.

243
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If you didn't hold me last night,

244
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I wouldn't have stayed.

245
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Even so,

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
you were not drunk at that time.

247
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But you forgot our engagement on the wedding day.

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's not what a gentleman did.

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Okay,

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
it's my fault.

251
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Next time,

252
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you should leave now.

253
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I...

254
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I...

255
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Drinking is bad for health.

256
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
In the future,

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
it's better to drink less.

258
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't worry.

259
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I won't drink again in the future.

260
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Gu's Mansion

261
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Before leaving the city,

262
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
you should ask the Princess Consort

263
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
to do the housework.

264
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Before leaving the city,

265
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
you should have a meeting with her.

266
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Go to the Flower Pavilion with me.

267
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

268
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,840
What's this?

269
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,080
What's this?

270
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,280
Mr. Lu.

271
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,200
Cousin.

272
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,840
What are you hiding?

273
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,320
Don't think I don't know

274
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,920
if it's your order.

275
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,400
You've loved Furong since you were a kid.

276
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,880
I guess this is for your lover.

277
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,760
Tell me, which lady is it?

278
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,440
You're all here. Let's eat.

279
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,320
Let's sit down.

280
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,880
Today's banquet

281
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,280
is to celebrate Wen An's joining the Flower Pavilion.

282
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,040
Good.

283
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,920
Next,

284
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,840
I'd like to thank you and Qingzhao for your help.

285
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,040
Lastly,

286
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,360
we have a special request from Princess Rui.

287
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,200
We need tea instead of wine.

288
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,920
Let's have a toast.

289
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,200
It's so lively.

290
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,480
Do you mind if I have a meal with you?

291
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,920
No need to be polite.

292
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,840
Today,

293
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,080
I'm here as a family member.

294
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,120
Feel free to chat with me.

295
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,360
Prince Rui is busy.

296
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,720
He must have missed by chance.

297
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,440
He'll leave after saying hello.

298
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,760
You're wrong.

299
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,240
I'm here today for a special reason.

300
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,680
I'm here to see what you're up to.

301
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,200
Shu Jun,

302
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,800
let Prince Rui sit down.

303
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,720
Yes, please sit down.

304
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,280
Please sit down.

305
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,920
Sit down.

306
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,680
Sit down.

307
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,800
Shu Jun,

308
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,800
what does Prince Rui like to eat?

309
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,000
I'll go and prepare some dishes.

310
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,520
He...

311
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,280
He likes to eat steamed fish,

312
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,400
Meijiang soup,

313
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,360
Shanshan cuisine,

314
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,440
and...

315
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,080
Tofu soup.

316
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,800
Tofu soup.

317
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,560
Tofu soup.

318
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Tofu soup.

319
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,480
Tofu soup.

320
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Tofu soup.

321
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Tofu soup.

322
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Tofu soup.

323
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,200
That's enough.

324
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,720
I didn't expect you to care about me so much.

325
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,600
You even remember everything I do when I'm happy.

326
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,360
It's my pleasure to have you.

327
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,640
This side seat is all Wei Cheng's.

328
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,640
Your deep compassion for one and no one

329
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,920
really helps me view them fondly.

330
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,320
It seems that one last item

331
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,600
should be mine next.

332
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,440
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,880
Let's eat.

334
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Let's eat.

335
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,200
Let's eat.

336
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,880
Let's eat.

337
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,360
Let's eat.

338
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,560
Shu Jun.

339
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,320
I was indeed careless.

340
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I apologize to you.

341
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,200
Let's forget about it.

342
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Don't mention it again.

343
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,360
Please help yourself, Your Majesty.

344
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,800
I... I'm going to see Shu Jun.

345
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,520
Tell me.

346
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,160
It's almost done.

347
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,360
Can we have a private dinner?

348
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,560
What's going on in the backyard?

349
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,440
Brother Song.

350
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,480
Can you say something?

351
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,520
I need to help Ming Shu clean up.

352
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,440
I think King of Rui is quite free.

353
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,000
Why don't you go to him?

354
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,120
It's okay. I'll help too.

355
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,800
Why are you still cleaning up?

356
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I can do it alone.

357
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,040
Lu... Lu Chang.

358
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,280
I heard that you're good at martial arts.

359
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,040
I have a question for you.

360
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,680
What's the question?

361
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,160
There's a trick to find snakes by picking grass.

362
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,440
Teach me.

363
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,480
You... You tell me.

364
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,280
You must call Brother Song to teach you how to find snakes by picking grass.

365
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,720
Brother Song is the best at this trick.

366
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,760
Brother Song.

367
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,000
Let's show him.

368
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,600
Hurry up.

369
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,120
Come on.

370
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,760
Come on.

371
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,600
Come on.

372
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,920
Lady Wen An.

373
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,320
Come on.

374
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,280
Let's talk.

375
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,960
Sir.

376
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,040
It's my first time here.

377
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,000
I want to buy a hairpin.

378
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,280
What do you recommend?

379
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,040
Me?

380
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,920
Sir.

381
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm asking you.

382
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,280
You...

383
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,000
What kind of style do you want?

384
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,880
I might as well turn into a pumpskinie.

385
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,880
Give it a try.

386
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,920
Handsome is fine.

387
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,320
An attractive one.

388
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,320
What does it mean?

389
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,960
It's the same as the one of Princess Rui.

390
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
You can wear it to cover up the crowd.

391
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,520
It will be unforgettable.

392
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:31,300
Punish the

393
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,660
Ifcheering Pavilion needed you will wait for any money you normally have,

394
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,040
no need to command me.

395
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,260
Thank you Great King for your kind treatment.

396
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,940
But it's better for us to get married before the wedding

397
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,020
and not get involved.

398
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,740
It's up to you.

399
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,380
Tomorrow,

400
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,460
I'll prepare the wedding gift for you.

401
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,140
I'll leave the rest of the things

402
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,260
to you.

403
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,340
So suddenly?

404
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,940
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

405
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,900
I'll keep my duty.

406
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,060
You should rest early.

407
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,700
Your Majesty.

408
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,700
It's cold in the spring.

409
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,260
Remember to bring more clothes

410
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,260
to avoid the cold.

411
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,300
Okay.

412
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,300
Thank you for your concern.

413
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,860
Your Highness is more concerned

414
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,140
about His Majesty than before.

415
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,220
Aunt Li.

416
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,700
My daughter-in-law,

417
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,740
you're finally back.

418
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
Your husband

419
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,740
is finally back home.

420
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,820
He's waiting for you.

421
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,060
My husband?

422
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,380
Look.

423
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,660
He's back this time.

424
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,860
He's not leaving.

425
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,340
Come on.

426
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,100
Zeng Niangzi.

427
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,660
It's you.

428
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:41,980
Son.

429
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,460
You finally came back.

430
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,060
You should spend time with your daughter-in-law.

431
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,260
I'm waiting for you to have a grandchild.

432
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,500
Zeng Niangzi.

433
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,180
I'm a little confused.

434
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,780
Don't take it to heart.

435
00:26:59,300 --> 00:26:59,900
It's okay.

436
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,180
I know what's going on with Aunt Li.

437
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,540
Aunt.

438
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,620
Look.

439
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,460
You got the wrong person again.

440
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,740
I'm not your daughter-in-law.

441
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,380
But your husband is filial

442
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
and a good man.

443
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,980
You'll be able to get what you want in the future.

444
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,100
Good.

445
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,220
Good.

446
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,060
I'm sorry.

447
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,180
The son of the late wife's late wife

448
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,100
and I are friends.

449
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,060
It's also a good thing

450
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,900
to see the late wife.

451
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,900
I invited two people to take care of the late wife.

452
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,940
But the late wife

453
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,620
is ill.

454
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,980
She's a little confused.

455
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,980
I'm afraid they'll all be taken away.

456
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,820
Zeng Niangzi.

457
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,260
Why are you here?

458
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,820
We're all neighbors.

459
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,420
I think the old woman

460
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,340
is living alone and poor.

461
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,380
She comes to see her from time to time.

462
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,540
So you're the one who's been taking care of the old lady.

463
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,740
Zeng Niangzi is kind and kind.

464
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,140
I thank you again.

465
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,380
Don't.

466
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,820
It's just a favor.

467
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,060
No need to thank me.

468
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,340
You drove away the coward for me last time.

469
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,420
I didn't even have a chance to thank you.

470
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,420
It's no big deal.

471
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,540
Zeng Niangzi, don't mention it.

472
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,020
Brother.

473
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,180
Lower your head.

474
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,700
What's this?

475
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,100
Xu Yanfu.

476
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,340
Protect the high-ranking.

477
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
High-ranking depends on luck?

478
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,740
I ran to the Prime Minister's Temple this morning.

479
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,540
I took it from those seven aunts and eight aunts.

480
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,780
It took a lot of effort.

481
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,580
Keep it going.

482
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,540
Put it inside.

483
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,300
Thank you, my lady.

484
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,940
Brother Lu, is Uncle Yin here?

485
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,620
Qingzhao.

486
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,420
Brother Song.

487
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,700
You're just in time.

488
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,940
Look what I brought you.

489
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,420
This is Xu Yanfu from the Prime Minister's Temple?

490
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,020
It's a rare good thing.

491
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,580
Thank you, Uncle Yin.

492
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,940
You're welcome.

493
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,820
I'm glad you like it.

494
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,540
I...

495
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,420
Brother, you can't take it off.

496
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,820
Even if it's to make me feel safe,

497
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,500
you can take it off.

498
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,580
Take it off.

499
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,660
So,

500
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,060
it's unique.

501
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:49,860
Brother Lu.

502
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,580
I have something to do.

503
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,780
I'd like to talk to Uncle Yin.

504
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,020
What?

505
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,340
I'm the one who can't hear you.

506
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,540
Brother, just go out and watch the door.

507
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,860
There won't be any misunderstanding.

508
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,100
Go.

509
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,500
It's not a good thing.

510
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,260
I'm your brother.

511
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,380
Actually, I ordered this hairpin

512
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,780
to give it to you.

513
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,660
It's too precious.

514
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,660
I remember

515
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,780
your brother asked me

516
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,460
to be your brother.

517
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,060
You said

518
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,580
I could be your best friend.

519
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,860
If you really think I'm your best friend,

520
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,100
don't refuse me again.

521
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,180
Even if Qingzhao is Mr. Qingshan,

522
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,780
I've never felt

523
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,580
touched when we first met.

524
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,100
It's a matter of time.

525
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,220
I'd better not affect his mood.

526
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,660
I'll return this hairpin

527
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,780
to him in the future.

528
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,140
I'll take it then.

529
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,860
Thank you, Qingzhao.

530
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,340
There are some words

531
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,140
that will be said to you

532
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,460
after the life is over.

533
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
I'll tell you later.

534
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,380
Young Master.

535
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,060
Mr. Lu.

536
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,660
Have you seen my young master?

537
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,260
Young Master.

538
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,580
Brother.

539
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,380
Qingzhao.

540
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,020
I have something to go back to Flower Pavilion.

541
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,980
I'm leaving first.

542
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,020
Brother.

543
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,660
Brother Lu.

544
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,220
The Spring Festival is coming.

545
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,540
The academy is about to be built.

546
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,460
You can take your clothes and things home.

547
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,980
How about I take you home?

548
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,620
I've prepared the car for you.

549
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,540
Thank you for your kindness.

550
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,940
It's not as if you can't see me clearly.

551
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,220
I just want to be with you.

552
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,180
No.

553
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,780
No.

554
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
I'm not going to be with you.

555
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,420
No.

556
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,460
No.

557
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,540
No.

558
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,540
No.

559
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,540
No.

560
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,540
No.

561
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,540
No.

562
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,540
No.

563
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,540
No.

564
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,540
No.

565
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,540
No.

566
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,540
No.

567
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,540
No.

568
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,540
No.

569
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,540
No.

570
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
No.

571
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,540
No.

572
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,540
No.

573
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
No.

574
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,540
No.

575
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
No.

576
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,540
No.

577
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
No.

578
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
No.

579
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
Stop.

580
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
My leg.

581
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,860
My leg.

582
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,860
What's wrong with you?

583
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
What's wrong with you?

584
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,860
My leg.

585
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,860
My leg is broken.

586
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,860
You want to hit me to death?

587
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,460
Everyone.

588
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,260
I didn't hit him.

589
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,260
You can find a doctor to treat him.

590
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,740
There is a clinic ahead.

591
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,620
Can someone help me

592
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,860
get a doctor here?

593
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,860
I'll go.

594
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,860
You're so mean.

595
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
Move.

596
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
Move.

597
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,860
What's going on?

598
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,860
It's him.

599
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,860
He got off the carriage.

600
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,860
He ran so fast.

601
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,860
He didn't even open his eyes.

602
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
He was afraid that my leg would be crushed.

603
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,860
Sir.

604
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,860
Please check.

605
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,860
I've already asked for a doctor.

606
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,860
I'll check if he's not a dead man.

607
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,860
The investigation is about the government.

608
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,860
How can I let you mess it up?

609
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,860
You ran in the street

610
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
and hurt a passerby.

611
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,860
I think

612
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
you're a fierce man.

613
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,860
Guards.

614
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,860
Take him down.

615
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,860
Yes.

616
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,860
You don't want to get hurt or investigate.

617
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
How can I?

618
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,180
It's not the right time

619
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
to investigate the case.

620
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
Why don't you investigate?

621
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
Take him away.

622
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
You...

623
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
Slow down.

624
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Slow down.

625
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Slow down.

626
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Slow down.

627
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
Slow down.

628
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,180
Go.

629
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Be honest.

630
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,140
How can you

631
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,140
just go to jail?

632
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,140
Where is the injured man?

633
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,140
Did you find a doctor to treat him?

634
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,140
There are witnesses on the street.

635
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
What can we find out?

636
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Liangzhou Prefecture is so chaotic.

637
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Where is the fake woman?

638
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,420
I want to see her.

639
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,420
Stop it.

640
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
It's the time of spring and autumn.

641
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,420
The government is asking for peace.

642
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,420
If it's a big deal,

643
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
you're the one who's unlucky.

644
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,420
Go.

645
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,420
This is strange.

646
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,420
I'd better think about it.

647
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,420
How should I deal with it?

648
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,420
What's the use of being so talented?

649
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,420
You offended the powerful.

650
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,420
You're not worthy of the reputation.

651
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,420
You did something wrong.

652
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,420
When I reply,

653
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,420
I'll say something for you.

654
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,420
I'm under the command of Lord Fu Yin.

655
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,420
I'll be the one to punish him.

656
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,420
I'll punish him.

657
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,420
I'll punish him.

658
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,420
I'll punish him.

659
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,420
I'll punish him.

660
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,420
I'll punish him.

661
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,420
I'll punish him.

662
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,420
I'll punish him.

663
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,420
I'll punish him.

664
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,420
I'll punish him.

665
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
I'll punish him.

666
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,420
I'll punish him.

667
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,420
I'll punish him.

668
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,420
What?

669
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
Brother is in prison?

670
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,420
He said he was a horse-riding murderer.

671
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,420
Brother is always cautious and law-abiding.

672
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,420
How could he do this?

673
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,420
Something's wrong.

674
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,420
Brother Yin, you're working in the government.

675
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,420
Can you ask Brother?

676
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,420
I've been there.

677
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,420
But this Jia Fu Yin ordered that

678
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,420
she can't be seen.

679
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,420
How can that be?

680
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,420
She must be in Songlin Academy.

681
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,420
Lu Chang's two kings are in awe.

682
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,420
She's the reason

683
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,420
why Jia Fu Yin hates her.

684
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,420
She's just being mean.

685
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,420
If that's the case,

686
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,420
we can't let the situation get worse.

687
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,420
If we're convicted

688
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,420
and the public doesn't know about it,

689
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,420
we won't be able to take the exam.

690
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,420
We can't let mother know.

691
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,420
Don't worry, Ming Shu.

692
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,420
We're here for you.

693
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
I've asked father to find out about this.

694
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,420
If there's any news, we'll make another plan.

695
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,420
Others are in trouble, and there's a way out.

696
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,420
How can you

697
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,420
forget your good sister at this time?

698
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,420
I've thought about it.

699
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,420
Rather than waiting for it,

700
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,420
it's better to take the initiative.

701
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,420
The most important thing is to try to see Brother

702
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,420
and ask him about the source.

703
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,420
Then we can have a place to release him.

704
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
I'll go with you.

705
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,420
I'll do it even if it's a bed.

706
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,420
They'll definitely give me the honor of Zhengguo Mansion.

707
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,420
I'll do it.

708
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,420
Sir, let's see the source of Jiangling.

709
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,420
No.

710
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,420
Why are you here again?

711
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,420
Didn't I say

712
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,420
to stop the investigation?

713
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,420
Brother,

714
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,420
you see, you and I are working in the government office.

715
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,420
I'm sorry.

716
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,420
No.

717
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,420
Zhengguo Mansion?

718
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,420
If Fu Ying is convicted,

719
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,420
we will have the honor of Zhengguo Mansion.

720
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,420
You say it again.

721
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,420
Can you do it?

722
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,420
Yes.

723
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,420
But

724
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,420
I can only do it once.

725
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,420
I'll go.

726
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,420
Brother.

727
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,420
Uncle.

728
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,420
Brother.

729
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,420
How are you?

730
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,420
I'm fine.

731
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,420
Don't worry.

732
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,420
With the wish book you sent,

733
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,420
I can make it come true.

734
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,420
I'll go with you.

735
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,420
I'll go with you.

736
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,420
I'll go with you.

737
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,420
I'll go with you.

738
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,420
I'll make it come true.

739
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,420
Ming Shu.

740
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,420
You're in a hurry.

741
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,420
I'll tell you something.

742
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,420
I'm sure

743
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,420
that I didn't bump into anyone.

744
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,420
This is a crime.

745
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,420
Secondly,

746
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,420
the military governor rushed to the scene

747
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,420
and refused to have a trial.

748
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Thirdly,

749
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,420
Fu Ying didn't investigate any details

750
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,420
and was convicted.

751
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,420
You mean

752
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,420
someone set up a trap?

753
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,420
I haven't figured it out yet.

754
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
I don't know who it is.

755
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,420
Could it be Jiang Lin?

756
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,420
No.

757
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,420
To figure out the real purpose,

758
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,420
we must force Jia Fu Ying

759
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,420
to re-investigate the case.

760
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,420
If we do something wrong,

761
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,420
we'll find a flaw.

762
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,420
As long as we don't let any

763
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,420
horse-dead soldiers escape,

764
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,420
it's not difficult.

765
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,420
Do as I say.

766
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,420
Go to the defendant.

767
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,420
The witness was poisoned.

768
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,420
It shouldn't be difficult to find him.

769
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,420
After you find him,

770
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,420
report him to the police

771
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,420
and force Jia Fu Ying to appear in court.

772
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,420
What if he doesn't cooperate?

773
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,420
It doesn't matter.

774
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
I'm innocent.

775
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,420
I'll be calm on the day of trial.

776
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,420
You just need to do as I say.

777
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,420
This is the only way to get out of it as soon as possible.

778
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,420
Don't worry.

779
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,420
I'll figure it out.

780
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,420
Thank you.

781
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,420
As long as you're safe,

782
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,420
it's nothing.

783
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,420
Mr. Song, please wait.

784
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,420
Jia Fu Ying.

785
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,420
Mr. Song.

786
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,420
Mr. Song.

787
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,420
I have a case today.

788
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,420
I want to talk to you.

789
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,420
I'm not talented.

790
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,420
I'm a government official.

791
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,420
I don't have to plan for you.

792
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,420
The case of Lu Chang was involved in the case.

793
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,420
The other man took the card of the government's palace

794
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,420
and wrote that Lu Chang's sister was a spy.

795
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,420
It's very dangerous to the brothers and sisters of the Lu family.

796
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,420
Is Lu Chang the guest of the government's palace?

797
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,420
The man is just a friend.

798
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,420
Jia Fu Ying, don't worry about the case.

799
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,420
The government's palace has nothing to do with this case.

800
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,420
I see.

801
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,420
Then I'm relieved.

802
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,420
Goodbye.

803
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,420
Brother Lu's sister.

804
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,420
As long as we catch Qian Si,

805
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,420
it proves that her wound is not caused by Brother Lu.

806
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,420
It's possible to prove his innocence.

807
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,420
We have to find a doctor

808
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,420
to check her again.

809
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,420
Don't worry.

810
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,420
As long as we don't worry about any clues,

811
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,420
we can prove Brother Lu's innocence.

812
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,420
We're not related.

813
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,420
We're not related.

814
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,420
But he cares about us so much.

815
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,420
He's so careless.

816
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,420
He looks so crazy.

817
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,420
If we want to catch Qian Si,

818
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,420
we can't do it in this way.

819
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,420
Brother Ying,

820
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,420
why don't you pretend to be a doctor?

821
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,420
Me?

822
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,420
Qian Niangzi.

823
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,420
Qian Niangzi.

824
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
Who's there?

825
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420
Qian Niangzi.

826
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,420
My uncle lives in Zuo Xiang.

827
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,420
He just came to the capital.

828
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,420
Is Qian injured?

829
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,420
My brother is injured.

830
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,420
Let him check it.

831
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,420
It's not expensive.

832
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,420
Make sure he's okay.

833
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,420
Who's your Qian?

834
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,420
Where are you from?

835
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
No need.

836
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,420
We've checked his wound.

837
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,420
My brother is a technical expert.

838
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,420
Let him check it.

839
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
Don't play tricks on me.

840
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,420
I know what you're up to.

841
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,420
What tricks?

842
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,420
Qian Niangzi.

843
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,420
Qian...

844
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,420
They just don't let us in.

845
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,420
They just want to cover up the injury.

846
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,420
It's not easy to alert them.

847
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,420
We can't break in.

848
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,420
What should we do?

849
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,420
Since we can't get in,

850
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,420
we'll find a way to lure them out.

851
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,420
I found that your brain is as useful as your brother.

852
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,420
Hurry up.

853
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
Find a way.

854
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,420
Then I'll have to trouble you

855
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,420
to find out the background of this family.

856
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,420
See if there's any useful information.

857
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,420
Okay.

858
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,420
Let's go.

859
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,420
Don't miss the white-headed man.

860
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,420
Once the heart is like a candle,

861
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,420
flowers bloom and wither in the world.

862
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:46,420
The journey to be a honest man is like a wind.

863
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,420
I wish we could stay in the same house,

864
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,420
and keep our love alive.

865
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:59,420
Let's go through the bustling and bustling world together.

866
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,420
When the rain stops,

867
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,420
the fate will change.

868
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Looking back,

869
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,420
I feel the pain.

870
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,420
If the scenery is beautiful,

871
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,420
can it be compared with the wind?

872
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,420
A kind of love is left behind,

873
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,420
and I'm lost in my heart.

874
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,420
The books are long,

875
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:34,420
but I can't count the time I miss you.

876
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,420
The moon is long,

877
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,420
but it's more precious than the wind.

878
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,420
I can't forget you,

879
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,420
but I miss you.

880
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,420
I wish time could be forgotten,

881
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,420
but I still dream about you.

882
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,420
I'm wrong.
