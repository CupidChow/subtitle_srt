FS baba

3
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,220
Tie the red thread to the life, ask who will stay

4
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,220
The snow has been new, the fate is a new chapter

5
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,220
Missing has grown, like a flower, like a waste

6
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,220
The road ahead is difficult, only fate is wrong

7
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,220
The light can only reach the end of the world

8
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,220
I don't regret

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,220
The winter of the first year, the moon hides the cliff

10
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,220
The new autumn, the spring breeze, the next life is a plan

11
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:10,600
The beauty is in the bustle, the lonely person is too

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,600
How lucky the world is, the world and I, when will I return

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,600
The sun, the moon, the stars, the moon, the flowers, the night, the spring, the sword, the clouds, the summer

14
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,220
Episode 2

15
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,220
Min Shu

16
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,220
I'll help you apply the medicine

17
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,220
No need, you're almost fully recovered

18
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,220
I just went to find you, Lu Sheng told me

19
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,220
Don't be angry, his intention is not to make you angry

20
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,220
I brought you your favorite pancakes, just out of the oven, not greasy

21
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,220
Try it

22
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,220
Min Shu

23
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,220
Don't be sad

24
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,220
Qin Zhao, do you think brother An is very excessive?

25
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,220
Who is his sister?

26
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,220
He actually helped others to hide me

27
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,220
Who is the one who is wrong?

28
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,220
In terms of relatives, who is better than you?

29
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,220
I'm not the one who is wrong

30
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,220
I'm not the one who is wrong

31
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,220
I'm not the one who is wrong

32
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,220
I'm not the one who is wrong

33
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,220
In the world, who is better than your blood, sweat and heart?

34
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,220
You two are the closest

35
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
I can't see it

36
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,220
That one, he is a man of his words

37
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,220
Brother An, they went to someone else

38
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,220
Don't tell me anything

39
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,220
Brother Luo must have his own thoughts

40
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,220
Min Shu, you might as well think about it

41
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,220
If you find out the real identity of Tang Sheng first

42
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,220
Will you tell Wen An or help him hide it?

43
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,220
I promised Wen An

44
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,220
I will not lie to her

45
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,220
But she is Mr. Su's daughter

46
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,220
She is very good at making up stories

47
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,220
I have to think about her

48
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,220
So to speak

49
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,220
Brother Luo chooses to hide

50
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,220
He also helped you with a lot of troubles

51
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,220
He must have considered it for you

52
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,220
He shouldn't have told me

53
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,220
Look at you

54
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,220
You are full of food

55
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,220
I, I, I will do it myself

56
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,220
Don't eat so hard

57
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,220
Come, have some tea

58
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,220
Brother Luo

59
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,220
I will leave first

60
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,220
Thank you

61
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,220
Do you think

62
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,220
Brother Luo is very wary of me and Min Shu?

63
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,220
This is not just a guard

64
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,220
Mr. Lu

65
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,220
I can't wait for the whole person to be in the middle of you two

66
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,220
But what I did is not right

67
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,220
That's why Brother Luo is so wary of me

68
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,220
Of course you can't be picky

69
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,220
But is Mr. Lu the brother of Mrs. Lu?

70
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,220
Mr. Lu, think about it

71
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
If you have a sister

72
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
Then you are also like this

73
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,220
Beware of other men coming close

74
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,220
I think you are right

75
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,220
I am too close to Min Shu

76
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,220
It's really rude

77
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,220
I have to think about Mr. Lu's feelings

78
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,220
That's right

79
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,220
I want to know Mrs. Lu

80
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,220
I'm afraid I have to go through this level first

81
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,220
You go out

82
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,220
Go, go, go

83
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,220
After all, she is the only daughter

84
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,220
I don't want to talk to you

85
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,220
I just didn't think of a good idea

86
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,220
Brother Luo, you have to go

87
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,220
I'm going to go

88
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,220
I'm going to go

89
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,220
I'm going to go

90
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,220
I'm going to go

91
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
I'm going to go

92
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,220
I'm going to go

93
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,220
Brother Luo apologizes to you

94
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,220
If I report to Mr. Wen An

95
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,220
Do you dare to promise not to be angry?

96
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,220
Say it

97
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,220
I knew you would protect her

98
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
I'm wrong

99
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,220
Don't be angry, okay?

100
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,220
Min Shu

101
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,220
Thank you

102
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,220
Xie Lang

103
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
Su Rui

104
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,220
You said that you only have me in your heart

105
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,220
If that's the case

106
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,220
Why do you still want to marry Wen An?

107
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,220
As long as you and the county chief are married

108
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,220
Then the county chief will not hold us back

109
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,220
I don't want to break off the engagement with Wen An

110
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,220
You and you are two birds with one stone

111
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,220
But now I haven't got the position of the crown prince

112
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,220
For the future between you and me

113
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,220
Wait a little longer

114
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,220
When will it be?

115
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,220
Soon

116
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,220
After I go to the palace to get the position of the crown prince

117
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,220
I'll marry Wen An

118
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,220
Even if it doesn't work

119
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,220
No matter how bad it is

120
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,220
It can also keep your wife's name

121
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,220
But he is so shamelessly investigating now

122
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,220
What are you going to do?

123
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,220
What are you afraid of?

124
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,220
I'll just tell him clearly

125
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,220
If he doesn't want to accept

126
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,220
Can cancel the engagement

127
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,220
Don't break your promise

128
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,220
rest assured

129
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,220
Wen An

130
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,220
When did I lie to you?

131
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,220
Wen An

132
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,220
You said I was still angry

133
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,220
Go back and rest early, Brother Lu

134
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,220
No sister, no brother

135
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,220
Brother is wrong

136
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,220
What's the matter in the house today?

137
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,220
Madam came today

138
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,220
People from the tribe are frequent

139
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,220
I'm afraid there's something wrong

140
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,220
Why else

141
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,220
My mother is so hardworking

142
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,220
Naturally, I have to be careful

143
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,220
It's really for her son

144
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
Plans for the position of the crown prince

145
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,220
Childe

146
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,220
I'm afraid it's not good

147
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,220
The wolf master is on the side of the young master

148
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,220
Intention to let him be the crown prince

149
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,220
now

150
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,220
There is a big lady in it

151
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,220
She took my mother's position

152
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,220
It's hard to talk to me

153
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,220
Now I want her son

154
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,220
To take my position

155
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,220
It's too much to bully

156
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,220
The situation is not decided yet

157
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,220
We still have a chance

158
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,220
Wait for you to be the crown prince in the future

159
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,220
Where else do they have a place to be?

160
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
That's right

161
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,220
I have to get the position of the crown prince

162
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,220
Otherwise, I will only die

163
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,220
If you want to get the position of the crown prince

164
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,220
You have to rely on the death of Wen An

165
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,220
This marriage

166
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,220
I have to do it

167
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,220
Brother Lu

168
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
Brother Lu

169
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,220
Brother Song, what's the matter?

170
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,220
This pen

171
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,220
Give it to Brother Lu

172
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,220
This pen is the top wife of Sanyang

173
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,220
It's the best choice for the bookkeeper

174
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,220
It's just that I'm used to writing

175
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,220
With this pen

176
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,220
I'm afraid it's a little bit of a mess

177
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,220
Not good

178
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,220
I have a mind of Song

179
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
Please take it back

180
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,220
In case you waste a good intention

181
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,220
Brother Lu is used to writing

182
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
But in the academy

183
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
It's still used by Xiao Kai

184
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,220
This is more useful than sooner

185
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,220
As long as he has a chance to use it

186
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,220
It's not a waste

187
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,220
Brother Lu is so determined to refuse

188
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,220
Know its benefits

189
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,220
I have something to do

190
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,220
Take a step first

191
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,220
Sure

192
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,220
Ming Shu

193
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,220
Booker

194
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,220
Why are you here?

195
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,220
Princess

196
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,220
Hurry up, sit down

197
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,220
Why did you suddenly come to the academy?

198
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,140
any clues?

199
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,060
If I tell the truth,

200
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,980
I'm afraid it'll hurt Su Tanglin.

201
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,900
But if I don't tell him,

202
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,380
I'll let Wen'an down again.

203
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,100
I think

204
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,980
she must have found something.

205
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,900
Things are getting more and more tense.

206
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,940
I...

207
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,700
It's okay.

208
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,580
Since I'm here,

209
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,900
I'll go and meet her.

210
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,660
The wedding is going well.

211
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,940
Yes.

212
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,460
Why is she gone?

213
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,380
He's really worried about you.

214
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,180
He said he'd send you out of the capital

215
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,940
to spend time with you

216
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,980
and keep you company.

217
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,300
I just said I wouldn't be afraid of her.

218
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,980
But he wants to send me away.

219
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,580
I won't let him do that.

220
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,580
You can't go.

221
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,340
She's still here.

222
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,420
Tang Sheng.

223
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,020
Be careful.

224
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,020
Wait.

225
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,820
Your skin is loose.

226
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,460
It's windy outside.

227
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
If you catch a cold,

228
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,340
I'll be the one who'll be heartbroken.

229
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,940
You're so talkative.

230
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,220
Through a social media group,

231
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,380
it's

232
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,740
said that akã£ã¦ã

237
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,780
Li Wen'an is stll

238
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,580
slippy for no reason.

239
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,420
I really don't see a reason.

240
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,220
And their post-guarantee material

241
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,840
is just that

242
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,640

246
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,860
San Hmmm

247
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,260
go

248
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,980
What's wrong with you

249
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
It's ok

250
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,140
Are you ok

251
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Yes

252
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:03,900
Both

253
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,820
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,580
Min Shu.

255
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,700
Brother,

256
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,420
I didn't disturb you, did I?

257
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,980
No.

258
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,700
Come in.

259
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,340
Why don't you talk?

260
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,340
Today, Wen An is here.

261
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,700
She asked me about the progress of my investigation.

262
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,220
Okay.

263
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,540
You don't want to know my answer?

264
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
I told you

265
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,340
you just need to do what you want.

266
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,580
Don't worry about it.

267
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,580
I didn't tell Wen An.

268
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,540
Because I believe

269
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,580
you can protect Su Tang Li with all your heart.

270
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,460
As for Wen An,

271
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,620
she just wants the truth.

272
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,260
She must have a way to protect Su Tang Li

273
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,380
and let her see the real face of Xie Xi.

274
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,060
Thank you, Min Shu.

275
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,340
I'll think of a way with you

276
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,540
about Wen An.

277
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,180
No more quarrel?

278
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,700
I dare not.

279
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,340
My lady.

280
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,020
You...

281
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,060
Why are you so impulsive?

282
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,220
How dare you show up in front of Wen An?

283
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,780
Why did you suddenly ask me to leave the city?

284
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,540
I did it for you.

285
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,900
You know

286
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,340
once your identity is exposed,

287
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,180
you must go back to the Ministry of Education.

288
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,460
How can I let you suffer in that fire again?

289
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,460
Don't worry.

290
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,300
When Wen An is relieved of his doubts,

291
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,460
I'll come back to you as soon as possible.

292
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,340
And I've made up my mind.

293
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,780
I can't just watch.

294
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,500
If you can't help your father with the case,

295
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,820
you can never stand by my side

296
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,860
with a good face.

297
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
I don't want you

298
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,260
and your future son

299
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,140
to suffer.

300
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,500
Now,

301
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,300
I can only marry Wen An

302
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,380
to get the position of the Crown Prince of Duke Yongqing's Mansion.

303
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,420
Only then can I help your father with the case

304
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,340
and protect you better.

305
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,380
In my life,

306
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,580
you're the only one

307
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,740
I love most.

308
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,540
I'm doing this

309
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,620
for you, right?

310
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,780
If you still don't believe me,

311
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,060
I can give you a try.

312
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,780
All right.

313
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,820
I believe you.

314
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,460
The day after tomorrow

315
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,060
is the day King of Rui and King of Yu come to the academy for inspection.

316
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,580
In order to avoid the re-emergence of Lu Ming Shu,

317
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,060
I'll send you to the capital tomorrow morning.

318
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,140
All right.

319
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,460
Stop.

320
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,540
If you dare to come here again, I'll call for help.

321
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,260
You can avoid it once,

322
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,980
but you can't avoid it for 15 days.

323
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,140
As long as I'm in the academy for one day,

324
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,140
I'll see your face

325
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,060
when you're done with the re-emergence.

326
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,100
I'll come back in two days.

327
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,940
Where are you running?

328
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,220
Where are you running?

329
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,340
I'm running.

330
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,420
Where are you running?

331
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,940
My heart hurts.

332
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,660
Come on.

333
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,460
No.

334
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,340
Don't hurt yourself.

335
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,540
No.

336
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,460
No.

337
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,100
I...

338
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,460
I can't go back there.

339
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,460
I won't.

340
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,060
I won't.

341
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,860
I won't.

342
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,980
I won't.

343
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,100
Your Highness, Your Highness,

344
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,140
Your Highness, Your Highness,

345
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,980
the Noble Consort is waiting for you.

346
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,100
Okay.

347
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,180
Here, Your Highness.

348
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,780
I'm relieved to see you two are so kind.

349
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,460
His Majesty is kind and considerate.

350
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,780
It's my fortune to be his husband.

351
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,220
I'll be with him in this life

352
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,300
and advance together.

353
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,660
Shu Jun,

354
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,020
why did you change his position

355
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,660
to the Yings?

356
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,860
Those are slightly different.

357
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,700
I heard that

358
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,580
His Majesty treats valehÃ±a days in humble clothes.

359
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,700
By losing his level of Daddy feeling,

360
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,020
not a single Yings,

361
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,020
will be at ease to deal with him.

362
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,140
Sure enough.

363
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,640
Thank you for your hurricane!(Xie Fang code name moon segway overseas?)

364
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,320
And I thought

365
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,740
she came all the way in her aura.

366
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,740
In the palace county,

367
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,520
I requested for the imperial concubine resä¹

368
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,920
on the biodivecure.

369
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,480
And you only kept coloured silver magnet

370
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,700
for black magic.

371
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,480
Those WHAT?

372
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,940
The same dragon,

373
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,740
lady Zorui.

374
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,240
Leng Quite.

375
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,580
The nineteenth line.

376
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,100
Look on this side?

377
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,140
Your Majesty.

378
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,740
Your Majesty.

379
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,860
There is a epidemic at noon.

380
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,380
Please go to the capital right now.

381
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,900
I see.

382
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,020
Let's go.

383
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,780
Zhang Sao of Huiming House

384
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,260
has been able to get along with her husband

385
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,700
with the help of her mistress.

386
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,860
She has opened a silk shop in Jinzhou.

387
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,460
Her husband heard that our family's name

388
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,940
and he dared not to bully her anymore.

389
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,660
She has been able to help Zhang Sao

390
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,220
get a husband who has been married for a long time.

391
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,900
It's a wish.

392
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,020
Ms. Yin.

393
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,940
A girl is coming to see you.

394
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,260
Please come in.

395
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,780
Greetings, Ms. Yin.

396
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,500
Get up.

397
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,020
Since you are in the Flower Pavilion,

398
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,060
you are all sisters.

399
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,820
What's the matter with you

400
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,220
coming to see me today?

401
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,780
I was born in a poor family.

402
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,900
My father died today.

403
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,020
If it weren't for the help of the Flower Pavilion,

404
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,580
I would have been in a hurry

405
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,780
to sell my body and funeral.

406
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,340
So I came here today

407
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,500
to thank the Flower Pavilion

408
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,980
for the help of my daughter.

409
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,620
Get up.

410
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,420
We founded the Flower Pavilion

411
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,380
to help women get rid of the troubles.

412
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,860
It's our duty.

413
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,820
We don't need to thank you.

414
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,860
But the deceased has passed away.

415
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,860
I hope you can cheer up

416
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,700
and have a good time

417
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,260
so that you can tell your father.

418
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,980
Thank you, Ms. Yin.

419
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,980
I will remember it.

420
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,860
I have no food.

421
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,580
My father loved to cultivate flowers and wood.

422
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,380
I have been training these flowers.

423
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,620
Now I give them to you

424
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,060
for your good.

425
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,420
Give them to me.

426
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,780
Thank you.

427
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,300
Please read it.

428
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,340
What are you doing?

429
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,580
Roll it.

430
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,540
and gave her some flowers.

431
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:23,900
Here.

432
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,340
You should be thankful for the jewelry.

433
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,900
I've asked around.

434
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,860
The Flower Pavilion

435
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,460
not only sells jewelry,

436
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,740
but also a women's club.

437
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,700
I've heard of

438
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,060
a women's club.

439
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,820
But the room is well-kept

440
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,860
and not well-kept.

441
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,260
You're right.

442
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:45,860
By the way,

443
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,460
the day before,

444
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,020
when Princess Heng Yang passed away,

445
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,300
Her Highness ordered people to go to the funeral.

446
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,940
I see.

447
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,380
And

448
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,740
the monthly salary of the servants

449
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,740
in the mansion this month...

450
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,340
Her Highness has given us the salary.

451
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,140
By the way,

452
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,020
the clothes you wear in the Songlin Academy

453
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,100
has been prepared by Her Highness.

454
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,620
She's really considerate

455
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,380
of the affairs of the mansion.

456
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,500
There's nothing wrong with the affairs in the mansion.

457
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,820
I'm just a gardener.

458
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,020
You don't have to help me.

459
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,060
Prince Yu and Prince Rui came to check on her.

460
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,740
It's no small matter to the Academy.

461
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,740
Thank you.

462
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,620
I didn't know such a big thing

463
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,540
would happen in the Academy.

464
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,540
It's nothing.

465
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,260
I can see Prince Yu and Prince Rui

466
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,220
tomorrow.

467
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,220
I'm looking forward to it.

468
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,740
Especially Prince Yu.

469
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,340
I heard that when he was born,

470
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,740
he was surrounded by clouds

471
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,140
and was called Xiang Rui by His Majesty.

472
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,140
I guess he must be

473
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,540
of extraordinary status.

474
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,940
Prince Yu has a deep foundation in the court.

475
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,380
He's a good man.

476
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,580
He has a deep foundation in the court.

477
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,260
He may be promoted to the throne.

478
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,300
But because of the war between the two sides,

479
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,620
Prince Rui was controversial in the court.

480
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,580
But there were many voices in private

481
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,060
saying that he was more like the emperor.

482
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,940
Now they are in the court like water and fire.

483
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,140
The parties are fighting.

484
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,940
They have nothing to be afraid of.

485
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,020
So tomorrow,

486
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,020
you don't have to just look at people.

487
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,340
You have to be careful.

488
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,780
I know.

489
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,540
I promise

490
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,180
I'll be careful.

491
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,380
I won't let them get away with it.

492
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,780
Let's go.

493
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,660
A man should learn to be wise

494
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,540
and not be afraid of the world.

495
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,820
Good poem.

496
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,380
You wrote it?

497
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,540
Yes, Prince.

498
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Prince asked me to do it.

499
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,660
I didn't dare to be rude.

500
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,380
I spent three days in the room

501
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,580
before I wrote it.

502
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,220
You're smart.

503
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,940
Tomorrow,

504
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,860
I'll write this poem

505
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,900
in front of Prince Yu and Prince Rui.

506
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
If you like it,

507
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,380
you'll definitely get your reward.

508
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,540
I dare not, Prince.

509
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,660
Don't worry, Prince.

510
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,780
I think we've done it.

511
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,980
Why should you worry?

512
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,140
It's just a woman

513
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,660
who fell off the cliff with a carriage.

514
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,980
It has nothing to do with me.

515
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,420
Didn't expect that zaman

516
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,180
wrote such a good poem

517
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,260
like you.

518
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,340
Xie Lang.

519
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,380
I can't see you soon,

520
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,740
but I felt relieved that you were there.

521
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,380
Many people

522
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,540
asks me not to say anything,

523
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,300
but I am COL,

524
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,460
and I...

525
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,980
want to tell you

526
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,300
beads of luck and fortune

527
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,180
and really wanna follow you.

528
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,540
As long as I don't see this,

529
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,720
I will still love you ground.

530
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,360
I'm sorry.

531
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,720
Calm down.

532
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,800
Su Tangli,

533
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,120
you didn't obey me.

534
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,080
It's because of Xie Xi.

535
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,920
He...

536
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,200
He found me before.

537
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Xie Xi,

538
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,960
how dare you hide yourself from the officials and slaves?

539
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,920
You'll be defeated.

540
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,720
Su Tangli,

541
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,040
he looks like a talented man.

542
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,920
You're a cold-blooded man.

543
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,400
You can only get back together with Wen An.

544
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,800
You'd better follow me instead.

545
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,720
Shut up!

546
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,560
How dare you hit me?

547
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,720
What are you doing?

548
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,800
Stop hitting me!

549
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,000
Stop it!

550
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,840
Stop it!

551
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,440
Stop it!

552
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,880
Stop it!

553
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,360
Stop it, Mr. Su!

554
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,400
Stop it!

555
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,440
Mr. Su!

556
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,200
Now the students of this academy

557
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
think they're the disciples of the Duke,

558
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,240
and make this academy a mess.

559
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,640
If you don't control it,

560
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,600
it's not good.

561
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,680
All right.

562
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,400
You're tired today.

563
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,560
They'll make a mistake.

564
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,720
Don't be angry.

565
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,920
You'll be sick.

566
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,400
Madam.

567
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,920
Uncle Ming.

568
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,240
Who are you angry for?

569
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,160
Mr. Xie and Mr. Lu.

570
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I heard that Mr. Lu

571
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,360
insulted Tang Sheng.

572
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,200
Mr. Xie couldn't stand it,

573
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,280
so he wanted to stand up for him.

574
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,360
So he taught Mr. Lu a lesson.

575
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,200
Xie Xie beat Lu Wencai.

576
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,360
If Lu Wencai, the evil ghost,

577
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,600
finds out Su Tangli's identity,

578
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,000
he'll be in trouble.

579
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,880
What about them now?

580
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,360
The chief punishes them

581
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,800
to be in the grounded for three days.

582
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,960
Even tomorrow,

583
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,680
the two princes come to the academy

584
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,040
and forbid them from attending.

585
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,280
I'll go to see the chief first.

586
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,120
Okay.

587
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,960
Go.

588
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,360
King Yi and King Rui are here.

589
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,240
The

590
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,680
Xu Yan, the leader of the Imperial College,

591
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,240
is here to welcome

592
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,360
Prince Yu, King of Rui, and Minister of Education.

593
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,280
I am here to welcome Prince Yu, King of Rui, and Minister of Education.

594
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,400
Please rise, Minister of Education.

595
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,360
You have been doing well for years.

596
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,040
I admire you

597
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,160
for your courage.

598
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,400
Prince Yu, you flatter me.

599
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,240
I don't deserve it.

600
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,400
I am flattered.

601
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,480
You deserve it.

602
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,960
Prince Yu, King of Rui,

603
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,400
and Minister of Education, please rise.

604
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,200
Recently, I have ordered many students

605
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:18,700
to hand in their own

606
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,660
This is nowæ··ed into case for treason.

607
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,300
Everyone!

608
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:23,780
Do this order!

609
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,740
The capital below does not accept

610
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,100
a dissolute voice as record.

611
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,060
Open your eyes!

612
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,060
Go to box and pick someone to send to Qing.

613
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,220
The palace is the capital of N suspe luodong.

614
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,960
That's true.

615
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,400
After 50 years,

616
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,700
you have brought happiness to those,

617
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,920
let's chat for another 300 days.

618
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,440
Okay.

619
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,060
Good.

620
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,380
The man in the Shunchang Mansion, Zhou Sheng.

621
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,020
This Song Qingzhao

622
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,820
is indeed the most talented man in the capital.

623
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,700
The article is really well written.

624
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,700
King Rui, you're too kind.

625
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,820
It's a great honor

626
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
for the Academy to teach you.

627
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,900
This Song Juren

628
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,140
is indeed eloquent and fluent.

629
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,660
But he's still young.

630
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,180
The article

631
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,260
is full of young people's stories.

632
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,980
Perhaps he's not a good man.

633
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,740
King Yu is right.

634
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,220
But Song Juren is eloquent

635
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,500
and fluent.

636
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,660
He's a great talent.

637
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,180
What about King Rui?

638
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,060
What do you think of his article?

639
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,820
Not as competent.

640
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,500
He wrote

641
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,820
namely

642
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,940
but it was written

643
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:21,980
frank.

644
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,080
It's obvious

645
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:24,860
that he's kellured.

646
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,820
In theggable theory,

647
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,220
he is better than Song Juren

648
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,940
while Luenerh is more mature.

649
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,540
But in his Master's manner and physics,

650
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,620
he's dainty and modest.

651
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,580
A Glory to his Top friend

652
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,940
Who can see it?

653
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,660
The poem of Pingpin

654
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,460
should be discussed in the old times.

655
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,620
Why do you talk about the origin of the poem?

656
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,380
Has the poem of Wen Hao

657
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,380
been born in the Guizhou?

658
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,420
I was talking about the poem of the old times.

659
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,260
How could King of Rui protect Lu Juren?

660
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,180
I don't know why King of Rui

661
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,540
planned the spring tour in advance

662
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,140
and secretly took the talents.

663
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:11,980
King of Rui

664
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,220
My lords,

665
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,740
don't argue.

666
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,100
I come today

667
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,340
to examine theÙÙ- atmosphere

668
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,380
of your Council of Lehend aprove.

669
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,380
Let's get back to ouræ­£é¡

670
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,980
and ride our power in the color of talents.

671
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,380
You're right.

672
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,220
icity.

673
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,500
Where is Lu Chang?

674
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:55,040
áº·t ê¹­

675
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,360
Ð³Ña

676
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,040
Eunuch Lu.

677
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,140
Come.

678
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,020
Lu Chang.

679
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,260
How old are you?

680
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,860
I'm over a year old.

681
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,580
I'm twenty-two years old.

682
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,460
Who else is in your family?

683
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,620
My father is dead.

684
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,060
I have a mother

685
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,300
and a sister.

686
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,820
You have a sister?

687
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,660
Lu Chang.

688
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,940
My sister is eighteen years old.

689
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,180
Mr. Lu.

690
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,420
Why are you so curious

691
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,660
about this young man's family?

692
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,820
Your Highness,

693
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,420
I just saw his strategy

694
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,180
and I know Ming Sheng well.

695
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,180
So I'm curious about his experience.

696
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,900
Nothing else.

697
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,180
You are all the backbone of the country.

698
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,420
The Spring Festival is coming.

699
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,700
I look forward to your performance.

700
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

701
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,820
Your Highness.

702
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,820
Your Highness, are you in pain?

703
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:44,980
I'm in pain.

704
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,260
Guards.

705
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,340
Take His Highness to the room.

706
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:50,940
Yes.

707
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,540
Your Highness, please.

708
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,980
jar

709
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,620
Your Highness,

710
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,100
I'm here to deliver your cloth for you.

711
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,140
Come on in.

712
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,180
The King of the Palace

713
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,180
Episode 16

714
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,180
Your Majesty,

715
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,180
the front is Huan Tao Hall.

716
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,180
I heard that this hall

717
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,180
was the place where the great master Guo Hui Nan

718
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
was studying in the capital 30 years ago.

719
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,180
There are many treasures of this great master.

720
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Your Majesty, you are so knowledgeable.

721
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Huan Tao Hall is the place

722
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,180
where the master is confined.

723
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,180
Why is the door and window closed?

724
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
It's strange.

725
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,180
The door has been opened.

726
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,180
Ming Shu, go and check.

727
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,180
Open the door and window.

728
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,180
Yes.

729
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,180
Oh, no.

730
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,180
What's wrong?

731
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,180
Someone died.

732
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,180
How could this happen in the library?

733
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,180
Are you okay?

734
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,180
I'm fine.

735
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,020
I'm not afraid of the

736
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,180
Luo Wen Cai.

737
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,180
Isn't he confined in the room?

738
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,180
How could he die here?

739
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,180
Your Majesty,

740
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,180
the minister said

741
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,180
that this place is a murder case.

742
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,180
It's not suitable to stay here.

743
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,180
Please wait in the Mingli Hall.

744
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
You're right.

745
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,180
Your Majesty,

746
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,180
how about we...

747
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,180
Song Ling Academy is located in the lower part of Liangzhou.

748
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,180
This place is a murder case.

749
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,180
You need to report to Liangzhou.

750
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,180
Yes.

751
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,180
Your Highness,

752
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,180
what do you think, Mr. Lu?

753
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,180
Report to Liangzhou

754
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,180
and ask Liangzhou to investigate this case.

755
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,180
I'll keep an eye on it.

756
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,180
All students in the academy

757
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,180
must leave here.

758
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,180
The dust is gone.

759
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,180
The wind is blowing.

760
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,180
I wish we could meet again.

761
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,180
Let's stay together.

762
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:55,180
Let's travel around the world.

763
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,180
Let's wait for the old days.

764
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:02,180
Let's drink and celebrate.

765
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:07,180
I look back at the old days.

766
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,180
If the scenery is clear,

767
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,180
can I return to the old days?

768
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,180
A kind of love is left alone.

769
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,180
I'm lost in my heart.

770
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,180
The long night is coming.

771
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:31,180
I can't help missing you.

772
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,180
I want to travel around the world.

773
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,180
I want to return to the old days.

774
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,180
I want to protect you.

775
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,180
I want to protect you.

776
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,180
I want to forget you.

777
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:55,180
I want to dream about you.

778
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,180
I want to protect you.

779
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,180
I want to protect you.
