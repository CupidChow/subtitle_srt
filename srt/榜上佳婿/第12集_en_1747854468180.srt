Episode 18

58
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Princess.

59
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Princess.

60
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
PrinceYi?

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's done.

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Redeem your majesty.

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you, princess.

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Tell prince Y 모양

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that I just was thinking what should we do

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
for prince dying.

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Standard closure?

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,560
ff

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,640
Yes.

70
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,160
Did he have a trip last night?

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,640
No need.

72
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,920
He just needs to play the role well.

73
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,760
That's enough.

74
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,320
You really don't plan to

75
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,320
make peace with King of Rui?

76
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,920
We've been through a lot in the past.

77
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,040
We should be grateful for each other.

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Wen Sheng.

79
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,680
Isn't he Mr. Wen Sheng?

80
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,040
No wonder he hasn't been able to find you these days.

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,520
So he's hiding in the Songlin Academy.

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,160
It hurts.

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,240
You're wrong.

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,000
I've been studying in the Songlin Academy.

85
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,800
But I saw you here.

86
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,280
It seems that your father has made a lot of contributions.

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,080
It hurts.

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,840
You...

89
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,680
Lu Chang.

90
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,840
You sneaked into my family.

91
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,800
You're not fit to be my benefactor.

92
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,080
Come on. Go to the court with me.

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,840
Fine.

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,280
You're my bodyguard.

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,680
There will be a big stir in the court.

96
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,760
When you do something wrong,

97
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,400
the street will be spread.

98
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,640
I'm afraid the Songlin Academy won't keep you.

99
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,920
Have you decided how to explain to your father?

100
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,880
You're so evil.

101
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,320
Mr. Lu.

102
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,600
I advise you not to let your father down.

103
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,520
You should be patient and learn from him.

104
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,360
And

105
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,520
next time you see me,

106
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,680
you should be rude.

107
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,760
I don't mind asking you about the rules.

108
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,520
Lu Chang.

109
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,920
Wait and see.

110
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,920
Get out.

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,520
Congratulations on the new marriage of Princess Rui.

112
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,960
Wish you and Prince Rui

113
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,480
a happy marriage.

114
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,440
Long live the princess.

115
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,120
What's that, Mr. Lu?

116
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,240
If you keep talking like that, I'll quit.

117
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,760
No.

118
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,040
Sister.

119
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,800
Secretary.

120
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
I have something for you.

121
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,440
What's that?

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,200
This is the wedding bracelet I designed.

123
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,920
It's your wedding gift.

124
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,800
Look.

125
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
It's just a wedding necklace.

126
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,520
I can't believe you're so considerate.

127
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,080
But it's so beautiful.

128
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,640
Mr. Lu.

129
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,880
You're so good.

130
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes, I'm good.

131
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,280
But at most,

132
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
you're just a clever girl.

133
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,440
But you can't tell

134
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,120
you're a brave and a narrow-minded girl.

135
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,080
Is she really as good as you said?

136
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,440
This lady is...

137
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,000
Min Shu.

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,040
Let me introduce her to you.

139
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,080
This is my best friend,

140
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,040
Princess Wen An of the Zhanghuai Commandery Prince.

141
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,840
She's Mr. Song's wife.

142
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,840
I'm Lu Min Shu.

143
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,040
Nice to meet you, Princess Wen An.

144
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,920
Please don't stand on ceremony.

145
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,880
Actually, I have something

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,760
to ask you for.

147
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Yin family's affairs.

148
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,400
You handled it very well.

149
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,200
I appreciate your advice.

150
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,200
You won't just let it go.

151
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,160
You'll follow the flow.

152
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,040
Thank you for your compliment.

153
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,840
If you need any help,

154
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
just tell me.

155
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
I want you to help me check someone.

156
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
Check someone?

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
I'm not sure.

158
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm not sure.

159
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
I'm not sure.

160
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I'm not sure.

161
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm not sure.

162
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
I'm not sure.

163
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
I'm not sure.

164
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
I'm not sure.

165
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
I'm not sure.

166
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
I'm not sure.

167
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
I'm not sure.

168
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
I'm sorry.

169
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Your Highness,

170
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
you grew up in the capital.

171
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Your family is a noble family.

172
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,640
Your family is

173
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
more noble than me

174
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
in terms of connections and skills.

175
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,520
I just came to the capital.

176
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,520
I don't think I can check someone.

177
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,320
I asked you to check someone.

178
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,520
Of course, there's a reason.

179
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,400
You asked for help

180
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
and you're so mean.

181
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Min Shu,

182
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
she's just a short temper.

183
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Don't mind her.

184
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,920
She's actually

185
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,760
bothered by her family affairs.

186
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Exactly.

187
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,200
Your Highness and the son of the eldest son of the Xie family,

188
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,360
Xie Xi,

189
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
got married three years ago.

190
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,320
As soon as he entered the House of Marquis of Yongqing,

191
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,880
Xie Xi is gentle,

192
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
with a high level of talent,

193
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,480
and she's also very dignified.

194
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,200
She's a perfect match for the husband.

195
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,040
I hear it's not a problem.

196
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,360
They're all saying it's not a problem.

197
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,800
But I just think it's a problem.

198
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,440
Why do you think so?

199
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,000
But Xie Xi always listens to you.

200
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You had to say he treats you better.

201
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Everyone told you not to make a fuss.

202
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
I'm afraid I'll misunderstand him.

203
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,600
I agreed to investigate him in secret.

204
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,280
But I didn't get anything

205
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,960
from Xie Xi's misdeed.

206
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,280
I'm suspecting you now.

207
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,400
Are you making a big deal out of it?

208
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,880
Why don't you believe me?

209
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,720
I don't not believe you.

210
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,360
But why do you suspect him?

211
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,360
I can't tell.

212
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,080
Why?

213
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,440
It's just a feeling.

214
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,000
Do you understand?

215
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,360
Don't worry, my lady.

216
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,880
Think about it.

217
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,320
Why do you have this feeling?

218
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,440
Think about it.

219
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,960
Why do you have this feeling?

220
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,520
Xie Xi

221
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,880
is always tolerant to me.

222
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,160
Even if I'm mean,

223
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,400
he's also tolerant to me.

224
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,080
That's why my parents

225
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,520
are willing to marry me.

226
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,680
But since last year,

227
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,760
I can't say anything strange.

228
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,280
Although

229
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,080
he's still modest and polite to me,

230
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,480
his manners and manners

231
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,280
are just a line.

232
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,320
You suspect he has someone else in his heart?

233
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,640
I, Wen An, am a man of great talent.

234
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,960
But I must have a noble personality

235
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,240
and a loyal and loyal person.

236
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,440
Xie Xi knows

237
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,720
what I want from him.

238
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,520
But if he changes his mind

239
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,280
and pretends to be with me,

240
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,560
he must have another intention.

241
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,680
I, Wen An,

242
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,960
will never marry a hypocrite

243
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,080
who has a bad intention.

244
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,080
Your Grace,

245
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,080
I understand your worry.

246
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,280
I'm willing to help you.

247
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,240
Really?

248
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
I hate those

249
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,960
who are just being playful and sincere.

250
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,320
And you're also

251
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,000
responsible for your own happiness.

252
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,400
You'll find out before the wedding

253
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,480
and only find out after the wedding.

254
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,120
Right?

255
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,880
I support you.

256
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,120
You're really a narrow-minded and polite person.

257
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,080
I'm a good teacher.

258
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,600
No matter what you find out,

259
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,880
I'll thank you.

260
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,440
You're welcome.

261
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,160
By the way,

262
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,080
Xie Xi will attend

263
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,440
the wine party before the wedding.

264
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,320
I'll arrange for him to meet you.

265
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,720
I was going to attend the party.

266
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,720
I'll listen to you.

267
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,600
The party is very lively.

268
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,280
All the ladies in the capital

269
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,640
will go to see their husbands.

270
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,320
If you want to go,

271
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,920
you have to dress up.

272
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
You want to help Mr. Lu

273
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,400
at the wine party?

274
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,080
You're talented.

275
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,120
If you can show your talent at the party,

276
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,520
you'll be famous in the capital.

277
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,480
Besides, today's daughter, Yun Ji,

278
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,560
if I can help you,

279
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,800
I'll be able to get along with Ming Shu.

280
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,120
Awesome.

281
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,200
In my opinion,

282
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,280
she's just a first-time beauty to Mr. Song.

283
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,440
She hasn't reached the point she likes.

284
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,480
You're pushing her.

285
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,240
You can't let her like others.

286
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,320
Anyway,

287
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,560
as long as she's happy,

288
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,480
happiness is enough.

289
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm not afraid of you.

290
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,720
That's all.

291
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,640
I still have work to do.

292
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,720
Now it's up to you.

293
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,080
Mr. Lu.

294
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,760
Why don't you come in?

295
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,440
I'll wait for Ming Shu.

296
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,480
I'll come with you.

297
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,680
Mr. Lu,

298
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,480
I know you're just a fake at the wine party.

299
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,880
But you're not the one who's affected.

300
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,240
If you can win the title,

301
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,520
you'll be famous.

302
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,440
You're the most respected girl in the capital.

303
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,720
You're the best.

304
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,600
In that case,

305
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,920
I'll do my best

306
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,360
to win the title.

307
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,320
I just want to see it with you.

308
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,760
I can accompany you.

309
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,600
It's a rare chance.

310
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,680
I'll be a broad-minded person

311
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,880
and plan for the future.

312
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,320
You're really

313
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,480
a good-for-nothing.

314
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,200
Brother.

315
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,880
Qingcheng.

316
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,800
Your eyes are like frost,

317
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,000
alone in the mist.

318
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,680
My heart is hidden,

319
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,960
waiting for the rain to stop.

320
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,680
There's no difference in the world.

321
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,800
I'm glad to have you by my side.

322
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,680
Chang.

323
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,840
You're by my side,

324
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,000
like the bright light.

325
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,360
Brother.

326
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,800
sembling emerald

327
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,480
you're carrying me.

328
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,160
Excellent pissing.

329
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,280
Come.

330
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,680
Someone whose face looks like your bands.

331
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,440
Let's shake hands and celebrate.

332
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,800
Today,

333
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,520
Mingyu's Да тобo grand festival is ecstatic.

334
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,440
Thanks, brother.

335
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,240
What's up, brother?

336
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,160
I asked him to make more friends at the party.

337
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,760
But he didn't do anything.

338
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,080
He just wanted to take care of you.

339
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,800
Xiu, just go to your work.

340
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
I'll follow Qingzhao.

341
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,720
It's okay.

342
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,320
You...

343
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,200
Did you embroider all the clothes on Qingzhu?

344
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,200
Let's go in.

345
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,920
Let's go in.

346
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,400
The wine party

347
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,920
is the beginning of the new wine of the wine family in Meifeng.

348
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,200
They invite customers.

349
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,480
The participants or the participants

350
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,520
will draw the winner through the winning or losing.

351
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,000
The winner will choose a bottle of wine

352
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,920
to give a hint first.

353
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,320
Then the others

354
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,720
will give hints.

355
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,720
The wine hinted

356
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,440
will be given before the exam.

357
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,440
The winner will get the wine

358
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,040
after the exam.

359
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,800
The corresponding wine family

360
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,160
will follow the name.

361
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,760
So the one who has the most chance to win the prize

362
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,120
will be chased by the wine family.

363
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,000
The people chase the name and the bamboo is in the way.

364
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,800
So I advised Brother Lu

365
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
not to give up the chance to show his talent.

366
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,240
I'm shy and ignorant.

367
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,440
I don't care about those names.

368
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,520
But sometimes it's more convenient

369
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,120
to get some names in the capital.

370
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,920
This is Sister Song.

371
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
This year's Zhao Yunlang must be him.

372
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,320
Jun Lang's work.

373
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,880
Qingzhao.

374
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,760
Everyone is looking at you.

375
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,840
But I don't care about them.

376
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,440
I'll go to the front.

377
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,200
Brother.

378
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,920
Can you try our wine?

379
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,200
Where?

380
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,200
There.

381
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,760
Sit down.

382
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,720
May I try your wine?

383
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,440
Sure.

384
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,040
Please.

385
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,480
Thank you.

386
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,040
The wine is full and the wine is thick.

387
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
It's a good wine.

388
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,040
Do you have a name for it?

389
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,240
Your Highness is so powerful.

390
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,600
No one asks for a name.

391
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,800
This wine is brewed by the pine flowers.

392
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,520
No name.

393
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,840
The unknown drink the unknown wine.

394
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,960
It's also very hard to drink.

395
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,000
Young people are not heavy.

396
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
It's hard to drink.

397
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,920
Young Master.

398
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,280
Young Master.

399
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,200
Try my wine.

400
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,040
Thank you.

401
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,240
Thank you.

402
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,360
Thank you.

403
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,000
Young Master.

404
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,440
This young master is...

405
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,880
He's the son of the Xie family of the Yongqing duke, Xie Xi.

406
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,560
He's also a popular person who won the exam this year.

407
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,440
But he's already married Wen An.

408
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,320
I'm afraid he won't have a chance to marry other young ladies.

409
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,160
I heard the book king mention it.

410
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
In your opinion,

411
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
is he worthy of the princess?

412
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,680
He's also a popular person who won the exam this year.

413
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,200
He's a good student.

414
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,200
He's also a great man among his classmates.

415
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,360
The mountain chief and his father are all very important to him.

416
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,480
They are both good people.

417
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,400
Isn't this Mr. Song?

418
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,200
Mr. Song.

419
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,840
Mr. Song.

420
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,560
Mr. Song.

421
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,120
Try my wine.

422
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,600
No.

423
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,800
My wine is very good.

424
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,360
Thank you.

425
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,960
Thank you.

426
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,720
My wine is very good.

427
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,440
Thank you, everyone.

428
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,280
Try my wine.

429
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,680
Mr. Song.

430
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,320
Try it.

431
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Mr. Xie.

432
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,560
Try my wine.

433
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,760
My wine is better.

434
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,600
Mr. Xie.

435
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Try my wine.

436
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,120
This wine is very good.

437
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,720
I'll try it.

438
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,520
My wine is good, too.

439
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,120
How about this?

440
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,640
Xiong.

441
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,080
Do you miss Xiong?

442
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,960
Those people only know how to talk and act.

443
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,320
They are never reserved.

444
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,840
I'm afraid Xiong will be sad.

445
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,720
Xiong and Master Yubo

446
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,880
drink and chat.

447
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,880
They are very happy.

448
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,760
They don't need to be sad.

449
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,520
Very good.

450
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,320
Try my wine.

451
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,120
Try it.

452
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,880
It's good.

453
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,720
Give me another one.

454
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,120
It's started, Xiong.

455
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,120
The time is up.

456
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,160
I announce

457
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,360
the wine tasting party

458
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,480
begins.

459
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,800
Everyone.

460
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,200
This year's wine tasting party

461
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,680
is held by Jinzun House.

462
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,760
It's my honor to give it to someone.

463
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,320
All the excellent students from all over the world

464
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,640
are invited to come.

465
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,960
It will make Jinzun House

466
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,360
more prosperous.

467
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,320
Good.

468
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,280
Everyone, please look.

469
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,760
This Jinzun House

470
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,040
is made of heavy gold.

471
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,440
The winner of the competition

472
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,480
will be rewarded with a gold medal.

473
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,440
The way of Jinzun House is very good.

474
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,480
The design is very good.

475
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,480
If we win,

476
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,080
we won't have to translate it.

477
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,200
Then,

478
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,280
according to the old rules,

479
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,400
the first line

480
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,960
will be written by me, the host.

481
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,200
Students, please listen to the first line.

482
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,880
There are people in the banquet.

483
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,920
There are no people in the banquet.

484
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,560
The world is scattered.

485
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,200
Please look.

486
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,440
What a world is scattered.

487
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,880
Please look.

488
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,200
You are right.

489
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,880
You are wrong.

490
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,840
It's true.

491
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,640
It's true.

492
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,200
The wine is pure and the wine is fragrant.

493
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,920
The cup is pure and fragrant.

494
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,320
I can smell it.

495
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,840
You are indeed Mr. Xie.

496
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,840
There are still some people in the world.

497
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Mr. Xie is not a bad person.

498
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,400
Mr. Xie, please give us the question.

499
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,120
The wine can be used to quench the grudge.

500
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,760
It can be used to make a good drink.

501
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,400
It can be used to make a good drink.

502
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
These people are really...

503
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,800
The good building is like a painting.

504
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,320
Yilan is also a painter.

505
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,400
Good.

506
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,680
Mr. Song,

507
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,720
you are indeed talented.

508
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,480
Then, let's have Mr. Song give us the question.

509
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,080
Today, we have a good drink.

510
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,760
We will drink to our heart's content.

511
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,480
Please listen to the order.

512
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,160
The fox hides the trap.

513
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,960
The fox hides the trap.

514
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,160
The fox hides the trap.

515
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,960
Good.

516
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,160
Good.

517
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,360
Good. Good.

518
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:05,960
Good.

519
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,160
I have long heard that Mr. Song is talented.

520
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,360
I have only seen him today.

521
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,800
He is indeed famous.

522
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,960
His family background and talent are all good.

523
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,080
This time,

524
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,720
it seems that Mr. Song will be a high-ranking man.

525
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,360
Yes.

526
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:17,880
Yes.

527
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,360
Yes.

528
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,880
Yes.

529
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,520
Yes.

530
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,880
Yes.

531
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,480
Yes.

532
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,080
Yes.

533
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,680
Yes.

534
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,480
Yes.

535
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,080
Yes.

536
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,880
Yes.

537
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,680
Yes.

538
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,480
I wonder if there are people

539
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
who can match Mr. Song's team.

540
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,280
Xiu,

541
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,680
why don't you come on stage?

542
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,880
Are you afraid of losing to Mr. Song?

543
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
How could it be?

544
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,080
It's just a fake name.

545
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,680
Even if it's a fake name,

546
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,080
I'm willing to fight for it.

547
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
In this room, I am the son of the Shi family.

548
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,480
I want to let Xiu come out

549
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,280
to cheer up the students of the Han family.

550
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,280
Even if I can't win him,

551
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,080
I have won the majority of the people here.

552
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,280
You are right.

553
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,080
Then I will represent the Han family

554
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,080
to fight with the young master of the Shi family.

555
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,480
I'm willing to.

556
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,280
Brother Lu, please.

557
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Who is this person?

558
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,080
Is he Song?

559
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,080
Mr. Lu,

560
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,280
you are so beautiful

561
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,480
as you were before.

562
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,280
I'm afraid you are not good enough

563
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,080
to compete with Mr. Song.

564
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,680
If you can't win him,

565
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,880
you are a shame.

566
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,080
Everyone,

567
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:39,900
this is Lu Chang, the

568
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
good-looking man.

569
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Brother, you are right.

570
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,880
Yes.

571
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,080
Mr. Lu is busy with his work.

572
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,280
He will come later.

573
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,880
Mr. Lu, please continue.

574
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
The little window

575
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,880
is a sin to be in the middle of the song.

576
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,680
The breeze is light and the moon is bright.

577
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,280
A year is good and the military is weak.

578
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,080
The ancient name of the ancient incense is ten years old.

579
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,680
The light is weak and the jade is not good.

580
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,880
The jade is not good and the jade is not good.

581
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,480
The ancient name of the ancient incense is ten years old.

582
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,880
The wind is strong and the moon is bright.

583
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
The wind is strong and the moon is bright.

584
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,680
Good.

585
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,480
Mr. Lu, please continue.

586
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,080
Brother Song,

587
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,680
listen carefully.

588
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,680
The wine party is the best.

589
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,080
The wine party is the best.

590
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
The wine party is the best.

591
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,480
The wine party is the best.

592
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,880
The upper-ranking officials came to the city,

593
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,280
but they were not careful.

594
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,880
They found that the money was not good.

595
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,280
Yes.

596
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,880
The money is not good.

597
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,080
Everyone,

598
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,480
is there anyone

599
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,480
who can match Mr. Lu?

600
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
If not,

601
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,280
then it's Mr. Lu who won the title.

602
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,680
Yes.

603
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,080
Mr. Song is not good enough.

604
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,080
Even Mr. Song is not good enough.

605
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,880
Brother Lu's promotion

606
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,880
is very good.

607
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,880
He is confident and hard-hearted.

608
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,280
I'm stupid and hard to deal with.

609
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,280
Good.

610
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Good.

611
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,680
The wine is the best.

612
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,880
I announce that

613
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,880
Mr. Lu will win the title

614
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,880
of the wine party today.

615
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Good.

616
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,880
Good.

617
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Yes.

618
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,280
Yes.

619
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,080
Yes.

620
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,280
Mr. Lu, please.

621
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,680
Everyone,

622
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,080
the gold medal is yours.

623
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,880
Mr. Lu, congratulations.

624
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,480
Thank you.

625
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
I wonder which family

626
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,280
Mr. Lu likes.

627
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,280
Please give us the hint.

628
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,080
I choose that family.

629
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,680
Grandpa, I hope Mr. Lu wins.

630
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,480
Mr. Lu wins.

631
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
Good.

632
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,680
The pine flowers are in the wine.

633
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,480
The spring water is fried tea.

634
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,480
The time of waking up is bright.

635
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,880
The time of drunk is clear.

636
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,680
Good poem.

637
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,880
Good poem.

638
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,680
Good.

639
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Good.

640
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,280
Mr. Lu,

641
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,280
may I ask

642
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,680
the name of the wine?

643
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Pine flowers are drunk.

644
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,680
Good.

645
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,480
Good.

646
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,880
Mr. Lu,

647
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,680
your wine

648
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
is all paid by our restaurant.

649
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
Later, the shopkeeper will pay you.

650
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,480
If Mr. Lu is the top of the class,

651
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,880
your wine will be the best.

652
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,880
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

653
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,480
Thank you, Mr. Song.

654
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,080
You won the title today.

655
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,680
You can inspire many students

656
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,280
to move forward.

657
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,480
I know the people

658
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,480
and the power of the people.

659
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,280
But as Uncle said...

660
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,680
You won the title today.

661
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
Do you regret it?

662
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,280
It's a great pleasure to be in the same boat with you.

663
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
You are talented.

664
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
I'm happy.

665
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,480
Thank you for your concern.

666
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,080
It's a great pleasure to have friends like you.

667
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,280
Uncle,

668
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,880
you don't have to be polite with me.

669
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,080
I didn't expect you to be so talented.

670
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,080
You are a good girl.

671
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
You are talented.

672
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
You are a good girl.

673
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
I hope you can get married.

674
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,680
Yes.

675
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,880
What do you mean?

676
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,080
I don't think I can fall in love with you.

677
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,680
Let's go.

678
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,080
For you.

679
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
Thank you.

680
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,480
Brother Lu, you are on stage today.

681
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,280
You are in the girl circle.

682
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Lady Ningshu,

683
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
please come with me.

684
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,480
Although I didn't win the title today,

685
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,080
I still have a wine to give to my ex-wife.

686
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
This wine is not too strong.

687
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,080
It's the best for the master.

688
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,280
Spring is warm and cold.

689
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,080
It's easy to catch a cold.

690
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,080
Don't catch a cold.

691
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,480
Although Xie Xi is intimate,

692
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,080
he is very polite and graceful.

693
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
You were on stage just now.

694
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,080
You didn't know

695
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,680
what the ladies on stage

696
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,280
looked like to you.

697
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,480
Since we have already made a deal,

698
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,080
no one else will be in my sight.

699
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,480
But

700
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,480
the wine party is very noisy today.

701
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
I'm afraid someone is drunk and

702
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,680
rude to you.

703
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,280
Or I'll send you back early.

704
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,480
My lady,

705
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,080
Xie's classmates are looking for you.

706
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
They said they would let you go downstairs

707
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
to drink and write poems.

708
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,480
Let them say later

709
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
that I will take care of you.

710
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
It's rare to see you.

711
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,680
I have to accompany you.

712
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,280
Don't let them wait.

713
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,280
Go and take care of them.

714
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,680
My carriage is outside.

715
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,880
You can go at any time.

716
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,080
OK.

717
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
I'll be downstairs.

718
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Let me know if you need anything.

719
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,680
Xie Xi is gentle and elegant.

720
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
He is affectionate to you.

721
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,280
He doesn't look like a pervert.

722
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,680
He looks like a perfect and flawless love.

723
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,080
But there is no such thing as perfect.

724
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,880
Either this kind of blind words

725
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,080
is not discovered by the world,

726
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,280
or

727
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,280
this kind of perfection is a false one.

728
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,880
I know what you mean.

729
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,680
I know what you mean.

730
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,480
I know what you mean.

731
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,280
People are both selfish and emotional.

732
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Mr. Xie is too unsympathetic.

733
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,080
His emotions are too rational and pretentious.

734
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
He doesn't look like a real love.

735
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,080
Yes.

736
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,280
That's it.

737
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
He seems to be considerate to me.

738
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,080
In fact,

739
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,880
he is pretentious.

740
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,680
It's like he is a good designer.

741
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,280
I can't tell where there is a problem.

742
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,880
But I do think there is a problem.

743
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,880
It's like I just warmed you up.

744
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,680
There is a fire in our room.

745
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,880
Even if it's cold,

746
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,280
it's not like that.

747
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,280
It's like it seems to be concerned.

748
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,680
In fact, it's a good design.

749
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,280
It's not a bad idea.

750
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,280
Yes.

751
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,480
That's it.

752
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,480
But I've been investigating it for more than half a year.

753
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,280
I...

754
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,480
I didn't find it at all.

755
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,280
It's a big deal for me.

756
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,480
Headmaster.

757
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,880
He is usually in the academy.

758
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
Have you checked the academy?

759
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,680
Academy?

760
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
What can be checked in the academy?

761
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,080
They are all men.

762
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,480
They are all men?

763
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,680
How can I do it?

764
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,480
Uncle.

765
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,080
How much did Mr. Lu drink?

766
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,480
Why is he so drunk?

767
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,880
He was dragged to the toilet.

768
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,080
I think he drank it all.

769
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,680
There is no alcohol left.

770
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
Brother, you're drunk.

771
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,200
Come on.

772
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Let's go back to the academy.

773
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,920
This wine is good.

774
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,400
Where's the letter?

775
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,480
Letter.

776
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,160
You're drunk.

777
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
You still miss the letter?

778
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,080
Let's go home.

779
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,160
The carriage sent by Princess Rui

780
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,000
is here to send the letter.

781
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,000
Come on.

782
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,600
Be careful.

783
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,320
Come on.

784
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,400
Brother Lu.

785
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:08,960
Be careful.

786
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,600
Brother Lu.

787
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,600
Do you like me?

788
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,600
Uncle Ming...

789
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,400
Uncle Ming.

790
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,120
Uncle Ming.

791
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,320
Where's our Uncle Ming?

792
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,680
He's back.

793
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,160
Drink some water.

794
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,440
Come on.

795
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,680
Brother Lu.

796
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,480
Thank you.

797
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,200
Thank you.

798
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,640
Drink some water.

799
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,520
Brother Lu.

800
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,880
Brother Lu.

801
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
Are you feeling unwell?

802
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,440
Mine.

803
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,920
Yours?

804
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,400
Mine.

805
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,920
What's yours?

806
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,160
Mine.

807
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,360
Brother Lu.

808
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,320
Brother Lu.

809
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,480
Brother Lu.

810
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,640
It's mine.

811
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,440
Mine.

812
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,320
Mine.

813
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,680
Brother Lu.

814
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,360
Mine.

815
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,200
My...

816
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,680
Mine.

817
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,760
Who knew

818
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,400
that the whisky lacks no big fun

819
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,240
is this hard to handle?

820
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,600
The more dangerous the place, the safer it is.

821
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,520
The most impossible thing

822
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,480
is that it's not easy to be discovered.

823
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,640
The clue might be in Song Lin Academy.

824
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,240
What do you think?

825
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,320
But

826
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,600
it's hard for me, too.

827
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,720
If I go to the academy,

828
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,320
I'll have to live with my brother again.

829
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,160
I can't do that.

830
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,440
I can't.

831
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,880
I can't.

832
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,000
You think so, too, right?

833
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,400
What?

834
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,360
You...

835
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,440
You want to be the young master's bookworm?

836
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:39,840
But...

837
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,280
But the bookworms are all garbage.

838
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,320
You can't do it.

839
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,600
Well...

840
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,280
It's not hard for me.

841
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,680
I can learn while I do it.

842
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,160
But...

843
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,680
But you're going to the academy.

844
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,280
Does Mr. Lu know that?

845
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,160
I know why you're going to the academy.

846
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,040
But based on my understanding of Xie Xi,

847
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,640
she's not a person who recommends the four immortals.

848
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,680
There's no special performance in the academy.

849
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,280
You'd better give up.

850
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,800
Xie Xi's behavior is too unpredictable.

851
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,640
But there's no bad guy in the world.

852
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,400
I doubt that Xie Xi must have hidden something.

853
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,680
She's been in the academy for a long time.

854
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,200
The flaw must be in the academy.

855
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,160
I must observe her in the academy.

856
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,880
Until I find out.

857
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,480
Don't worry.

858
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,520
I know what you're worried about.

859
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,240
I won't cause you any trouble.

860
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,080
You're not worried about me telling Mr. Lu?

861
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,480
I believe you.

862
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,280
But...

863
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,160
But drink some water.

864
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,400
Okay.

865
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,920
No.

866
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,720
What about me?

867
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,400
I don't think you look well.

868
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,880
Go back and have a rest.

869
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,920
I...

870
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,160
The four immortals are very exquisite.

871
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,760
Mr. Song.

872
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
This is your room?

873
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,120
Take a look.

874
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,960
Uncle Lin.

875
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,920
Are you a girl?

876
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,360
Or is it more convenient to live in the room?

877
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,800
My uncle is outside.

878
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,760
You've helped me a lot.

879
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,280
How can I wrong you again?

880
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,280
I'm happy that you can come here.

881
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,240
Why do I wrong you?

882
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
I've thought about it.

883
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,880
I just arrived.

884
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,320
I need to get familiar with Xie Xi's habit.

885
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,720
It's convenient for me to investigate her.

886
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,280
There are rules in the academy.

887
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,680
Students should be careful.

888
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,120
Let them stay for half an hour.

889
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,360
Eat breakfast at three o'clock.

890
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,160
Start a class at five o'clock in the morning.

891
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,080
Then finish at five o'clock.

892
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,480
The rest of the time is the time for students to do homework

893
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,720
and study freely.

894
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,400
Go back to the room or go to the library.

895
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,200
I can't go to Xie Xi's room.

896
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,120
I can only pay more attention to the classroom and the library.

897
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,560
Don't be too anxious.

898
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,520
You just arrived at the academy.

899
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,680
Get familiar with the environment first.

900
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,720
Let me show you something.

901
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,920
What is it?

902
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,320
Please sit.

903
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,600
What is it?

904
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:55,720
Look.

905
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,240
I'm afraid you'll be bored.

906
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,720
So I found this jewelry sketch from the library.

907
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,080
I want to inspire you to design jewelry.

908
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,280
It's so good.

909
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
This sketch is really valuable.

910
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,840
I'm glad you like it.

911
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,640
Qingzhao.

912
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,600
You're the most gentle and considerate man in the world.

913
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,440
There's something in it

914
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,800
that you've never seen before.

915
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,840
You must be interested.

916
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,680
In...

917
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,600
Please.

918
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,960
focusing my anxieties on the

919
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,280
lonely shadow

920
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,440
for the survivedmemories

921
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,520
are counter alternating with Rainbowр

922
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,020
Give me a startups

923
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,520
Sh sü

924
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,320
Let's go.

925
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,000
Well...

926
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,520
You...

927
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,560
You must go to class.

928
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,000
Well,

929
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,040
don't tell my brother

930
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,240
that I'm trying to fix the bookcase.

931
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,680
Otherwise, he'll be a nag.

932
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,960
I won't tell him what I promised you.

933
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,680
But

934
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,160
I'm afraid I can't keep it from him for long.

935
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,680
But don't worry.

936
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,080
I'll take care of it

937
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,080
even if your brother finds out.

938
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,480
Go.

939
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,160
Mr. Song,

940
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,200
why are you here today?

941
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,760
Where's your uncle?

942
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,440
How can he be lazy?

943
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,200
He's not a good actor.

944
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,280
Let's go to the workshop.

945
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,880
Mr. Song,

946
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,360
Yes.

947
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,880
No need.

948
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,360
Uncle is not feeling well today.
