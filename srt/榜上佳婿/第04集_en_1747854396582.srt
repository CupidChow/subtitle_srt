Episode 18

31
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,140
It's him.

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,140
Mr. Song.

33
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,140
Mrs. Ming Shu.

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,140
Why are you here?

35
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
We need to buy some things.

36
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,140
I want to do some business.

37
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,140
But I don't know what to do.

38
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,140
I just want to walk around and have a look.

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,140
You can do business?

40
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,140
I just arrived in the capital.

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,140
I need to read the books.

42
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,140
My brother said

43
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,140
he wouldn't let me worry about my family.

44
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,140
But I don't want to do business.

45
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,140
Mrs. Ming Shu is a real person.

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,140
I'm also honest with her.

47
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,140
All the industries in the capital are very intense.

48
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,140
If we rush into it,

49
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,140
I'm afraid it's hard to take the risk.

50
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,140
Besides,

51
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,140
men's business is already very hard.

52
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,140
As a woman,

53
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,140
I'm afraid it will be difficult for men to get into it.

54
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,140
So what if you're a woman?

55
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,140
It's easier to get a job than to be in a state of hesitation.

56
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,140
You're right.

57
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,140
You're so determined.

58
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,140
I'll do my best to support you.

59
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,140
Thank you, Mr. Song.

60
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,140
It's almost noon.

61
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,140
First of all,

62
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,140
we need to use the most special snacks in the capital to support us.

63
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,140
The first hand is rubbed with jade.

64
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,140
The oil must be fried to make the skin tender.

65
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,140
It's the pancake.

66
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,140
Mrs. Ming Shu must try it.

67
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,140
Mrs. Ming Shu, have some tea.

68
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,140
It's delicious.

69
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,140
It's delicious.

70
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,140
It's delicious.

71
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,140
It's delicious.

72
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,140
It's delicious.

73
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,140
It's really delicious.

74
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,140
By the way,

75
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,140
according to Mr. Song,

76
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,140
what's the most profitable thing in the capital?

77
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,140
Make money?

78
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,140
I don't do much research on business.

79
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,140
But in my family,

80
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,140
it's the most profitable thing.

81
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,140
Look,

82
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,140
in terms of shape,

83
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,140
we have to buy everything we wear,

84
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,140
including the face and the pictures.

85
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,140
The rouge is also different in color.

86
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,140
In my opinion, it's not much different.

87
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,140
But in her opinion, it's different.

88
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,140
Those jewelry

89
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,140
never have more time.

90
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,140
The jewelry she wants to wear

91
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,140
must be the one she doesn't have.

92
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,140
But I think

93
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,140
the nature of women's beauty is really cute.

94
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,140
Before,

95
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,140
many people bought

96
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,140
cheap and ugly jewelry.

97
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,140
Now that you didn't say it,

98
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,140
maybe we can really start from this aspect.

99
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,140
No hurry.

100
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
Let's take our time.

101
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,140
Are you tired?

102
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,140
No.

103
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,140
Serve tea.

104
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,140
Coming.

105
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,140
This...

106
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,140
Please enjoy.

107
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,140
Thank you.

108
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,140
So great.

109
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,140
In the capital,

110
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,140
even drinking tea

111
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,140
can make so many flowers.

112
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,140
Where can we do

113
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,140
the magic of martial arts?

114
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,140
Business should be done,

115
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,140
and life should be good.

116
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
Don't let down

117
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,140
the memory of this bowl of human beings.

118
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,140
The world is beautiful.

119
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,140
What kind of jewelry is so bad?

120
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,140
I'll talk to them.

121
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,140
It seems to be Chen Xin.

122
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,140
Go and have a look.

123
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,140
Shopkeeper.

124
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,140
I bought jewelry from your house.

125
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,140
Not only is it a joke,

126
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,140
it's been broken for two days.

127
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,140
That lady seems to be

128
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,140
Tao Niang's side.

129
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,140
We have to help her.

130
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
Wait.

131
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,140
Let's see the situation first.

132
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,140
Lady.

133
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
It's obvious that you

134
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,140
are not good at it.

135
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,140
It's obvious that you are not good at it.

136
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,140
You have to return it to me.

137
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,140
It's a bit difficult for me.

138
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,140
I can't return it.

139
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,140
You are too much.

140
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,140
It's obvious that it's your problem.

141
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,140
You just don't want to return it to me, right?

142
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,140
I think you don't want to work here.

143
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Chen Xin.

144
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,140
Lady Lu.

145
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,140
It's been a long time.

146
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,140
How is Lady Tao?

147
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,140
My lady is very good.

148
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,140
I'm concerned about her.

149
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Can I borrow this hairpin?

150
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,140
Look.

151
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,140
How about changing the hairpin like this?

152
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
Great.

153
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
The craftsmanship is simple.

154
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,140
The style is even more unique.

155
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,140
Originally,

156
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,140
there were too many pearls around the coral stone.

157
00:06:51,140 --> 00:07:08,020
We can use a few to change them into

158
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,020
pearls.

159
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,020
It's not a pearl-like pearl.

160
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,020
It's elegant and unique.

161
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,020
You are really unique.

162
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
Don't worry, my lady.

163
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,020
I can definitely change it

164
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
according to this pattern.

165
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,020
I think it's good.

166
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Then let's do it first.

167
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,020
No problem.

168
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,020
Come and get it done in a few days.

169
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,020
Thank you, Lady Mingshu.

170
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,020
But I have to go back to the mansion.

171
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,020
I'll leave first.

172
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,020
I didn't expect Lady Mingshu

173
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,020
to be so talented in jewelry.

174
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
That's not true.

175
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,020
I saw it and I thought I could change it.

176
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
I didn't expect it to be so good.

177
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
It's not just good.

178
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
In my opinion,

179
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,020
it's better than the good ones in the capital.

180
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,020
You are overpraising me.

181
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,020
Then in your opinion,

182
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,020
can I open a jewelry shop?

183
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
I dare to say yes.

184
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
I will be pursued by people.

185
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,020
I'm not afraid of people.

186
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,020
I'm not afraid of people.

187
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,020
I'm not afraid of people.

188
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,020
I'm not afraid of people.

189
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
I'm not afraid of people.

190
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,020
Look.

191
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,020
Look.

192
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,020
Xinyi's business is coming.

193
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,020
Good fate comes with no delay.

194
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
It's also a good thing to travel in the capital.

195
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,020
Do you want to feel it?

196
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,020
Go.

197
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,020
Mr. Yang.

198
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,020
Mr. Yang.

199
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,020
Mr. Yang.

200
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,020
I can smell the sourness in the courtyard.

201
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,020
Open the door.

202
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,020
It's not me.

203
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,020
Yang Zishu bullies the new people again.

204
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,020
I heard that there is no one in the neighborhood.

205
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Now he is afraid of the disaster.

206
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,020
Is Mr. Song here?

207
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,020
In my opinion,

208
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
he is the only one who can save this old man.

209
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,020
Do you know who my father is?

210
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,020
Do you know who my father is?

211
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
My father is the champion of the six-level.

212
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,020
What's this?

213
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
What's this?

214
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,020
Look.

215
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,020
Jiang Lucheng

216
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,020
is afraid of the disaster.

217
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,020
Yes.

218
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,020
It's not good to hear the screaming.

219
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
You can't offend Yang Zishu.

220
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
Who dares to offend him?

221
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,020
Yes.

222
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,020
What's going on?

223
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
You guys will show me your skills in the future.

224
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
It's Mr. Lu.

225
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,020
This is my brother Lu.

226
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
This...

227
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
Be more respectful in the future.

228
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
Did you hear that?

229
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
Lu Jianyuan

230
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
is not going to give Yang Zishu any magic, is he?

231
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,020
It shouldn't be.

232
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,020
Brother Lu.

233
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,020
Brother Song.

234
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,020
We meet again.

235
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,020
So you know Brother Song.

236
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
Yes.

237
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
It's so nice to meet you.

238
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
Yang Zishu is always angry.

239
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
How did you deal with him?

240
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
I said I could teach him to fight with the west.

241
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,020
Thanks to the mountain chief's reminder.

242
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,020
I know he likes it.

243
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,020
Brother Lu,

244
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,020
you are so elegant.

245
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
Brother Song, don't fight.

246
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,020
It's just a kid playing in the countryside.

247
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
But to deal with him

248
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,020
should be a lot of fun.

249
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,020
With you here,

250
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,020
I can finally

251
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
be free from boredom.

252
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,020
Why didn't you see Brother Song in the class?

253
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
I...

254
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,020
I went to buy some cultural treasures.

255
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,020
I went with my sister.

256
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,020
I heard she really wants to go to the capital.

257
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,020
I will take you to the capital

258
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,020
to visit the land owner.

259
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
It's a busy night.

260
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,020
How dare you bother me?

261
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,020
Brother Song is not allowed to accompany you.

262
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,020
Brother Lu, don't be polite.

263
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,020
Brother Song, don't be polite.

264
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,020
If you want to open a jewelry shop,

265
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,020
you have to find a shopkeeper

266
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,020
to ask about the shop.

267
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,020
Shopkeeper.

268
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,020
This shop is going to be sold out.

269
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,020
It's you.

270
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,020
Shopkeeper, do you recognize me?

271
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,020
I saw you drawing a picture

272
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,020
of a lady in the jewelry shop that day.

273
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,020
There is an emergency in my hometown.

274
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,020
It won't be solved in a short time.

275
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,020
So I want to sell this shop as soon as possible.

276
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,020
What a coincidence.

277
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,020
I just want to rent it.

278
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,020
Why don't you transfer it to me?

279
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,020
I don't know the price.

280
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,020
I believe in your craftsmanship.

281
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,020
I will give you a good price.

282
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,020
150 taels.

283
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,020
How about it?

284
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,020
Shopkeeper, the price is fair.

285
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,020
Then I will be honest with you.

286
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,020
I don't have much money now.

287
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,020
How about I pay 90 taels first

288
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,020
and pay the rest before you leave the capital?

289
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,020
Well...

290
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,020
I will give you a good price.

291
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
Then do as you say.

292
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
Thank you, shopkeeper.

293
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,020
How can I make enough money?

294
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,020
Lady Min Shu.

295
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,020
Lady Tao.

296
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,020
What are you doing here?

297
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,020
If you need my help,

298
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
just tell me.

299
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,020
Well...

300
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,020
Since Lady Tao has told me,

301
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
I will be polite.

302
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,020
I want to enter the jewelry shop.

303
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
But I still need some money.

304
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
I want to find a job.

305
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,020
You have been in the capital for a long time.

306
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,020
Can you help me find out?

307
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,020
How much do you need?

308
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,020
I can lend you.

309
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
This is what I want to do.

310
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,020
I will do it myself.

311
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,020
I will do it myself.

312
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,020
I want to apologize to you today.

313
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,020
I hid the real name from you before.

314
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,020
Actually, I am the daughter of Yin Xianjun, the daughter of Yinfu.

315
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,020
Don't blame me.

316
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,020
It's not convenient for women to travel outside.

317
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,020
Of course I understand.

318
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
How can I blame you?

319
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,020
Then I'm relieved to hear that.

320
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,020
But it's true that

321
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
I have a job.

322
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,020
I just don't know why I don't like you.

323
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
Your Majesty,

324
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
the noble consort ordered again.

325
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,020
You want to marry Yin family.

326
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,020
No matter what,

327
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,020
the garden needs to be expanded and repaired.

328
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
If she mentions it again,

329
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,020
you should do it.

330
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,020
You don't have to repeat it with me.

331
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,020
But you are of high status.

332
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,020
How can you let other princes

333
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
take over the seven clans?

334
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,020
The officials in the court are obsessed with the title.

335
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,020
They even chase after the nobility.

336
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
I have a good mansion.

337
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,020
The nobility is very good.

338
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
Why do I need to compete with them?

339
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,020
Your Majesty.

340
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,020
You asked me to come here.

341
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
Are you not a good person?

342
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
There is one thing

343
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,020
that I want to go.

344
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,020
You are the best choice.

345
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,020
Why are you so polite to me?

346
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,020
This is the invitation for Yin family's tea party.

347
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,020
Help me.

348
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,020
You are having a relationship with Lady Shu.

349
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,020
Why don't you go there in person?

350
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,020
That's why I have to avoid the risk.

351
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,020
The noble consort heard that Lady Shu was wronged.

352
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,020
If it's true,

353
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,020
the one who has a relationship with her

354
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,020
will be punished by someone else.

355
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,020
If it's a rumor,

356
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,020
why Yin family is allowed to do so?

357
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,020
You help me find out the truth.

358
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,020
I will.

359
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,020
Don't worry.

360
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,020
I will handle it.

361
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
The case of the corruption case

362
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
is a secret secret of Dali Temple.

363
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,020
So I can only find out that

364
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,020
he was pointed out

365
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,020
that the corruption case was being investigated.

366
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,020
The money was found in the tomb of the noble consort.

367
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
It may be a disaster.

368
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,020
Just these

369
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,020
are not enough to prove the crime of the noble consort.

370
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,020
Because the noble consort left a confession letter

371
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,020
before committing suicide.

372
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,020
So everyone thought that she was guilty of committing suicide.

373
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Someone must have been trying to frame her

374
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
and forged the evidence.

375
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,020
It's a pity that I'm new here.

376
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
I'm not familiar with Dali Temple.

377
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,020
I can only find out these.

378
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,020
It seems that you want to find out more clues.

379
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,020
The case of the noble consort

380
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,020
still needs to be handled by Dali Temple.

381
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
I have heard about Dali Temple

382
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,020
from the man of the palace.

383
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
It's said that King of Rui

384
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,020
will send someone to Dali Temple for a private visit.

385
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,020
King of Rui

386
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,020
may not be able to sleep for a while.

387
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,020
But the Yin Tai Talisman

388
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,020
is a prehistoric thing.

389
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,020
Maybe he has some clues and information.

390
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,020
Mr. Lu.

391
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,020
You are so lucky to be here.

392
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,020
My son just came back from the palace.

393
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,020
Brother Lu, you are here.

394
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,020
Come in.

395
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,020
Brother Lu, please have a seat.

396
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:29,600
The Yin-style

397
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
is a good time to study literature.

398
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,020
The Yin family is a great example.

399
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
Dr. Yin is the leader of the literature and art world.

400
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
I have been looking for him for a long time.

401
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,020
I happened to do something new a few days ago.

402
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,020
I want to ask for the advice of the Fang family.

403
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
Can you ask Brother Song to write me to go?

404
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
That's good.

405
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,020
Then tomorrow, please invite Brother Lu

406
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
to the Yin family dinner with me.

407
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
With Brother Lu here,

408
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,020
the food and tea banquet will be wonderful.

409
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,020
Okay.

410
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,020
It's inside.

411
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
Let's go.

412
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,020
Lady Min Shu.

413
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,020
Don't worry.

414
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,020
I asked you to come to the mansion

415
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,020
to help my sister with the poison.

416
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,020
I shouldn't have said anything

417
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,020
about some things.

418
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,020
But you are my savior.

419
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,020
I introduced you to him.

420
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,020
I want to remind you.

421
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020
Please go ahead, Lady Xian.

422
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,020
My sister is a generous and decent girl.

423
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,020
She is the most noble among sisters.

424
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,020
Although she used to be spoiled,

425
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,020
she is not a bad girl.

426
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,020
But since a year ago,

427
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,020
she has changed her temper.

428
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,020
She beat the servants in the fourth night.

429
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,020
And she killed the cats and dogs.

430
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,420
She even pushed the

431
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,020
mother-in-law's pet dog into the water.

432
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,020
The marriage with King of Rui is about to begin.

433
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,020
Mother-in-law wants to ask a half-dose wife

434
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,020
to watch her behavior.

435
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,020
In case there is a mistake in the middle.

436
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
But she has already

437
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,020
made the other guests angry.

438
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,020
Mother-in-law is worried that she can't find anyone.

439
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
So I want to

440
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
come to you to try.

441
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
I want to come to you to try.

442
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,020
So I'm just teaching her

443
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,020
before the wedding.

444
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,020
I guess it will be soon.

445
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,020
But it's not easy.

446
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,020
You are kind enough to give me a chance.

447
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,020
It's helpful to me.

448
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,020
Whether it works or not depends on my own ability.

449
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,020
Lady Xian, don't worry.

450
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,020
This is the library we usually study.

451
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
I'll take you in.

452
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,020
The library is in the second room.

453
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,020
Greetings, Lady Mingshu.

454
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,020
This is my second sister.

455
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,020
Lady Liangjun in the second room.

456
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,020
Lady Liangjun.

457
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
Greetings, Lady Liangjun.

458
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,020
I'm sorry for my rudeness.

459
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,020
Lady Mingshu, don't be surprised.

460
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,020
I heard from the auntie

461
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,020
that a half-dose wife is coming today.

462
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,020
I'm happy to have six sisters.

463
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
Moreover,

464
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
Lady Mingshu is so charming.

465
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,020
You are too kind.

466
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,020
If you need anything in the future,

467
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,020
just tell them.

468
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,020
Did you hear that?

469
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,020
Yes.

470
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,020
If there is another lady who dares to come,

471
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,020
why don't you ask around first?

472
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,020
What?

473
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,020
Today, Uncle is having a banquet in the front hall.

474
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,020
He called me.

475
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,020
You are so familiar with it.

476
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Sister.

477
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,020
Sister.

478
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,020
This is the half-dose wife

479
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,020
that the auntie especially found for you.

480
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,020
Greetings, Lady Mingshu.

481
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
Lu Mingshu?

482
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,020
I heard that she is the Polo Hu from Jiangling.

483
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,020
How can you be my half-dose wife?

484
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
Sister.

485
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,020
Mingshu's brother...

486
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,020
I heard that you were the one

487
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
who found this person.

488
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,020
How dare you!

489
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,020
I'm sorry.

490
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,020
I did ask for Lady Mingshu.

491
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,020
It's not her fault.

492
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,020
Although I'm from a poor family,

493
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
my brother is from Jiangling.

494
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,020
He is a decent family man.

495
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,020
And Lady Mingshu asked me to come

496
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,020
to be her half-dose wife.

497
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,020
It's not that I don't like her.

498
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,020
Why should I be afraid of her family background?

499
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
You know how to

500
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
bring Lady Mingshu to the Hu family.

501
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,020
You are so clever.

502
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,020
I'd like to see

503
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,020
how long you can be so smart and smart.

504
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,020
Today, we are going to learn

505
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
the poem called The Fiery House.

506
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,020
The ferocious house is white as frost.

507
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,020
The so-called one person is in the water.

508
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,020
All right.

509
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
Please write down

510
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,020
the content of the poem in the book.

511
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,020
I've read it.

512
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,020
You can start learning.

513
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,020
Luckily, I got the poem

514
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,020
when I was reading it.

515
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,020
You're so pure and cute.

516
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,020
Welcome.

517
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,020
Welcome.

518
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,760
I'm the sound of the wind

519
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,460
We both took part in the competition!

520
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,200
Look, how fruitful you are.

521
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,580
It's left by both Mr. yep and it's desserts from the Men's Ainu Chamber.

522
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,180
You look as usual

523
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:24,400
with your unique

524
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,080
Your Highness,

525
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,280
this white paper should be yours again.

526
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,560
Your Highness,

527
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,360
Madam asked me to teach you well.

528
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
But why did you

529
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,760
control the white paper again?

530
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,000
You are not only good at writing,

531
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,880
but also good at writing and writing.

532
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,200
You are very elegant.

533
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:03,540
Report to me for your

534
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,320
guide.

535
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,720
What错是这 么?

536
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
and you don't have to do it.

537
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,000
Lu Ming Shu,

538
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
how dare you!

539
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,760
Lu Ming Shu,

540
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,480
I just came to the Yin family for a day.

541
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,880
I wanted to give you a chance to read in class.

542
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,880
But you dared to mock me in the school.

543
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,760
How dare you!

544
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,240
You know that you are older than me

545
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:41,800
and you are not married yet.

546
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,440
Wen Shu.

547
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,160
But you use the song of Zhe Yang Liu

548
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
to ignore the etiquette of your disciple.

549
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
How can you be a good teacher

550
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,600
and not be a good teacher?

551
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,680
Get out of here!

552
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,120
Sir,

553
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,840
I didn't write this note.

554
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,800
Please check it carefully.

555
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,440
oke

556
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,040
You don't have polarity

557
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,560
and keep them from everyone.

558
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,920
How can you be so kind?

559
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,600
Just steep thechodon

560
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,000
and I've observe you to write it.

561
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,400
These notes will never be created by you.

562
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,360
Besides,

563
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
I've never find any SNF woman

564
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,600
as ugly as you.

565
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,440
At first she is with the missing child

566
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,600
and always zigzag her way around

567
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,200
andThank her for her good reminder.

568
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,920
There are 15 sisters in the Tang Dynasty.

569
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
They are honest and sincere.

570
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,720
They don't want to go back to their families.

571
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,400
They are so generous.

572
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,280
I can't stand

573
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,320
such a girl.

574
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
How can I laugh at her?

575
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,360
Enough.

576
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,040
I believe that

577
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
it's not her doing

578
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,400
based on what Lady Ming Shu said.

579
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Let's call it a day.

580
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,320
No.

581
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,120
If this news gets out,

582
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,200
not only will people think that you are a good wife,

583
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,600
but also our family will be famous.

584
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,560
Shuang Yan.

585
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,760
Drive her out.

586
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,000
Yes.

587
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,640
Lady Ming Shu.

588
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,880
Madam.

589
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,400
Enough.

590
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,240
Stop it.

591
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,240
Madam Yin.

592
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,080
Your Highness.

593
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,640
Tell me.

594
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,120
What's the matter?

595
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,640
Madam.

596
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,080
Who wrote this note?

597
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,360
Everyone knows it.

598
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,360
I don't have to tell you.

599
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Yes, Madam.

600
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,000
We should be more understanding.

601
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,520
Madam.

602
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,440
Ming Shu is not that kind of person.

603
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,800
She is my wife.

604
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,120
She is a good person if you come.

605
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,640
I'll tell you the truth.

606
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,120
There is a missing piece of this note.

607
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,720
I don't know how to write it.

608
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,280
I don't know

609
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,960
why she has such a secret.

610
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,880
Lady Ming Shu is really good at finding out.

611
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,920
She wrote it

612
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,520
to avoid

613
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,000
the words of Master Yin.

614
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,680
This is Lady Shu Jun's habit.

615
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,880
Everyone here

616
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,600
knows it.

617
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,440
Mother.

618
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,720
Just give her the big bead.

619
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,480
Don't make any more trouble.

620
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,000
Your Highness.

621
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,760
After school,

622
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,040
bring Lady Ming Shu to see me.

623
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,320
Yes.

624
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,960
Come.

625
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,960
Here.

626
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,880
Thank you.

627
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,720
I'm sorry.

628
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,000
You're here to read the half-poison.

629
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,640
How could she hide it from me?

630
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,560
I think you're in a hurry.

631
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,040
You didn't have time to tell me.

632
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,800
This Lady Shu Jun

633
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,480
is very arrogant.

634
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,160
I'm afraid it's not easy to read the half-poison.

635
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,400
My cousin, King Rui,

636
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,120
is having an affair with her.

637
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,800
I've heard some rumors about her.

638
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,800
Now it seems

639
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,520
that she's not telling the truth.

640
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,280
But you don't have to worry too much.

641
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,160
Lady Shu Jun is good at reading the half-poison.

642
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,800
She's also good at playing the drums.

643
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,920
She's also good at making jewelry.

644
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,400
She has such a beautiful personality.

645
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,480
It's rare to see her.

646
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,640
How did you know

647
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,640
that she's good at making jewelry?

648
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,080
You've met her before?

649
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,000
I met her that day.

650
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,040
She got furniture at the passion fruit house

651
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,560
and modified people's vanishing patterns.

652
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,560
That kind of things rarely occurs.

653
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,440
Are there other things?

654
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,680
All I know is that I made sweet-kißes

655
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,680
to make some snacks.

656
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,520
No one else matters.

657
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:38,880
No real love is applauds.

658
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:39,960
맞아요.

659
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,880
farming is not Psalm.

660
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,680
fine.

661
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,840
A girl is good meat in showing off her beauty before seeing me.

662
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,200
and the sun shines.

663
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,880
The tea banquet of Yin family

664
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,880
is really elegant.

665
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,600
You're so kind.

666
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,000
You're so talented.

667
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,240
This is Eunuch Yin.

668
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,480
Greetings, Uncle Yin.

669
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,280
You don't have to stand here.

670
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
This is...

671
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,680
I'm Lu Chang.

672
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
Greetings, Eunuch Yin.

673
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,440
I've admired you for a long time.

674
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm here to pay my respects.

675
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,960
Good.

676
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,120
You're all young and talented.

677
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,680
The tea banquet of Yin family

678
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,680
will make your culture and culture survive.

679
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,000
Come and join us.

680
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Lady Ming Shu.

681
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,640
Let's go.

682
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,200
I'll take you to see the aunt.

683
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,520
You go first.

684
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,120
Did anyone find it?

685
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,280
Yes.

686
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
Lady Yang.

687
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,320
What are you doing here?

688
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,520
I saw you were in a hurry.

689
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,800
I was afraid something urgent would happen.

690
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,120
So I came to see if there's anything I can help.

691
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,600
I heard a man's voice just now.

692
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,800
Who is it?

693
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,400
There's no man.

694
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,360
I'm just watering the flowers.

695
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,040
There are guests in the mansion today.

696
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,280
It's not surprising that there's a man.

697
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,000
Lady Ming Shu.

698
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,440
Did you hear that?

699
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
I only saw you alone here.

700
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,720
So I came to see you.

701
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,400
You're so poor that you can't let me go.

702
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,920
You're also a man.

703
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,280
What's your plan?

704
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,120
Are you trying to get me

705
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,760
a man?

706
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
You misunderstood.

707
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,720
I didn't mean that.

708
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,640
I think

709
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,280
I heard it wrong.

710
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,720
Lu Ming Shu.

711
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,360
I don't need a partner.

712
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,640
You can leave alone.

713
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,600
Otherwise,

714
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,120
I'll make you stay.

715
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,480
What should I do?

716
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,080
Madam asked me to come.

717
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,000
You'd better tell her

718
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,360
what you're thinking.

719
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,640
If she asks me to leave,

720
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,600
I'll leave.

721
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
Where are you going?

722
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,400
I'm going to say hello to my parents.

723
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,920
You don't even know the rule of engagement and engagement.

724
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,760
You want to be my partner?

725
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,120
I'm going to see Madam too.

726
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,520
I'll go with you.

727
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Master.

728
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
You two.

729
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
What a coincidence.

730
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,960
There are some things in the house that need to be dealt with.

731
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,920
I'll leave for a moment.

732
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,600
Please.

733
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Mr. Song.

734
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Mr. Jiang.

735
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,240
Mr. Song.

736
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,760
I have something urgent to do.

737
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,840
I'm here to say goodbye to the music teacher.

738
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,360
The music teacher has something to attend to.

739
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,960
I'll tell him for you.

740
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,960
Thank you.

741
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Mother.

742
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,960
Greetings, Aunt.

743
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,400
Master invited guests today.

744
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
You three

745
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,600
don't have to wait here to greet him.

746
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,240
Go back to your rooms.

747
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Yes.

748
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
Wait.

749
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
You!

750
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Okay, Master.

751
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,800
Why are you angry?

752
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Because of your good daughter.

753
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,600
She pushed Aunt Jiao Xi into the water before.

754
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,400
Today, she made you angry in the classroom.

755
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
That's good.

756
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,120
She's leaving.

757
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Master.

758
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,800
Come on.

759
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Sit down.

760
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Master.

761
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,200
It's because you're not feeling well.

762
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,800
Don't be angry.

763
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,400
You're still protecting her.

764
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,600
You pushed Aunt Jiao Xi into the water.

765
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,000
Now, you're talking about

766
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,600
some old women in the court.

767
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
They're blaming me for being rude.

768
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm a great man.

769
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,400
I usually only judge others.

770
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
But now,

771
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
I'm being criticized by others.

772
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm so embarrassed.

773
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Master.

774
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,400
She didn't do it.

775
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,400
But why did you invite her today?

776
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,800
If you really care about her,

777
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,800
you don't have to serve her.

778
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Just take care of yourself.

779
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
What's wrong?

780
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,600
Am I wrong?

781
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,800
You ruined my family's reputation.

782
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Do you know what a big sin you've committed?

783
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
I didn't expect that

784
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
I would be so mean to you.

785
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,000
You never thought about my feelings.

786
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,400
I'm sorry.

787
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,200
I'm leaving.

788
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
You...

789
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm going to entertain my guests today.

790
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,800
Keep an eye on this evil man.

791
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,200
Don't make any mistakes again.

792
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,000
Okay, Master.

793
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,400
You guys can go back now.

794
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,600
Lady Lu is staying.

795
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Yinfu has passed on the message.

796
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You can't skip your study.

797
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,000
You must find a substitute as soon as possible.

798
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,000
Master.

799
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,200
You seem to be worried about your master.

800
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,200
I'm free these days.

801
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,600
If you don't mind,

802
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,400
I can replace you for a while.

803
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I have a lot of time and money.

804
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,200
Since I'm willing to be a nobleman,

805
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,000
I can't ask for a job.

806
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,400
I'm willing to share the burden with you.

807
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,600
You've got a good job.

808
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Are you a substitute in Jiangling?

809
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,800
I'm looking for a job.

810
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,000
Then I'll ask for a job and a substitute.

811
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,800
If you don't mind,

812
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
you can support Han Sheng.

813
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,400
In case Lu Tu runs away.

814
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,000
I'll arrange it now.

815
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,800
Thank you, Master.

816
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,600
It's not too late.

817
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,000
They unexpectedly took the course.

818
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,800
Hurry up!

819
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,800
Lord Hu has told me the reliably seconded Try%,

820
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
who Lady이� Bike told.

821
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and you are not afraid of the real wind.

822
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It shows that you are a smart and brave girl.

823
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You are the only one who can't tell the difference.

824
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I will do my best to help you.

825
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Okay.

826
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Don't worry.

827
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I won't treat you badly.

828
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Besides the reward,

829
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
your music skills in the mansion are just like yours.

830
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
If you can find the truth of Shu Jun's change of temperament,

831
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
you can get the money back.

832
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And you will be heavily rewarded.

833
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I will do my best.

834
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
But Madam asked me to do something.

835
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I have to have the authority.

836
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I can't be taken by Shu Jun.

837
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Of course.

838
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
As long as the situation is reasonable,

839
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
you can decide for yourself.

840
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Thank you, Madam.

841
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Uncle.

842
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Sir.

843
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Mr. Fang from Hanlin Academy is coming to the mansion tonight.

844
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
He asked me to call you back.

845
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Then go back to the mansion and report to him.

846
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Tell him I will be back later.

847
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
No.

848
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
He will be angry.

849
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I will explain to him when I get back.

850
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Okay.

851
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I just saw Mr. Dai scolding Shu Jun's wife.

852
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Is he always like this?

853
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Mr. Dai and Madam always see Shu Jun as their treasure.

854
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
He was so angry just now.

855
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
He is a little grumpy.

856
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I think Liang Jun is a good man.

857
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
He is very popular in the mansion.

858
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Liang Jun is gentle and gentle-minded.

859
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And his father, Mr. Dai,

860
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
died in the battlefield many years ago.

861
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Madam also misses him.

862
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
She is very happy.

863
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So Mr. Dai and Madam always see Liang Jun as their son-in-law.

864
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
He raised them by himself.

865
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I see.

866
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Feixue.

867
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Feixue.

868
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Madam Liang.

869
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What's the hurry?

870
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Feixue is missing.

871
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Feixue.

872
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I will go help her.

873
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Feixue.

874
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
No.

875
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Madam Shu Jun.

876
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Is she going to throw Feixue into the water?

877
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Madam.

878
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Please.

879
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Madam.

880
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It's okay.

881
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
It's okay.

882
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
What?

883
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Can't I touch her?

884
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Liang Jun didn't mean that.

885
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Liang Jun knew that Madam was unhappy.

886
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I was careless.

887
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I won't let him bother Madam anymore.

888
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Then you just watch this beast.

889
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Otherwise...

890
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Before,

891
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
all the cats and rabbits that Madam Shu Jun touched

892
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
would die.

893
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Madam Liang Jun was also afraid.
