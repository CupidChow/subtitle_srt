00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,620
I'm sorry.

31
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,620
I'm sorry.

32
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,620
I'm sorry.

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,620
I'm sorry.

40
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,620
I'm sorry.

41
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,620

I'm sorry.

57
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,620
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,620
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,620
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,620
I'm sorry.

61
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,620
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Please leave us.

63
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
Don't be afraid.

64
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
You wouldn't have left, either.

65
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
Don't be afraid.

66
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,120
Right before slipped away.

67
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,820
The day is so huh Σ

68
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,020
Your fate is so high.

69
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,720
When did I even take his inside?

70
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,680
The downloaded the ấy

71
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,820
Please move further.

72
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
I saw him walking after he who?

73
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,820
Go to the originally.

74
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,920
I think that's you.

75
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,760
Did you buy it?

76
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,880
Mister.

77
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,800
Wait.

78
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,520
What's in the box?

79
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,960
Nothing.

80
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,680
You...

81
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,880
Good.

82
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,960
You dare to steal the cloth that the Noble Consort gave you.

83
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,080
This is what Madam asked Liu Yuan to give to you.

84
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,280
It's bad if you receive it.

85
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,920
I'll repair it now and send it to you in a hurry.

86
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,640
You stole things.

87
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,320
You have so many reasons.

88
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,080
Come with me.

89
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,080
Let go.

90
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,880
You can't do that.

91
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,600
Come with me.

92
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,880
Lady Yuan.

93
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,280
Lady Yuan.

94
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,480
Lady Yuan.

95
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,760
How is Lady Yuan?

96
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,360
Is she okay?

97
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,160
Wait a minute.

98
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,640
Wait a minute.

99
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
There's nothing else.

100
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,240
Yeah.

101
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,840
Really?

102
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
She must be fine.

103
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,880
What's going on?

104
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,040
Didn't you arrange everything?

105
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,720
I don't know.

106
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,080
But I don't think there will be any mistake.

107
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,640
Don't worry, Madam.

108
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,720
Have some snacks.

109
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Don't be too worried.

110
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,320
What are you two doing here?

111
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
I'm also very anxious.

112
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,240
But

113
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
the cloth that Song Xiangrui gave me hasn't arrived yet.

114
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,280
Why didn't you prepare it earlier?

115
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,840
It must be coming soon.

116
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,520
Soon?

117
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,720
What should we do now?

118
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,360
What should we do now?

119
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
What should we do now?

120
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,560
When will it arrive?

121
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
What should we do now?

122
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,320
You guys go and wait.

123
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,840
Yes.

124
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,440
Yes.

125
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,120
Hurry up.

126
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
Hurry up.

127
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,480
asked you to prepare shifts today.

128
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,280
You need to get everything up and send them tonight.

129
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,160
Send them tonight.

130
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,440
Let go of me.

131
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,320
Chief.

132
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,240
You dare to trick me?

133
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,960
I'm afraid that the master will blame you.

134
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,520
Stop.

135
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,440
You can think about it.

136
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,640
Tell me your name.

137
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,520
Where do you work?

138
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,240
Mr. Lu.

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Brother Song.

140
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,960
It's been half a day.

141
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
Mr. Lu is wandering around here.

142
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,440
Everyone is waiting for you.

143
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,760
I'm not well-groomed.

144
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
Then please.

145
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,240
Mr. Lu, please.

146
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,240
Brother Song, please.

147
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,880
No.

148
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,000
Madam.

149
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,800
It's done.

150
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Thank you, Madam.

151
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,160
Don't worry.

152
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,160
Everyone.

153
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,440
Wen Sheng was inspired by the dance.

154
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,560
He was touched.

155
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,640
I hope I didn't disturb your mood.

156
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,360
Mr. Wen Sheng,

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,720
don't blame yourself.

158
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,000
The sound of the zither

159
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
has really improved the color of the banquet.

160
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,960
There are more exciting things to come.

161
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,280
Let's keep watching.

162
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
It's really good.

163
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,800
Nice It's really good.

164
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,480
The Smooth Scent Isn't too bad.

165
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,440
It looks nice.

166
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,240
There is Noble Consort's provided cloth.

167
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,720
It really has extraordinary intention.

168
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You're so shameless.

170
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,800
What are you doing?

171
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,560
Why did you hit him?

172
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,120
This gift should be mine.

173
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,760
You seduced him.

174
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
You took away all the benefits.

175
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,320
You can get the evidence.

176
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,080
Why did you hit me?

177
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,880
What's going on?

178
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,280
I gave him the painting.

179
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,840
Did someone help you?

180
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,880
You're a woman.

181
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
You're sick.

182
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,240
Why should you make it hard for each other?

183
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,160
You know your husband is a man.

184
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,640
You have no choice.

185
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,440
You can't just

186
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,880
bully the innocent.

187
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,400
Even if you did something,

188
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,800
you can't change anything.

189
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,240
Why is the lady coming to the Lu family again?

190
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,720
That's good.

191
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,720
In order to wait for her,

192
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,560
the young master didn't even go to the banquet.

193
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,840
She always has her own ways.

194
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,200
She must have her own reasons.

195
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,920
It's really interesting.

196
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,560
Ming Shu.

197
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,720
Mr. Lu.

198
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,360
Mr. Lu is here too.

199
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,200
You are...

200
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,240
Keep your voice down.

201
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,960
We're staying in the Lu family

202
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
because we're a married couple.

203
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,040
Mr. Lu,

204
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
thank you for Mr. Song.

205
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
Otherwise, we would have been killed by that Luo Wencai.

206
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,440
Married couple?

207
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,600
I see.

208
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,280
You're looking for clues about Liu Xiankun, right?

209
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,880
Yes.

210
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
Please keep it a secret for us.

211
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,320
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

212
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,200
Mr. Song, are you here for the banquet?

213
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,320
Yes.

214
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,840
I thought it was just a boring banquet.

215
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,480
I didn't expect to meet you.

216
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,880
I really envy you.

217
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,040
You're free.

218
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,480
Unlike me,

219
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,000
I have to report to my parents every time I leave the mansion.

220
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,680
Envy us?

221
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,200
There are so many people in the world who envy you.

222
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,160
Everything in the world has its ups and downs.

223
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,680
It's rare for Mr. Song to be able to

224
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,000
take care of his family.

225
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,280
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

226
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,360
The situation of you and your family

227
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,280
is still in the dark.

228
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,120
If you need any help,

229
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,560
I'll do my best.

230
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,400
Mr. Song, you're so kind.

231
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,280
If there's anything,

232
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,400
just let us know.

233
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,240
You're too kind.

234
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,840
Don't mention it.

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,680
You look very good in this dress.

236
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,520
You're so good-looking.

237
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,880
Mr. Wen Shang looks angry.

238
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,960
But Mother is still angry.

239
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Mother.

240
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,040
Yuan Ying.

241
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Mother.

242
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,280
Thank you.

243
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,760
It's nothing.

244
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,960
Life is not easy.

245
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,320
We should help each other.

246
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,960
Besides, you helped me before.

247
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,960
We're both innocent.

248
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,840
Why don't you reject me like others?

249
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,840
You're just a little cold.

250
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,240
But you're kind.

251
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,560
Why should I reject you?

252
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,400
But I'm still curious.

253
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,120
You're born in the capital.

254
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,440
Why are you surrounded by

255
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,480
a rough and colorful Luo Wencai?

256
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,080
Did he force you?

257
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,440
I don't want to live.

258
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,480
I just want to live alone.

259
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,360
But I'm in a crisis.

260
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
It's not easy.

261
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,440
Wen Shang and I are from poor families.

262
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,360
We've been running around all the time.

263
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,480
We just want to save enough money

264
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,880
to buy some food.

265
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,280
We don't want to wander.

266
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,360
We're both people from different worlds.

267
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,720
You're right.

268
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,640
I was forced by that Luo Wencai.

269
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,680
He threatened my brother with his life.

270
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,880
If I don't obey,

271
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,480
he'll kill my brother.

272
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
So,

273
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,160
even if someone scolds me,

274
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,560
I have to bear with it.

275
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,320
What about your brother?

276
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,440
Have you seen him?

277
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,960
I've seen him.

278
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
I don't know.

279
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,760
But he has

280
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
my brother's jade pendant.

281
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,960
I've changed my mind.

282
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,720
But if he doesn't let you see your brother,

283
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,320
you're willing to be controlled like this?

284
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,320
But what can I do?

285
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,200
Do you have any relatives?

286
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
No.

287
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,400
Let's not talk about this.

288
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Let me ask you.

289
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,040
Today,

290
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,640
I saw you and Mr. Wen Shang

291
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,400
and a noble man together.

292
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,200
You're close to that man.

293
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,120
Who is he?

294
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,720
He's a good friend of mine.

295
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,520
Then let me remind you.

296
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,600
The noble man of Mo Yupeio is too close.

297
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,280
inaudible

298
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,040
He's jealous.

299
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,200
Jealous?

300
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,560
No, he won't.

301
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,040
He...

302
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
He won't.

303
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,620
That Gang coun District Third Miss

304
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,560
teases and flirt with Mr. Wen Shao늘

305
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:39,920
before we can get over.

306
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,680
before we can get over.

307
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,200
Mrs. Lu

308
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,780
02.16.20

309
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,000
stirs and whists several times.

310
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,760
She conspires against us

311
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,460
and even

312
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,860
I can't even think of the word gold and gold.

313
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,860
In this way,

314
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,500
I won't go to their family dinner in the future.

315
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,060
Madam is right.

316
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,140
I'm your father.

317
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,580
Why are you so generous?

318
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,700
Think about it.

319
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,860
What if our son

320
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,220
really likes that Third Lady Lu?

321
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,700
Such a shallow person.

322
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,020
I will never allow her

323
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,540
to be the daughter-in-law of our Song family.

324
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,700
How can I say that?

325
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,740
You are worrying about the situation.

326
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,780
I taught our son since childhood.

327
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,820
What do I have?

328
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,220
You can see it by yourself.

329
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,140
You will know.

330
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,100
In the past,

331
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,980
those noble ladies who were popular with him,

332
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,820
have you ever fallen for him?

333
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,100
Don't worry.

334
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,220
Third Lady Lu can't be his wife.

335
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,700
That's right.

336
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,700
We have seen it before.

337
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,500
Not any other young lady

338
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,540
can see it.

339
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,100
You have a good taste.

340
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,540
I don't know you like to do this.

341
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,860
I'm sorry.

342
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,980
I will scold you for this.

343
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,780
Father.

344
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,900
Mother.

345
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,580
I just came back from Stopade Department.

346
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,380
I came to ask about the news.

347
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,500
You've been tired all day.

348
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,420
Have a rest.

349
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,700
You have been busy with things

350
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,660
to delay your studies.

351
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:11,780
You have been busy with things to delay your studies.

352
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,000
You have been busy with things to delay your studies.

353
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,540
Since today,

354
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,700
you have been working on my theory and teaching me.

355
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,940
I feel very grateful

356
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,700
It's the same.

357
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,820
Okay.

358
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,380
You should go back to your room.

359
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
It's tiring to go back to the banquet.

360
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,860
Father, Mother, you should rest early.

361
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,300
I'll come back tomorrow morning.

362
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,180
How did he become so sensible?

363
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,860
It's just that.

364
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,820
He's a little worse than I expected.

365
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,660
You're just stubborn.

366
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,320
Emergencyplan

367
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,500
Hold it close to you.

368
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,020
Okay.

369
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,140
Master,

370
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,700
do you really have to write a diagnosis every day?

371
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,060
No,

372
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,100
let's attack five of them today.

373
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,620
I...

374
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,820
Master,

375
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,380
you've changed your mind?

376
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,860
First, I need to write it.

377
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,140
If I can't be good enough,

378
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,940
how can I let them

379
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,300
and let us out of the mansion.

380
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,780
So it's for the Lu family.

381
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,100
No, no, no.

382
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,300
It must be for Lady Lu.

383
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,300
Now I understand

384
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,420
what Lao Zi said.

385
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,540
The most gentle in the world

386
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,340
is the most beautiful in the world.

387
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,740
To treat the parents of the strong and the weak,

388
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,820
we have to use the means of water and softness.

389
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,380
The rest is all hard work.

390
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,860
It does look effective.

391
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:16,780
By the way,

392
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,460
tomorrow you help me

393
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,620
to get some books about the law of the country.

394
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,780
And then I'll show you some of the ways to be an official.

395
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,780
Remember,

396
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,700
you must show them to me.

397
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,300
Okay.

398
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,220
You're both women and you're sick together.

399
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,860
Why do you have to make it difficult for each other?

400
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,460
I can't get to know Liu Yuanying today.

401
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,060
I'll find another chance.

402
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,460
I'm not thinking about it.

403
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,180
I'm thinking about what Lady Mo said today.

404
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,700
Mister.

405
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,900
Mister, why?

406
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,140
I know you're jealous of Liu Yuanying.

407
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,180
But you have to take care of the reputation of the Lu family.

408
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,820
Fortunately, nothing big happened.

409
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,660
Otherwise, I won't spare you.

410
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,180
He complained to you.

411
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,620
I...

412
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,220
Mister, I was just confused.

413
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,740
Fortunately, nothing big happened.

414
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,540
Mister.

415
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,660
Mister, don't be angry.

416
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,260
If you dare to do this again,

417
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,900
I'll be rude to you.

418
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,980
Lady, are you okay?

419
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,740
I'm fine.

420
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,740
I've been married to him for a few days.

421
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,220
I've got used to it.

422
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,460
He's a bad person

423
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,540
who's not talented and greedy.

424
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,780
But my family wants me to marry him.

425
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,980
What can I do?

426
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,380
You have to blame Liu Yuanying.

427
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,740
She's a bad person.

428
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,620
If you can't stand this anger,

429
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,580
I'll find someone to deal with her tomorrow.

430
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,980
You're both women and you're sick together.

431
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,940
You're destined to be together.

432
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,220
Why bother each other?

433
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,100
You know how he is.

434
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,660
Yuanying has no choice.

435
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,460
You can't just

436
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,980
bully an innocent man.

437
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,380
Even if you've done it,

438
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,780
you can't change anything.

439
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,220
Forget it.

440
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,140
What's the point of keeping her?

441
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,500
She's gone.

442
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,780
And now she has Zhao Yuanying and Li Yuanying.

443
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
What's the point?

444
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Young lady.

445
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,940
Where are you going so late?

446
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,100
My husband is waiting for me.

447
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
I'm in a hurry to find him.

448
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,860
Wait.

449
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,220
Your husband?

450
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,740
What's your identity?

451
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,740
Why do you care about him?

452
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,820
As long as you take care of me,

453
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,100
you'll have everything you want.

454
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,220
You bitch.

455
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,980
How dare you hit me?

456
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,460
My husband.

457
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,060
Stay away from my wife.

458
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,420
Or your family will be in a dilemma.

459
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,420
You two.

460
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,060
How dare you hit me?

461
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,180
This is my family.

462
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,660
I'll stick you two to death

463
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,260
like two ants.

464
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,900
Do you know?

465
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,260
Gratitude is the most important.

466
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,060
Everyone knows that we two

467
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,700
are specially invited by the mansion.

468
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,940
If anything happens to us,

469
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,700
you won't be afraid of affecting the seal

470
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,220
and the reputation of the mansion.

471
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,340
When the seal ceremony is over,

472
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,820
I'll kill you two.

473
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,660
Wait for me.

474
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,380
Wait for me.

475
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,980
My husband, are you okay?

476
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,540
I'm fine.

477
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,180
He's so bold.

478
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,860
Look at him.

479
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,060
He can't even lift his back.

480
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,500
Your hand is hurt.

481
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,820
I don't know what he's wearing in his arms.

482
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,260
Ignore it.

483
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,820
I love you.

484
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,900
I love you.

485
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,340
It's all internal injuries.

486
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,380
You can tell from internal injuries.

487
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,300
Of course I can.

488
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,460
I'll show you.

489
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,780
Ming Shu.

490
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,460
I'll go to the basement.

491
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,300
No.

492
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,260
It's so noisy on the ground.

493
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,540
You'll get sick if you stay here.

494
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,100
It's not appropriate.

495
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,380
Our two beds

496
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,860
are so wide in the middle.

497
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,620
And I sleep well.

498
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,700
I'll stick the seal.

499
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
I'm not too cold.

500
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,340
Don't worry.

501
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,380
Go to sleep.

502
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,780
Lu Chao, what are you thinking?

503
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,260
Why are you here?

504
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,660
Why don't you go and practice martial arts?

505
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,820
It's a good time for you.

506
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,340
I have a question for you.

507
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:56,940
What is it?

508
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,900
I don't know

509
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,980
what to say.

510
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,740
I'm sorry.

511
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,420
I'm sorry.

512
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,100
I'm sorry.

513
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,740
I'm sorry.

514
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,420
I'm sorry.

515
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,220
I'm sorry.

516
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,940
I'm sorry.

517
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,660
I'm sorry.

518
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,420
I'm sorry.

519
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,180
I'm sorry.

520
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,020
I'm sorry.

521
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,140
I'm sorry.

522
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,020
I'm sorry.

523
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,300
I don't know what to say.

524
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,460
It's so mysterious.

525
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,780
I've seen a lot of cases like this.

526
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,380
You've met someone in your relationship.

527
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,180
Stop whining.

528
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,140
Do you like someone?

529
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,020
No way.

530
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,100
Why not?

531
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,740
That noble young master

532
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,860
looks like a family member.

533
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,980
He's your childhood sweetheart, right?

534
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,500
Noble young master?

535
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,180
You forgot?

536
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,700
I saw him that day.

537
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,780
I also reminded you

538
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,020
not to get too close to him

539
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,420
in case he gets jealous.

540
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,740
Oh.

541
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,940
Now I understand

542
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,260
your confusion.

543
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,180
It's just like what's in the book.

544
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,260
A happy married woman

545
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,060
is forced to be separated from her childhood sweetheart.

546
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,140
Then she's forced to live her life

547
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,780
and has to marry someone else.

548
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,820
Now she meets her ex-lover.

549
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,300
But her identity is unknown

550
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,420
and she's being followed by the law.

551
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,340
She can only be loved by others.

552
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,180
Your handwriting is smooth and smooth.

553
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,660
You're really good at playing the piano.

554
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,020
Can you see the shadow

555
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,500
from here?

556
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,140
There's a garden over there.

557
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,740
I'm afraid you miscalculated.

558
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,660
Come here.

559
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,260
Young Master.

560
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,340
A few days ago,

561
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,500
I was holding the piano

562
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,100
and I saw you playing the piano.

563
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,340
I was so surprised.

564
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
I was so surprised.

565
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,340
I was so surprised.

566
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
I was so surprised.

567
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,340
I was so surprised.

568
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,340
I was so surprised.

569
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,340
I was holding the piano

570
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,740
and made a picture of a flower and a bird.

571
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,060
If you have time,

572
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,140
can you help me point out some?

573
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,700
I don't know much about the picture of a flower and a bird.

574
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,020
I'm afraid it's hard to point out.

575
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
I hope you can understand.

576
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,460
It's a little boring to stay here.

577
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,140
I'll go to the garden and take a break.

578
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,020
Mr. Song.

579
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,860
It's boring.

580
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,020
Eat more.

581
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
Try this.

582
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,740
Think about how you used to get along with your brother.

583
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,340
You have to adjust quickly.

584
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,340
It's been too hard to practice these days.

585
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,340
I'm so hungry.

586
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
Eat more.

587
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,580
My hand hurts again.

588
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,580
Try this.

589
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,860
Mother is good at everything.

590
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,020
But she doesn't understand the style.

591
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,140
Your husband's hand is injured.

592
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,620
How can you eat by yourself?

593
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,340
You're right.

594
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,140
Why don't you feed your husband quickly?

595
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,300
No need.

596
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,500
I can do it myself.

597
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,300
All right.

598
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,420
You're too idle.

599
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,620
Mother is tired every day.

600
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,300
Eat quickly.

601
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,380
My husband.

602
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,420
Open your mouth.

603
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,500
Look.

604
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
I didn't see it.

605
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,580
It's so sweet.

606
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,820
Is it a love letter?

607
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,180
I haven't seen it.

608
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,540
I didn't eat it.

609
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,340
Really.

610
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,700
What are you laughing at?

611
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,060
Mother is hurt by her husband's hand.

612
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,380
She's feeding him.

613
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,180
Zhenzhen is like a wife.

614
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,540
She kills others first.

615
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:44,980
Mother is jealous.

616
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,620
All right.

617
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,420
Let's talk about something important.

618
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,060
Ye Rong got sick last night.

619
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,300
She can't go on stage.

620
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,300
Mu Qing.

621
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,980
You can make up for her.

622
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,060
I see.

623
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,260
Practice quickly.

624
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,660
You have to act in three days.

625
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,740
Three days?

626
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,900
So fast?

627
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,860
Although she's acting,

628
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,420
she sees her as her husband.

629
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,460
My husband

630
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,620
is still a little suspicious.

631
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,580
If it's about this,

632
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,420
you think too much.

633
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,260
They are brothers and sisters.

634
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,540
What's the big deal?

635
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,260
Right.

636
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,740
I'm really being selfish.

637
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,060
Mr. Song.

638
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,020
Let's eat quickly.

639
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,020
We have to rehearse later.

640
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,060
It's only a few days before the En Yin banquet.

641
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,180
Why are you here again today?

642
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,420
I'm also concerned about the progress of the investigation.

643
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,020
It's not over yet.

644
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,500
I'm also worried about it.

645
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,260
I get along with Miss Yuan Ying.

646
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,780
But she's very suspicious about Liu Xiankun.

647
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,980
Whenever I mention her father,

648
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,260
she changes the topic.

649
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,180
So I think

650
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,460
it's hard to make a relationship.

651
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,460
To make Liu Yuan Ying tell the truth,

652
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,900
there are two conditions.

653
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,980
One,

654
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,300
she has to make sure her brother is safe.

655
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,700
Xiong is right.

656
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,940
This is what she cares about the most.

657
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,380
If you have a chance

658
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,620
to get away from Lu Wencai,

659
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,220
would you like to do it?

660
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,220
My father is still in her hands.

661
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,540
I can't abandon my father.

662
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,300
It's been so long.

663
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:35,740
You've been

664
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
trying to get away from her.

665
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,020
She won't let you see her.

666
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,620
She's been controlling you.

667
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,420
Aren't you afraid

668
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,540
she's been lying to you?

669
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,860
The second condition is to let her know

670
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,460
her current situation

671
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,780
is not only as simple as being possessed,

672
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,380
but more dangerous.

673
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,500
We can save her.

674
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,660
The official discipline of the Pope

675
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,500
is not a taboo,

676
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,020
but it's a rule.

677
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,500
If you don't plan to

678
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,100
threaten her,

679
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,660
I'm afraid she'll do anything

680
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,780
to protect herself.

681
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,020
Do you think she'll spare your life?

682
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,700
She has the power.

683
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,020
I'm in a hurry. How can I get away?

684
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,740
I'm grateful that you care about me.

685
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,740
But you can't do anything for me.

686
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,940
Use the N-line Banquet.

687
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,100
If she can prove Lu Wencai

688
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,220
on the N-line Banquet,

689
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,460
I'm sure I can help her get away.

690
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,980
You're going to use the N-line Banquet

691
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,780
to save Lady Yuanying

692
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,620
and stop Lu Wencai from entering the market.

693
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,220
Yes.

694
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,420
The market is only for family background.

695
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,820
No matter the quality of the banquet,

696
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,620
it's against the law.

697
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,340
Lu Wencai will be the target.

698
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,660
How can the people be safe?

699
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,180
I've been in charge of the N-line Banquet since I was a child.

700
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,500
But I didn't realize

701
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,220
such a private matter

702
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,460
is so secretive.

703
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,540
If the country is under Lu Wencai's control,

704
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,420
how can the country be safe?

705
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,940
That's one of the reasons I support the new policy.

706
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,660
You mean

707
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,740
we should join hands with Lady Yuanying

708
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,860
to report Lu Wencai's crimes

709
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,540
on the N-line Banquet?

710
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,060
If we can get help from Liu Yuanying,

711
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,900
it'll be more convincing to expose Lu Wencai.

712
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,060
We're helping each other

713
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,060
in this matter.

714
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,060
Do you understand?

715
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,940
But she thinks we have no power

716
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,500
and doesn't believe us.

717
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,580
To be honest,

718
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,620
that noble man

719
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,620
is the grandson of Duke Zheng.

720
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,820
If he helps us,

721
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,180
the N-line Banquet will be successful.

722
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,100
He's already made such a big step.

723
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,660
But

724
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,700
he's your childhood friend.

725
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,580
He has nothing to do with me.

726
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,380
Why would he help me?

727
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
I'll figure something out.

728
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,100
You're married.

729
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,340
With your past relationship,

730
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,700
you can let him take the risk of offending the Lu family.

731
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,340
That's impossible.

732
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,140
Please don't give me any more hope.

733
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,740
Why don't I come forward

734
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,820
and persuade him in person?

735
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,180
If people see this,

736
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,740
it'll lead to unnecessary misunderstandings.

737
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,580
I'll go and talk to him.

738
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,220
I'll go and talk to him.

739
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
I'll go and talk to him.

740
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
I'll go and talk to him.

741
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,700
I'll go and talk to him.

742
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,300
I have an idea.

743
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,860
I'm afraid that Lady Yuan Ying has read too many books.

744
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,340
She's mistaken that

745
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,660
Mr. Song is the childhood friend I've missed.

746
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,900
If she believes that

747
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,500
Mr. Song can really do me a favor,

748
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,660
the problem might be solved in one day.

749
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,220
I know it sounds a bit absurd.

750
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,420
If you think it's not appropriate,

751
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,860
just take it as if I didn't say it.

752
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,860
I said it before.

753
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,340
If you have any problems,

754
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,540
I'll be happy to help you.

755
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,860
No problem.

756
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,620
I can cooperate.

757
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,860
Mu wohl

758
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,460
Mu Qing!

759
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:18,880
Halt!

760
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,240
Are you all right, Mo Qing?

761
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
What are you doing?

762
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,780
I'm meant to be your trimmer.

763
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,040
Be careful.

764
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,160
Mother.

765
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,160
I'd like to see it.

766
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Don't be like this.

767
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,880
You're injured.

768
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,640
I know you're hard-working.

769
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,280
It's inevitable to get hurt.

770
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,240
I made this ointment for you.

771
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,600
Here.

772
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,720
Hold it.

773
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,000
It's...

774
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,440
It's okay.

775
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,600
Don't move.

776
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,720
It'll be fine soon.

777
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,000
Does it hurt?

778
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,080
Mr. Wen Sheng.

779
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,520
What's the matter, Miss Yuan Ying?

780
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,480
I...

781
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,680
I heard that Mr. Wen Sheng's zither is very moving.

782
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,080
Could you please

783
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,360
give me a copy of the music score?

784
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:56,680
Okay.

785
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,480
I'll give it to you later.

786
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,120
But I need it now.

787
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,800
Mr. Wen Sheng.

788
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,000
What are you doing?

789
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,480
Mr. Wen Sheng, don't be so agitated.

790
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,040
It's not what you think.

791
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,600
Sir.

792
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,920
We just met by chance.

793
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,480
There's really nothing between us.

794
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,800
By chance?

795
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,720
Do you think I'll believe you?

796
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,840
Since you're married to me,

797
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
you can't see him again.

798
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:32,960
Come here.

799
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,640
Let her go.

800
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,240
Don't you have enough hurt for her?

801
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,240
I'm the only one in her heart.

802
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,080
Only I can make her happy.

803
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,760
You've been with her for a while.

804
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,720
But you're acting like a lover.

805
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
With your background,

806
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,800
can you decide your marriage?

807
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,240
With her background,

808
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,760
can you enter your family?

809
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,120
Why do you give her happiness?

810
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,320
I'm sincere to her.

811
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,400
I have no false hope.

812
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,960
As long as you let her go,

813
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,640
I'll do anything for her.

814
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,320
No matter how much it costs,

815
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,360
I'll marry her and give her a happy life.

816
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,320
You're dreaming.

817
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,000
She's mine for the rest of her life.

818
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,320
I'll kill her.

819
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,440
It's so scary.

820
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,960
My lord.

821
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,240
Mr. Lu.

822
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,760
I'm so sorry.

823
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,480
I was too deep.

824
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,720
It's my fault.

825
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,440
It's my bad idea.

826
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,040
I didn't expect you two to be so good at acting.

827
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,680
It's okay.

828
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,960
Song Qiong is also here to help us.

829
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,640
He'll be here for us.

830
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,800
Thank you, Mr. Song.

831
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,560
Hello, Her Grace.

832
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,160
Everything seems so different

833
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,480
thanks to me.

834
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,080
About Rayunney,

835
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,160
it's true that

836
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,640
her father died too early.

837
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,960
You're such a great actor!

838
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,080
You've worked so hard.

839
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,920
I'm always grateful to you.

840
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,400
The play

841
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,360
might not be complete.

842
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,560
and regret the ending of our life.

843
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,680
Alright.

844
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,160
Liu Yuan Yi now believes that

845
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,720
Brother Song will be able to make it.

846
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,840
We still need the second step.

847
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,360
Give him the sleeping umbrella.

848
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,320
Whether we can get the news

849
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,760
of his brother from Lu Wen Cai's mouth

850
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,000
is up to him.

851
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,600
You'd better answer to it.

852
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,560
While he never freedom,

853
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,560
he will survive.

854
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,320
If that was true,

855
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:09,920
how great it would be.

856
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,000
It's normal.

857
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,680
Let me see.

858
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,480
No need.

859
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,560
It's fine.

860
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,920
I'll send you out of the mansion first.

861
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,720
I'll take care of the rest.

862
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,120
It's the end of the world.

863
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,440
How can I give up?

864
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,480
I know you want to help me.

865
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,800
But your safety is the most important.

866
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,760
I can't see you get hurt.

867
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,480
I know you value me.

868
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,240
But you're also the most important person to me.

869
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,440
If I leave now,

870
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,880
I'll be suspicious.

871
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,560
Besides, you've done so much for the sake of the reality.

872
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,040
It's no big deal to say a little hurt.

873
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,160
Thank you.

874
00:38:59,240 --> 00:38:59,800
Really.

875
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,640
I'll be careful.

876
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,560
I'll be careful.

877
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,480
I'll be careful.

878
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,320
I'll be careful.

879
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,160
I'll be careful.

880
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,320
Why did you send him home?

881
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,320
I'm gonna send him home.

882
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:26,960
I gotta go.

883
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Don't miss the chance to meet you

884
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,760
A heart is like a candle, flowers bloom and fall

885
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,760
I will follow the wind wherever it takes me

886
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,760
I will stay with you in the world

887
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,760
We will travel across the vast universe

888
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:43,760
We will wait for the sunset to set the sky and the earth to welcome the new year

889
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Looking back, I will feel the pain

890
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,760
If I can go back to the past

891
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,760
A love that is only left in the past, and I'm lost in my heart

892
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:13,760
The long night is coming, I can't help but miss you

893
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,760
If the sea is as deep as the moon, the moon will return and the wind will blow

894
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,760
I will never forget you, I will always be with you

895
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:37,760
I will forget everything that has happened in the past, and I will still be in the dream

896
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,760
