I will never forget you.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The rich and rich

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
are hard to get rid of.

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They can't avoid it.

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Moreover, the little girl

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
is very beautiful.

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Please don't be so rude.

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Master.

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Good. Good.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I want to ask you.

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who are you

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
in this portrait?

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Lu Cheng.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Exactly.

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He studied in our

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Jianjia Academy since he was a child.

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He is expected to get

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,120
the

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,000
Jianjia Academy's

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
although it is located in Jiangling,

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
it is only

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the end of the business of the farmers and the merchants.

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Therefore,

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
our son-in-law

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
must be an official.

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Tell me.

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Should we

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
do something for the Jianjia Academy?

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Should we do something

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
for the happiness of our family?

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

88
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The most important thing is

89
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
that Lu Cheng

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
will be robbed by the families tomorrow.

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
How can we

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
give the loyal people of the Ming Academy

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
to each other?

94
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

96
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We can't.

97
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We can't.

98
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We are not capable of

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
robbing the wife and the children.

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Good. Good.

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Good. Good.

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Come on.

103
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Welcome, Madam.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
According to Madam,

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the gifts have been changed to red and white.

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It is the wedding gift for the bride.

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Recently, all the officials

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
have come to Jiangling to get the bride.

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They can't help buying gold and silver

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
for the wedding.

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But this is the right time

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
for us to show off our skills.

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Please be careful.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes, Madam.

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you really treat me well,

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
why don't you ask my brother

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
to propose a marriage proposal?

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He asked me to come here.

119
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I brought you here

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
to choose a bride for you.

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Come on.

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Look.

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Which one is better?

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
These sets of clothes

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
are also very suitable for the bride.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you, Manager.

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you, Manager.

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This jade is delicate and flawless.

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's a good jade.

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You have a good taste.

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is an ancient jade.

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's worth a lot of money.

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Sir,

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
what do you think of this set?

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You can choose as you like.

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Once you've chosen,

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll take you to the hall to have a meal.

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The hall?

140
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's hard for you to make a choice.

141
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Can these shallow things

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
be used as eyes?

143
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Although these sets

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
are exquisite,

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
they are not enough.

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How can you let Mr. Gao use them as a bait?

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Look, Madam.

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This head is the key

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
to our shop's shop.

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's made of gold and gold.

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's made of beautiful jade.

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's made of

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the essence of the flower and jade.

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Are you satisfied?

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This head is really beautiful.

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The meaning is good, too.

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I like it very much.

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You have good taste.

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Mr. Gao, what do you think?

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're talking nonsense.

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You want to make fun of me?

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's go.

163
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We can't.

164
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll take you to the hall.

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The hall is a good place.

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There are many people

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
who come and go outside the city.

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But it's too dark.

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm afraid it's hard to come back at night.

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Fortunately, there is a room to stay overnight.

171
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you know

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
that you said it's a good place

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
but it's a remote place outside the city?

174
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You...

175
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I think you

176
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
don't plan to let me come back tonight.

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Madam.

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Madam.

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you miss me that much?

180
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The gold pendant on your jade

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
is given by the new jade of Xiangyun House.

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Only the ones who are familiar with it can get one.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You are so charming.

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're a lowly servant.

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What kind of love

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
is not mine

187
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
but is all a lie?

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Madam.

189
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Madam.

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr. Gao.

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We don't welcome you to the gold shop.

192
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Take care.

193
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Not bad.

194
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You...

195
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Bitch.

196
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
How dare you ruin my plan?

197
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Brother A'Chang.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The current Governor Gao is my cousin.

199
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
How dare you go against me?

200
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're sick of living.

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If I'm not mistaken,

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the jade pendant on your hand

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
is the jade pendant of the former Governor Su Changhua.

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
How could you have the item

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
that was stolen from the former Governor's Mansion?

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Wait for me.

207
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Brother A'Chang.

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's been a long time.

209
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Are you all right?

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Madam.

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Brother Lu.

212
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thanks to your help today,

213
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was able to get away from the trouble.

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't mention it.

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you.

216
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
These years,

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
the Imperial College of Health and Welfare has been helping the Academy.

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It gives us, the Han family,

219
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the opportunity to focus on our studies.

220
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I have nothing to repay you.

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I hope I can help you.

222
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's the greatest reward

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
if we can learn from each other.

224
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I hope you can go back to Changgong tomorrow.

225
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I have something to do.

226
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll leave you alone.

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Brother A'Chang.

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Brother A'Chang.

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Brother A'Chang.

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Since you came back from study,

233
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
we haven't talked to each other.

234
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We're not friends.

235
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We have something to do.

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Besides,

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm a few years older than you.

238
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I know I should avoid danger.

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why?

240
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Brother A'Chang, don't be so formal.

241
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I saw you defending the camp just now.

242
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You didn't even care about your life.

243
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Although the camp is expensive,

244
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
it's still an outsider.

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's still an outsider.

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The key is to protect yourself.

247
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Brother A'Chang is right.

248
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Besides,

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Gao Wan is not a good person.

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You'd better avoid her in the future.

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
In case you get into trouble.

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I can't stand her lying to a woman.

253
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
She's back to the camp.

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I can't just sit back and watch.

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Brother A'Chang cares about me.

256
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Every time I'm in danger,

257
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
you're always by my side.

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's normal.

259
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's normal.

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I have to go now.

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Brother A'Chang.

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yun Shu, you...

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Why are you here?

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I heard you're going to study abroad.

265
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
When will you come back?

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I hope next autumn.

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Two years.

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's windy and cold outside.

269
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Go back quickly.

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
When will you see me again?

271
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I will.

272
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The leaves are slowly falling.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can't count the number of times I miss you.

274
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If we can meet again,

275
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
when we can return,

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll send you a telegram.

277
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You know?

278
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll never forget you.

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Sometimes I miss you.

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I hope we can be together forever.

281
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I hope we can be together forever.

282
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm leaving.

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm leaving.

284
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Brother A'Chang.

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll wait for you to come back.

286
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll wait for you to come back.

287
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Please.

288
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
My wife.

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I always feel that Mr. Lu came back from studying abroad.

290
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He's been with you for many months.

291
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I've been the manager for two years.

292
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
How could he not change at all?

293
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Although we're close,

294
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
we still have a friendship.

295
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't mind taking the initiative to resolve the problem.

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But everyone wants a woman to be quiet and self-reliant.

297
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Men and women can't take the initiative.

298
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Men pursue what they love,

299
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
and then they are passed on by the family.

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Women are accused of being a hostage.

301
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
People always have to fight for what they like.

302
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If he doesn't want to,

303
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I can't force him to do it.

304
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll do my best.

305
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What?

306
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Mr. Su's body is with Gao Wan?

307
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

308
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Mr. Su is accused of corruption and corruption.

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
His goods should be used as evidence to give to the Dali Temple.

310
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But now it's in Gao Wan's hands.

311
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Could it be that Gao Zhi and the officials of the investigation

312
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
have been colluding with each other?

313
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Since I was a child,

314
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
my teacher taught me to take the world as my enemy.

315
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
A gentleman does what he does and does not do what he does.

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He is always innocent and never could be corrupted.

317
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How could I let him be framed and be in danger?

318
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'll be on my way to the capital soon.

319
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll help you then.

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not easy to talk about this.

321
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's not easy.

322
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Only if you want to get involved in the case,

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
you can have some possibilities.

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Lu Chang, you will definitely succeed this time.

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:10,420
Right, many merchants are planning to catch the

326
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You...

327
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yuan Wai,

328
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Mrs. Ming Shu has been against the capture of the blood.

329
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
She said that Lu Chang

330
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
needs to be caught on fire.

331
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But the situation is not waiting for people.

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Lu Chang will definitely be caught.

333
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I have to plan to capture the blood immediately.

334
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
When he becomes my son-in-law,

335
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I will protect him from the evil.

336
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Once Mrs. Ming Shu knows Yuan Wai's plan,

337
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm afraid she won't give up.

338
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't be afraid.

339
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm doing this for the two of them.

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
One day, they will understand me.

341
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Ming Shu is a child with a good opinion.

342
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'll keep it a secret for now.

343
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But if Lu Chang doesn't agree,

344
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
we have to have a plan.

345
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes.

346
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Madam, bad news.

347
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What's wrong?

348
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Mr. Lu is now the first choice for the capture of blood.

349
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
As expected,

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
from what I know about him,

351
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
even if he is caught,

352
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Wei Daxin won't marry him.

353
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What else?

354
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
They also said that

355
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Zhao and Jiang were going to...

356
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
They were going to capture him.

357
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Then...

358
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
How can we do that?

359
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You remember it.

360
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You know about the capture of blood.

361
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Don't let Ming Shu know about it.

362
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't worry.

363
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I've told her.

364
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
As long as...

365
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't hide it from me.

366
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll go and capture him.

367
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This...

368
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You...

369
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why did you agree?

370
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
If I don't agree,

371
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
the other house will use the means of the back house

372
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
to force Brother Chang to save the criminal.

373
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
How can I allow this to happen?

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
How dare they?

375
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Even if I go to heaven and earth,

376
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I have to capture Lu Chang.

377
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll go and capture him.

378
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We don't just want to send out the strongest team.

379
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We have to think of a strategy to fight.

380
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We have to put up a guard at the tea house and around the Lu family.

381
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yes.

382
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
We have to put up a guard.

383
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes.

384
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
We can't let him escape.

385
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Also,

386
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I know that Father has a backup plan.

387
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So I have to go first.

388
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I only marry Brother Chang.

389
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Father, don't be angry.

390
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Do you agree?

391
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Look.

392
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You...

393
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You said it.

394
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I dare not not agree.

395
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay.

396
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Since they've come,

397
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
will Brother Chang...

398
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Will he willingly marry me?

399
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Our Jian family helps him study.

400
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I owe him.

401
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Besides,

402
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
my daughter is so smart and beautiful.

403
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
She has no reason not to agree.

404
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Father, you're being ungrateful.

405
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
She is always independent.

406
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
She only sees our school to study.

407
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
When did she accept the Jian family's help?

408
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Luckily,

409
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll invite Zeng Yi tomorrow.

410
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'll be in person

411
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
to talk to Brother Chang about my feelings.

412
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's good.

413
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You're so considerate.

414
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Our Jian family is so sincere.

415
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't believe that Lu Chang

416
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
is so loyal.

417
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Where are you going, Father?

418
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll burn incense for your mother in the ancestral hall.

419
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Let her bless you in heaven.

420
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
She'll be blessed with good news.

421
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Father, I'll go with you.

422
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Let's go.

423
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Father, I want to bring some meat for Mother.

424
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Of course.

425
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're so handsome.

426
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Didn't we meet just now?

427
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Why did you ask me to come here?

428
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Today,

429
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I and a man

430
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:03,480
came to see Mr. Su's Yuzhu's

431
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,640
Come on.

432
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,120
Su Changhua,

433
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,480
you're a prisoner now.

434
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,840
And you pretend to be a cold-hearted man.

435
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,280
Who do you think you are?

436
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,360
Officer Jian,

437
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,360
we're not friends.

438
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,080
I'm sorry to trouble you.

439
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,080
What a careless man you are!

440
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,380
Yesterday my Jian family consected

441
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,600
the master in front of the money.

442
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,000
I paid the bachelor

443
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,020
while you

444
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,160
rejected my request.

445
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,000
You only care

446
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,040
about the benefit from the people.

447
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,840
Thankfully, God stalled

448
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,920
and took you実 вю.

449
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,880
You're here all the time.

450
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,080
I've always respected her.

451
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
But she's a master of the Five Cultivations.

452
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
She's like Gao Shicai.

453
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
It's so sad.

454
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
But you've been friends for so many years.

455
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
What if you get married tomorrow?

456
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Su Changhua

457
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,080
has been trying to steal the money from the disaster relief.

458
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
The evidence is clear.

459
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
According to the law of the Great An,

460
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
he's sentenced to death.

461
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
He'll be executed today.

462
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
He's going to be executed according to the law of the state.

463
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Master.

464
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
I won't let you down.

465
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
I'll only

466
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,080
confess my love to you.

467
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Master.

468
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
Look.

469
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
The four of them are out.

470
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
After the show,

471
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
you have to take many positions.

472
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
Find the way.

473
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,080
Once you find it,

474
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
you have to be gentle,

475
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
accurate and cruel.

476
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Do you understand?

477
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Yes.

478
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
Let's go.

479
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Every time you come to the Lu family,

480
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
you ask Ma Zheting to stay at the entrance.

481
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
But this time,

482
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
you brought many gifts.

483
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Why don't you bring some small gifts?

484
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Zeng Yi is a good girl.

485
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
When there are many people,

486
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,080
it's hard to seem to be aggressive.

487
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,080
That's why he's so rude.

488
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
You're so kind.

489
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,080
You're so kind.

490
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
I hope you know that.

491
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,080
We'll invite Zeng Yi to the mansion later.

492
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,080
With the filial piety of Chang,

493
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,080
he'll come even if he's not caught.

494
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
Master.

495
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
Master.

496
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
Master.

497
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Qiu Wei, release the net.

498
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Did you see us?

499
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
Did you see us?

500
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
We're out.

501
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
We're out.

502
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
Who are you?

503
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
We're out.

504
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
We're out.

505
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,080
We're out.

506
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Look.

507
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,080
Look.

508
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
These people are from Lu's family.

509
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Uncle Lu.

510
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
We're out.

511
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,080
Catch Lu Chang.

512
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Catch Lu Chang.

513
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Catch Lu Chang.

514
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Catch Lu Chang.

515
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,080
Hurry.

516
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
Catch him.

517
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
If you can't catch Lu Chang,

518
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
give me someone else.

519
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
Let's go.

520
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
Catch him.

521
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Catch him.

522
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Catch him.

523
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Catch him.

524
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Catch him.

525
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Let's go.

526
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
Let's go.

527
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
Let's go.

528
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Don't go.

529
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
We're out.

530
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
You're so rude.

531
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Thank you.

532
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Let's go.

533
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,080
Let's go.

534
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
If you can't find Lu Chang,

535
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
go over there.

536
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Let's go.

537
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Let's go.

538
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Let's go.

539
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Let's go.

540
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Catch him.

541
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Let's go.

542
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
Let's go.

543
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
No.

544
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Go.

545
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Don't you think about me?

546
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
I won't let you go.

547
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
I won't let you go.

548
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
Let me go.

549
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Let me go.

550
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080
Uncle, it's good that you're talking.

551
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
You guys...

552
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Let's go.

553
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Over there.

554
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Where is he?

555
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
He's over there.

556
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Catch him.

557
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
Lu Chang.

558
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
Where's Chen?

559
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
Catch him.

560
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
Let's go.

561
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Let's go.

562
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Catch him.

563
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Over there.

564
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
Hurry.

565
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Hurry.

566
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
Let's go.

567
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Catch him.

568
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Let's go.

569
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
Let's go.

570
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
Catch him.

571
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
Let's go.

572
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Let's go.

573
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
Let's go.

574
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,080
Over there.

575
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
Go.

576
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Hurry.

577
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
He's over there.

578
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Let's go.

579
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
Catch that guy who's trying to escape.

580
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
Hurry.

581
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
That's great.

582
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
Let's go.

583
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Let's go.

584
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
Let's go.

585
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
This way.

586
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
If you have a gun, shoot.

587
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Hurry and put the gun away.

588
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Put it away.

589
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Don't let them catch us.

590
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Hurry.

591
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
Put the gun away.

592
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
The people of Chengfu are too despicable.

593
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080
Put it away.

594
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
Good.

595
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,080
The people of Chengfu are too despicable.

596
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Good.

597
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Good.

598
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,080
Zeyu.

599
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
Please have some tea.

600
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
Why are you so polite?

601
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
You asked me to come here today.

602
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,080
What's the matter?

603
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
If I say it,

604
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,080
don't laugh at me.

605
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
How could I?

606
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
I want to marry Chang.

607
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
I know it's urgent.

608
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
But he's too strong.

609
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
I think since you've caught him,

610
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,080
I don't have to hide my feelings.

611
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
I watched you grow up.

612
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
If you were my daughter-in-law,

613
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
I would be happy.

614
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,080
But your Chang

615
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
is too stubborn.

616
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
Even if he has thousands of feelings,

617
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
he won't say anything

618
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
that will make you feel upset.

619
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,080
So I want to tell him in person.

620
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
I'm not reluctant,

621
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
but I don't want to miss it.

622
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
Is this the place?

623
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
Don't hide it.

624
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
It's here.

625
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
It's Mr. Lu's house.

626
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,080
It's really Mr. Lu.

627
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
We're all at the gate of the house.

628
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,080
I don't believe he won't come back.

629
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
That's right.

630
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
Come on.

631
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
Ming Shu invited me to see my mother.

632
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Remember to pick her up.

633
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
The Jian family is so entangled.

634
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,080
You'd better make it clear in person

635
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
in case of trouble.

636
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Did you see anyone?

637
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
No.

638
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
What about you?

639
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
No.

640
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
That's weird.

641
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
It's clearly this way.

642
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
Why didn't I see anyone?

643
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
Mr. Lu,

644
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
my wife told me

645
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
to catch you back to the mansion today.

646
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Sorry for the inconvenience.

647
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
Go.

648
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
Thank you.

649
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
I'll go.

650
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Go.

651
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
Go.

652
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,080
That's right.

653
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Look at him.

654
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
Mr. Lu.

655
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
Good.

656
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
Please.

657
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
No need to see me.

658
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
Mr. Lu,

659
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
we're a family now.

660
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
We can discuss about the marriage

661
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,080
while Linteng is here.

662
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
Jian Yun, you misunderstood me.

663
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
I came here

664
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
to pick up my mother

665
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
and to make it clear to the Jian family

666
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
that I don't plan to get married.

667
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,080
You...

668
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,080
If you really treat me as your elder,

669
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
then sit down

670
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
and have some tea with me.

671
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Then

672
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,080
I'll tell you about the Jian family's mind.

673
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Come on.

674
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
Please.

675
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
Good.

676
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Please.

677
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
Mr. Lu,

678
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
I'm really

679
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
in love with you.

680
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,080
I only have one daughter.

681
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
If you two

682
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
can get married,

683
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
then I can use all my assets

684
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,080
to help you.

685
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,080
Cheng Meng Tai,

686
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
I'm sorry for my misdeed.

687
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,080
But I'm not lucky enough

688
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
to let you down.

689
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,080
You mean

690
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
you can't leave any room for me?

691
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
You want to find your husband

692
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
and entrust your family.

693
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
But I'm not here

694
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
and I have something important to do.

695
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,080
I have to go my own way.

696
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
I'm full of sincerity.

697
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
But you keep refusing me.

698
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
In your eyes,

699
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
the Jian family is so ungrateful.

700
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
It's just different.

701
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,080
If you still don't understand,

702
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
you may remember

703
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,080
what Su Chang Hua did to you.

704
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
Let's not talk about it.

705
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,080
If you marry my daughter,

706
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,080
what will you do

707
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
if you don't?

708
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
Not only that,

709
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
you must care about it.

710
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,080
Yuan Wei has discussed with Zeng Yi for a few days.

711
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
You'll be a bride soon.

712
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,080
I haven't made up my mind.

713
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,080
Brother Cheng really agreed.

714
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
He said he was happy to talk to Childe Lu.

715
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
Everyone is drunk.

716
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
My wife knows his character.

717
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,080
She doesn't know he's being threatened.

718
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
She must know what you mean

719
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
and be willing to stay.

720
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,080
Otherwise,

721
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,080
I'm afraid Master Xian will come

722
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,080
and stop persuading him.

723
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,080
He is really like that.

724
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
It seems that he still remembers

725
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
his old friendship.

726
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
What's wrong with you?

727
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Stop talking to me.

728
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
I remember everything you told me.

729
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
I have to do something.

730
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Not when I'm busy,

731
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,080
you'll need to find someone

732
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
who knows this girl

733
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
and I like it.

734
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Think about it.

735
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Tell me,

736
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,080
did you never

737
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,980
say you loved him?

738
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,980
You're crying so ugly.

739
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
If your mother sees you like this,

740
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
how can she be at ease?

741
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
Can mother see me?

742
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Then I won't cry anymore.

743
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:25,980
Really?

744
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
I didn't do it on purpose.

745
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
Look at you.

746
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,980
This shape looks like the Qingzhu of the Qing Dynasty.

747
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,980
Do you like Qingzhu?

748
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,160
I once went to the

749
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,980
Haoli and Teng Yu Road to the ice mountain with Song Bai.

750
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Mr. Su made me look like Qingzhu.

751
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,980
I'm not afraid of wind and rain.

752
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,980
I'm not afraid of snow.

753
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,980
Then I'll sew the clothes for you in Qingzhu.

754
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,980
Okay.

755
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,980
My wife,

756
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,980
Yuan Wanyu asked someone to find someone.

757
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,980
Today is the auspicious day.

758
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,980
You can go to the bridal chamber first.

759
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,980
You can go to the bridal chamber first.

760
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,980
You can go to the bridal chamber first.

761
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,980
They really said that?

762
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,980
Did they say that when they got married?

763
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
They said it was a custom.

764
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
There's no problem.

765
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
I see.

766
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
I still feel strange.

767
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
I still feel strange.

768
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,980
I still feel strange.

769
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,980
Go.

770
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,980
Go, my wife.

771
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Haochuan,

772
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,980
what's wrong with you?

773
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,980
Your Jian family is really good.

774
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,980
You can even do things like killing the demon.

775
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
You can even do things like killing the demon.

776
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
If I don't wake up in time,

777
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,980
will I be forced to get married?

778
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,980
The demon?

779
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,980
The demon?

780
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
The demon?

781
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,980
The demon?

782
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
The demon?

783
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
The demon?

784
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,980
The demon?

785
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
The demon?

786
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
The demon?

787
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,980
The demon?

788
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,980
I won't let them do that.

789
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
Brother Haochuan,

790
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,980
I'm trying to show my sincerity.

791
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,980
I'm trying to show my sincerity.

792
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,980
I'm trying to show my sincerity.

793
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,980
I'm not forcing you.

794
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,980
If I don't know about the demon,

795
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
If I don't know about the demon,

796
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,980
do you believe it?

797
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
I don't want to get married.

798
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,980
What's the point of believing it?

799
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,980
We've known each other since childhood.

800
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,980
We've known each other since childhood.

801
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,980
But we're so close.

802
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
You said you liked Qingzhu.

803
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,980
I'll sew Qingzhu on your clothes.

804
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
I'll sew Qingzhu on your clothes.

805
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,980
Do you really think I'm willing to do that?

806
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,980
Do you really think I'm willing to do that?

807
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,980
When my mother took me to the Jiangling,

808
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,980
it was the other side who helped me.

809
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,980
That's how we got our feet in Jiangling.

810
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
I won't forget

811
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,980
this favor.

812
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,980
I'll repay you one day.

813
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,980
But not in this way.

814
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,980
I'm not a fairy.

815
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,980
But I've never noticed

816
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
your feelings for me.

817
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
I'm grateful for your kindness.

818
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
But you're a Jiao Gui.

819
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
I've been a man of my word since I was a child.

820
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
I know how much I'm worth.

821
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
I'm afraid I'm not worthy of you.

822
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
Besides, I'm a scholar.

823
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,980
I don't know what's the way.

824
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
I don't want to drag others down.

825
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,980
I'm afraid I've let you down.

826
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,980
It doesn't matter what these things are.

827
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,980
I just want to know

828
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
if you have any feelings for me.

829
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
You've disappointed me.

830
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,980
Besides, there are many people

831
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,980
who are sponsored by the Academy.

832
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
It's not difficult to find

833
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,980
a few young talents

834
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
to help you.

835
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,980
Why are you so obsessed with me?

836
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,980
I'm just a scholar.

837
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,980
I'm a man of my word.

838
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,980
I'm a saint.

839
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,980
But those scholars

840
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,980
are no longer worth it.

841
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
You really miss me.

842
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
I just don't want you

843
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
to waste your time on me.

844
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
You're the one who's too far away.

845
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
You should be with someone better.

846
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Besides, outside the Academy,

847
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,980
you're a teacher.

848
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,980
How can I ignore the gratitude

849
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,980
and get married to the Jian family?

850
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,980
I thought

851
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,980
I still remembered the love of my second master.

852
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,980
It turns out that I'm over-reacting.

853
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,980
Today,

854
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,980
I did make a mistake

855
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,980
and I'm sorry.

856
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
I have nothing to say.

857
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,980
I'm willing to apologize to you.

858
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,980
I also admit that my second brother

859
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,980
is hard-working

860
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,980
but afraid of being bullied.

861
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
You're not only a man of your heart,

862
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,980
but also a man of your mind.

863
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
Since you came back from the snow,

864
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,980
you've been avoiding me.

865
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
How can I not know?

866
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
I thought

867
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,980
you just didn't understand me.

868
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,980
When the day comes,

869
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,980
you'll see my sincerity.

870
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,980
We've known each other for so many years.

871
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,980
If you're just being loyal,

872
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,980
how can you misunderstand me?

873
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,980
It seems that you're really mean to me.

874
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,980
You're my daughter.

875
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,980
You're also a businessman.

876
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,980
No matter in the past or now,

877
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,980
I'm not good enough for you.

878
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,980
I have no intention of betraying you.

879
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,980
I understand.

880
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
If that's the case,

881
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
then let's call it a day.

882
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,980
I'm sorry.

883
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,980
I'm sorry.

884
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
I'm sorry.

885
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,980
This Hejing Wine

886
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,980
was originally meant to be shared

887
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,980
as the only one.

888
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,980
It'll never be separated.

889
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,980
Let it be a farewell drink.

890
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,980
Don't look away from the distant.

891
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
Even if we meet again,

892
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,980
I hope you'll be happy

893
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,980
and live a long life.

894
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,980
I hope you'll live a long life

895
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,980
and live a long life.

896
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,980
I also wish that

897
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,980
you'll marry her soon

898
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,980
and have a happy marriage.

899
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,980
There's a long way to go.

900
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:45,980
Don't miss the chance to spend time with her.

901
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,980
Once you get married,

902
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,980
the flowers will bloom in the world.

903
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,980
Be honest and go with the wind.

904
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,980
You go.

905
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,980
I'll go.

906
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,980
I'll go.

907
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,980
I'll go.

908
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,980
I'll go.

909
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,980
I'll go.

910
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,980
I'll go.

911
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,980
I'll go.

912
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,980
I'll go.

913
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,980
I'll go.

914
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,980
I'll go.

915
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,980
I'll go.

916
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,980
I'll go.

917
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,980
I'll go.

918
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,980
I'll go.

919
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,980
I'll go.

920
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
I'll go.

921
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,980
I'll go.

922
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,980
I'll go.

923
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,980
I'll go.

924
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,980
I'll go.

925
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,980
I'll go.

926
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,980
I'll go.

927
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
I'll go.

928
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
I'll go.

929
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,980
I'll go.

930
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,980
I'll go.

931
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,980
I'll go.

932
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,980
I'll be waiting for you

933
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,980
If the scenery is clear, can I return to the past?

934
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:18,980
A kind of love that I miss, but I'm lost in my heart

935
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:30,980
Counting the long night, I can't count the time I missed you

936
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,980
If the sea is long, I'm willing to return to the past

937
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:44,980
I can't forget the time I missed you

938
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,980
I'm willing to forget the time we met

939
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:54,980
The dream of the sea is like a dream
