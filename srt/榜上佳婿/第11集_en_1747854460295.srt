1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
What good it is to be so unfair!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,180
The

3
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,180
The

00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,180
The

5
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,180
The

6
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,180
The

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,180
The

8
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,180
The

9
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,180
The

10
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,180
The

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,180
The

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,180
The

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,180
The

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,180
The

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,180
The

16
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,180
The

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,180
The

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,180
The

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,120
The

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,120
The

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,920
The

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,360
The

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,360
The

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
The

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,360
The

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,360
The

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,360
The

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,360
The

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,360
The Legend of Chusen

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Episode 18

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
That's the treasure of the main hall.

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Put it here.

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Okay.

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Put it in a place where it's obvious.

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,360
I can go around it later.

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
This one.

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Put it there.

38
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
This one.

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Madam Ming Shu.

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Mr. Song.

41
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Mr. Song.

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Today, the Flower Pavilion is opening.

43
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,360
I found a feng shui stone.

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
Look, where should I put it?

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,360
This is made by Mr. Cui Li.

46
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
It's not easy to get it.

47
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Thank you, Mr. Song.

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Ming Shu.

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Brother.

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
I brought you a feng shui stone.

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
Look, where should I put it?

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Sister.

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
This is made by Mr. Cui Li.

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
It's very famous.

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Mr. Cui.

56
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
It's very famous.

57
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
So many works.

58
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,360
I wonder where Brother Lu got it from.

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Mr. Cui gave it to me.

60
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Didn't you help him solve the problems of fashion?

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Did he give it to you?

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,360
So Brother Lu doesn't know about the skill equipment.

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
I admire him.

64
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,360
But how should I put these two?

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Oh.

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
How about putting them together?

67
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Two feng shui stones together.

68
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
It's not a good idea.

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
This is made by Mr. Tai.

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
It's the spirit stone.

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
It's a business.

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
It's rare to see Mr. Song's good intentions.

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
But Ming Shu is a duke.

74
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,360
He is familiar with the world.

75
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
He needs to be exquisite.

76
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
So this is a perfect work.

77
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
It's more suitable.

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
You have such a good idea.

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
I think Ming Shu is the most important.

80
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
I've sent it out.

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
I'll leave it to Ming Shu.

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Mr. Song is kind.

83
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
In my opinion,

84
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
I'll put this one in the shop.

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
As for this one,

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
I'll put it in my room.

87
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Yes.

88
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
It's good.

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
It's beautiful.

90
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Come on.

91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Let me do it.

92
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Is this the real jade stone of the duke?

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
My father is a duke.

94
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
I've never heard of it.

95
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Let you shine.

96
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Look.

97
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
It's so lively.

98
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
Mom.

99
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Smile.

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
No.

101
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Everyone.

102
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Our Flower Pavilion

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
is a shop that sells

104
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
women's things.

105
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
At the same time,

106
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
it's also a women's club.

107
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
It's a place

108
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
where women can gather

109
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
and exchange their feelings.

110
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Women can have a few friends

111
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
outside their homes.

112
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Our Flower Pavilion,

113
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
no matter where your status is,

114
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
all women can be friends.

115
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
They can share their life

116
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,360
and have fun when they are in trouble.

117
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
Good.

118
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Good.

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Come on.

120
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Let's go inside.

121
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Come on.

122
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Come on.

123
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Come on.

124
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Come on.

125
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Come on.

126
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Come on.

127
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Come on.

128
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Come on.

129
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Come on.

130
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Come on.

131
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Come on.

132
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Come on.

133
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Come on.

134
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Come on.

135
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Sisters.

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Our shop's jewelry

137
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
is not only new and new.

138
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
It's also a lot of different kinds.

139
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
The most unique thing is

140
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
that you can design your own jewelry

141
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,360
according to your unique temperament.

142
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
You can fully participate in

143
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,360
the design and production of your own jewelry.

144
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
It's like having a unique star

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
that belongs to you.

146
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,360
It's called Dian Xing Chen.

147
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Dian Xing Chen.

148
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Good.

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Good.

150
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Good.

151
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Good.

152
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
If you are interested in jewelry,

153
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
you can come with me.

154
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Hurry up.

155
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
If you are interested in jewelry,

156
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
you can come with me.

157
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
What's going on?

158
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
What's going on?

159
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
What's going on?

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
What's going on?

161
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Everyone.

162
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
The embroidery section of Xiu Xing He

163
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
is the same as the one in my shop.

164
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
There are many kinds of jewelry.

165
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
There are many kinds of jewelry.

166
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
There are many kinds of jewelry.

167
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
If you are interested,

168
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
you can come in and have a look.

169
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Okay.

170
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
I like it.

171
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
I like it.

172
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Tang Yi Ge not only has tea seats and elegant rooms,

173
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
but also a children's playground.

174
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,360
The shop also takes care of children.

175
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
It's just to provide you with a place to relax

176
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
when you buy things.

177
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
It's just to provide you with a place to relax when you buy things.

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
That's good.

179
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
So I can buy things

180
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
with my children.

181
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Yes.

182
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
You can go around the shop.

183
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
When you are tired,

184
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
you can come here to have some tea and snacks.

185
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
Come on.

186
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Come on.

187
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Come on.

188
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Look over there.

189
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Look at the embroidery.

190
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Look at the embroidery.

191
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
It's really beautiful.

192
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
It's really beautiful.

193
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
It's really beautiful.

194
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Your eyes are really unique.

195
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
This is called Xiang Xiu.

196
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
The embroidery is made by hand.

197
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
It's unique.

198
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Look.

199
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Does this butterfly sound like a horse?

200
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
It's like a horse is about to fly out.

201
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Look.

202
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Zeng Yi is so good.

203
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
In terms of female workers,

204
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
my mother is not afraid of those

205
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
rich people in the capital.

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I'll go to the second floor.

207
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
This lady

208
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
needs to explain the meaning of the dress for you.

209
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
This dress is so beautiful.

210
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Yes.

211
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
She can design it for herself.

212
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
I like it too.

213
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm not at ease with my fate.

214
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
I'm in a hurry.

215
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
This is the embroidery pattern

216
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
that you made.

217
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Embroidery?

218
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Mr. Song.

219
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Uncle Ming.

220
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
New year's eve.

221
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
I need your help.

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Uncle Ming asked me to try this tea.

223
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
It tastes really good.

224
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Try it.

225
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Do you like Uncle Ming?

226
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
My sister.

227
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Do you have a ghost in your heart?

228
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm telling you.

229
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
The story of the new horse is very familiar.

230
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
But the man who made you fall in love

231
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
is very affectionate to you.

232
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
It's a play.

233
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Don't take it seriously.

234
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Even if it's a play,

235
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
the feelings in the play are not fake.

236
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
It's all fake.

237
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Don't mention it again.

238
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Uncle Ming.

239
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Come up and help me.

240
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
I'm almost out of time.

241
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Coming.

242
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Coming.

243
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
This is so beautiful.

244
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
I'm telling you.

245
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
The one I bought is very beautiful.

246
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
The boss said it was a very beautiful flower.

247
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
It's so beautiful.

248
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
It's so beautiful.

249
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
It's so beautiful.

250
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
What are you going to pick today?

251
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Uncle Jianming really came to the capital.

252
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
It's all that road.

253
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
He used a golden hairpin to trick us.

254
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
He even made his sister blind.

255
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
It's really hateful.

256
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
It's hateful.

257
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
What should we do?

258
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Cut off the roots.

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Peach Blossom Pavilion's plum soup.

260
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Try it.

261
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Thank you, brother.

262
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Look at this.

263
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
It's so pretty.

264
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Lady Lu.

265
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
What do you think about this hairpin?

266
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Lady, I...

267
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Take a rest. I'll go.

268
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
This hairpin is made of the hair of a bird.

269
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
It's made of the Wings of the Thunder.

270
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
The two birds are very strong.

271
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,360
The foot of the bird is the most suitable for you,

272
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,360
a gorgeous and elegant woman like you.

273
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
The young master said it so well.

274
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
I have no reason not to buy it.

275
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Mr. Song, you're good.

276
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
I was introducing you just now.

277
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
I learned a new skill.

278
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
I made a mistake.

279
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Mr. Song,

280
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
help me look at this bracelet.

281
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Mr. Song,

282
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
help me look at this chain.

283
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Look at this.

284
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Look at this.

285
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
She is talented,

286
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
noble, but weak.

287
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Most importantly,

288
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,360
she is so beautiful.

289
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
How can she be so perfect?

290
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
You two have good taste.

291
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Girl,

292
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
take a look at this.

293
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
You said it was your brother.

294
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Of course my brother is good.

295
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Of course my brother is good.

296
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,360
The person my brother values is also extraordinary.

297
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
I'll go back to work.

298
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
I always feel that Ming Shu is blocking me.

299
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Mr. Song even sacrificed his appearance.

300
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
You are not a good speaker.

301
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Come on.

302
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Where is Liu Yuan Ying?

303
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Slow down.

304
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Don't worry.

305
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Slow down.

306
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
When can we go to buy things?

307
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Mom, play with me.

308
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Ladies,

309
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
you can go shopping first.

310
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
I'll take care of them.

311
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Great.

312
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Be good.

313
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Be good and wait for me.

314
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Thank you.

315
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
Mom.

316
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Mom.

317
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
I don't want to go shopping.

318
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Let mom go shopping first.

319
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
I'll play with you.

320
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
Okay?

321
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Mom, where are you going?

322
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Mom.

323
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
I'll play with you.

324
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Okay?

325
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Mom.

326
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Okay.

327
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
I'll play with you.

328
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Okay?

329
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
No.

330
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
No.

331
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Mom.

332
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Mom.

333
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
You go back.

334
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Mom, I'm leaving.

335
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Now you have a business.

336
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
I'll take this.

337
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
I'll go to pay the bill.

338
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Look at my hands.

339
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
I think these two are suitable for you.

340
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
No.

341
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Mom.

342
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Don't cry.

343
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
I'll play with you.

344
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Okay?

345
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Madam, you go first.

346
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
I'll go first.

347
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Okay.

348
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Dear guest.

349
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
What can I do for you?

350
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
I want to customize a dress.

351
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
I don't know if you're willing to lend me this.

352
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
I'll use it up.

353
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Let me go up and draw.

354
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Let's do this first.

355
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Watch carefully.

356
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
You're so great.

357
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
How about this?

358
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Whoever unlocks a button,

359
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
will be rewarded with a piece of cake.

360
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Okay?

361
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
Okay.

362
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
You caught a little fat guy.

363
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
You can't eat now.

364
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
You can eat after playing.

365
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
It's him again.

366
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
Who are you?

367
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
I'm here.

368
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Who is there?

369
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,360
There is always something wrong.

370
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Luckily, your shoulder

371
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,360
is with me.

372
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Don't go.

373
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Don't go.

374
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Don't go.

375
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
I'm dreaming again.

376
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Baby.

377
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
He hasgem России on his meticulous work.

378
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Mr. Lu,

379
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Ni Man Man.

380
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,760
Embrace tonight's revolution

381
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,740
There's only one of flowers remaining

382
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,780
The wind blows through my dissipation

383
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,100
A

384
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,720
Yes.

385
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,340
It's probably him.

386
00:16:51,360 --> 00:17:00,620
I wonder

387
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:07,620
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the water

388
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:14,620
I'm afraid that I'll have to fly to the other side of the world

389
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,620
I'm afraid that the night will be too long

390
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,620
I'm afraid that I'll be crying

391
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:29,620
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the water

392
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,620
Ming Shu

393
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,620
Ming Shu, are you alright?

394
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,620
How come I didn't think it was you?

395
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,620
Ming Shu

396
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,620
So the person I dreamed of was Song Qingzhao

397
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,620
I got it wrong

398
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
That's great

399
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,620
Brother Lu

400
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,620
You said you liked pearls

401
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,620
I'll put pearls on your clothes

402
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,620
Do you really want to do it?

403
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,620
Brother Lu, is there anything wrong?

404
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,620
Sorry

405
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
Ming Shu

406
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
Are you alright?

407
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
Are you feeling unwell?

408
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
No, no

409
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,620
Then come out quickly

410
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,620
There are guests outside, you can't be rude

411
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
I'll be there in a minute

412
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
Hurry up

413
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
Okay

414
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,620
Come on, kids

415
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,620
Eat while it's hot

416
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,620
Thank you, Zeng Yi

417
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
Sit down

418
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
Good morning, Zeng Yi

419
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
Good morning

420
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,620
Good morning, Mr. Song

421
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Good morning, Brother Yun

422
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,620
Good morning

423
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,620
Brother Song, I'm a rough guy, don't be polite to me

424
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
Sit down, sit down

425
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
Eat

426
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,620
Zeng Yi's steamed buns are delicious

427
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,620
Ming Shu

428
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,620
Let's eat, Ming Shu

429
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,620
Coming, mom

430
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
Brother Yun

431
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,620
Can you switch places with me?

432
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,620
I want to sit next to Qingzhao

433
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,620
Brother Yun

434
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,620
Can you switch places with me?

435
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,620
I want to sit next to Qingzhao

436
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,620
What did you just call me?

437
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,620
We've known each other for a long time

438
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,620
And you still call me young master

439
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,620
You're so familiar

440
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,620
Ming Shu

441
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,620
What's wrong with your throat?

442
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,620
Are you sick?

443
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,620
Why do you talk like a kitten?

444
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,620
Okay

445
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,620
Then I'll call you Ming Shu in the future

446
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,620
What?

447
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,620
What's going on?

448
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,620
Brother Song came here early in the morning

449
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,620
Is there anything urgent?

450
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,620
Brother Lu

451
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,620
In a few days, it will be the three-year-old wine party in Beijing

452
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,620
The guests who are about to participate in the Spring Festival will go together

453
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,620
They will discuss the poem together

454
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,620
It's a good start for the gold medal

455
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,620
There will be many people from Beijing who will go to watch

456
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,620
With your talent

457
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,620
You can be the best in the wine party

458
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
Don't miss it

459
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,620
It sounds like a feast

460
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,620
I don't like the heat since I was a kid

461
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,620
I don't care

462
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,620
Qingzhao

463
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,620
I'm very interested

464
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,620
Take me with you

465
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,620
Of course

466
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
I like the most

467
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,620
You have to take me

468
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,620
If you don't take me, how can I go?

469
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,620
Go

470
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,620
Go

471
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,620
Brother

472
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,620
The lady said

473
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,620
The gold medal of the gold shop

474
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,620
Find a big gold medal

475
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,620
Is this a clue?

476
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,620
I've checked this thing

477
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,620
It's no use

478
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,620
Then the gold medal may still be a clue

479
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,620
Ming Shu

480
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,620
Just listen to your brother

481
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,620
I'm done

482
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,620
You eat slowly

483
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
What's wrong with brother?

484
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,620
That lady has passed away

485
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,620
Mr. Song is gone

486
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,620
Ok

487
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,620
You don't like Ming Shu being with Mr. Song

488
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,620
I don't like him

489
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,620
How do you know I don't like it?

490
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,620
You

491
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,620
Put the word don't like

492
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,620
On your face

493
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,620
According to the Song family

494
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,620
If it's about the marriage

495
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
Must check the Lu family

496
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,620
The identity of the Jieshi Ming Shu can't be hidden

497
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,620
Just because of this

498
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,620
Or because you can't let go

499
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,620
I just remind you

500
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
You were the sister of Ming Shu

501
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,620
It's your own decision

502
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,620
To better protect her

503
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,620
If you let Ming Shu know

504
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,620
You have an unworthy love for her

505
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,620
Since you doubt your identity

506
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,620
Have you thought about how to explain?

507
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,620
Ming Shu's family is broken

508
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,620
Is a poor child

509
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
You also saw

510
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
Now she is very happy

511
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,620
Realized new friends

512
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,620
Have what you like to do

513
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,620
Mother just hopes

514
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,620
No matter what you decide

515
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,620
Don't hurt her

516
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,620
Ok

517
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,620
Mother assured

518
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
I understand what to do

519
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,620
Ming Shu's sister

520
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,620
What?

521
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,620
Isn't this normal?

522
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,620
What happened in front of Song Qin Zhang?

523
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,620
I seem to like her

524
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,620
How is it possible?

525
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,620
You put her in a twist

526
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,620
She doesn't look like you

527
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,620
Like a person

528
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,620
I don't like

529
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,620
I don't like her

530
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,620
I don't like her

531
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,620
I don't like her

532
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,620
I don't like her

533
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,620
I don't like her

534
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,620
I don't like her

535
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,620
I don't like her

536
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,620
I don't like her

537
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,620
I don't like her

538
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
Like a person can't be yourself

539
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,620
What is like?

540
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,620
Come come come

541
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,620
I tell you

542
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,620
You

543
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
Be sure to keep your heart

544
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,620
At least wait for your brother

545
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
After you become a heavyweight

546
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,620
At that time you are a family

547
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,620
You just have the capital of the Tang Hunlun family

548
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,620
You listen to that brother

549
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,620
That brother won't pit you

550
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
You have a point

551
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,620
Like a person

552
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
Should be generous and free

553
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Sister Ming

554
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
The last sentence is the point

555
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,620
Not

556
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,620
Maybe forget the past

557
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,620
You will have long-lasting happiness

558
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,620
Give you this hope

559
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,620
I hope you can forget all the pain and hatred

560
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,620
Forever

561
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,620
Again

562
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,620
You are a father and a family

563
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,620
How can you think about the love of a man and a woman?

564
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,620
How can a man be controlled by love?

565
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,620
I believe you can cut off the love thread

566
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,620
Do what you should do

567
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
Is it

568
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,620
OK

569
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,620
So be it

570
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
Eat

571
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,620
Take a good look at the house

572
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,620
Take a good look at the house

573
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
The water is so fragrant

574
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,620
Brother An did not study in the yard

575
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,620
Not up yet

576
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,620
Brother

577
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,620
Why are you still not up

578
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,620
I went back to the academy

579
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,620
Take care of yourself and mother

580
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,620
The inside of the box is a house-worn dress

581
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,620
You keep it well

582
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,620
So beautiful box

583
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,620
This is Wang Youhua

584
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,620
So familiar

585
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,620
Brothers have a hard time

586
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,620
There is a period of time

587
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,620
Drink

588
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
This is what Lu Jiyan asked

589
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,620
We will take care of his family

590
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,620
Thank you

591
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,620
The official's inspection is urgent

592
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,620
Don't be panic

593
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,620
Yes, big brother

594
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,620
Brother, let me talk to you

595
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,620
it is good

596
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,620
Brother

597
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,620
Brother, drink some tea

598
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,620
Thank you

599
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,620
I said

600
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,620
Brother seems to be getting more and more

601
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,620
I can't let you go

602
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Food and men and women

603
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,620
People know that the big jade has smoke

604
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,620
The dead king is poor

605
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,620
People know that the big thing has smoke

606
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,620
So want to be a bad person

607
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,620
The heart knows the big end

608
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,620
People hide their hearts

609
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,620
Can't take it

610
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,620
The beauty is in their hearts

611
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,620
Don't see their color

612
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,620
Want to be a poor person

613
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,620
What is the snake in the snake

614
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,620
I have a ancestral pen and a chess piece

615
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,620
I have a ancestral pen and a chess piece

616
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,620
The essence of the game

617
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,620
There is a road

618
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,620
The moon is falling

619
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,620
So diligent

620
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,620
In the future, it will be a big event

621
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,620
The moon is falling

622
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,620
The earth is flat

623
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,620
Jumping over the mountain

624
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,620
Don't get tired

625
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,620
Don't worry

626
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,620
You'll never fall asleep

627
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,620
I'm pours

628
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,020
The re Golden

629
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,620
to marry me.

630
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,500
But I still hope

631
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,900
you can be with a normal girl

632
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,900
and be with my husband.

633
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,020
Mother, don't worry.

634
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,620
I will be happy.

635
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,500
But you have to understand

636
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,820
marriage is different from ordinary marriage.

637
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,620
It's hard to have a promise and a fear.

638
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,500
I can't be with you

639
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,740
and take care of you in the future.

640
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,380
You have to take care of yourself.

641
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,940
Don't make any trouble.

642
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,740
Don't back down.

643
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,540
You can take care of yourself

644
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,540
for all the reasons.

645
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,500
I will remember

646
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,820
your teachings.

647
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,300
All right.

648
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,860
It's time.

649
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,900
Baker.

650
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,700
Here you go.

651
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,980
Take care of yourself.

652
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,500
Don't miss me.

653
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,660
Father,

654
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,300
I'll let you remember this.

655
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,460
In the future,

656
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,820
no matter where you are,

657
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,940
you must

658
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,740
be strong and brave.

659
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,060
Don't worry.

660
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,140
I'll always

661
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,620
follow you

662
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,500
always.

663
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,300
I will do to do my best.

664
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,140
Lift your shoulders.

665
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,100
Be by my side.

666
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,260
Shine brightly.

667
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,740
Your Highness, it seems that King Rui is here.

668
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,860
Hurry up. Sit down.

669
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,660
Hurry up.

670
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,580
Emperor Xun only gets to sleep at Såz quite late.

671
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,860
Probably he's the guest of the g teeth Sun Takashi.

672
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,580
The King is in the study.

673
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,900
Let me go up and have a look.

674
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,620
The lights in the study of King Rui are still on for the night?

675
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,320
Your Highness,

676
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,020
is he not coming?

677
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,580
It's the wedding night.

678
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,340
I'll wait for a while.

679
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,700
If he doesn't come,

680
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,740
I'll go and invite him.

681
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,260
You want to invite him in person?

682
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,460
Do you think there's no

683
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:17,500
palace

684
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,020
to invite him in person?

685
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:27,980
Your Majesty.

686
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,780
It's about time.

687
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,820
It's time to go to the bridal chamber.

688
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,820
The marriage ceremony

689
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,500
caused a lot of trouble before.

690
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,260
I didn't plan to forget it.

691
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,020
Let's just forget it.

692
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,740
If you don't go to the bridal chamber,

693
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,300
it's hard to explain to Her Highness.

694
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,660
Well.

695
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,740
You're a nag.

696
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,260
I...

697
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,860
He's coming. He's coming.

698
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,260
He's really coming this time.

699
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,260
Really?

700
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:21,900
Yes.

701
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,820
My lady.

702
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,700
Princess Consort.

703
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,460
Hurry up.

704
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,420
Yes.

705
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:25,940
Hurry up.

706
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,500
Your clothes. Your clothes.

707
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,500
Why am I still a little nervous

708
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,300
when I see him?

709
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,540
How about drinking a cup of wine

710
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,300
and pretending to be a man?

711
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,820
Get it for me.

712
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,900
Hurry up.

713
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,700
Okay.

714
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,580
I'll be right there.

715
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,380
Come on.

716
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,420
The king of Rui is here.

717
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,660
King of Rui.

718
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,860
King of Rui.

719
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,620
King of Rui.

720
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,860
Are you nervous?

721
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,100
Please make another round.

722
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,340
Your Highness.

723
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,100
The wine is for the couple to share.

724
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,340
It seems that you can't wait for me.

725
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,180
You should drink it yourself.

726
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,420
Fine.

727
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,380
Since you don't want to be polite,

728
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,460
I don't need to be polite.

729
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,540
Since you say so,

730
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,300
I'll do as you say.

731
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,380
It's already midnight.

732
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,620
Why don't you take the chance to make a good arrangement

733
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,780
and have a good rest?

734
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,660
We have reached a consensus

735
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,300
before we get married.

736
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,820
Marriage has nothing to do with emotions.

737
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,940
I just came here

738
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,500
to do something.

739
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,460
Tonight,

740
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,500
I'll spend the night here.

741
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,100
Your Highness.

742
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:45,980
Please.

743
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,220
Really?

744
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,700
Alright.

745
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,540
I'm fine.

746
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,540
I'll take your advice and

747
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,460
both Misslaub and I

748
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,700
will arrange a wedding.

749
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,540
The King said that I will keep my words in mind

750
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,660
that words are hard to follow.

751
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,060
I hoped you would be generous and understanding.

752
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,140
Of course.

753
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,340
I just follow his order.

754
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,540
One, two, three.

755
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,300
I'll go to sleep now.

756
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,220
Remember to blow out the candles.

757
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,500
Got it.

758
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,980
I was so cold to him,

759
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,280
how could he fall for me?

760
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,020
It's quite hiding.

761
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:24,540
If the scenery is clear, can I return to the wind?

762
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:30,540
A kind of love that is left alone, and lost in the heart

763
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:42,540
Counting the long night, I can't count the time I miss you

764
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:50,540
If the sea is full of wishes, can I return to the wind?

765
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:57,540
The more I look, the more I regret

766
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:08,540
I'm willing to forget the past, but I still dream like a dream
