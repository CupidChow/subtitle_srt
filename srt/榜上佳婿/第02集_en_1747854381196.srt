1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
Got it...

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,760
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,760
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Episode 16

5
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Father!

6
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Father!

7
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,760
Father, you did this for my own good!

8
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,760
You clearly are a man of your word,

9
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,760
and you want to get involved with the official.

10
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
It's all for your own interests.

11
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,760
Forget it,

12
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,760
how can you do such a thing?

13
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,760
Lu Chang is so stubborn.

14
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,760
I gave him my family business,

15
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
but he doesn't care, right?

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,760
Why should he?

17
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,760
What's wrong with me?

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
As long as you like him,

19
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
I promise to let him marry you.

20
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Father!

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
My sister, Ming Shu,

22
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
doesn't have to be so arrogant

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
and force others to marry her.

24
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
If you insist on this,

25
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
I might as well not marry her for the rest of my life.

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Don't talk nonsense!

27
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Ming Shu, don't be angry.

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Your father also cares about you.

29
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Your aunt is right.

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
As long as you like her,

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
I will definitely get you married.

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
This is not good.

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
I'll change another move.

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Father,

35
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
don't make any more trouble, okay?

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Don't move!

37
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Don't move!

38
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Ming Shu!

39
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Father!

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Come on.

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
Come on, let's eat.

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Let's eat.

43
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Let's eat.

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
About Zhuo Xu,

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Ming Shu told me that

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,760
he truly loves you.

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
I thought you were open-minded

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
and agreed to this marriage.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,760
But I didn't expect that

50
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
you would turn against me

51
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
and leave no room for me.

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
You missed a good marriage.

53
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,760
I'm afraid you'll regret it in the future.

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
It's already complicated to be a teacher.

55
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
I'm not interested in men and women.

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
Mother, don't say anything.

57
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
Let's eat.

58
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
Drink the medicine.

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
I'll do it myself.

60
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Father, you blame me for being unwise.

61
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
You're mad at me.

62
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
I won't be mad at you.

63
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
It's because of you and Lu Chang.

64
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
I know you're sad.

65
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
I feel sorry for you.

66
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Don't worry, father.

67
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
I've tried my best.

68
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
I have no regrets.

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
I've let go of my daughter.

70
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Okay.

71
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
With my daughter's talent,

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
I'll find a man

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
who's a thousand times better

74
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
than Lu Chang in the future.

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Okay, okay.

76
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
What are you hiding from me again?

77
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
Guess.

78
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Look.

79
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
This...

80
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
I found someone to make this.

81
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
It's made by you

82
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
with your new design.

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
Put it on.

84
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Father loves me.

85
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
I'll put it on for you.

86
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
You made it.

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Do you like it?

88
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Yes.

89
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Thank you, father.

90
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
As long as you like it.

91
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
Jin Yu.

92
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
You've been taking care of me for a long time.

93
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
You should go to rest.

94
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
Okay, I'll come to see you later.

95
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
I'm leaving.

96
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
See you.

97
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
Go, go.

98
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Madam.

99
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
The butler said you often go out these days.

100
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Is there anything new to go?

101
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,760
It's just a prayer for your parents.

102
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
I still need to take care of the outside world.

103
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
I won't see you off.

104
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Thank you, Madam.

105
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Give birth.

106
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Yes.

107
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Mother.

108
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
I'm here.

109
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
I'm here.

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
I'm here.

111
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
I'm here.

112
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
I'm here.

113
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm here.

114
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Madam.

115
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Nanny Ying said

116
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
she found clues about the whereabouts of Zhou Yi Niang.

117
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Let her keep an eye on it.

118
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
Tell me if anything happens.

119
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Okay.

120
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Madam still suspects Zhou Yi Niang and others.

121
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
She's really suspicious.

122
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
I can't just ignore it.

123
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,760
This must be handled before father knows.

124
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Mother.

125
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Mother.

126
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Can't we leave after the New Year?

127
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
The New Year is in March.

128
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
It's easier to settle down if we go there before the New Year.

129
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
I can also ask

130
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,760
if the news about Tang Li's illness is true.

131
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Mr. Su is just a child in Tang Li.

132
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
I didn't expect him to be involved in this case.

133
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
He left at such a young age.

134
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Zhou Yi Niang.

135
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
Did you find out the whereabouts of Zhou Yi Niang?

136
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Let's inquire about something more factual and clear.

137
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
You can't hide away from us.

138
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
Don't feel free to let us help.

139
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
W sincere to go there.

140
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,400
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,360
Is Zhou Yiniang really going to the Xinhua Courtyard?

142
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,120
Yes.

143
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Nanny Ying said

144
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,280
Zhou Yiniang went there twice a few days ago.

145
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,160
The Xinhua Courtyard is located in the middle of the mountain.

146
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Only those who are sincere in going to the mountain to burn incense

147
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,080
will go there to rest.

148
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,160
Almost no one stays there.

149
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,160
No wonder

150
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,240
she chose such a barren place.

151
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,600
You are the Governor of Great Half Heaven and Earth.

152
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,880
Having lost the way to Lord Hun in company,

153
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,560
we can spend any time and any fällture at leisure.

154
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,600
Our hearts have still decided.

155
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,920
He may have into a fight now.

156
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,280
But he promised to let him go.

157
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,480
I feel sad

158
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,200
for him.

159
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,860
We won't be apart anymore.

160
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,380
I will return to you.

161
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,860
When we are apart,

162
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,020
we will meet again.

163
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,740
I hope you can be with your family.

164
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,660
I wish you a happy life

165
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,820
and a long life.

166
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,140
It's been a few days.

167
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,220
Don't you miss me?

168
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,380
How annoying!

169
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,100
Don't talk about the master.

170
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,780
This Xinhua Courtyard is so remote.

171
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
If we don't go here,

172
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,380
it will be a problem for us.

173
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,060
We have to go somewhere else.

174
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,900
Besides,

175
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,660
it's been a long time.

176
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,660
I still haven't got any evidence

177
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,740
from the old man.

178
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,980
What is the evidence

179
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,980
you've been asking me for?

180
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,620
No matter what it is,

181
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,220
don't worry.

182
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,700
Tonight,

183
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,900
we will be together.

184
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,020
We will not leave a single living.

185
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,780
Whatever evidence you have,

186
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,060
you will have it turned into ashes.

187
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,700
The family business

188
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,340
will be yours.

189
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,420
My lady.

190
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,860
Ming Shu.

191
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,580
Ming Shu.

192
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,300
Stop!

193
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,420
Don't run!

194
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,020
Stop!

195
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:53,940
Stop!

196
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,340
Stop!

197
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Explain it to me.

198
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,020
Explain!

199
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,180
Go!

200
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,900
Run, Yuan.

201
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,260
國家!

202
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,340
Go!

203
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,660
I did.

204
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,060
Come on.

205
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,900
Stop!

206
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,620
Someone help!

207
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,260
Help!

208
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,260
Stop!

209
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,080
Don't you think

210
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,680
I am karma-resistant?

211
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,260
Even if you're karma-ers,

212
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,840
even if you're illness-deficient,

213
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,240
it's nothing to me.

214
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,560
When I saw that appeared,

215
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,900
I sat still and waited.

216
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,760
I what?

217
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,360
Cupid?

218
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,320
I was soEC isvernalism.

219
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,420
In the human test,

220
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,220
we all had to..

221
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,280
Wonderful.

222
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,320
Min Zhaoyun

223
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,800
Min Shu

224
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,520
Min Shu

225
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,040
Search carefully

226
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,920
What most important

227
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,880
is to spot someone

228
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,960
As well as the enemy

229
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Hurry up.

230
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Hurry up.

231
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Who is this?

232
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Ming Shu?

233
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,740
It's not safe here.

234
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,740
We need to leave now.

235
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,480
Search carefully.

236
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Hurry up.

237
00:14:50,280 --> 00:15:07,360
The

238
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Eagle Division was rescued by the passers-by.

239
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
My Lord,

240
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,280
the Jian family's case has been resolved.

241
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,880
But we haven't found any evidence.

242
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Ming Shu is the only survivor of the Jian family.

243
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
No matter if he knows the evidence,

244
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
he can't stay.

245
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
He must have been injured

246
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
and can't run far.

247
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,080
Search the nearby clinic.

248
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Yes.

249
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
What did the doctor say?

250
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
He has a severe head injury.

251
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
But he's fine.

252
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
We need to wait for him to wake up.

253
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
I think

254
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
if Ming Shu is in danger,

255
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,080
A-Lin should report to the government

256
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,880
and have the soldiers catch the thieves.

257
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Isn't it?

258
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
There must be something wrong.

259
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
I want to report to the Jian family

260
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,880
and tell them about Ming Shu.

261
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
I'm afraid that

262
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
the Jian family will be in danger.

263
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
I'm afraid that

264
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
we'll decide after the inspection is over.

265
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Be careful.

266
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Who is the murderer?

267
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Yes.

268
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
The Jian family is so confused.

269
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
How could it be possible?

270
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Is it true?

271
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Yes.

272
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
All the people are dead.

273
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Yes.

274
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
The murderer is so suspicious.

275
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
There's no one alive.

276
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Is the wound inside confirmed?

277
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Yes.

278
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
The murderer is so suspicious.

279
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
The wound is so big.

280
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Tell the people to disperse.

281
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Don't gather here.

282
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Yes.

283
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Stop looking.

284
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Disperse.

285
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Stop looking.

286
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Disperse.

287
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Let's go.

288
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
The Jian Ming Shu was also killed.

289
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
It should be a group of people.

290
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
I've saved him.

291
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
But he's still in a coma.

292
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Except for Ming Shu,

293
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
we didn't find Zhou Yi Niang.

294
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
The bandits of the Jian family

295
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
were killed

296
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
by the government after the inspection.

297
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Then the government

298
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
used the charges of the Jian family's bandits

299
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
to end the case.

300
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
The Jian family became a criminal?

301
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Could it be that the bandits colluded

302
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
and made a fake impression

303
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
that they were bandits

304
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
and actually took the assets of the Jian family?

305
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
When I was checking the Jian family,

306
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
I found that the Jian housekeeper was still in a coma.

307
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
He told me

308
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
someone was looking for something

309
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
that the Su family wanted.

310
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
The first thing?

311
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
What do you mean?

312
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
I haven't finished yet.

313
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
He's out of breath.

314
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
This thing must be very important.

315
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Otherwise, the Jian family

316
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
wouldn't have...

317
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
The Jian family asked for

318
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
more than this.

319
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
There must be something

320
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
you care about.

321
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,880
Could it be that what he wanted

322
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
was this thing?

323
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Does Ming Shu know something?

324
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
That's why they killed him.

325
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
When will you come back?

326
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Uncle Wen should be coming down soon.

327
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
He'll be here soon.

328
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
When you arrive,

329
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,880
go to the Liang Garden to find a place to stay.

330
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
We can take care of each other.

331
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Okay.

332
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
I didn't expect

333
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
the Jian family was so cruel.

334
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Poor Ming Shu.

335
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Ming Shu,

336
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
how do you feel?

337
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
It hurts.

338
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Who...

339
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Who are you?

340
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
I'm Lu Chang.

341
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Lu Chang?

342
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
Who is he?

343
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
What about him?

344
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Do you know him?

345
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Ming Shu.

346
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
Then,

347
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
what about yourself?

348
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
I...

349
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Who am I?

350
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
I am...

351
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Ming Shu, think about it.

352
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
Who are you?

353
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Where is your home?

354
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Ming Shu.

355
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
Mother,

356
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
don't ask.

357
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
I'll get the doctor.

358
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Okay, stop thinking.

359
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Just forget it.

360
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
Stop thinking.

361
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Maybe the love hit his head

362
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
and his brain is not in good condition.

363
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
That's why he's in this state.

364
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Although this is rare,

365
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
the medical books are in stock.

366
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
The disease of amnesia

367
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
is a big problem.

368
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
How can we cure it?

369
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
To be honest,

370
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
I've only seen this disease

371
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,880
in medical books.

372
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
I'm afraid it's not good.

373
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
The patient can't be stimulated.

374
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Now we can only use

375
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
some methods to cure the disease.

376
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,880
We can't be too hasty.

377
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
How much can it be recovered?

378
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
No one can say.

379
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
It's all up to God.

380
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Goodbye.

381
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Chang'er,

382
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
I know you want to know

383
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
the truth behind it.

384
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
But you heard what the doctor said.

385
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Ming Shu can't stand the stimulation.

386
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Mother, don't worry.

387
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
I won't act rashly.

388
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
The Jian family is gone.

389
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Now Ming Shu is in this state.

390
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
What should we do?

391
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
Mother,

392
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
before Ming Shu recovers his memory,

393
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
I'll tell him about the Jian family.

394
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
He has been very assertive since childhood.

395
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
If he knows the truth,

396
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
he will be in danger.

397
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
He may be in danger.

398
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
What about the future?

399
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
What should we do?

400
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,880
We can only follow the path to the capital.

401
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
He may be the key to the case of the En family.

402
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Now he is being hunted,

403
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
I must protect him from harm.

404
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
Then he has been following us?

405
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
He is your daughter,

406
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
my sister.

407
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Now the Jian family is convicted by the government.

408
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
If he doesn't change his identity,

409
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
not only he is a coward,

410
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
the government won't let him go.

411
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
If he is a stranger

412
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
and he is with us,

413
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,880
he may be suspected by others,

414
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,880
and he may be humiliated.

415
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,880
This is the best way to protect him.

416
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,880
What if he can't recover in this life?

417
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
What will he do in the future?

418
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
What if the truth is exposed?

419
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880
You can't leave the city and you can't protect him.

420
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Are you sure you won't regret it in this life?

421
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
I just know that

422
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
if I don't save him,

423
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
I will regret it.

424
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
If he is always like this,

425
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
I will protect him in this life

426
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
as his brother.

427
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,880
Lu Ming Shu.

428
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
I will give you these in the future.

429
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
Please be more simple these days.

430
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
You are awake.

431
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Lu Chao.

432
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
You remember me?

433
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,880
You said it yourself.

434
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
Little Lu Chao.

435
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Why did you

436
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
forget everything?

437
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
I remember you.

438
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
I remember you.

439
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
I remember you.

440
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
I remember you.

441
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
I can't remember.

442
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
You accidentally fell off the cliff

443
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
and hit your head.

444
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
You got a divorce.

445
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
Divorce?

446
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Then who are you?

447
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
I am your brother.

448
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
You are my sister.

449
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Lu Ming Shu.

450
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
Lu Ming Shu.

451
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
Lu Ming Shu.

452
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
This name sounds nice.

453
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Ming Shu.

454
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
You have been lying for a long time.

455
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,880
Are you hungry?

456
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
Come and have a bowl of porridge.

457
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Come on.

458
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Get up first.

459
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

460
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
You don't even know your mother?

461
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Drink it while it's hot.

462
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Come on.

463
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
I can do it myself.

464
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
I searched all the hospitals

465
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,880
but I didn't find the sound of the note.

466
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
This is a notice of marriage.

467
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
You have been lying for a long time.

468
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
This is a good method.

469
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
If someone finds out,

470
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
they will report to us.

471
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
They are really my mother and brother.

472
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
How do I feel happy?

473
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
I feel like I am in the air.

474
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
I feel so nervous.

475
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
It's clearly a pair of

476
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
hands that have been bitten.

477
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
But my hands are so long.

478
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
They are not like the hands that have been burned.

479
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
I am wearing such a precious gold bracelet.

480
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
But if we are not a family,

481
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
wipe your sister's mouth.

482
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
Who are you?

483
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
I am your brother.

484
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
You are my sister,

485
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
Lu Ming Shu.

486
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
But they give me

487
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
an inexplicable sense of closeness.

488
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
They don't tell me what to do

489
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
and they even try to take care of me.

490
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
What are they hiding?

491
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
You haven't recovered yet.

492
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Why are you going to bed?

493
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
I told you to lie in bed and don't move.

494
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
But you are moving around.

495
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
When can I get up?

496
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,880
I am not going to sleep.

497
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
Why are you moving around?

498
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
When can you be more obedient?

499
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
I just want to drink water.

500
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
I will pour it.

501
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
Why is this man so weird?

502
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Is he really my brother?

503
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Is this a man or a woman?

504
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
There are so few women in the Sword Hall.

505
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
The news is true.

506
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
The girl is caught by the criminal.

507
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
The fairy is looking for her.

508
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
She is in a critical situation.

509
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
I feel that she is familiar.

510
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
No wonder her colleagues posted three posters.

511
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
She looks familiar.

512
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
I heard that.

513
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Really?

514
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
The girl is caught by the criminal.

515
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
The girl is caught by the criminal.

516
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
The fairy is caught by the criminal.

517
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
Why are you up?

518
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Lie down for a while.

519
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
I have been lying for a long time.

520
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
I'd better go out and rest.

521
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
You will catch a cold.

522
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
You can't go out.

523
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Why?

524
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
There is an enemy outside.

525
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
What enemy?

526
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
I will tell you later.

527
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
I will tell you later.

528
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
You can't go out now.

529
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Don't ask.

530
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
Listen to me.

531
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,880
Mother.

532
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,880
Come with me.

533
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
Stay in the room.

534
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Sleep for a while.

535
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
Lie down.

536
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Mother.

537
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
There are his pictures outside.

538
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
He is disguised as a relative.

539
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Don't let him go out.

540
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
If someone finds out,

541
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
the consequences will be unimaginable.

542
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Okay.

543
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
I will go to find Ying Xun.

544
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
I will go to find Ying Xun.

545
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
We have to find another way.

546
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
We have to find another way.

547
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
No wonder he doesn't let me go out.

548
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
Why are you standing?

549
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
Why are you standing?

550
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Eat something.

551
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Come on.

552
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
You have to eat while it's hot.

553
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
What if you don't have the strength?

554
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
Right?

555
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
He looks so kind.

556
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
If it wasn't for the notice,

557
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
I would have believed him.

558
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
I don't know.

559
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
I don't know.

560
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
I don't know.

561
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Chopsticks.

562
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
What's wrong?

563
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,880
I can't eat these.

564
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
I want to eat some porridge.

565
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Wait for a while.

566
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
I will get you some sugar.

567
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
Eat it later.

568
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Wait for a while.

569
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Let's go.

570
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
See?

571
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
parentheses.

572
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
OK.

573
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
Happy birthday to you!

574
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,000
This gold bracelet looks special.

575
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,560
Maybe

576
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,920
I can find out something in the gold shop.

577
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,480
I got it all.

578
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,120
I brought it to you myself.

579
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,720
There are enemies outside.

580
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,560
I'll talk to you later.

581
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,800
Give it to me!

582
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,800
Stay still!

583
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,280
Help!

584
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,400
Don't run!

585
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,800
Isn't that pretty?

586
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,480
It's too ka...

587
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,360
Ka Suo!

588
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,720
Mr TikTok! Over there!

589
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
What happened just now?

590
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Who are they?

591
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Let's go back to the room.

592
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Sir.

593
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Mother.

594
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You're finally back.

595
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
I was so worried about you.

596
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Hurry up and pack up.

597
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
We'll be right back.

598
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Okay.

599
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
I'll go pack up.

600
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
I'll go pack up.

601
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
I'll go pack up.

602
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
I'll go pack up.

603
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
I'll go pack up.

604
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
Hurry up and pack up.

605
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
We'll leave right away.

606
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Okay.

607
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Sir.

608
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Be quiet.

609
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Come in.

610
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Sir, I brought you some water.

611
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Okay.

612
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
This time we'll go south.

613
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Are you satisfied?

614
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Yes.

615
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Great.

616
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
I want to take a boat.

617
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Then pack up.

618
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
We'll be right back at the port.

619
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
If you still want to experience what happened just now,

620
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
you can go out again.

621
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Hurry up and come with us.

622
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Did you see this woman?

623
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
It's her.

624
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
I remember it very clearly.

625
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
They're going south to walk the waterway.

626
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Who is with her?

627
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
It's a man and a woman.

628
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
It looks like a family.

629
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Do you know their identities?

630
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
I really don't know.

631
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Let's go to the port.

632
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
I'm giving you money.

633
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Thank you for saving me before.

634
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
It's my duty.

635
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
We've been driving for hours.

636
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Why don't we take a break?

637
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
If they find the inn,

638
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
they'll think we're going south.

639
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
They must be in the wrong direction.

640
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
They can't catch up.

641
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
You can't be so hasty.

642
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
It's windy outside.

643
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
You can go in.

644
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Who are they?

645
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Why are they after me?

646
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Could it be that I was the one who caused the trouble

647
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
before I got the phobia?

648
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
It has nothing to do with you.

649
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
It has something to do with my teacher.

650
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Your teacher?

651
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Yes.

652
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
My teacher was framed to death.

653
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
I was also targeted in secret.

654
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
You fell into the cliff for this.

655
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Do you dare to run around again?

656
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
I'm sorry.

657
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
I just saw the gold bracelet and the wrong thing.

658
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
I wanted to go to the inn to ask.

659
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
See if it can be repaired.

660
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
That's true.

661
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
I accidentally saw the notice on the street.

662
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
They want more people to find you.

663
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
To threaten me.

664
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
I'm sorry.

665
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
The bracelet is not expensive.

666
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Do you really think it's mine?

667
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
You've been weak and sick since you were little.

668
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Mother is the most partial to you.

669
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
She doesn't let you do anything.

670
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
She even saved you from the best thing.

671
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
It's windy outside.

672
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
You can go in.

673
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
It's stuffy.

674
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
It's more comfortable to be out there.

675
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
But I'm not feeling well.

676
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Don't move.

677
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
You're so considerate.

678
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Ming Shu is rich.

679
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
He can't get used to my old clothes.

680
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
There are so many red pillows on his back.

681
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
He was covered by the rough cloth.

682
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
I think he's been like this for a long time.

683
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
He's been used to being in the sun since he was a kid.

684
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
He can't stand any discomfort.

685
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
He's been like this for a lifetime.

686
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,400
I think he doesn't want to bother us.

687
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,400
You still remember him.

688
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,400
He's a man of his word.

689
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
He's different from other rich ladies.

690
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
You should know him well.

691
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
When you get to the town,

692
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
go buy him some ointment.

693
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Go get some windproofs.

694
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Help him get some fresh air.

695
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
It should be fine.

696
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Okay.

697
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
It seems that he doesn't trust us.

698
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
You have to be careful.

699
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Don't show any flaws.

700
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
He's born rich.

701
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,400
He's different from us.

702
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Living in different environments for a long time

703
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
will bring a lot of differences.

704
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
He's so smart.

705
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
How can he not see it?

706
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
But don't worry, mother.

707
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
I'll make sure

708
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,400
he's not suspicious of Lu Chang's sister.

709
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Why do I have red spots on your clothes?

710
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
What do I wear on a daily basis?

711
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
My skin is very soft.

712
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
The clothes you wear on a daily basis

713
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
are naturally soft cloth.

714
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,400
I lost my luggage on the way to the capital.

715
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I had to wear it.

716
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
These are pretty good.

717
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
I can wear them.

718
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Nonsense.

719
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
You've been afraid of it since you were a child.

720
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
It's been hard on you.

721
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
You've been patient for so long.

722
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
What kind of person is he?

723
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Do you mean Chang'er?

724
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
He's cold.

725
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
He's nice to me sometimes.

726
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Sometimes he's like a man.

727
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,400
He's cold-hearted.

728
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Sometimes he's cold-hearted.

729
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
He's cold-hearted.

730
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Sometimes he's a man.

731
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,400
You'll know when you've been with him for a long time.

732
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Be careful not to catch a cold.

733
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
Does it hurt?

734
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
I'll apply the medicine.

735
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
They said

736
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
this medicine has a special effect on the kidney.

737
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
It'll be better after a few touches.

738
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Bear with it.

739
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,400
You've spent a lot of money for me.

740
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Thank you.

741
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Don't thank me.

742
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
We're a family.

743
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Silly child.

744
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Does it hurt?

745
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Bear with it.

746
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
I'm fine.

747
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
What are we doing here?

748
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
What do you need?

749
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Just tell me.

750
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
Pick a dress for her.

751
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
There are many clothes in the B Hall.

752
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
What does the little lady like?

753
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Wait for me.

754
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
Pick a dress for her.

755
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
It needs to be better.

756
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Wear something comfortable.

757
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,400
A personal dress?

758
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
You're blushing.

759
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Your pillow is too late to be done.

760
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,400
I'm so lucky.

761
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
My husband is so kind.

762
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,400
He's really a kind person.

763
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,400
I'm his brother.

764
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
I'm sorry.

765
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
You're brothers and sisters.

766
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
This way, please.

767
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
This way, please.

768
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Come on.

769
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
This one.

770
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
You have good taste.

771
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,400
This dress is very good.

772
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Girls like it the most.

773
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
How much?

774
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
It's free.

775
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,400
It's one dollar each.

776
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
It's two dollars per day.

777
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,400
You're so clever.

778
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
It's one dollar each.

779
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Don't fool him with words.

780
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,300
The cotton in your clothes is made of

781
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,400
the fabric of the stockings.

782
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
The cotton in the market is only a few dozen.

783
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,400
The stockings are cheaper.

784
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
You have six hundred dollars.

785
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
Don't take one more.

786
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
Six...

787
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
Forget it.

788
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
Six hundred dollars is six hundred dollars.

789
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Take it.

790
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
Give her another dress.

791
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Okay.

792
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
No.

793
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,400
You saved it.

794
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
Be good.

795
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,400
I must buy it.

796
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
No.

797
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
Do you feel better now?

798
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
We have to spend money everywhere

799
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
in the capital.

800
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,400
We can't avoid the people.

801
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
You're in spring.

802
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,400
You should study at ease.

803
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
There's no money in the house.

804
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Only spending.

805
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
How long will it take?

806
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
No matter how hard it is,

807
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,400
you and mother can't bear it.

808
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
You can't spend the money you should.

809
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,400
I have to spend money on the knife.

810
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
The clothes of the clothes shop

811
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
are expensive and expensive.

812
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
It's better to go to the capital.

813
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
I can't afford to make a few

814
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,400
more money than myself.

815
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
I didn't expect you to be so careful.

816
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Is it strange?

817
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
The weather is getting colder.

818
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Put on this jacket.

819
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,400
Why do you give it to me?

820
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,400
Put it on first.

821
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
You can't catch a cold.

822
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
Together.

823
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,400
Okay.

824
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,400
Mother will do it.

825
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,400
Come on.

826
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,400
Put it on.

827
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Why do you catch a cold?

828
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
I'm cold.

829
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,400
I'm cold.

830
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,400
I'm cold.

831
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
I'm cold.

832
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,400
I'm cold.

833
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,400
I'm cold.

834
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,400
I'm cold.

835
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
I'm cold.

836
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
I'm cold.

837
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,400
I'm cold.

838
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
I'm cold.

839
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
I'm cold.

840
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
I'm cold.

841
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,400
What if you catch a cold?

842
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,400
You're just fine, right?

843
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,400
Come on.

844
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,400
What's wrong?

845
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,400
What's wrong?

846
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
The car is broken.

847
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,400
What?

848
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,400
There should be a storm tonight.

849
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,400
We can't stay here.

850
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,400
There are some light in the distance.

851
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Do you want to go and have a look?

852
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,400
What's wrong?

853
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
What happened here?

854
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,400
Er Chang,

855
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,400
why don't we just go?

856
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,400
It's a female dress that's been torn apart.

857
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
There are traces of nail polish.

858
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
Is this a black shop?

859
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
If it's a black shop,

860
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
we wouldn't have to do it at the door.

861
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
It's like we've been attacked by bandits.

862
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
There must be a woman trapped in there.

863
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
There are so many cars here.

864
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,400
Only one horse is in the stable.

865
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
The bandits may have left.

866
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Mother,

867
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,400
you and Uncle Ming go back to the stable and wait for me.

868
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
I'll go in and see.

869
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
I'll pick you up when I'm safe.

870
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
But you're alone.

871
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
I'll go with you.

872
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
So many people died.

873
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
Be careful.

874
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
I'm here.

875
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
I'm here.

876
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
I'm here.

877
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,400
I'm here.

878
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,400
I'm here.

879
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,400
I'm here.

880
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,400
I'm here.

881
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,400
I'm here.

882
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,400
I'm here.

883
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,400
I'm here.

884
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
I'm here.

885
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
I'm here.

886
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,400
I'm here.

887
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,400
I'm here.

888
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
I'm here.

889
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,400
I'm here.

890
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,400
I'm here.

891
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,400
I'm here.

892
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,400
I'm here.

893
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,400
I'm here.

894
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,400
I'm here.

895
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
I'm here.

896
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,400
I'm here.

897
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,400
I'm here.

898
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400

901
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,400
I'm here.

902
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,400

I'm here.

904
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,400
I'm here.

905
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,400
I'm here.

906
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,400
I'm here.

907
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,400
