Row of stroke

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,460
Last%,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,040
Let me see first.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,060
Look ringing in your ears.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,880
Please.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,560
Drink ginseng wine first.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,340
Then ask

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

16
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

17
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

19
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

20
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

22
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

23
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

24
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

25
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

26
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

27
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

28
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

29
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

30
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

31
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

32
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

33
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

34
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

35
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

36
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

37
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

38
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

39
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

40
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

41
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

42
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

43
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

44
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

45
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

46
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

47
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,340
I'm afraid I can't help you.

48
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,520
The

49
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:30,340
Legend of Fei

50
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,340
Episode 22

51
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,340
Tang Sheng.

52
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,340
My name is Ming Shu.

53
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,340
I'm new here.

54
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,340
Nice to meet you.

55
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,340
Look.

56
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
I told you.

57
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,340
He's just a temper.

58
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,340
I've never seen him with anyone.

59
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,340
He's just wearing a mask all the time.

60
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,340
He doesn't look like a real person.

61
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,340
Speaking of which,

62
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,340
this kid is also a tough guy.

63
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,340
I heard from the chief that

64
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,340
he was a little boy.

65
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,340
He was a little boy.

66
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,340
He burned his face.

67
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,340
That's why he had to cover it up with a mask.

68
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,340
That's why he was born with a temper that didn't like to see people.

69
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,340
It's a human nature.

70
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,340
When did he come to the hospital?

71
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,340
When did he come to the hospital?

72
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,340
Let me think about it.

73
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,340
Probably more than a year ago.

74
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
I don't know the exact date.

75
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,340
You suspect Tang Sheng?

76
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,340
The county chief suspects that Xie Xi has a problem.

77
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,340
It happened a year ago.

78
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,340
Tang Sheng came to the academy a year ago.

79
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,340
It may be a coincidence,

80
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,340
but Tang Sheng is weak.

81
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,340
It's not impossible to say that she's a girl.

82
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,340
Although Tang Sheng is a girl from the back yard,

83
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,340
she rarely appears in the academy.

84
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
I've been here for so long, but I've never seen her.

85
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,340
Then I'll find out who she is.

86
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,340
Then I'll stay in the back yard.

87
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,340
Take the opportunity to see her more.

88
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,340
See what she's really like.

89
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,340
If she's really Xie Xi,

90
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,340
you should know your background.

91
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,340
You pay more attention.

92
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,340
I'm sorry.

93
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,340
Ming Shu,

94
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,340
are you okay?

95
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,340
I'm fine.

96
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,340
I'm fine.

97
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,340
I'm fine.

98
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
I'm cold.

99
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,340
Yang Youmei.

100
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,100
It seems

101
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,860
nothing can be done.

102
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,020
Thank you.

103
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,900
You're welcome.

104
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,940
You're back.

105
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,260
By the way,

106
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,140
I heard you're good at reading and writing.

107
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,260
You must have joined your colleagues

108
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,660
when you were 16.

109
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,700
Didn't the chief ask you to try last autumn?

110
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,940
I was born in a humble family.

111
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,780
I dare not rely on Liyuelong Sect.

112
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,020
The chief and your wife

113
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,940
asked me to learn some Chushi's way

114
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,540
to do some work in the academy.

115
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,220
Chushi's way?

116
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,140
I heard from Anxiong

117
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,980
that Mr. Xie Xi is good at writing

118
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,300
and is highly skilled.

119
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,460
Why don't you talk to him?

120
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,580
I was born in a humble family.

121
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,780
I don't want to bother you.

122
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,180
You're the younger sister of Mr. Lu Chang?

123
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,100
Are you from Jiangling?

124
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,380
Do you have any other relatives in your hometown?

125
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,180
Why do you ask?

126
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,500
Recently,

127
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,660
I happen to have someone who wants to build a gold market.

128
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,220
I heard it's Jiangling's famous gold shop.

129
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,940
I just want to ask if you know anything about it.

130
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,460
I know about the gold shop.

131
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,100
But something happened to that shop.

132
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,380
I don't know the details.

133
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,580
I see.

134
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,100
I have something to do.

135
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,140
I'll go now.

136
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,340
Goodbye, Miss Ming Shu.

137
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,380
I deliberately mentioned Xie Xi

138
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,660
to test his reaction.

139
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,980
He's good at hiding emotions.

140
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,300
He can hardly see a thing.

141
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,900
He's the one who asked me a question.

142
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,980
What did he ask you?

143
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,260
Nothing but

144
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,620
Jiangling's family's affairs

145
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,580
and the gold shop.

146
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,420
How could I remember?

147
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,140
Tang Sheng.

148
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,380
Who's there?

149
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,180
Someone there?

150
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,220
刚才那说 Ü Say Not And Don't Know

151
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,520
My favorite isrepresentedness.

152
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,420
There is one word Tang in it.

153
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,720
Grandpa's profile is so dope,

154
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,220
tang Sat Austria.

155
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,620
Tang Li.

156
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,540
I've been waiting for you.

157
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,700
We've known each other since childhood.

158
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,380
We're like brothers and sisters.

159
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,780
Do you really think I can't recognize you?

160
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,900
Brother Lu.

161
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,260
I'm in Jiangling.

162
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,740
I heard you died of illness.

163
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,780
I couldn't believe it.

164
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,820
When I arrived in the capital,

165
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,980
I asked Yin Xun

166
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,900
to go to the Ministry of Education

167
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,820
to find out where you were.

168
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,060
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,540
It's a pity

170
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,140
to see you alive.

171
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,780
I'm sure

172
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,260
you'll be happy under the influence of the Nine Fists.

173
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,260
I didn't expect Brother Lu

174
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,700
to miss me all the time.

175
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,740
You're the only daughter of the En family.

176
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,340
How can I not ask you?

177
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,740
But you

178
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,540
recognized me long ago.

179
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:56,980
Why didn't you

180
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,060
recognize me earlier

181
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,700
and hide from me?

182
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,900
This is the en family.

183
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,100
Did this trick work?

184
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,700
Indeed.

185
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,980
Please let us know

186
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,740
when you go back from the en family.

187
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,260
I'll show you around.

188
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,140
Let me tell you the truth.

189
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,660
I...

190
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,380
In the half- fot.

191
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,740
Brother Lu...

192
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,380
and practicing talents.

193
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,980
I have been reached a death.

194
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,340
I happiness

195
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,380
will delighted

196
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,460
and gain to粗殺.

197
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,380
Now it is odd

198
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,020
how the boat tilts into the clouds.

199
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,540
I'm afraid I'll be implicated

200
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,420
by you.

201
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,420
I'll be the only one

202
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,980
who can help you.

203
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,540
How can you think so?

204
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,300
You're so kind to me.

205
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,580
I've always regarded you as my sister.

206
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,060
I should take care of you.

207
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,980
It's not easy for Brother Lu to establish a family in the capital.

208
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,820
I can't let you be burdened.

209
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Don't worry.

210
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,820
I've found someone to rely on.

211
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,900
He can protect me forever.

212
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,860
You mean Xie Xi?

213
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,220
I suffered a lot in the Jiaofang Temple.

214
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,500
I was tortured.

215
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,420
But I want to live on

216
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,220
and avenge my father.

217
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,340
I thought of Xie Xi.

218
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,420
You've known her for a long time.

219
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,100
The Xie family is also from Jiangling.

220
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,900
Five years ago,

221
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,780
Xie Xi returned to his hometown to visit his family.

222
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,620
He once loved me.

223
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,220
But I didn't

224
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,420
put it in my heart.

225
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,220
Three years ago,

226
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,380
he and the late Lady were engaged.

227
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,380
I think he must have already made me angry.

228
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,540
But I don't care about those things.

229
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,340
I just want him to save my life.

230
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,300
But he agreed.

231
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,820
He said he would protect me

232
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,060
and help me with the case.

233
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,980
That's enough.

234
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,220
The En family was not convicted yet.

235
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,260
The Xie family is still on their own

236
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,420
and cheating the officials.

237
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,340
But now you're the daughter of a criminal.

238
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,900
How can Xie Xi be involved?

239
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,500
He is the son of Marquis Yongqian.

240
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,740
He will be the heir in the future.

241
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,780
But Lady Wen An is already investigating.

242
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,140
Brother Lu.

243
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,540
I know what to do.

244
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,460
Please don't tell my identity to Lady Jin.

245
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,260
I finally left the Jiaofang Temple.

246
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,140
Now Lady Jin is investigating me under the order of the County Chief.

247
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,660
I hope you can stop her.

248
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,180
I can't stop you.

249
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,020
I'm a man of my word.

250
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,180
Besides, Xie Xi has an engagement with someone else.

251
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
You should avoid it.

252
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,860
How about this?

253
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,860
I'll help you leave this place

254
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,380
and avoid the storm.

255
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,380
I'll think about it.

256
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,700
By the way,

257
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,780
you think Jiang Mingxu is your sister

258
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,820
because she has the evidence of my father's case.

259
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,500
How do you know she has evidence?

260
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,260
My father was in prison.

261
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,260
Jiang Jinhai

262
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,020
tried to meet her once.

263
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,220
My father told her where the evidence was hidden.

264
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,820
You can take the case from here.

265
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,100
It seems tuberculosis is to blame.

266
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,980
She is owing Gaoshetai

267
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,780
a punishment for burying her,

268
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,740
no.

269
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,220
You're overestimating yourself.

270
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,220
In my opinion,

271
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,500
you're only a

272
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,260
you

273
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,900
you

274
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,180
are enough.

275
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,860
Go.

276
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,860
Get the hell out!

277
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,220
Did pratique tapes tell you more?

278
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,220
No.

279
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,340
After leaving the Confuciheads,

280
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,900
I secretly went to Jianjia's house to look for Jian Jinhan,

281
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,860
but found out

282
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,020
that Jianjia's house had been destroyed too.

283
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,220
Why hasn't he left yet?

284
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,420
Exactly.

285
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,340
He's been being haunted by the hot air for so long.

286
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,860
If he keeps hiding,

287
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,740
I'm afraid he'll run out of breath.

288
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,820
He can hide today,

289
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,420
but he can't hide tomorrow.

290
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
Let's go.

291
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
Your Highness.

292
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,180
Your Highness,

293
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,380
the food is ready.

294
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
I thought

295
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,700
you'd wait until midnight.

296
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:22,360
Pond of

297
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,620
Haven't you said

298
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,360
there's nothing between us about love?

299
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,500
What are we doing in my room tonight?

300
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,360
Since we are married,

301
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,800
why should it matter

302
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,460
if I agree to this marriage?

303
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,040
Don't tell me that before our marriage,

304
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,280
did I not teach you

305
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Then you don't have to

306
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,520
get into the child's room.

307
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,600
No need?

308
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,120
But I think

309
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,160
you are very discerning about this.

310
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,520
You didn't let me come

311
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,880
and make trouble for you

312
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,080
in the whole house.

313
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,400
Is that true?

314
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,920
I did it for the sake of cooperation.

315
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,560
I hope you don't drive the evil spirit out of me

316
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,040
and keep exception from thoseenser.

317
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,080
So it won't be unnecessary distress.

318
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,000
W commonly used for properlyport.

319
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,120
Don't talk again I'm the one who wantar you.

320
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,320
I did not.

321
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,680
I'm sorry.

322
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,520
It doesn't matter

323
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,320
if it's a misunderstanding.

324
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,720
Since you've done it for me,

325
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,440
I won't let you down.

326
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,120
No.

327
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
I didn't mean to do that.

328
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,040
What are you doing?

329
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,600
Don't come over.

330
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,240
pec h

331
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,840
I suddenly remember

332
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
there's official duty to do.

333
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,800
I'll let you off this time.

334
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,760
If you have any problem next time,

335
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,720
you can tell me directly.

336
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
No need to be so polite

337
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,640
and tell the servants of the mansion.

338
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,840
I'm here.

339
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,080
Thanks for your kindness.

340
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,640
Alright, Madam Ling.

341
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,000
Right now,

342
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,880
the amount is matching with your account.

343
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,520
See?

344
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,440
Thanks,

345
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,560
I'll send the tower to your manor tomorrow.

346
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,900
I don't wanna run 내� sorry,

347
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,920
This job is done.

348
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,280
Will Tang Sheng go too?

349
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,960
He must go

350
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,400
if he wants to be responsible for the celebration.

351
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,080
Madam,

352
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,640
you must be tired

353
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,240
from your busy days.

354
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,800
Leave the running errands to me.

355
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,240
My good girl.

356
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,160
You're so sweet and pretty.

357
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,720
I'll ask Shutong to go with you later.

358
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,440
Okay.

359
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,040
Oh, my.

360
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,000
Madam,

361
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,400
give me a treasure.

362
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,920
You're so good at teaching me.

363
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,800
The evidence must be in the hands of Jian Jianhai.

364
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Otherwise, he wouldn't have caused the murder.

365
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,120
Now, Jian Mingshong

366
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,880
is the only survivor of the Jian family.

367
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,560
He must have

368
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,440
the evidence.

369
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,160
As long as he regains his memory,

370
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,040
he can get the evidence back

371
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,920
and help my father.

372
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,760
He has a divorce.

373
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,760
He can't bear to kill him.

374
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
The doctor said he could only get the

375
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,760
excrement.

376
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,080
Besides, I don't think

377
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,280
he's the only one who has the evidence.

378
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,600
I think he's prepared

379
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,920
to protect his wife.

380
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,000
Protect his wife?

381
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,320
How can you be so happy?

382
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,720
Don't worry.

383
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,520
I'll help the family

384
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,680
to get back together.

385
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,280
But you must protect yourself

386
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,000
and wait for the day to come.

387
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,800
Wait?

388
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,240
No.

389
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll do my best to solve the case.

390
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,440
I got a poison

391
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,560
when I got out of the mess.

392
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,680
I'll never stop.

393
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,840
But you can't

394
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,160
get this from Ming Shu.

395
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,600
Can you promise me?

396
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,720
I didn't expect Brother Lu

397
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,520
to care so much

398
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
about the victim.

399
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,160
Don't worry.

400
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,960
I know what to do.

401
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,760
Sir,

402
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,240
Ms. Lin has a bad leg.

403
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,160
I'll send some basin for her.

404
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,280
What about you?

405
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,920
Thank you.

406
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,720
Tang Sheng is in charge of the calculation.

407
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,920
You can confirm it with him.

408
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,120
Thank you.

409
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,860
The victim is dead.

410
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,760
Done.

411
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,720
There have been many compromise.

412
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,960
I also have a great case.

413
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,940
Are you serious?

414
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,160
Move!

415
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,080
Ah Xiong!

416
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,920
Ah Xiong!

417
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,160
Young Master, are you okay?

418
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,240
Uncle Yuan!

419
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm fine.

420
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,000
Why are you here?

421
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,800
Ah Xiong!

422
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,200
Are you hurt?

423
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,840
I'm not hurt.

424
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,640
Are you okay?

425
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,240
I'm fine.

426
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,200
This school is a nightmare!

427
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,320
We'll be in trouble if we come here!

428
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,640
Ah Xiong shouldn't have saved him.

429
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,240
Ah Xiong!

430
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,520
You two are siblings!

431
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,160
You were trying to trick me before, right?

432
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,800
How dare you!

433
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,880
Ah Xiong just saved you!

434
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,760
Lu Wencai,

435
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,520
don't be so rude in front of your sister.

436
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,520
I can save you and ruin you.

437
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,760
Wait for me.

438
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Go!

439
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,400
See if anyone else is hurt.

440
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,440
Uncle Yuan, why are you bleeding?

441
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,160
No!

442
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:27,920
Sorry!

443
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,440
Young Master!

444
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,920
You're bleeding!

445
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,360
It's just a small wound. I'm fine.

446
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,360
Where are you hurt?

447
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
You're bleeding!

448
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,000
You said you're fine.

449
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,800
Does it hurt?

450
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,880
A little.

451
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,160
You're usually

452
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,760
not friendly to

453
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,960
these small wounds.

454
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,480
I didn't expect

455
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,920
you'd be in pain one day.

456
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,520
You're so clever.

457
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't talk nonsense.

458
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,560
Come to think of it,

459
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,640
don't you think

460
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,080
that Lady Ming Shu

461
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,760
has been very close to you recently?

462
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,520
You just found out?

463
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,560
Qingzhao!

464
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,520
It's Uncle Ming Shu.

465
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,520
Come in!

466
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,120
How's your wound?

467
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,080
Does it still hurt?

468
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,480
It doesn't hurt anymore.

469
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
If you come later,

470
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,800
I'm afraid it will heal.

471
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,080
You can't be so rude.

472
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,400
It hurts!

473
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,280
Young Master!

474
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,320
Please don't!

475
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,640
I'm a rough man.

476
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,320
I'm not that delicate.

477
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,840
Didn't you say you're good at taking care of people?

478
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,760
Let me do it.

479
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,120
No need.

480
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,920
Just let Uncle Ming Shu be gentle.

481
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,640
If you let Uncle Ming Shu be gentle,

482
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,840
it will be a serious wound.

483
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,600
Brother!

484
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,080
I heard that you were hurt

485
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,920
because you wanted to save Ming Shu.

486
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,680
As your brother,

487
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,880
I have to thank you on his behalf.

488
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,000
Thank you, Brother Song.

489
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,120
Brother Song!

490
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,560
Brother, be gentle.

491
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,160
Qingzhao is hurt.

492
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,400
Let me do it.

493
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,320
Did I hurt you?

494
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,080
No.

495
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,160
No.

496
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,880
Qingzhao is coming again.

497
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,000
Qingzhao,

498
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,000
don't touch your wound.

499
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,040
You're a rough man like Uncle Ming Shu.

500
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,280
I don't think you can take care of him.

501
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,600
I've been looking at you for a few days.

502
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,240
Don't you still have to take care of the backyard?

503
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,640
I'll take care of Mr. Song these days.

504
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,200
You can do your own work.

505
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,520
Okay.

506
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,480
Then take care of him carefully.

507
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,680
Of course.

508
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,760
Tang Sheng, how's your foot?

509
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,400
Can you get up?

510
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,240
Sorry.

511
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,880
Sorry.

512
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,920
1 month pre expect

513
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,640
Brother.

514
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,040
Are you still worrying about dansing for Mr. Song?

515
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,760
How long have you known him?

516
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,880
Do you like him this much?

517
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,640
I can't say what I like.

518
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,800
But it's easy to get along with her.

519
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,640
I even dreamed of her.

520
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,200
You dreamed of her?

521
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,640
A long-lost lover.

522
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Do you think she likes me?

523
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,640
The dream is vague.

524
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,520
How can you be sure it's her?

525
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
In that dream,

526
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,840
she's wearing a green dress.

527
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,640
She's thin.

528
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
And her back is round.

529
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,640
I'm sure it's her.

530
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
I won't be wrong.

531
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,840
You're sure it's Song Qingcheng

532
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
because of her back?

533
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,040
Then...

534
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,040
Then I'm wearing a green dress, too.

535
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,440
The whole school is wearing a green dress.

536
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,640
Yes, they are.

537
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,040
But it can't be Ah Xiu.

538
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
How can I be against Ah Xiu?

539
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,640
Anyway, I dreamed of her.

540
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,440
I won't be wrong.

541
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
You're so generous.

542
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,440
When the plaque fell,

543
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,440
I saw you were hit.

544
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,640
Were you hurt?

545
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,840
I'm fine.

546
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,240
But

547
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
it was Jian Mingshu who helped me up.

548
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,240
I saw his face.

549
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,240
I'm afraid

550
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,240
he knew my identity.

551
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
It was Lu Mingshu.

552
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,240
I'm sorry.

553
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,840
I'm sorry.

554
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,240
It's not very safe here.

555
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,040
You'd better leave here as soon as possible.

556
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,840
Your Majesty,

557
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,640
you'll come to the academy soon.

558
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,240
I'll leave now

559
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,440
and attract attention.

560
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,040
After the inspection,

561
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,240
I'll leave soon.

562
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,240
Okay.

563
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,640
Ah Xiu.

564
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,840
Ah Xiu.

565
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,040
Where did you go?

566
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
I looked for you everywhere.

567
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,240
I was in the library.

568
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,440
What's up?

569
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,840
Nothing.

570
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,640
You've been in the library?

571
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
I found some books.

572
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
I found some books.

573
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,840
I'll use them for the next discussion.

574
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,440
Ah Xiu went to the backyard.

575
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
Why did he lie to me?

576
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
You go back first.

577
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,640
I'll take care of the rest.

578
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,640
Yes.

579
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
It's a trap.

580
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,440
He tried to lure me in.

581
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,240
Help!

582
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,040
Help!

583
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,240
I can't escape.

584
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
I can't hold my breath.

585
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Help!

586
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,440
Where did Lu Ming Shu go?

587
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,040
He seemed to have found something.

588
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,240
He didn't get close to the trap.

589
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,440
He was watching us closely.

590
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,240
If this goes on,

591
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,840
he'll find out who you are sooner or later.

592
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
I thought I could use this trap

593
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,840
to make him leave the academy.

594
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,640
It seems that I have to chase him away

595
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,440
and find another way.

596
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,440
Yes.

597
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,240
Where are you going?

598
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Help!

599
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,840
Help!

600
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Why is he back?

601
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,640
It seems that someone wants to kill him.

602
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,640
We have to save him.

603
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Otherwise, he'll die.

604
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,240
No.

605
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,640
Someone wants to kill him.

606
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,440
It has nothing to do with us.

607
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,840
It's better to save him.

608
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,440
But...

609
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Let's go. Leave here.

610
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,040
Stop!

611
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Help!

612
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,840
Stop!

613
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,240
Who are you?

614
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Why did you kill me?

615
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,840
Stop!

616
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Bai Ling.

617
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,240
We've searched the backyard.

618
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,840
No one is there.

619
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,440
Did he leave the academy?

620
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
Even if he did,

621
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
he wouldn't be far.

622
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Ming Shu is well-mannered.

623
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,040
Hello.

624
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,440
Are you looking for Lu Ming Shu?

625
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
Have you seen her?

626
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,640
When I was cleaning the backyard,

627
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,040
I saw that she seemed to be going to the back hill.

628
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Back hill?

629
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,840
Yes.

630
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,840
Thank you.

631
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Ming Shu.

632
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
Help!

633
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,760
This...

634
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,120
It's Uncle Ming's shoe.

635
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,600
You watch him here.

636
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,560
I'll go find Uncle Ming.

637
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,440
Okay.

638
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,360
Uncle Ming!

639
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,920
Uncle Ming!

640
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,880
Uncle Ming!

641
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,960
Uncle Ming!

642
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:46,960
Uncle Ming!

643
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,960
Wake up!

644
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,400
Uncle Ming!

645
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,400
Wake up!

646
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:12,200
livro

647
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,200
Knowing what it means to be right in front of others

648
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Yu Tu likes her, too?

649
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,900
Tell me what's the truth

650
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,700
How is she loyal

651
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,520
Yeah?

652
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,100
Stop

653
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,180
Don't say anything

654
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,940
You don't need to prove anything

655
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,760
Don't set foot in the Jie's soul

656
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,320
King Qi

657
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,200
Don't go.

658
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Don't go.

659
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,440
Yingshu.

660
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,880
I don't want to lie to myself anymore.

661
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Yanzhi.

662
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
In your heart,

663
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,320
she is also

664
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,720
as important as you.

665
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,640
Yingshu.

666
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,800
I've prepared some medicines.

667
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,960
Let me see.

668
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,280
This is the deepest wound on my body.

669
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
Qingzhao, don't worry. I'm really fine.

670
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,480
Brother, you gave me medicine yesterday.

671
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,120
Qingzhao, thank you for your kindness.

672
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,640
Master,

673
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,080
it's really a bit exaggerated.

674
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,120
After I gave the killer to Yingshu yesterday,

675
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,480
I came to you immediately.

676
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,360
Brother Lu said you were asleep.

677
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,320
I couldn't bother you anymore.

678
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,600
I've been thinking about you.

679
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,080
Fortunately, you're fine.

680
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,840
It's okay. Sit down.

681
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,720
Sit down.

682
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,920
What happened yesterday?

683
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,240
Yesterday, I saw Xie Xi go to the back hill alone

684
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,360
and followed him secretly.

685
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,600
Who would have thought that was a trap he set for me?

686
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,200
Xie Xi led you there

687
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,160
and sent out the killer.

688
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,880
I didn't expect him to be so cruel.

689
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,920
I know it sounds like Xie Xi is trying to harm me.

690
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,320
But I don't think the killer and Xie Xi are a team.

691
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,440
That's right.

692
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,720
If Xie Xi wants to kill you,

693
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,680
he can lead you to the back hill and kill you directly.

694
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,600
There's no need to do it again.

695
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,720
It's a trap.

696
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,120
So you've thought about it.

697
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,480
Even if Xie Xi didn't want to kill you,

698
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,880
he was the one who caused the danger.

699
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,960
Besides, he didn't save you.

700
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
What does he have to do with you?

701
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,360
Besides,

702
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,240
if Xie Xi didn't want to kill Ming Shu,

703
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,480
who else would want to kill him?

704
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,920
I think the killer looks like

705
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,640
the person who chased me before.

706
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,160
To be honest,

707
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,000
someone wanted to stop me from investigating the case of En.

708
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,160
Ming Shu was also killed.

709
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
So I was very concerned about him.

710
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,440
I see.

711
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,560
Then I'll have to be more careful to protect Ming Shu.

712
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,320
Thank you, Brother Cong.

713
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,040
Now the academy is not a safe place for Ming Shu.

714
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
You clean up.

715
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,200
I'll send you back.

716
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,920
I don't want to go back.

717
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,960
It's not necessarily a good idea for Ming Shu to leave.

718
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,160
The killer was very aggressive in the academy.

719
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,560
If he leaves the academy,

720
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,120
what kind of danger will happen?

721
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,600
Brother Lu,

722
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,320
why don't you keep Ming Shu by your side and protect him?

723
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,160
Yes, Brother Cong.

724
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,280
I don't think I'll be safe if I go back.

725
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,240
Why don't you stay here?

726
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,280
I promise you

727
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,040
I'll be more careful.

728
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,480
But we have a deal.

729
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,880
You have to be careful.

730
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,880
You can't leave my sight.

731
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,840
I forgot to tell you something.

732
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,360
I'm sure Tang Sheng is a girl.

733
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,920
Why do you say that?

734
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,360
I touched her waist the other day.

735
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,440
It's soft and delicate.

736
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,160
It's clearly a girl.

737
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,320
Lu Cheng?

738
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,360
Wait.

739
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,400
You framed Ming Shu

740
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
and killed him.

741
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,360
You should be glad that Ming Shu

742
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,600
was killed by a slap.

743
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,480
Otherwise, it wouldn't be so easy.

744
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,360
Lu Cheng, are you crazy?

745
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,640
How dare you hit the same window?

746
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,680
You can go to the chief and report it.

747
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,600
There are some things

748
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,680
we can talk about

749
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
in front of the chief.

750
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Let go.

751
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,000
Remember,

752
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,520
if you dare to hurt Ming Shu,

753
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,440
I'll give up my body

754
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,200
and my family.

755
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,400
I see. I see. Let go.

756
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,040
What's your plan

757
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,200
about Tang Li?

758
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,520
It seems that it's a mutual affection.

759
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Stop talking nonsense.

760
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,920
I have my own arrangement.

761
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,720
Why do you have to worry about it?

762
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,960
You don't want to lose a good engagement

763
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,120
and you can't bear the softness of Tang Li.

764
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,880
You want to take advantage of both sides.

765
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,840
You're afraid that you'll be killed by the fire.

766
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,880
Lu Cheng, don't go too far.

767
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,840
I'm reminding you.

768
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,640
If you can't take responsibility,

769
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,800
you'd better tell Tang Li earlier.

770
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,440
I have no other choice.

771
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,840
Where did I make a mistake

772
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,840
that made Wen An chase me?

773
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,480
Brother Lu,

774
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,000
I didn't know that Xie Xi

775
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,120
would set up a trap to harm him.

776
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,160
When I found out, I stopped him.

777
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
But that killer

778
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,840
really had nothing to do with us.

779
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,680
I also wanted to save Ming Shu.

780
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,880
But I was

781
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,880
really helpless.

782
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,080
I know.

783
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,520
You told me that day

784
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,800
that Ming Shu was in the back hill.

785
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,040
I was really worried about him.

786
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,920
I never thought about hurting him.

787
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,040
Brother Lu,

788
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,920
I know you care about him.

789
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,680
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

790
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,560
What are you talking about?

791
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,280
Ming Shu.

792
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,160
Tang Sheng,

793
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,600
I know it's you.

794
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,320
Don't hide behind Brother Wuxian. Come out.

795
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,160
Brother Wuxian.

796
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,960
Brother Wuxian,

797
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,360
why did you meet him behind my back?

798
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,160
What's your secret?

799
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,400
Who is he?

800
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,840
I will explain it to you later.

801
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,080
Who is he?

802
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,240
Brother Lu, don't hide it from me.

803
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,080
Look at the situation.

804
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
I'm afraid Ming Shu has already noticed it.

805
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,760
I came with you today.

806
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,840
Yes.

807
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,080
I knew Brother Wuxian was hiding it from me.

808
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,920
I just don't understand

809
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,280
why he hid it from me.

810
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,680
Ming Shu,

811
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,800
I didn't tell you something

812
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,600
to protect you.

813
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,840
Sister Ming Shu,

814
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
don't blame him.

815
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,000
My real name is Su Tang Lin.

816
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,920
I'm the daughter of Su Changhua.

817
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,560
I escaped from death before.

818
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,880
I had to fake my identity

819
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,640
and hide in this school.

820
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,360
Once my identity is exposed,

821
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,000
I will be the best one

822
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,280
to take back the school.

823
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,720
Brother Lu had to hide it from you

824
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,120
for helping me.

825
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,280
Don't blame him.

826
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,000
Okay.

827
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,160
I won't tell him what you hid from me.

828
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,840
I was entrusted by the Lord of Wen'an.

829
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,080
Now,

830
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,240
I have to ask him something.

831
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,360
Okay.

832
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,280
Okay.

833
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,720
Sister Ming Shu, just ask.

834
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,880
I will tell you everything.

835
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,520
I know you have many troubles.

836
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
But do you know that

837
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,560
your relationship with Xie Xi

838
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,520
has hurt someone else?

839
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,000
I just want a place to settle down.

840
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,960
I never thought of hurting Lord Wen'an.

841
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,760
I never thought of competing with him.

842
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,160
For the Lord of Wen'an,

843
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,160
your appearance has ruined his marriage.

844
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,600
It's not something

845
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,360
that can be erased without thinking.

846
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,320
And Xie Xi

847
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,960
is not a good person.

848
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,920
If you are sober, you should end it quickly.

849
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,600
I just don't want to go back to the school

850
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,280
and suffer humiliation.

851
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,640
I can only take the life of others

852
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,880
and live a life of my own.

853
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,040
Ming Shu,

854
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,400
just pretend that you don't know this, okay?

855
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,720
I know you have troubles.

856
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,840
But this is not the reason

857
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,160
why you hurt others.

858
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,840
In this world,

859
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,640
I have no one to rely on.

860
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,760
Xie Xi is not

861
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,760
a good husband to me.

862
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,840
He is a life-saving straw.

863
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,640
Do you understand?

864
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,280
You have Xiong to protect you.

865
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,520
You have Di Qi to protect you.

866
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,080
But once my body is discovered,

867
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,680
I have no other choice.

868
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,680
It's wrong.

869
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,040
You don't have to find those reasons for yourself.

870
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,960
Xiong is hiding his business for you.

871
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,280
I have no obligation to cover for you.

872
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,240
Don't use your pitiful weapon.

873
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,280
I don't want to take it.

874
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,880
I'm sorry.

875
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,760
I'm sorry.

876
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,680
I'm sorry.

877
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,680
I'm sorry.

878
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,680
I'm sorry.

879
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,680
I'm sorry.

880
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,680
I'm sorry.

881
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,680
I'm sorry.

882
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,680
I'm sorry.

883
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,680
I'm sorry.

884
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,680
I'm sorry.

885
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,680
I'm sorry.

886
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,680
I'm sorry.

887
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,680
I'm sorry.

888
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
I'm sorry.

889
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
I'm sorry.

890
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,680
I'm sorry.

891
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
I'm sorry.

892
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
I'm sorry.

893
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,680
I'm sorry.

894
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,680
I'm sorry.

895
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,680
I'm sorry.

896
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,680
I'm sorry.

897
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,680
I'm sorry.

898
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,680
I'm sorry.

899
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,680
I'm sorry.

900
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,680
I'm sorry.

901
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,680
I'm sorry.

902
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,680
I'm sorry.

903
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,680
I'm sorry.

904
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:58,720
1,000 years later
