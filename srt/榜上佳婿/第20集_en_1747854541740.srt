42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The world makes me wonder when I'll return.

43
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The stars in the sun and the moon are like flowers.

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The night is like the rain.

45
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The night is like the rain.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A fire basin is scattered.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Two men wash the mirror.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Two men wash the mirror.

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Three men change new clothes and wash the mirror.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm fine.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm fine, mother.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Mother.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Uncle Lian,

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
help your brother remember his past life.

55
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
I'll racing to get rich

56
00:02:45,500 --> 00:03:08,720
to drive us

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,900
but we both lost control of our own.

58
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,660
I thought you got hurt so badly

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,180
no matter what I did to Brighten to you.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,040
The

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,520
demand is huge.

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,060
Here comes the sea-bone soup.

63
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,520
Stay there.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Stand still.

65
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,920
You're now injured.

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm delighted.

67
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,720
and to help my daughter recover.

68
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,160
Besides,

69
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
tomorrow is the provincial day.

70
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,320
We need to ask for an urgent edict.

71
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:18,920
Wait for it.

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,960
These days,

73
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,120
I've made you worried.

74
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,600
Xiong.

75
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,960
Xiong.

76
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,280
Slow down.

77
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm embarrassed to ask you

78
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,920
how you're feeling

79
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,400
after I saw you there.

80
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,120
Do I look like I'm in trouble?

81
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,840
But you...

82
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,440
Does it hurt?

83
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,720
It did hurt a little before.

84
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,000
But after Xiong came back,

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,920
it doesn't hurt anymore.

86
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
You're still smiling.

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,320
It's all because I was in prison

88
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,400
and couldn't protect you in time.

89
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,440
I can't guarantee

90
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
that Xiong will protect you

91
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,800
in this dangerous situation.

92
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,440
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,280
But you have to take care of yourself.

94
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,160
Do you hear me?

95
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,320
Xiong.

96
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,440
When I was in a coma,

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,760
I had a dream.

98
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,880
I dreamed of

99
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,040
a man

100
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,040
who loved me so much.

101
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,200
I could feel his warmth

102
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,640
even in my dream.

103
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,120
He did everything for me.

104
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,400
He was like

105
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,880
a kind father.

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,520
But I couldn't see his face clearly.

107
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,640
Do you think he's our father?

108
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,400
Maybe.

109
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,440
It might just be a dream.

110
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,080
I dreamed of you?

111
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,760
Me?

112
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,400
You were so mean to me.

113
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,240
You even drove me away

114
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
when I gave you food.

115
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,080
It was just a dream.

116
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,280
How could Xiong be like that?

117
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,440
Yishu.

118
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,680
It was my fault

119
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
in the past.

120
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
I made you sad.

121
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
What's wrong with you?

122
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,160
What are you talking about?

123
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,280
What's wrong?

124
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,680
I'll go check on my mother.

125
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,920
Pen, ink, paper, ink.

126
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,120
Dried food, candle, oil cloth.

127
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,160
Are they all ready?

128
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,080
Yes.

129
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,680
By the way,

130
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,720
there's a small hand stove

131
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,080
that Ming Shu prepared for you.

132
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,080
They're all ready.

133
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,160
It's three days and nights.

134
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,440
Check it again.

135
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,280
I've checked it several times.

136
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,160
Don't worry, mother.

137
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,720
I'll give you a big blessing.

138
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,880
What do you think?

139
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,000
Master,

140
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,360
why don't you go there?

141
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
Although my mother is angry with me,

142
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,680
she'll come

143
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
to save me today.

144
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,880
If I go there without permission,

145
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,280
I'll be rude to Ming Shu.

146
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,160
I see.

147
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,000
I saw him.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,840
What are you doing?

149
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,440
Don't go.

150
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,800
What?

151
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,800
She's a woman.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,240
She's rebellious and leaves home.

153
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,120
If you go,

154
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,440
we'll be in a bad position.

155
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,440
I'll go check

156
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,000
if she's prepared for it.

157
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
I haven't prepared it

158
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
and given it to her yet.

159
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
She's a rebellious girl.

160
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,200
You...

161
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,080
What's she doing?

162
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,400
You're so stubborn.

163
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,280
If you don't want to go,

164
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,320
even a horse can't

165
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,480
pull you over.

166
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,480
You can't go to see her.

167
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,200
I'll go, okay?

168
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,120
Mother.

169
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,880
Qingzhao,

170
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,000
I've prepared some things for you.

171
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,000
Come on.

172
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,240
Your father is here, too.

173
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,440
What's wrong with him?

174
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,560
I understand.

175
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,480
Good monk, enter.

176
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,480
Slow down.

177
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,240
Mother is waiting for you.

178
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,440
Hurry up.

179
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,360
Go.

180
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,400
Brother Lu.

181
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,360
Brother Song.

182
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,200
Last time, my sister was in danger.

183
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,960
Thanks to your help,

184
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,680
I'm able to remember it.

185
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,320
We're friends.

186
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,920
You're my best friend.

187
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,040
You don't have to thank me.

188
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,760
Tianzhi.

189
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,160
What's this?

190
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,080
This is the wish-fulfilling talisman

191
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,760
my sister made at the Buddha temple.

192
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,800
It's also the wish-fulfilling talisman at the Buddha temple?

193
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,200
Yes.

194
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,280
Tianzi, number seven.

195
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,080
Li Zi, number nine.

196
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,640
Help me, my brother.

197
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,240
showed us mercy

198
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,160
and banked on our estates.

199
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,640
Have mercy on my son.

200
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,600
Let's have good meals and drinks,

201
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,520
remember our parents' words.

Thank you.

Drikan.

Bless Qingcheng.

Moon Gate

208
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,640
If you don't want to pack up,

209
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
then shut your mouth.

210
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,880
Who said I don't want to pack up?

211
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
May the Buddha of the Empty Waves,

212

all the Bodhisattvas,

and all the disciples,

214
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
bless my son to be successful,

215
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,680
and help us to make a good family.

216
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
It's like a picture of a flower.

217
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,680
It's like a picture of a flower.

218
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,680
It's the same.

219
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,680
The red flowers on the palm of your hand,

220
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,680
I ask who left it.

221
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,680
The blood is red, the heart is blue,

222
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
and the heart is black.

223
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
Missing you is like a flower,

224
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,680
like a flower, like a flower.

225
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,240
The

226
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,680
only way to reach the end of the world is through a dream.

227
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,680
I don't regret the winter sun,

228
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
the moon has never been so bright.

229
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
The stars are in the sky,

230
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,680
afraid that the wind will blow the wings of the snow.

231
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
The moon is in the sky,

232
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
suddenly the world is too quiet.

233
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,680
The four seasons have been so stupid.

234
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
The red flowers on the palm of your hand,

235
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
I ask who left it.

236
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
The red flowers on the palm of your hand,

237
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
I ask who left it.

238
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
The sun and the moon are like stars without flowers,

239
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,680
the night is like a cloud in the sky.

240
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,680
I don't regret the winter sun,

241
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
the moon has never been so bright.

242
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
The stars are in the sky,

243
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,680
afraid that the wind will blow the wings of the snow.

244
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
But fate is in the air,

245
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,680
suddenly the world is too quiet.

246
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,680
The four seasons have been so stupid.

247
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
The red flowers on the palm of your hand,

248
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
I ask who left it.

249
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
The red flowers on the palm of your hand,

250
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
I ask who left it.

251
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
The sun and the moon are like stars without flowers,

252
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,680
the night is like a cloud in the sky.

253
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
Min Shu,

254
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,680
I have figured it out.

255
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Only by being strong and powerful,

256
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,680
I can fight with you.

257
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
Come out.

258
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
Come out.

259
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Come out.

260
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Come out.

261
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
Come out.

262
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
Come out.

263
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
Ah Xiang.

264
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
Where is mother?

265
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Mother is making soup for you at home.

266
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
She said you couldn't sleep well these days.

267
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
You are really thin.

268
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
How is the exam?

269
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,680
I dare not talk about it.

270
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
I can only wait for the result.

271
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
It's okay.

272
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
I prayed with mother at home day and night these days.

273
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
I must be able to do it.

274
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
I saw you.

275
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
Find Qing Zhao.

276
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
I didn't see her when I entered the field.

277
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
I don't know how she did in the exam.

278
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
With her talent,

279
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
she must have done well in the exam.

280
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
She asked us to leave first.

281
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
Let's go first.

282
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Brother Ying is here too.

283
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Young Master.

284
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Young Master.

285
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Lu Niangzi and Xiu Mei have left.

286
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Okay.

287
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
Let's go find them later.

288
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Let's go.

289
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Lala.

290
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
Let's go.

291
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,680
Su Lanyan, come on.

292
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
What are you doing?

293
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
What's wrong?

294
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
If you don't see her,

295
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
I will leave the house too.

296
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
From now on, you are the only one left in Song's Mansion.

297
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
I'll see which one you are ashamed of.

298
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Let's go.

299
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Hurry up.

300
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,680
Don't pull the cart.

301
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
Don't be so slow.

302
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Hurry up.

303
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
Father.

304
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
Mother.

305
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,680
Qing Zhao.

306
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
Why are you all thinner?

307
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
Well...

308
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
Anyway,

309
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
you've worked hard.

310
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
Well...

311
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
Let's go home.

312
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
Your father has already spoken.

313
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
Hurry up and go back to the mansion.

314
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
I'll make up for you.

315
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Let's go, Master.

316
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
Hurry up.

317
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Master.

318
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
My son has suffered a lot these days.

319
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Ming Shu.

320
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Mother.

321
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Your clothes are dry.

322
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
Come on.

323
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Thank you, Mother.

324
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
This is...

325
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
This is a gift from Qing Zhao.

326
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,680
I'm thinking of finding a time to send it back to her.

327
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Ming Shu.

328
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
You are a smart kid.

329
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Whether it's a post,

330
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
or a heart-calming pill,

331
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
or even taking care of you without leaving you,

332
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,680
all the famous people are watching you.

333
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,680
But if you don't express your feelings,

334
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
it's not reasonable.

335
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,680
I've always been relaxed and free with her.

336
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
But if I have to say something else,

337
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
I don't think I'm free.

338
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
If you really want to be with her,

339
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
I'll try my best to help you.

340
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
But if you hesitate,

341
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
you should keep a proper distance from her.

342
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
In case of misunderstanding,

343
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,680
it will only increase your burden.

344
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
I understand.

345
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Have a good rest.

346
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,680
Qing Zhao is a rare and beautiful girl.

347
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680
She's the most rare beauty in the world.

348
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,680
But I'm not interested in her.

349
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
My feelings toward Meng Zhongren

350
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
are not so deep.

351
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
What are you talking about?

352
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
I'm talking about Ming Shu.

353
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
What's the matter?

354
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
You asked me to come here in secret.

355
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
What's the matter?

356
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
After what happened,

357
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
I want to understand one thing.

358
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
I can't lose Ming Shu.

359
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
I can't.

360
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
As your brother,

361
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
I'll support you.

362
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
But now, Ming Shu is your sister.

363
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
What if you give up on her?

364
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
I know.

365
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
I'll do it myself.

366
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
She told me that she dreamed of the past.

367
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Even at that moment,

368
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
I hope she can regain her memory.

369
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Then I can walk to her face.

370
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
But now you're her brother.

371
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
You two are impossible.

372
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
You two are impossible.

373
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Unless you tell her the truth.

374
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
No.

375
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
If she knows that her family is ruined,

376
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
her family is ruined,

377
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
I don't know what she'll do.

378
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
I can't take the risk.

379
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Then...

380
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Or you can say she picked it up.

381
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Anyway, you don't know about her background.

382
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Isn't this a good way to end it?

383
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
No.

384
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
I don't care about her feelings.

385
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
I can't be so selfish.

386
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Look at you.

387
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
You can't do this or that.

388
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
If you keep hesitating,

389
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
Ming Shu will be taken away by Song Qingzhao sooner or later.

390
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Don't come to me to cry.

391
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
If she still has feelings for Song Qingzhao,

392
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
maybe I can find the chance.

393
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
But there is one condition.

394
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
You can't hurt her.

395
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
I...

396
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,680
It seems that my cousin is finally out.

397
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Ming Shu,

398
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
I've been wanting to ask you.

399
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,680
What do you think of my cousin?

400
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
I don't know.

401
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
I just want to know

402
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
what you think of my cousin.

403
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
What do you think of my cousin?

404
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
What do you think of my cousin?

405
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
What do you think of my cousin?

406
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
I haven't thought about it yet.

407
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,680
We all know that she has feelings for you.

408
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Especially those days when you were in a coma.

409
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
She took good care of you.

410
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
It's also touching.

411
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
If you can be a couple,

412
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
we will be happy for you.

413
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
I just don't know what you're worried about.

414
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
We are close friends.

415
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
I won't hide it.

416
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,680
I treat Qingzhao

417
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
as my own brother.

418
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Although I have thought about the possibility of marriage,

419
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,680
I still can't find any traces of love in my heart.

420
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
I don't think

421
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,680
we should mix friendship with love.

422
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
What do you think?

423
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
I'll say it first.

424
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
If you can be a couple,

425
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
we are relatives.

426
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
But whether it works or not,

427
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
it depends on you.

428
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Even if you are not my cousin,

429
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
you are also our best friend.

430
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Wen An, thank you.

431
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
We support you

432
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
no matter what you decide.

433
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
You are so nice.

434
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
We are going to prepare for an accident.

435
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Go to do your work.

436
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Uncle Ming.

437
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Qing...

438
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Qingzhao.

439
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
You are here.

440
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
I have something to tell you.

441
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Then you have a good talk.

442
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
We are leaving.

443
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
It seems that I have to be sad.

444
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
Here.

445
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
It's dry and dirty.

446
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
This is...

447
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
I think Old Li coughs a lot.

448
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Make some pear soup to warm him up.

449
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
You have it too.

450
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Aunt Li.

451
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Come on.

452
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
Don't mind it.

453
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
I'm afraid I'm confused again.

454
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
My fault.

455
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Come on.

456
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Aunt Li.

457
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Have some pear soup.

458
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Come on.

459
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,680
Come on.

460
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Drink it while it's hot.

461
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
Come on.

462
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
This...

463
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Old Li is still clean.

464
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
I'm afraid the soup will be spilled on his clothes.

465
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Right?

466
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
I understand.

467
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
In this world,

468
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
there is no one else

469
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,680
who can do this kind of detail.

470
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
It's a small thing.

471
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Don't worry.

472
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Don't just stand there.

473
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Drink it while it's hot.

474
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
Come on.

475
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
We have to finish it.

476
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Finish it all.

477
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
There's still so much.

478
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Finish it all.

479
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Qingzhao.

480
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
Thank you for

481
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,680
calling Ning Xinwan to save my life.

482
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
And you took good care of me.

483
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
I heard it all.

484
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
Thank you so much.

485
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
Uncle Mi.

486
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,680
You don't have to thank me.

487
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
And...

488
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
This is...

489
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
This is the dress you made

490
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
in Flower Pavilion.

491
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I know its value.

492
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
And I secretly made a guess

493
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
behind its meaning.

494
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
But I can't

495
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
respond to your heart.

496
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
You want to return it to me?

497
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
I...

498
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
Qingzhao.

499
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
You're really nice.

500
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
I'm very honored

501
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
to get along with you.

502
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
But...

503
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
We...

504
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,680
We're not that kind of...

505
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Then...

506
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Can I think that way?

507
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
You like me as a person.

508
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
You like me as a companion.

509
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
But you haven't decided

510
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,680
whether you should take me as your husband.

511
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Should you take me as your husband?

512
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
I'm sorry, Qingzhao.

513
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
You've done so much for me.

514
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
But I...

515
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
I...

516
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Uncle Mi.

517
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
You can't mix your love and affection.

518
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
I don't want you

519
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
to feel burdened.

520
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
I won't force you to make a decision.

521
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
You and I

522
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
should get along as usual.

523
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
It's better to get along as usual.

524
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Do you really think so?

525
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
I'm happy to have you.

526
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
If I can't,

527
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
it's your freedom.

528
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
I won't blame anyone.

529
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Thank you, Qingzhao.

530
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
Then...

531
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
The gift has been given.

532
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
I can't take it back.

533
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
If one day,

534
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
you really meet your husband,

535
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
you can return it to me.

536
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Uncle Mi.

537
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Brother, why are you here?

538
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
I'm here to see you.

539
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
What for?

540
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
It's a secret.

541
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
Brother Song,

542
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
I'll take Uncle Mi away.

543
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Excuse me.

544
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Let's go.

545
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Brother Song, what's going on?

546
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Why didn't you tell me?

547
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
You're already doing it?

548
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,680
You're here to see me?

549
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Can't I?

550
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,680
From what I know about you,

551
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,680
I don't think you like to go shopping.

552
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
It's good that you like it.

553
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,680
I mean,

554
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
I was busy with my study.

555
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,680
I didn't have time to go shopping.

556
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
But,

557
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,680
I was busy with my study.

558
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
I'll spend more time with you.

559
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,680
How can I miss the delicious and fun?

560
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
The soup in front is very delicious.

561
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
Go and have a taste.

562
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Brother, you must have taken the wrong medicine.

563
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
Why are you holding my hand?

564
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Come and have a look.

565
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
What do you want to eat?

566
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
The pancakes here are delicious.

567
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Give me a pancake.

568
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Okay.

569
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,680
And a red bean soup.

570
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
Okay.

571
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
You've been here?

572
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,680
I came here with Qingzhao when I just came to Beijing.

573
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
Why did I choose such a shop?

574
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,680
Brother, what did you say?

575
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,680
Didn't you say you wanted to drink some soup?

576
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Have you heard of regret soup?

577
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Regret soup?

578
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
Regret soup?

579
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
It's said that if you drink this soup,

580
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
you can get rid of your regret.

581
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
There's such a saying in the world?

582
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
I don't believe it.

583
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Besides,

584
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
why regret it in the first place?

585
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
In my opinion,

586
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
I should let the regretted people suffer more

587
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
so that they can learn a lesson.

588
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
The lesson is already very heavy.

589
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
You have to be kind.

590
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
You're right, brother.

591
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,680
Yes.

592
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
Do you still drink regret soup?

593
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
No.

594
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
I'll have some of your sweetest desserts.

595
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
Okay.

596
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Mrs. Zhu.

597
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
Why is there no music today?

598
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
There's something at the musician's house today.

599
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
I can't come.

600
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
It's the Phoenix King.

601
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
This song is full of love.

602
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
If I'm not mistaken,

603
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
I'm afraid it's not expressing my feelings to you.

604
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
How could it be?

605
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
He's my brother.

606
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
I'm being impolite.

607
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Don't blame me.

608
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
But this kind of music

609
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
will definitely hide someone in your brother's heart.

610
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
Enjoy.

611
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
Enjoy.

612
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Do you have someone in mind?

613
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Mingshu.

614
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Have you ever thought

615
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
not to call me brother?

616
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Not to call you brother?

617
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Then what should I do?

618
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
What should you do?

619
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Call me Brother A Chang

620
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
or Lu Chang.

621
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
Brother A Chang?

622
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Brother A Chang!

623
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
I'm sorry.

624
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,680
I'm sorry.

625
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Mingshu.

626
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
I regret it.

627
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,680
Brother A Chang.

628
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Let's go home.

629
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,680
Brother A Chang.

630
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Brother A Chang.

631
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Thank you, Brother Wei.

632
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Mother.

633
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
Mother.

634
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
This is...

635
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
This is

636
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,680
the uncle who saved your mother.

637
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
I, Lu Chang,

638
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
thank you for saving my mother.

639
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Don't mention it.

640
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
Since I've brought your mother back to the mansion safely,

641
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
I'll leave now.

642
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
I'll come back another day.

643
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
He's a good man.

644
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
He's a good man.

645
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
A hero saves a beauty.

646
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
It's a coincidence.

647
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
It's a story in the script.

648
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
You two

649
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,680
are even fighting to get your mother back.

650
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
If your mother meets someone who's destined to be,

651
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
will you support her or not?

652
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
If mother likes it,

653
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
I have nothing to say.

654
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
But why are you so anxious about this?

655
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
Mother.

656
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
May I ask

657
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
where Mr. Lu is?

658
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
I'm Lu Chang.

659
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
And

660
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,680
congratulations to Mr. Lu.

661
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
You've won the membership of this season.

662
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,680
I'm here to congratulate you.

663
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
Thank you.

664
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Did I hear it right?

665
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
Are you really a member?

666
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Absolutely.

667
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
You're Mr. Lu, the leader of the team.

668
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
If you win the membership,

669
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
you'll be the champion of this season.

670
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
Thank you, Mr. Guanchao.

671
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Thank you.

672
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,680
Chang.

673
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
It's a promise.

674
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Xiu.

675
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
Young Master.

676
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,680
Young Master.

677
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,680
If you take this wine and air back,

678
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,680
Madam will definitely be very warm.

679
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,680
Aren't you happy?

680
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
Drink more.

681
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,680
If others are high,

682
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
I don't know how happy they will be.

683
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,680
But you've lost a lot of weight.

684
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,680
How can you be happy?

685
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
You're obviously drinking and fighting.

686
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
Ming Shu is the motivation for me to enter the world.

687
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
If I can't marry her,

688
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
what's the point of being high?

689
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
Why are you so angry?

690
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,680
Maybe she's just being stubborn.

691
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
She won't be like this.

692
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,680
I'm afraid she really doesn't mean anything to me.

693
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
Are you going to give up like this?

694
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,680
No.

695
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
Young Master.

696
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
Think about it.

697
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,680
The man around Ming Shu

698
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,680
is not only Mr. Lu's brother,

699
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
but also someone else.

700
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,680
When the wedding is coming,

701
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
the first one to think of Mr. Lu is going to be...

702
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
You're right.

703
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,680
If there's a chance,

704
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,680
I can't give up.

705
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
Now I have to enter the world

706
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,680
to live a family-like life.

707
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
As long as Ming Shu marries me,

708
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,680
I can marry her.

709
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,680
That's right.

710
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
Come on. Since you're happy,

711
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
let's have a drink.

712
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,680
What are you drinking?

713
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,680
Go back to the mansion.

714
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
I'm going to find Ming Shu.

715
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Well...

716
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
Okay.

717
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,680
Brother, you're really a smart man.

718
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
You don't look like

719
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
a young master at all.

720
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
Luckily, I didn't go to see him today.

721
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
Otherwise,

722
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
he must have been caught.

723
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,680
But I heard that you're a fast-growing man.

724
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
It's easier to be a disciple.

725
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,680
I will never use marriage

726
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,680
to exchange for a rich disciple.

727
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,680
A wife is a wife.

728
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
A wife is a wife.

729
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,680
It must be a love affair.

730
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
Don't you hate it?

731
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
And then?

732
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Love is love.

733
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,680
You don't live for gratitude.

734
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,680
You don't fight for worldly things.

735
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,680
You don't live for wealth.

736
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,680
You don't live for your disciples.

737
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,680
Good job.

738
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
You're really a smart man.

739
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
I'll beat him up if anyone dares to marry you.

740
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,680
Follow me.

741
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,680
Don't do anything.

742
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Just look at me.

743
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
It's been a long time since I saw Mr. Song.

744
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
Congratulations to you, too.

745
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
Thank you, Zeng Yi.

746
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
They're all in Chang's room.

747
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
Come with me.

748
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
Grandma,

749
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,680
there's still a neck size difference.

750
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
Mr. Song is here.

751
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Qingzhao,

752
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
I'm giving Xiu Liang a neck size.

753
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,680
Have you prepared the new clothes for your father?

754
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,680
Stay for dinner.

755
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,680
OK.

756
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,680
Congratulations on becoming a student.

757
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
The official has also issued a decree

758
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,680
to appoint me as the Minister of Rites.

759
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
Congratulations to King Rui for getting the chance to make a wish.

760
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
Brother Lu,

761
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
you've been thinking about the case of the late teacher.

762
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
Finally, the day has come.

763
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
Thank you for your kind words.

764
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
King Rui,

765
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
I have something important to report.

766
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,680
Can I have a word with you?

767
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
It's a secret.

768
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
When the time comes,

769
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
I'll tell you.

770
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
In that case,

771
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
I'll leave first.

772
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
It's good

773
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
that you can go to the Flower Pavilion

774
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
to help sell the ashes.

775
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,680
Thank you.

776
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
Thank you.

777
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
How do you think

778
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
of today's auction?

779
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,680
Today's flower girls are so lively.

780
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Right?

781
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,680
I hope

782
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,680
all the family members of the court are here.

783
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
Right.

784
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
Now the spring festival is coming.

785
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
Last year, there were five victims of the drought.

786
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,680
The owner of the Flower Pavilion,

787
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,680
Miss Ming Shu,

788
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,680
knew about this.

789
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
She took the initiative to hold a auction.

790
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,680
What a great deal.

791
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,680
She will record the price one by one

792
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
to help the victims.

793
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
We should support

794
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
such a great cause.

795
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
Right.

796
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
It's a great deal to get King Rui's approval.

797
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
There must be something to be gained.

798
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
We should go and see.

799
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,680
The auction will be recorded.

800
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,680
We can't be left behind.

801
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
Right.

802
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Everyone, go and have a look.

803
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,680
Please follow me.

804
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,680
Let's go.

805
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Please.

806
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,680
Look at this hairpin.

807
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
This is the latest style.

808
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,680
Our shop is the best in the whole capital.

809
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
Really?

810
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
Look at this.

811
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,680
It's beautiful.

812
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,680
It's so colorful.

813
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
There are few people

814
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
at the auction today.

815
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
Let's go and find them.

816
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
We haven't found Miss Ming Shu yet.

817
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,680
Young Master,

818
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
you've been caught by someone.

819
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,680
I heard that you are a high-ranking scholar.

820
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
I haven't had the chance to pay my respects to you.

821
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680
Please don't mind.

822
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Thank you for your kindness.

823
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
But I have something important to do today.

824
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
I won't accompany you.

825
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Goodbye.

826
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,680
You don't care about your identity.

827
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
You live in the Jiang family.

828
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,680
You dare to be jealous of Mr. Song.

829
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Mr. Song.

830
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
Ming Shu.

831
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,680
You've been looking for me?

832
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,680
Where can I help you?

833
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,680
Please tell me.

834
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,680
I'm fine.

835
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
If you have time,

836
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
you can help me.

837
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,680
It should be there.

838
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
No problem.

839
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
This...

840
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,680
What is Miss Ming Shu doing?

841
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,680
Wait a minute.

842
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,680
I have something to ask you.

843
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
Please go ahead.

844
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,680
I didn't help Mr. Su

845
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,680
in his death.

846
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,680
You never hate me?

847
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
I've thought about it.

848
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
What do you think?

849
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
The new teacher was framed.

850
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,680
The evidence is clear.

851
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,680
If the general pleads,

852
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
he is afraid of the court's dispute.

853
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
He also opposes the new teacher.

854
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
He is fierce.

855
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
The new teacher's suicide

856
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,680
has been taking over Ning Yuan.

857
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,680
He wants to protect you

858
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,680
and give you a chance.

859
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,680
That's right.

860
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,680
I was in a hurry.

861
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,680
Mr. Su

862
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
wants to sacrifice himself

863
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
to open the way for the new teacher.

864
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Now King of Rui is trying to

865
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
win the favor of Zhao Xue.

866
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,680
He knows it.

867
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,680
He is willing to do it.

868
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
Tell me.

869
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,680
What do you want to talk to me alone?

870
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,680
Please forgive me.

871
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,680
I'm not a brother and sister with Ming Shu.
