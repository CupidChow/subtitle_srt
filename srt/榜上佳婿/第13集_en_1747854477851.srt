Voluntary grace

Will the

00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,380
I will write a letter to the wind and the flowers

4
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,380
I will tie the knot and leave no red flowers

5
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,380
I will ask who will stay with me

00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,380
I will write a letter to the wind and leave no red flowers

00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,380
I will ask who will stay with me

00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:29,380
The Long Ballad

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,380
Episode 2

30
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,380
There are more dishes?

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,380
Uncle Ming, the dishes are all served.

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,380
So rich.

33
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,380
I asked the kitchen to make the most popular dish.

34
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,380
Try this lamb first.

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,380
And this thin skin bun.

36
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,380
This is the best.

37
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,380
What's wrong with you?

38
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,380
Cold water.

39
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,380
Cold water?

40
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,380
Brother Song.

41
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,380
Are you here?

42
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,380
Uncle Luo.

43
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,380
I'm here.

44
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,380
Hide.

45
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,380
Hide.

46
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,380
Brother Song.

47
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,380
I'm here.

48
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,380
Brother Song.

49
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,380
Are you okay?

50
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,380
I'm fine.

51
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,380
Sorry.

52
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,380
There seems to be a problem with the door.

53
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,380
I asked someone to fix it.

54
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,380
Why didn't you come for dinner?

55
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,380
Is there something wrong with your body?

56
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,380
So many dishes.

57
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,380
It seems that Brother Song has a good appetite.

58
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,380
I'm fine.

59
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,380
I will have a small stove every now and then.

60
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,380
I'm worried about Brother Lu.

61
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,380
Why are you alone?

62
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,380
Where is Uncle?

63
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,380
He... He went out.

64
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,380
Actually, I just want to ask.

65
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,380
How did Ming Shu...

66
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,380
You...

67
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,380
It's nothing.

68
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,380
Brother Lu, don't worry.

69
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,380
I don't know if Brother Lu has eaten.

70
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,380
Why don't we sit down and eat together?

71
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,380
Okay.

72
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,380
But I think Brother Lu should have eaten at this time.

73
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,380
Brother Lu is busy at night.

74
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,380
I won't keep Brother Lu.

75
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,380
Excuse me.

76
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,380
Brother Lu, take care.

77
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,380
Brother Lu, take care.

78
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,380
Are you okay?

79
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,380
Why is there no sound in Rui Wan's room?

80
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
Don't look at it again.

81
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,380
Didn't she say she wouldn't come again in the future?

82
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,380
In the future,

83
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,380
arrange this room according to Yin's habit.

84
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,380
The day is yours.

85
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,380
What's comfortable, what's not.

86
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,380
Then you bring all those drawings?

87
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,380
Bring all.

88
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,380
And my calligraphy.

89
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,380
I'll bring it to you.

90
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,380
I'll bring it to you.

91
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,380
And my calligraphy.

92
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,380
Bring all the boxes and boxes used.

93
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,380
Arrange it all.

94
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,380
Then Rui Wan's things...

95
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,380
Find a box and put it in.

96
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,380
Send it to the study the next day.

97
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
In case you come back and forth.

98
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,380
It's annoying.

99
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,380
Okay.

100
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,380
King, the princess is in a deep sleep.

101
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,380
Oh.

102
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,380
Since ancient times,

103
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,380
women take men as their heaven.

104
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,380
The princess doesn't ask you if you go back to your room.

105
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,380
Sleep alone.

106
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,380
I told her that night.

107
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,380
Marriage has nothing to do with feelings.

108
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,380
I have nothing to do with her.

109
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,380
But a normal woman smells this.

110
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,380
She must be worried about it.

111
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,380
It doesn't look like it.

112
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,380
It's so bright.

113
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,380
Besides, King.

114
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,380
You just wanted to make her bright.

115
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,380
If she reacts like this,

116
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,380
This...

117
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,380
It's good.

118
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,380
Even if we get married,

119
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,380
my life hasn't changed.

120
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,380
What do I look like?

121
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,380
King, you're as handsome as a crown.

122
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,380
These years,

123
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,380
I've been followed by women.

124
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,380
Of course.

125
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,380
But the princess doesn't know this.

126
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,380
Min Shu.

127
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,380
You are cold.

128
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,380
You are decisive and unwavering.

129
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,380
The enemy has been favored by his family since childhood.

130
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,380
You don't care about the situation.

131
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,380
I really envy you.

132
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,380
Although I lost my memory,

133
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,380
you're right.

134
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,380
My mother and brother

135
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,380
love me very much.

136
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,380
What about you?

137
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,380
You've been a good boy since you were a child.

138
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,380
You should be happy.

139
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,380
I was taught by my father since I was a child.

140
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Everything was arranged by my father.

141
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,380
I almost didn't

142
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,380
do one thing in my own way.

143
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,380
Until now,

144
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,380
I've been worried about you.

145
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,380
I can't be as handsome as you.

146
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,380
That's why I really envy you.

147
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,380
Yun Shu.

148
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,380
Yun Shu.

149
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,380
Why do you say this?

150
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,380
The only reason is regret.

151
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,380
Why do you say

152
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,380
country can't build by force?

153
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,280
Why is government

154
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:50,820
held or

155
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,740
no family in power.

156
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,300
Why is family the alcohol in the world?

157
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,200
Arrogant,

158
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,280
the country is in crisis.

159
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,080
The one who is the king of the country of the Qing Dynasty will be the home of the thousand saints.

160
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,240
The one who is the king of the country of the Qing Dynasty will be the home of the thousand saints.

161
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,880
The Qing Dynasty and Lu Chang

162
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,800
are both great talents.

163
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,880
They are both great talents.

164
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:28,920
Your Highness.

165
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,800
It's time to change the clothes.

166
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,920
Yes.

167
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
Your Highness, it's time to go to the court.

168
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,200
This is the water of the Xinji River.

169
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,680
Your Highness, please prepare it.

170
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,160
Change the clothes.

171
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm here to help you change the clothes.

172
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,920
Go.

173
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
You don't have to worry about these things.

174
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,640
Let others do it.

175
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,400
My father used to be

176
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,240
carried by my mother.

177
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,880
Now I'm the princess.

178
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,600
I should change the clothes for you.

179
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,120
It's a hassle to wear the official clothes.

180
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,800
Please don't worry about it.

181
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,280
You know it's a hassle.

182
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,680
If you don't know how to do it,

183
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
you don't have to force yourself.

184
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,960
We all know fried fish andoo the first with sauce

185
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,480
to make it taste like Goji.

186
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,320
This is Owu Dis�� actually

187
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,760
a recipe for alone cooking

188
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,000
for Alph satram and his host.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,280
But this will be easy.

190
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:18,040
People's Book of Nature

191
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,880
Good.

192
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,200
I'm sleepy.

193
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,120
Let's go back.

194
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,760
Okay.

195
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,600
Do you think the Princess

196
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,840
asked me to change my mind?

197
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,520
I dare not say that.

198
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,440
I order you to say it.

199
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,520
I think the Princess didn't do it on purpose.

200
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,520
It seems to be a fair and just act.

201
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,600
Nonsense.

202
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,160
Qinlink.

203
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,240
Qin Burong.

204
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Xingzhao, you left so early?

205
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
I went out to practice.

206
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Uncle Ming, I'll clean up.

207
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
It's time to go to the school.

208
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,280
You usually do this job for me, right?

209
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Now that I'm your student,

210
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
I'll do this job.

211
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Thank you.

212
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
You're welcome.

213
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
You moved for a night.

214
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Just take it as a reward.

215
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
You said there was no problem with Xie Xi.

216
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Yes.

217
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Yes.

218
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
We're in the academy.

219
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,280
We're at the four o'clock line of the library.

220
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
If there's a little lady,

221
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
how can she not be known by others?

222
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,280
There's a little lady who's been hidden by you.

223
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
No one has found out that she's here to comb your hair.

224
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
So,

225
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,280
you can't make a conclusion before you know the truth.

226
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Does it hurt?

227
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
No.

228
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
I'm an unworthy comb.

230
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
I think it's pretty good.

231
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Pretty good.

232
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Very...

233
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
characteristic.

234
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
That's it.

235
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
You're going to class like this?

236
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
I'm not thirsty in the future.

237
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
I'm thirsty.

238
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
I'm sorry.

241
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
I'm sorry.

244
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,280
It seems that the master is not well.

246
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
He can't even keep his hair.

247
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
What's wrong?

248
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
I'm very satisfied with this hair.

249
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
OK.

250
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Mr. Song.

251
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Today's style is really not ordinary.

252
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Mr. Song.

253
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Is the master not well?

254
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Yes.

255
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
There's no clue in the academy.

256
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,280
There's no trace of Xie Xi in other places.

257
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
Where can I find clues?

258
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
Who?

259
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
You say me.

260
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
It's me.

261
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
There's a clue.

262
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
I just heard Xie Xi and Shu Tong say

263
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
they're going out to meet a friend.

264
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
There are a lot of people in the academy.

265
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
It's not convenient for him to see anyone.

266
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
There are not so many people outside the academy.

267
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Did he say where?

268
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
It seems to be by the Yongqing River.

269
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Yongqing River.

270
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Yongqing River.

271
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
I think it's a little bit far.

272
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Yongqing River.

273
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Who is Xie Xi talking to?

274
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
It's too far.

275
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
But it's really a girl.

276
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
I can't hear what they're saying.

277
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
There must be a trace of this.

278
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
Let's go.

279
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
Let's go, Song Xiao.

280
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Look at this.

281
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
This is...

282
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
This is...

283
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
The sign of the academy.

284
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
This is not a student's sign.

285
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,280
It must be left by that girl.

286
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Maybe

287
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
this girl is hiding in this academy.

288
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Now I can find out who that girl is.

289
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
But it's a little bit of a mystery.

290
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
What's wrong?

291
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Nothing.

292
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
Uncle Lian.

293
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
I heard my brother call me.

294
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Brother Lu.

295
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Brother Lu, calm down.

296
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Uncle Lian.

297
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Uncle Lian.

298
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Brother Lian.

299
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Why are you here?

300
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
I came to see you.

301
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Go.

302
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Uncle Lian.

303
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
I...

304
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Lu Ming Shu.

305
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
You know the consequences of the rumors of the Yingshu Army.

306
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
If the rumors are spread,

307
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
how will you stand in the capital?

308
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Brother Lu.

309
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Brother Lu.

310
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
You blame me.

311
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
You're afraid that people won't find out, aren't you?

312
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,280
Leave now.

313
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Qingzhou, you go back first.

314
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
I'll explain to my brother.

315
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
Okay.

316
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
I'll come with you.

317
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
Brother, you misunderstood.

318
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,280
I hid in the academy to investigate that Xie Xi.

319
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
As for me and Mr. Song,

320
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
I'm only concerned about men and women.

321
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
I have no place to go.

322
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
I'm not going.

323
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
That's not good.

324
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,280
Why don't you look for me in Chang'an?

325
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Instead, you go to Song Qing.

326
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
I...

327
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Isn't Uncle Lian sick?

328
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
I want to help him for a few days.

329
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Don't lie to me.

330
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
This Songlin Academy is full of men.

331
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
You can't stay here.

332
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Pack up.

333
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
I'll take you home.

334
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
I've promised Ms. Wen'an.

335
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
I have to stay here and observe for a few days.

336
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
If you don't allow it,

337
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
I'll leave.

338
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
It's not impossible to stay.

339
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
You can only be my servant.

340
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Stay away from Song Qing.

341
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
I'll go.

342
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Why are you walking around?

343
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
I'll go over there and see how it is.

344
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,280
It's time.

345
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
You should be asleep.

346
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
What are you doing?

347
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
I don't have a short bed like Uncle Lian.

348
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
So I sleep on the floor and you sleep on the bed.

349
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
I don't accept it.

350
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
That's it.

351
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
What are you doing?

352
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
I sleep on the floor.

353
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
It's good.

354
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
You sleep here tonight.

355
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
I'll go out by myself.

356
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Brother.

357
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Where are you going?

358
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
Brother Lu.

359
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Brother Lu.

360
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
I was not feeling well last night.

361
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
I didn't sleep in the room.

362
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
I didn't sleep in the room at all.

363
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Brother Lu.

364
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
You're not angry anymore?

365
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
I'll do it for you.

366
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
I prepared some supper for you.

367
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
It's hot.

368
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
How can I be embarrassed?

369
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
Brother Lu, please come in.

370
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
I made these dumplings myself in the back.

371
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
I hope you don't let me down.

372
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
Since you made it yourself,

373
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
I must try it.

374
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Why is the dumpling so sour?

375
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
The dumpling filling is made of

376
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:49,340
the sourness of the ginger and

377
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
the acidity of the ginger.

378
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
It's not bad.

379
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
I like it.

380
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
It's not bad.

381
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
I like it.

382
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
I like it.

383
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
It's really good.

384
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
It's good.

385
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
It's good.

386
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
It's good.

387
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
One more.

388
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,040
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,040
You did me a favor.

390
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,120
But I'm really upset.

391
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,480
Brother Song,

392
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
I didn't mean to make things difficult for you.

393
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,040
I just want you to know

394
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,480
that I'm the most sincere person.

395
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
As your brother,

396
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,800
I won't allow anyone to hurt him.

397
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,440
People can be dangerous.

398
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,920
Men and women should be more careful.

399
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,520
Brother Lu,

400
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,280
I'll help you.

401
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,880
I won't do anything to

402
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,400
disturb his peace.

403
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,240
I believe you.

404
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,520
But you have to be clear about what's going on.

405
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,040
You can't be too harsh on him.

406
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,160
I'll remember what you said.

407
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,920
I'll stay with you tonight.

408
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,440
Hmm?

409
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,880
Okay.

410
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,120
I didn't expect the night owls to be so strong.

411
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,160
Brother Lu,

412
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,560
I'm just used to it.

413
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,680
Please don't misunderstand.

414
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,160
Song Qingzhao,

415
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,240
are you sure you didn't go back to your room last night?

416
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,600
I'm innocent.

417
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,680
I dare not do anything to the heaven.

418
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,880
I just went back to my room.

419
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:16,960
What?

420
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,720
You're a young man.

421
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,280
You lost to a servant.

422
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,600
You can't even lose a hairpin.

423
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,200
Thank you, Brother Lu.

424
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,920
Who lost your hairpin last night?

425
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,120
Did Uncle Ming say

426
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,360
who lost it last night?

427
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,240
Brother Song.

428
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,120
Brother Yang.

429
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,160
It seems that your hairpin is healed.

430
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,440
You lost a good hairpin today.

431
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,960
Not at all.

432
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,200
The northeast corner is the water pool.

433
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,000
The west is the flower garden.

434
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,080
The back hill is the forest.

435
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,680
What are you doing?

436
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,040
I went out for a walk

437
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,240
when you were in class.

438
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,400
I want to draw a simple map of the academy

439
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,600
and analyze the information.

440
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,920
It's impossible to go to the back garden.

441
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:18,920
Look.

442
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,720
All the scholars are men.

443
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,960
All the garbage is from the servants.

444
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,000
They all live in the back garden.

445
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,600
What about the girl I met yesterday?

446
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,800
She's probably in the back garden.

447
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,280
But even so,

448
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,240
what about Wen'an?

449
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,880
What about that girl?

450
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,640
You're trying to find out the truth.

451
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,880
It's good,

452
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,440
but is it too simple?

453
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
How important is marriage to women?

454
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,600
No matter what,

455
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,440
the master has the right

456
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,200
to know the true face of his future husband.

457
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,720
Since he's suspicious,

458
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,280
he can't just take it lightly.

459
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,560
If I'm the girl who will be the future husband,

460
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,320
would you still say that?

461
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,400
All right.

462
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,400
You convinced me.

463
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,520
But this

464
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,320
will never happen to you.

465
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,960
Shut up.

466
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
I forgot to eat.

467
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,400
I've got the result

468
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,600
of your investigation.

469
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,600
The girl who dressed as a man

470
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,400
is actually Lu Chang's sister,

471
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,480
Lu Ming Shu.

472
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,960
Lu Ming Shu?

473
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,320
Lu Chang's sister?

474
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,800
She's also a new friend of Lord Yingshu.

475
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,680
When someone saw Concubineclub,

476
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,920
she walked out of

477
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,960
Lady Wen'an's nest.

478
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,920
Soon after that,

479
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:56,720
she sneaked into theSUyuan Date

480
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,580
The

481
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,080
Brother knows I like hand-pulled noodles.

482
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,540
What do you like to eat?

483
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,540
You don't know?

484
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,460
The noodles are made with the soup made by my mother.

485
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,380
It has my favorite sweet and sour.

486
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,140
Eat it.

487
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,260
The noodles will be soggy.

488
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,380
You love me.

489
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,100
I've made up my mind.

490
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,920
I'll go to the backyard after I finish my meal.

491
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:50,180
Those

492
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,180
Madam Lin.

493
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,480
Madam Lin.

494
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,180
These are the clothes my son wore yesterday.

495
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:01,880
Thank you.

496
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,140
You're wearing them?

497
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,940
It's a small gift. Please accept it.

498
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,020
Mr. Xie is usually generous with us.

499
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,860
It's my duty.

500
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,660
I'll wash it for you later.

501
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,940
Okay. Thank you.

502
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,340
You're welcome.

503
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,100
What's this?

504
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,340
It seems that it's not a medical

505
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,500
I'll just put the clothes there.

506
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,820
Madam Lin.

507
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,300
Do you have a son to come to the backyard?

508
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,260
If the sons come,

509
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,660
why do they ask you to wash the clothes?

510
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,100
He's asking you.

511
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:00,780
Who?

512
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,900
No one is not qualified.

513
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,300
Who did it?

514
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,860
The clothes are all dirty.

515
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,500
Xiu.

516
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,940
The water is too dirty. I feel bad.

517
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,180
Can you take a bath here?

518
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,820
How did you get it?

519
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,780
You go first. I'll tell you later.

520
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,620
Okay. I'll get you some water.

521
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,260
Go.

522
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,300
Go. Go. Go.

523
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,900
Go. Go. Go.

524
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Go. Go. Go.

525
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,580
You're dead.

526
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,980
I was picked by Lu Chang,

527
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,460
the General of Changsheng.

528
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,300
I'm not defeated.

529
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,860
Okay. Don't be angry.

530
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,660
By the way,

531
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,580
I heard that you failed the test.

532
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,260
You can only enter the exam by taking the exam.

533
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,340
Look.

534
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,660
You can't beat me in reading.

535
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,900
You can't beat me in playing.

536
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,940
You can't do anything.

537
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,540
You're the best in chess.

538
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,420
Right, Changsheng?

539
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,060
Yes.

540
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,660
Don't think about the irrelevant things.

541
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,420
Except for this mighty General,

542
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,740
there's also a flying tiger General.

543
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,700
He's invincible.

544
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,660
Do you dare to do it?

545
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,380
Where's the flying tiger General?

546
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,580
Mr. Lu.

547
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,180
He's not here.

548
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,260
You stole it.

549
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,660
You must think that you can't beat me in playing.

550
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,700
So you stole it.

551
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,740
Bullshit.

552
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,260
I'm afraid you can't win.

553
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,100
Right. Right.

554
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,220
I saw someone behind Mr. Lu.

555
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,780
He was walking behind him.

556
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,380
Then he went over there.

557
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,300
He went to the south.

558
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:35,940
Go after him.

559
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,660
Go after him, Zhang Song.

560
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,020
What are you looking at? Hurry up.

561
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,740
I'll go now.

562
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,820
Hurry up.

563
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,420
You're so annoying.

564
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,140
Why didn't you lose yourself?

565
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,100
What a useless guy.

566
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,700
I can't beat you in playing.

567
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,580
The southern room

568
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,100
is going to be searched carefully.

569
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,620
This is the flying tiger General

570
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,620
I bought with great efforts.

571
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,260
Lu Chang?

572
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,020
I'm here.

573
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,780
Min Shu.

574
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,380
I know.

575
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,900
This time,

576
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,860
you must hate me

577
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,940
and stole my flying tiger General.

578
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,420
Search the other rooms.

579
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,700
I'll search Lu Chang.

580
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,260
Go.

581
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,060
Go.

582
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,820
Open the door.

583
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,020
Lu Wen Cai.

584
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,500
Where's my flying tiger General?

585
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,140
Hand him over.

586
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,900
General.

587
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,380
Didn't you see I was about to take a bath?

588
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,980
You stole it.

589
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,980
I'll find out myself

590
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,740
how you can deny it.

591
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,380
Get out of the way.

592
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,900
Let go.

593
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,700
Lu Wen Cai.

594
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,140
Don't forget the rules of this house.

595
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,780
All students who enter the house

596
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,540
can't enter the same room as others.

597
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,980
You'll be punished for that.

598
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,460
Do you have to do that?

599
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,860
You won't hide my flying tiger General

600
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,940
in the bath, will you?

601
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,260
Who hides that general?

602
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,260
Is he your flying tiger General?

603
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,980
Young Master.

604
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,980
The flying tiger General is found outside.

605
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:17,980
Get out.

606
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,780
Wait for me.

607
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:24,780
Tell me.

608
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,940
What did you do?

609
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,100
I was beaten for nothing.

610
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,860
You broke into the same room

611
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,980
without knowing it.

612
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,100
Young Master.

613
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,620
Let's go.

614
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,820
Fight with me again.

615
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:35,780
Go.

616
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,500
Luckily, I didn't find Min Shu.

617
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,940
Min Shu.

618
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,100
Min Shu.

619
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,300
Are you okay?

620
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:08,980
Are you okay?

621
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,060
Yes.

622
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,900
Han Shang, go out

623
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,940
and change my clothes.

624
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,420
Okay.

625
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,100
It's okay.

626
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,660
I'll be in a mess

627
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,940
because it's getting close.

628
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,300
I heard that Lu Wencai

629
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,820
wanted to enter Lu Chang's room,

630
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,460
but he was beaten for nothing.

631
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,580
Is it true?

632
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,860
Yes.

633
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,460
But I don't know

634
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,780
which one is the culprit.

635
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,860
It's said that Lu Chang

636
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,220
stole Lu Wencai's hairpin.

637
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,980
That's why he was bullied by Lu.

638
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
He made a big scene.

639
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,020
I know that.

640
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,100
Do you know that

641
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,580
Lu Wencai is a good man?

642
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,580
He's a good man.

643
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,580
He's a good man.

644
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,580
He's a good man.

645
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,580
He's a good man.

646
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,580
He's a good man.

647
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,580
He's a good man.

648
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,580
He's a good man.

649
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,580
He's a good man.

650
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,580
He's a good man.

651
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,580
He's a good man.

652
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,620
Do you know what this is?

653
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,140
I'll tell you the reason.

654
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,820
Someone used the hairpin to frame you.

655
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,340
Even Lu Wencai was used.

656
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,420
He wanted to use it

657
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,260
to expose the identity of the woman in the letter

658
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,940
and drive her out of the academy.

659
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,060
This game

660
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,820
started when she was drenched.

661
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,020
But I was busy with my studies

662
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,940
and couldn't care about these things.

663
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,260
So I let this villain take the initiative.

664
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Who could it be?

665
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,980
Xie Xi.

666
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,900
It seems that Xie Xi has discovered the existence of the letter.

667
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,940
You've already attracted his attention.

668
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,580
Maybe there are others

669
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,820
who have already started to observe the letter secretly.

670
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,300
But I don't know who it is.

671
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,500
He wanted to drive me out of the academy.

672
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,940
If it doesn't work this time,

673
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,940
he won't let me go next time.

674
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,660
Ming Shu.

675
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,660
I'll take you to the mountain tomorrow.

676
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,540
You didn't find Lu Ming Shu.

677
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,700
Luo Wencai hasn't found her yet.

678
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
Xie Xi is outside.

679
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,260
He was found by Song Qing.

680
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,020
It seems that I underestimated

681
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,500
the ability of the Lu brothers.

682
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,260
What should we do next?

683
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,580
No matter what,

684
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,820
we must drive her out of the academy.

685
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,820
I'm Lu Ming Shu.

686
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,260
Greetings, Madam.

687
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,420
Lu Cheng.

688
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,620
This is...

689
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,540
Madam.

690
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,620
I heard from the chief that

691
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,620
Prince Yu and Prince Rui and the Chancellor

692
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,260
are about to leave the academy for inspection.

693
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,860
Madam is suffering from lack of people in the back yard.

694
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,900
She just got married.

695
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,380
She came to the academy today to give students clothes.

696
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,140
If Madam doesn't mind,

697
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,420
she can stay in the academy for a few days.

698
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,980
Lu Cheng.

699
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,940
You're always so funny.

700
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,020
I thought you were a cold-hearted person.

701
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,420
I didn't expect you to be so warm-hearted.

702
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,580
But the academy is full of things.

703
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,380
I wonder if you can handle it.

704
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,260
Madam.

705
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,980
I'm so grateful to you

706
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,780
for taking care of you and the chief.

707
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,180
If I can help the academy,

708
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,820
it's the biggest wish of Ming Shu.

709
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,740
You're a good girl.

710
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,700
I can't bear to let you do rough work.

711
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,820
How about this?

712
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,700
You live in the backyard

713
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,860
and do some chores.

714
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,540
Yes.

715
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,780
Thank you, Madam.

716
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,420
Thank you, Madam.

717
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,700
Ming Shu.

718
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,260
It's great that you can stay in the academy.

719
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,460
Of course.

720
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,260
I can stay in the backyard

721
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,860
and watch Xie Xi.

722
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,340
But you two have to keep an eye on her

723
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,740
in the academy.

724
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,020
You don't have to say that.

725
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:52,940
Lu Cheng.

726
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,660
Xie Xi has already identified Ming Shu.

727
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,180
It's not convenient for you to investigate her.

728
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,500
Why don't you leave it to me?

729
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,500
That's great.

730
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,380
Thank you, Chief.

731
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,620
I think we don't have to rush.

732
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,980
Now that Xie Xi knows that Ming Shu

733
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,820
has stayed in the academy,

734
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,380
she must be in a mess.

735
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,580
We just need to watch her.

736
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,420
Lu Cheng is so lucky.

737
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,380
Our princess has been in the mansion since she was young.

738
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,180
His Majesty has never seen her.

739
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,660
Your Highness!

740
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,700
Your Highness.

741
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,620
Those servants were all哈哈哈 over there

742
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,820
What are they yelling at me for?

743
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,860
For saying that His Majesty never visits my room,

744
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,980
or I am too lazy and sleep all the time?

745
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,420
Then what do you think

746
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,980
is the best way to punish him?

747
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,340
I happen to have experience

748
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,700
in dealing with rumors.

749
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,940
I can't find a way out.

750
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,420
Come here.

751
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,100
Then tell them...

752
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
The King's Mansion

753
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,980
Who is in charge of

754
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,980
the meal in the Princess's room?

755
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,180
I...

756
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,740
You. Come here.

757
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,900
What can I do for you, Lady Shuang?

758
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,980
The Princess has been weak recently.

759
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,780
You need to eat more to prepare for the meal.

760
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,620
Where should I prepare for the Princess?

761
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,900
Please tell me.

762
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,820
The Princess and the King are newly married.

763
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,900
What do you think?

764
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,340
But don't tell anyone about this.

765
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,060
Don't worry.

766
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,260
I'm a good talker.

767
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,020
Go back to your work.

768
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,580
Okay.

769
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,740
What's going on?

770
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,340
What's going on?

771
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,460
What's going on?

772
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,300
I'm working hard.

773
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,100
What are you talking about?

774
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,900
What does the Princess mean?

775
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,060
I'm exhausted.

776
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,300
Madam, have some water.

777
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,060
Take a breath.

778
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,340
I'm drinking water.

779
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,100
My throat is about to dry.

780
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,140
What happened?

781
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,940
A batch of refugees just came here.

782
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,420
The numbers and accounts are not right.

783
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,460
Now, they can't go to the library.

784
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,860
I have to go there to check it.

785
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,300
I'm so busy.

786
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,940
I'm so tired.

787
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,940
I'm so tired.

788
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,820
The total number of refugees is right.

789
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,980
But the numbers of these two refugees are wrong.

790
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,300
Did they write the names wrong

791
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,700
when they copied the accounts?

792
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,100
Good girl.

793
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,940
You're so good.

794
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,780
Good girl.

795
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,180
It's all thanks to you.

796
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,260
You saved Madam a lot of energy.

797
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,140
Didn't the young girl like me

798
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,340
help you with the problem?

799
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,940
The only person who can read the name

800
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,700
is a man.

801
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,940
How can we hire someone like him?

802
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,420
The only person who can help

803
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,060
is Tang Sheng.

804
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
But that girl

805
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,340
can read the numbers.

806
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,860
But she's so stubborn.

807
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,380
She ignores others.

808
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,220
Who is Tang Sheng?

809
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,260
I haven't seen him for so long.

810
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,380
He usually stays in the room

811
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,140
to do some math

812
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,420
and do some work.

813
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,660
He rarely goes out.

814
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,300
It's normal that you haven't seen him.

815
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,380
What a coincidence.

816
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,900
That's Tang Sheng.

817
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,580
Tang Sheng.

818
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,260
I'm Ming Shu.

819
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,020
I'm new here.

820
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,980
Let me introduce you.

821
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,260
