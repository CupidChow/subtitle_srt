I wanted to save them before the bandit left.

59
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
I just saved a bandit.

60
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I'm so grateful to you.

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Go. Go.

62
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
The bandit is back.

63
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
They only have four people.

64
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
We can fight later.

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Go.

66
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
What?

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Who are you?

Stop.

72
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Are you hurt?

73
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm fine.

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
You...

77
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
You...

78
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
You killed me.

79
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
You...

80
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I...

81
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I...

82
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Uncle Lin.

83
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
It's me.

84
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
If you're the bandit,

85
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I'll do anything to avenge you.

86
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Li Yuan.

87
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
You almost killed Yuan Si Gui.

88
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Han.

89
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
What's wrong?

90
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
What's wrong?

91
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Xiu.

92
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
What did you call me?

93
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Xiu.

94
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Xiu.

95
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Xiu.

96
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
You finally admitted that I'm your brother.

97
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
You saved me.

98
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
You even gave up your life.

99
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
You...

100
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
You're my brother.

101
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,800
You'll be my brother in this life.

102
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
All right.

103
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Don't cry.

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Is it so miserable to be my sister?

105
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
I was so scared just now.

106
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
I thought you were dead.

107
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
All right.

108
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Don't cry.

109
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm fine.

110
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Mother, sorry to keep you waiting.

111
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
I'm fine.

112
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
As long as you're safe and sound.

113
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Here, have some tea.

114
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
My wife

115
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
ordered me to bring you some food and medicine.

116
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Please have a good rest.

117
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
She'll come and thank you tomorrow.

118
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Thank you, mother.

119
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I'll be going now.

120
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
I'll see you later.

121
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
I'll see you later.

122
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
I'll see you later.

123
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I'll see you later.

124
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
I'll see you later.

125
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
I'll see you later.

126
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Thank you for coming to thank me in person.

127
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Thank you for your wife's concern.

128
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Thank you.

129
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Mei Shu.

130
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
What are you doing?

131
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Mother, drink some warm water first.

132
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Warm yourself up.

133
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Eating something.

134
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
What did you call me?

135
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Mother.

136
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Say that again.

137
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Mother.

138
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Get up.

139
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I was not sensible before.

140
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
I misunderstood mother and brother.

141
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I made you worry.

142
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I was wrong.

143
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Good girl.

144
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Get up and talk.

145
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
My child.

146
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,800
You've suffered a lot during this period.

147
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Let bygones be bygones.

148
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
As long as I'm here,

149
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
I'll protect you.

150
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,800
You're the one who made me a small temple.

151
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
I wish you...

152
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
I wish you...

153
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
I wish you a long life.

154
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
I wish you a long life.

155
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Ah Xiong, are you in there?

156
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Are you done?

157
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,360
What are you doing now?

158
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,800
You're so clumsy.

159
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,640
If you were someone else,

160
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,640
what would you do?

161
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,440
Who would have thought that you're here?

162
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,080
This is the place where you cook.

163
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,320
You're being reasonable.

164
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,280
I'm here to deliver the medicine to my brother.

165
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,920
I knew that you were afraid that my mother would be worried,

166
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,360
so I secretly brought you here.

167
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,920
I knew that you were afraid that my mother would be worried,

168
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,280
so I secretly brought you here.

169
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,800
Thank you.

170
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,560
Let's go.

171
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,000
montage

172
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,560
plug

173
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,280
Let me.

174
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,280
No, I can do it on my own.

175
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,240
You can't do it yourself.

176
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,680
No matter how NP I讓 постоянx expression,

177
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,840
I'll getудьion effect for you.

178
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,960
Hand.

179
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,160
Does it hurt?

180
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
I'll be gentle.

181
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
The Book of

182
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
The Book of The Uncertainty

183
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Will Uncle Jianming really be with Lu Chang?

184
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
We searched every place

185
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
but we didn't see Uncle Jianming.

186
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
It must be a chance to meet him.

187
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Lu Chang and the Jian family are in a relationship.

188
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
The evil spirit is in the north.

189
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
It must be the two people that you mentioned.

190
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Anyway, let's finish them first.

191
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
How is it? Does it still hurt?

192
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
It's okay.

193
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Go back to your room and rest early.

194
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
Give me your hand.

195
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
What's wrong?

196
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Just give it to me.

197
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
You've been hurt so much.

198
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
It's all wounds.

199
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
It's so rough.

200
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
I can't hold the pen.

201
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Why is it all writing?

202
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
What is this?

203
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,360
The blue perfume and ointment that the lady sent.

204
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Good stuff.

205
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
It's so small.

206
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
It's worth a lot.

207
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
It's the most moisturizing.

208
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
It can also cure the cold.

209
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
It's for women.

210
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
You can use it too.

211
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
I'll do it myself.

212
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
You're so careless.

213
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
You wasted so much good stuff.

214
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Look.

215
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
This hand heart, hand back

216
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
and this finger.

217
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
You have to push it.

218
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Such good stuff.

219
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
You're so generous.

220
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Brother Han.

221
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Okay.

222
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
I still have the ointment.

223
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
You should go back and rest early.

224
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Are you hungry?

225
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Don't move.

226
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Behave yourself.

227
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
I didn't expect so many things happened

228
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
after I went out to report yesterday.

229
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Fortunately, I'm safe.

230
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Brother.

231
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
Thanks to you,

232
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
we can be safe and sound.

233
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
I'm Song Qingzhao from the capital.

234
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
I'm Lu Chang from Jiangling.

235
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,360
If it wasn't for your help,

236
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
we wouldn't have been captured so soon.

237
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
You went to the capital this time,

238
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
and I went back.

239
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
We can go together.

240
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,360
It's my pleasure to meet you.

241
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Brother Han.

242
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
I'm Lu Chang.

243
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Brother.

244
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
How's your hand?

245
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Let me see.

246
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Mr. Song.

247
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
I'll go first.

248
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Why did you leave so soon?

249
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Wait for me.

250
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Brother, I'm hungry.

251
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
I want to eat something.

252
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Wait for me.

253
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Mr. Song.

254
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
Thanks for your help yesterday.

255
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
You're welcome.

256
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
Brother.

257
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
You're hiding from me.

258
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Mr. Song.

259
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
Madam told me

260
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,360
not to reveal the name of the person.

261
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,360
You brothers are kind and kind.

262
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
If you're like this,

263
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
you should be careful.

264
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
You're being selfish.

265
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
The first floor is the inn of the capital.

266
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Let's go and have a look.

267
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Yes.

268
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,360
I've signed the paper.

269
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Thank you for your help.

270
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
I'll go now.

271
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
Go.

272
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Go.

273
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
Go.

274
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Go.

275
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Go.

276
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Go.

277
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Go.

278
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
Go.

279
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
Thank you for your help.

280
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
I'm a little bit rude.

281
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Please accept it.

282
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
We appreciate your kindness.

283
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
It's right to take care of each other

284
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
when you go out.

285
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
In fact,

286
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
it's not fair.

287
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Thank you, Mr. Song.

288
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Thank you, Mrs. Tao.

289
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
It's the right thing to do.

290
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
I'm just a savior.

291
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,360
How can I keep this money?

292
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
This money

293
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
not only expresses gratitude,

294
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
but also makes us feel grateful.

295
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
It's also a way to express our gratitude.

296
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
It's also a way to express our gratitude.

297
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
It's also a way to express our gratitude.

298
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
It's more worrying if you don't say it.

299
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
Don't worry.

300
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,360
I know better than you

301
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
about the girls' thoughts.

302
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
This money is right.

303
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
You're thoughtful.

304
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,360
So,

305
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
this money is right.

306
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
And we're going to have a competition on the way.

307
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,360
This money is not for nothing.

308
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
You're so impulsive.

309
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
How can you be so impulsive?

310
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
What's wrong with you?

311
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
You're such a outcast!

312
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
I'll let you forget about such things and go home.

313
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Stroesa.

314
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,060
Grocer.

315
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
Stop.

316
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,360
We came all the way here

317
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
to complain about the situation.

318
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,860
An investigation from everywhere.

319
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,460
Go to the shortcut.

320
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,220
Catch him.

321
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:02,860
Yes.

322
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,780
Stop.

323
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,380
Don't move.

324
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,340
What do you want?

325
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,700
Find her.

326
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,860
I'm a guard of the imperial court.

327
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,980
I'm going to the port with my family.

328
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,820
If anything happens on the way,

329
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,140
the imperial court will not sit back and do nothing.

330
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,180
You misunderstood.

331
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,740
My lady has gone.

332
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
She's looking for her.

333
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,940
She's worried about you.

334
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,580
So she offended you.

335
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,020
If it's a misunderstanding,

336
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,820
then let's go.

337
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,540
Go.

338
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,780
Your Majesty,

339
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,260
Lu Chang didn't take Jian Ming Shu away.

340
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,460
Yes.

341
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,700
Mr. Song,

342
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,460
you've helped me many times.

343
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
I'm very grateful.

344
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,980
You don't have to be polite.

345
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,580
But I admire you

346
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,580
for fighting with the bandits in the inn.

347
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,700
You're really a heroine.

348
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,740
I'm the first woman.

349
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,060
How could I not see that woman?

350
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,180
You're really

351
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,100
different.

352
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,540
It will be fine.

353
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,860
Your Majesty,

354
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,220
the Johans' Assembly is here.

355
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,440
Run to Xian??

356
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,500
No.

357
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,340
Run!

358
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:43,860
No.

359
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,700
Run to that place.

360
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,060
Clan Leader Wang Shu told us

361
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,580
Jian Ming Shu ran to the next place.

362
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,020
And if he's not there,

363
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,580
we can't find him for a while.

364
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,180
Here.

365
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,660
Slow down.

366
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,300
You're still the same as when you were a kid.

367
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,860
Is Mr. Song reliable?

368
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,980
Are you so relieved to hand Ming Shu to him?

369
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,540
Mr. Song

370
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,060
is not a royal family

371
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,420
but a royal family.

372
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,060
His identity can save people.

373
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,420
He's a good man.

374
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,460
How did you know his identity?

375
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,060
I heard from the immortal

376
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,460
that the golden dragon cicada on his body

377
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,860
is a tribute to the royal family.

378
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,940
Not a common man can have it.

379
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,700
I believe in your vision.

380
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,540
I'm just worried

381
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,980
that the person who killed Ming Shu

382
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,700
wouldn't give up easily.

383
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,420
It's raining.

384
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,380
Hurry up, mother.

385
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,780
Let's hide.

386
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,420
Hurry up.

387
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,820
Master,

388
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,100
the carriage is wet.

389
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,300
Stop.

390
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,380
Hurry up.

391
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,300
Those bandits broke the carriage.

392
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,180
I don't know where they went.

393
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,660
I'm sorry, Master.

394
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,780
I'm fine.

395
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,380
It's just a poor lady.

396
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,260
Be careful not to get sick.

397
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,620
I'm just a little sick.

398
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,660
Don't worry.

399
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
Just wait for me.

400
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,740
There's a pavilion in the distance.

401
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,540
I don't think it'll stop raining for a while.

402
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,260
Let's go and get some rain.

403
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,820
But...

404
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,900
But if we keep going like this,

405
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,380
we'll get wet.

406
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,140
Lady,

407
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,340
be careful not to catch a cold.

408
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,460
phenomena

409
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,340
Since we can't avoid this rain,

410
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
we'd better enjoy it

411
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,340
by hiding in the carriage.

412
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,340
You're acting like a woman.

413
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,340
You're too wild.

414
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,340
Don't you think what she said makes sense?

415
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,340
She's a free-spirited woman.

416
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,340
She's always acting like herself.

417
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,340
She's exactly what I want.

418
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
Yes.

419
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
Dong Zi'er.

420
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
Dong Zi'er.

421
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,340
Dong Zi'er.

422
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,340
Dong Zi'er.

423
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,340
Wipe it off.

424
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,340
Don't catch a cold.

425
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,340
Uncle Yuer should talk about me.

426
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,340
Thank you.

427
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,340
Mrs. Lu.

428
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,340
The greenery is so beautiful.

429
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,340
Thanks to Mrs. Lu,

430
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,340
I can enjoy such a beautiful scenery.

431
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,340
Mr. Song.

432
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,340
You're so talented.

433
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
You know how to enjoy the scenery.

434
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,340
Do you think the mud smells good?

435
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,340
Yes.

436
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
They should be

437
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
heading southeast.

438
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,340
I'm not sure.

439
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
It's safer in the capital.

440
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,340
This is the so-called

441
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,340
life-saving machine.

442
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,340
It's hard to find a car

443
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,340
in the wilderness.

444
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,340
But our carriage is broken.

445
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,340
If Mrs. Tao doesn't mind,

446
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,340
why don't we take her

447
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,340
carriage

448
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,340
and go to the capital together?

449
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,340
It's really hard for my son.

450
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,340
He's been with me all the way.

451
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,340
I didn't see you do anything.

452
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,340
But I didn't expect

453
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,340
you to arrange so much.

454
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,340
Get in the carriage, Mrs. Tao.

455
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,340
Thank you, Mr. Song.

456
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,340
I don't know where you live.

457
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,340
I'll take Ming Shu

458
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,340
to visit the people in person.

459
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,340
You're welcome.

460
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,340
We'll meet again

461
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,340
in the capital.

462
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,340
Please arrange a place for us.

463
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,340
Goodbye.

464
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,340
See you.

465
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,340
See you.

466
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,340
They're new to the capital.

467
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,340
I'm afraid they'll have trouble.

468
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,340
Liu Xin, where are they?

469
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
See if they need help.

470
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,340
Yes.

471
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
This time, I left the capital

472
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,340
because you didn't want to go to the city.

473
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,340
So I had a fight with the wolf.

474
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,340
Do you have any plans

475
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,340
to take them back to the capital?

476
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
It's not a good idea to escape.

477
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
I'll go to Panlong Street later

478
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
to buy some fresh grass as a gift.

479
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
I'll buy them a good one when I get back.

480
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,340
Mr. Song, you deserve it.

481
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
Go to Panlong Street.

482
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,340
Mrs. Tao, you don't have to see me off.

483
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,340
Our place is not far from here.

484
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,340
Goodbye.

485
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,340
Thank you for saving my life.

486
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,340
You're welcome, Mrs. Tao.

487
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,340
We won't bother you.

488
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,340
Goodbye.

489
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,340
Yin Xue.

490
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
Zeng Yi.

491
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Give it to me.

492
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,340
Why are you so late?

493
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,340
I arrived two days earlier than you.

494
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
I've booked the house for you.

495
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,340
Uncle Ming?

496
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,340
Uncle Ming, this is Yin Xue.

497
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,340
We've known each other since we were kids.

498
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,340
We're a family.

499
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,340
Uncle Ming, don't underestimate me.

500
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,340
I'm working in Liangzhou now.

501
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,340
I'll protect you well in the future.

502
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
Brother Ying.

503
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
Brother Ying.

504
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
Is this the house you're working in?

505
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,340
Zeng Yi, I've made a good house for you.

506
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
Let's go.

507
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
Okay.

508
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
Come on.

509
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,340
Give it to me.

510
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
Come on.

511
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
There's a very special tree in this house.

512
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,340
It's interesting.

513
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,340
This house and this tree...

514
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
It's really special.

515
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,340
This...

516
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,340
This must be the trouble from the day before yesterday.

517
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,340
I'm sorry, Zeng Yi.

518
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340
I'm sorry.

519
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,340
I'll get you another one.

520
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,340
Yin Xue.

521
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,340
This is the trouble from the day before yesterday.

522
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,340
I'm sure there's no difference in getting another one.

523
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
Let's clean up.

524
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
Chang is right.

525
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,340
I think this house is actually quite good.

526
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,340
Everyone can live here after cleaning up.

527
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
I have Tao Niang's house here.

528
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
I'll clean it up.

529
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,340
Okay.

530
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,340
I'll clean it up.

531
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,340
I'll clean it up.

532
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,340
Okay.

533
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,340
I have money from Tao Niang.

534
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,340
Maybe I can pay her.

535
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Be careful.

536
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,340
Are you done, Chang?

537
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,340
Let's do this for today.

538
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,340
We'll clean it up later.

539
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,340
Okay.

540
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,340
I don't think there are many houses that are not built.

541
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,340
Let's go out and buy some.

542
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,340
No need.

543
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Everyone is tired today.

544
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,340
Have a good rest.

545
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,340
We'll do it tomorrow.

546
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
Right.

547
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,340
The streets of Beijing are definitely busy.

548
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,340
We're now considered to be people of Beijing.

549
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,340
Let's go shopping tomorrow.

550
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,340
I'm going to buy some food.

551
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,340
I'll go with you.

552
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
I'll go with you.

553
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,340
I'll go with you.

554
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,340
I'll go with you.

555
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,340
I'll go with you.

556
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,340
I'll go with you.

557
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,340
I'll go with you.

558
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,340
Let's go shopping tomorrow.

559
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,340
You three go.

560
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Good.

561
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,340
Good.

562
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,340
It's a poem.

563
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,340
Brother, this is sweet.

564
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,340
Try it.

565
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,340
I'll go there and have a look.

566
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,340
Young Master, do you want to buy a cloth?

567
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,340
Brother, why do I feel like you're hiding from me?

568
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
No.

569
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,340
No.

570
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,340
Are you going to buy a cloth?

571
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Didn't you say you wanted to buy a cloth and make clothes?

572
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,340
See if you like it.

573
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
You still remember?

574
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,340
I'm afraid my mother will blame me.

575
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
I think this cloth is good.

576
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
This color.

577
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,340
I don't need it.

578
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,340
You can have yours.

579
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
I don't want it either.

580
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,340
Boss, this one.

581
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,340
Half a bag.

582
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,340
Okay.

583
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,340
This one for clothes.

584
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,340
This one, this one.

585
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,340
This one is also suitable for clothes.

586
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,340
How about this one?

587
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,340
This one is good.

588
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
How about this one?

589
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,340
Now Uncle Ming is a reliable person.

590
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,340
I've always wanted this.

591
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,340
Now I believe it.

592
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,340
I didn't expect it to be so sticky.

593
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,340
I can't hold it anymore.

594
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
Thank you.

595
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,340
Help me step on it.

596
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Okay.

597
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,340
Miss, this one is good.

598
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,340
Look, this one is good.

599
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,340
It's pretty good.

600
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,340
It's a new style.

601
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Yes.

602
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,340
Okay.

603
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,340
Then you wrap it up for me.

604
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,340
It's old and expensive.

605
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,340
But I think a lot of people bought it.

606
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Everything is suitable for you.

607
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Come on.

608
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,340
This one is expensive.

609
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
Why does someone buy it?

610
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,340
The money in Beijing is too easy to earn.

611
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,340
Chang, Uncle Ming.

612
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,340
Come and try on new clothes.

613
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,340
Uncle Ming is smart.

614
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,340
He spent a batch of cloth money

615
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
and bought three kinds of cloth.

616
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,340
He cut the cloth into three pieces

617
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
just for a small trick.

618
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,340
It's all thanks to my mother.

619
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,340
The foreign style is not so new.

620
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,340
Brother, come on.

621
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,340
Try it on.

622
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,340
Mother, look.

623
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,340
It's just right.

624
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
It's just right.

625
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,340
How delicate it is.

626
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,340
Do you like it?

627
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
My clothes are pretty.

628
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,340
Your brother

629
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,340
is just like this.

630
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,340
In fact, he is happier than anyone else.

631
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,340
Don't take it to heart.

632
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,340
How could I care?

633
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,340
Brother obviously loves me.

634
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,340
I understand his pain.

635
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,340
Say it.

636
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,340
Brother is very happy.

637
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,340
I know.

638
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,340
I know.

639
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,340
I know.

640
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,340
I know.

641
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
I know.

642
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,340
I know.

643
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,340
I know.

644
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
Brother is obviously a scholar.

645
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,340
A scholar should

646
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,340
read the holy books

647
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,340
without hearing or hearing.

648
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Look at my brother.

649
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
He not only knows martial arts,

650
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
but also

651
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
how to repair a house, drive a car.

652
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
He knows almost everything.

653
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,340
Because our family is in trouble,

654
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,340
the outsiders still want to bully us.

655
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
Brother had to

656
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,340
squeeze out time

657
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,340
to get angry.

658
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,340
He must be tired.

659
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,340
Your father left early.

660
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,340
I can only

661
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,340
do some embroidery

662
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,340
and make a living.

663
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,340
There is only one man left in the family.

664
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,340
He is the only one

665
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,340
who can do everything.

666
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,340
Although my brother

667
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,340
looks cold,

668
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,340
when I was in danger,

669
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,340
he was so hard-working

670
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,340
to block me.

671
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,340
He is so nice to me.

672
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,340
I want to be nicer to him.

673
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,340
I can't help myself

674
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,340
to be nice to him.

675
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,340
I can't help myself

676
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,340
to be nice to him.

677
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,340
I can only

678
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,340
help him to

679
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,340
get a new dress

680
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,340
and a bowl of hot soup.

681
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,340
As long as I can

682
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,340
help him to

683
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
build this family,

684
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,340
I can help him to

685
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,340
study hard

686
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,340
and suffer less.

687
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,340
Ming Shu,

688
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,340
you used to

689
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,340
love your brother so much.

690
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,340
Your brother can understand you.

691
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
As long as he is happy,

692
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,340
I will be happy.

693
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,340
Here you are.

694
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,340
Fish.

695
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
So many dishes.

696
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,340
I hope you can eat them all.

697
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
Right?

698
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,340
There are fish every year.

699
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
By the way,

700
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,340
I used 10 taels of silver

701
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,340
to build the house.

702
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,340
I will give you

703
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,340
the rest of the money.

704
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,340
I have money.

705
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,340
Aren't you going

706
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,340
to Song Ling Academy tomorrow?

707
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,340
Take the money.

708
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,340
I don't need money to go to the academy.

709
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,340
Ming Shu,

710
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,340
you took the money.

711
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,340
You can keep it.

712
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,340
Hurry up.

713
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,340
Okay.

714
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,340
I'll keep it.

715
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
Don't take it from my house.

716
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,340
You have to take the money.

717
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,340
I will give you the money.

718
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,340
Right.

719
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,340
Here.

720
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,340
Hurry up.

721
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
I forgot.

722
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,340
We have to talk a lot during the festival.

723
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,340
I wish our family

724
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,340
can be happy forever.

725
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,340
I wish you a long life.

726
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,340
I wish you a good luck

727
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,340
and a bright future.

728
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,340
I understand.

729
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,340
I won't get lucky this year.

730
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,340
This year?

731
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,340
I mean this year.

732
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,340
Stop laughing.

733
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
Come on.

734
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,340
I wish you

735
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,340
a safe and happy life.

736
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,340
I will

737
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,340
keep my promise.

738
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,340
Keep my promise.

739
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,340
Sit down.

740
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
Let's eat fish.

741
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,340
Which dog is so cute?

742
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,340
I just picked it up.

743
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,340
You picked it up?

744
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,340
It's for you.

745
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,340
I'm going to the academy

746
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,340
to bring it back and show it to you.

747
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,340
You have a home.

748
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,340
What's your name?

749
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,340
Let me give you a name.

750
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
It's Zao Zao.

751
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,340
Zao Zao?

752
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,340
You mean the morning class?

753
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,340
I want you to get up early.

754
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,340
Although the enemy

755
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,340
can't find the capital for a while,

756
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,340
you should be careful

757
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,340
when going out.

758
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,340
Don't go around

759
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,340
when I'm not here.

760
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Don't worry, Xiu.

761
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,340
I will be here.

762
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,340
We will take good care of ourselves.

763
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,340
We won't let you worry, right?

764
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,340
So cute, Zao Zao.

765
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,340
Xiu is so cute, too.

766
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,340
You're so cute.

767
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
You're so cute.

768
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,340
Zao Zao.

769
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,340
Your name is Zao Zao.

770
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,340
Play with me, okay?

771
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,340
He went over the eight-meter-high ground

772
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,340
and crossed the sky.

773
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,340
He didn't find the trace of the Jiaming tree.

774
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,340
If he's not in the southeast,

775
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,340
is he really going to the capital with that road?

776
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,340
If there were other horses in the inn at that time,

777
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
It's not too late.

778
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,340
Go to the river immediately.

779
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,340
After I left,

780
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,340
you help me look after the tree.

781
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
I think those bastards

782
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,340
will come one day.

783
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Don't worry.

784
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,340
Lin Shuyue is my sister.

785
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
You should pay more attention to the case of the teacher.

786
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,340
You can't let go of any clues.

787
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,340
Leave all these to me.

788
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,340
You know it.

789
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,340
I'm the best at finding news.

790
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,340
Are you sure you want to send Lin Shuyue?

791
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,340
I'm going back to the capital.

792
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,340
It's just right to walk together.

793
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,340
This case is very involved.

794
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,340
I also need to seek help from the powerful.

795
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,340
Greetings, Chief.

796
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,340
You may rise.

797
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,340
I have another student here to study.

798
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,340
It also increases my talent in Songlin Academy.

799
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,340
In a few months,

800
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,340
I'll be free.

801
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,340
I hope you can be a great student.

802
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
I just got the chance to study in the academy.

803
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,340
I'm not a student.

804
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,340
I'm just a student.

805
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,340
I'm not a student.

806
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,340
I'm a student.

807
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,340
The academy is full of talented people.

808
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,340
Although I have this ambition,

809
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,340
I dare not boast.

810
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,340
I've seen Mr. Song Qingzhao before.

811
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,340
Qingzhao is the grandson of Duke Zheng.

812
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,340
He is the brother of Duke Rui.

813
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,340
Although he is from a noble family,

814
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,340
he has no spirit of money.

815
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,340
You can talk to him more in the future.

816
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,340
Thank you for your advice.

817
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,340
Thank you.

818
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,340
Are you sure they are in Songlin Academy?

819
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
Don't worry, sir.

820
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,340
I've checked it out.

821
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,340
This is it.

822
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
Let's go and buy some gifts.

823
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,340
Okay.

824
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,340
Over there.

825
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,340
What business do you want to make?

826
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
Sir, how about this?

827
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,340
I seem to have seen this before.

828
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,340
It's him.

829
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,340
Mr. Song.

830
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,340
Mrs. Ning.

831
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,340
Qingcheng Garden is not fierce.

832
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,340
Don't miss the white-headed man

833
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,340
even if time passes by.

834
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,340
Once the heart is like a candle,

835
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,340
flowers bloom and fall in the world.

836
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,340
I will follow the wind

837
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,340
wherever the greedy man goes.

838
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,340
I will stay in Qingcheng

839
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,340
even if time changes.

840
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,340
I will live my life

841
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:20,340
in the world with you.

842
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,340
When the sun rises,

843
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,340
the moon sets and the firework burns.

844
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,340
I look back at the old days

845
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:33,340
and start over.

846
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,340
If the scenery is beautiful,

847
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,340
I can go back to the past.

848
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:42,340
I will miss the old days

849
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,340
and get lost in my heart.

850
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,340
The long night is coming.

851
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:56,340
I can't help missing you.

852
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,340
If the sea is far away,

853
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:05,340
I can go back to the past.

854
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,340
I have no regrets.

855
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,340
I will live my life.

856
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,340
I will forget the past.

857
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:21,340
I will live my life.

858
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,340
The End
