00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
или

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I will never forget you.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I will never forget you.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will never forget you.

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I will never forget you.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I will never forget you.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will never forget you.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I will never forget you.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I will never forget you.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I will never forget you.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will never forget you.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I will never forget you.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I will never forget you.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I will never forget you.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I will never forget you.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I will never forget you.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I will never forget you.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I will never forget you.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I will never forget you.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I will never forget you.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will never forget you.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I will never forget you.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I will never forget you.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I will never forget you.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I will never forget you.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I will never forget you.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will never forget you.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I will never forget you.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will never forget you.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will never forget you.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I will never forget you.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will never forget you.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will never forget you.

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will never forget you.

35
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never forget you.

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will never forget you.

37
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I will never forget you.

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I will never forget you.

39
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will never forget you.

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will never forget you.

41
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will never forget you.

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I will never forget you.

43
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I will never forget you.

44
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I will never forget you.

45
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will never forget you.

46
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will never forget you.

47
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will never forget you.

48
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I will never forget you.

49
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I will never forget you.

50
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will never forget you.

51
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I will never forget you.

52
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I will never forget you.

53
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will never forget you.

54
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will never forget you.

55
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will never forget you.

56
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I will never forget you.

57
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The End

58
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 18

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Can you tell how long he has been dead?

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The dead person has been dead for more than a week.

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Sir, there is a footprint on the window.

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There is also a embroidery sword.

63
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A weapon.

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's it.

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sir.

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The End

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
My god.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My god.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Who is so cruel

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
to kill the woman?

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Who is the murderer?

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He should be executed

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
on the day of the two kings' inspection.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What is the situation?

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Although Lu Wencai is low-class,

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
he won't be killed.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
My god.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
King of Yu. King of Rui.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The Lu family is loyal to the court.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But they don't want to be killed

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
by the murderer

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
under the feet of the emperor.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Please

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
help my son.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Minister Lu.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You are a important official of the court.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Many students are here.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't lose your memory.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The dead person has been dead.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Please rest in peace.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The death of your son

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
has been found in Liangzhou's government office.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What is the truth?

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
There will be a result later.

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Come on.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Help Minister Lu to the room.

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
My son.

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Mrs. Jia.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How is the investigation going?

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Your Majesty.

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The body is still warm.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The bones are not yet dried.

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The blood is not yet silver.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
According to the five-seat tea party,

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
the dead person will not be dead

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
for more than a week.

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The initial judgment is murder.

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is the murder we found outside the window.

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The murderer

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
is a man who attacked the dead with a sword.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He accidentally fell into the chaos.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Please have a look.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Today, the two kings are here.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The whole court is closed.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Lu Wencai

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
if he is killed in a room,

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm afraid the murderer is the owner of the academy.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
King Rui, look.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There is a word on this sword.

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
a Xie.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Xie?

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Xie?

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Chief Xu.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Is there anyone

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
named Xie in this academy?

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There is only one person named Xie in the academy.

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's the person named Yongqing Houli.

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's the person named Xie.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The person named Xie

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
is the son of Yongqing Houli,

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Xie Xi.

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This...

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Xie Xi.

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Xie Xi.

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Where is this person?

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
King Rui,

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Xie Xi had a fight with Lu Wencai yesterday.

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He was locked up.

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He is not here now.

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Send Xie Xi.

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The Yongqing Hou's mansion has always been guarded by you.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How did King Rui deal with it?

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This case has not been investigated yet.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Prince Yu said this

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
too early.

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
down there.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Xie Xi.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The sword

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
is theLE that you have.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
King Rui,

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
this thing

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
is yours.

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,760
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,840
But the thing was lost two days ago.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know why it's here.

158
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,600
Besides, two days ago,

159
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,040
when I was fighting with Lu Wencai,

160
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,280
I was attacked by him.

161
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,360
I haven't recovered yet.

162
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,360
Even if I have the sword,

163
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,040
I have no strength to hurt people.

164
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,680
Where is the person

165
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,080
who killed Lu Wencai in the incense?

166
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,680
I went into the room alone

167
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,680
and didn't go out.

168
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,400
My book case can prove it.

169
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,320
Your book case is true.

170
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,160
Prove it?

171
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,400
What is the proof?

172
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,960
Your Highness,

173
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,800
I have another witness.

174
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,240
Who is it?

175
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,880
I was trying to kill Tang Sheng.

176
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,680
He came to visit me.

177
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,920
A person who tried to kill Tang Sheng?

178
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,440
Why did he come?

179
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,800
Your Highness, you don't know.

180
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,040
I attacked Lu Wencai yesterday

181
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,000
because Lu Wencai bullied Tang Sheng.

182
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,560
I wanted to make him pay.

183
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,000
So this morning,

184
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,640
Tang Sheng came to thank me.

185
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
I'm Tang Sheng.

186
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,080
I'm Tang Sheng.

187
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,640
Before you left for the incense,

188
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,320
did you visit Xie Xi?

189
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,720
I did

190
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
receive Xie Xi's return yesterday.

191
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,800
But

192
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
I haven't visited him recently.

193
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,160
Tang Sheng, you...

194
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,320
Mr. Xie,

195
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,480
you are just involved in this case.

196
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,040
If you didn't do it,

197
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
Prince Yu and Prince Rui

198
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,080
would clear you up.

199
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm grateful for your protection.

200
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,200
But it's a matter of life and death.

201
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm sorry for what I did.

202
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,000
Xie Xi,

203
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,520
you are guilty

204
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,400
for making false witness.

205
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,960
Tang Sheng,

206
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,680
why are you doing this?

207
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,040
I understand.

208
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,960
You killed Lu Wencai, right?

209
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,720
You are afraid that he will harass you again.

210
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,200
So you saw me fighting with him yesterday

211
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,040
and framed me.

212
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,680
You killed him, right?

213
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,160
Xie Xi.

214
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,320
Don't be rash.

215
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
What he said is true or false.

216
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,240
You will know it after a trial.

217
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,840
Why are you

218
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,080
shouting in front of the two kings?

219
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,600
The two kings are not rude.

220
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,240
But Tang Sheng

221
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,440
is evil.

222
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,920
Yeah.

223
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,000
Chief Xue,

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,040
what's going on?

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,840
Isn't Tang Sheng

226
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,360
your servant?

227
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,040
Why does she dress up as a man

228
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,480
and hide her face?

229
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,280
Who is she?

230
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,720
Well,

231
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,560
I really don't know.

232
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,760
A year ago,

233
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,840
Xie Xi brought her here

234
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,080
and put her in the Academy.

235
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,080
She is also a good person.

236
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
Nothing has happened so far.

237
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,040
Xie Xi,

238
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,400
what's going on?

239
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,520
Your Majesty,

240
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,520
Tang Sheng

241
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,560
is the only daughter of the guilty Su Changhua,

242
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,400
Su Tangli.

243
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,680
It's me

244
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,120
who took her from the abandoned factory

245
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,440
and saved her in the abandoned factory.

246
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,360
For the sake of our acquaintance,

247
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,560
I hid her in the Academy.

248
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,120
Before her death,

249
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,080
Lu Wencai broke her identity

250
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,360
and tortured her.

251
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,000
I did it out of kindness

252
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,360
to help her.

253
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,440
Unexpectedly,

254
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,960
she kept the goods

255
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,320
and wanted to kill Lu Wencai.

256
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,640
She even stole my embroidery

257
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,200
and hurt me.

258
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Xie Xi,

259
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,680
how could I hurt you?

260
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,280
Don't be impulsive.

261
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,000
It's no good for you and me.

262
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,720
Embroidery is your personal protective item.

263
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
How could she steal it?

264
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,720
What's your relationship?

265
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,840
She...

266
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,160
She tried to seduce me

267
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,040
and used my pity for her

268
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,960
to give her a chance.

269
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,840
Xie Xi,

270
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,520
how could you...

271
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,320
How could you turn the tables?

272
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,200
Your Majesty,

273
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,360
although I beat Lu Wencai yesterday,

274
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,720
I was also seduced by Su Tangli.

275
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,080
I'm going to inherit the throne of the Crown Prince.

276
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,280
Why should I bet on my future?

277
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,280
I know she's in a critical situation.

278
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,240
She's a slave who escaped from the official.

279
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,080
She obviously killed Lu Wencai

280
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,400
for her own sake.

281
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
Xie Xi,

282
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,040
you said you'd protect me

283
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,240
and love me.

284
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,200
You even said you'd marry Lady Wen'an

285
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,560
and never leave me.

286
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Now,

287
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,080
you're trying to keep your secret

288
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,640
and pushing me to the edge.

289
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,760
Lu Wencai knows I'm not a concubine.

290
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
He tried to seduce me

291
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,440
and even insulted you.

292
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,480
He made you hate him.

293
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,840
You once said

294
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,520
you'd never let him go.

295
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,080
Why didn't you kill him?

296
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,520
Besides,

297
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,080
I'm a weak woman.

298
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,720
I can't fight back.

299
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,120
How could I kill Lu Wencai?

300
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,720
He didn't want to defend you

301
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,560
because you're weak.

302
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,640
He said you'd kill him when he was in peace.

303
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,920
How could he escape?

304
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,280
You even used your father's name

305
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,080
to forge the identity document

306
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,880
to save me.

307
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,440
I thought you were sincere to me.

308
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,640
Now,

309
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,880
you're blind.

310
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,640
Forge the identity document?

311
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,400
Enough.

312
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,640
Use your power

313
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,840
to forge the identity document?

314
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,720
It's a big crime.

315
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,080
I'm also willing to help you.

316
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,040
Now, not only Xie Xi,

317
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,440
but also Marquis Yongqing.

318
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,120
King of Rui,

319
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,640
are you ready

320
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,640
to open up the whole Marquis Yongqing's mansion?

321
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,960
Prince, you've committed a crime

322
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,680
with the common people.

323
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,560
Don't worry, King of Rui.

324
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,000
I'll handle this case

325
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,040
with full credit.

326
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,840
Marquis,

327
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,880
put Xie Xi and Su Tangli

328
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,520
in the academy for now.

329
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,440
We'll investigate this case

330
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,360
later.

331
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,800
Yes.

332
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,240
Guards.

333
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,280
Guards.

334
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,240
What did the killer

335
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,200
tell us?

336
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,560
He said he heard everything from Brother Ming Yu

337
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,400
and didn't know anything.

338
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,800
I guess it's just a trap.

339
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,400
We haven't found the killer yet.

340
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,640
We can't let him get away.

341
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,800
I understand.

342
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,440
Prince Lu,

343
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,360
under King of Rui's order,

344
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,040
please ask Su Tangli a few questions.

345
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,800
Tangli,

346
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,720
there's no one else here.

347
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,000
Tell me the truth.

348
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,720
Did you kill Lu Wencai?

349
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,080
I didn't kill Lu Wencai.

350
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,240
I'm a knight in the name of my father.

351
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
I'm a knight in the name of my father.

352
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,160
If I tell you anything,

353
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,120
I'll tell my father to rest in peace.

354
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,440
Okay.

355
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,560
As long as you don't get your blood,

356
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,560
everything will be fine.

357
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,640
Brother Lu,

358
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,000
Brother Ying,

359
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,480
thank you for your concern.

360
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,040
Check carefully.

361
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,840
There are no wounds or blood stains.

362
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,160
Raise your hands.

363
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,240
Come on, stand up and have a look.

364
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,200
Those scholars

365
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,640
didn't find any wounds or blood stains.

366
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,080
Because we always

367
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,560
work for the two kings,

368
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,960
I want to ask you for help.

369
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,920
Let us help Liangzhou Prefecture to investigate the case.

370
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Prince Yu and Chancellor

371
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,160
are also allowed to do so.

372
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,240
With your help,

373
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,520
we can find out the truth very quickly.

374
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,520
Give you justice for Lu Xiong's loss.

375
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,040
Take Brother Sha Ran to Xiujing.

376
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,880
I'll go with you.

377
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,280
But Xie Xi is the one who killed Brother Sha Ran.

378
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,760
And Su Tang Li's identity is very special.

379
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,680
And the motive of the murder is more mature.

380
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,080
They do have the suspicion of murder.

381
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,600
But the real murderer

382
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,080
is hard to tell at a glance.

383
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,720
If Xie Xi and Su Niangzi

384
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,120
really want to kill Lu Wencai,

385
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,880
there is a better chance.

386
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,640
We have to wait for the two kings

387
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,160
to take everyone to the academy

388
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,360
before we can do it.

389
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,920
And throw the embroidery sword outside the window.

390
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,400
No matter how busy Xie Xi and Tang Li are,

391
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,040
they won't make such a lowly mistake.

392
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,600
Unless the embroidery sword

393
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,400
was deliberately thrown by the murderer at the crime scene.

394
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,360
So we can frame Xie Su and Niangzi.

395
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,640
In this way,

396
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,480
we can only understand these doubts.

397
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,200
I think so, too, Jingang.

398
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,400
It seems that after the Ying family's rumor

399
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,800
and Liu Yuanying's incident,

400
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,360
we have more tacit understanding.

401
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,040
Shen Ming Shu, you are clear-minded.

402
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,440
That's why you have an interest in me.

403
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm not.

404
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Since Lu Wencai

405
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
entered the academy early in the morning,

406
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,000
it means that this case is not a temporary one.

407
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,560
Then...

408
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,840
It means...

409
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,360
It means the murderer

410
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,000
will have a deep intention to kill the academy.

411
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,320
You...

412
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,160
You see.

413
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,400
You have a good understanding with Ming Shu.

414
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Let's check the scene first.

415
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,920
What did I say wrong again?

416
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,440
By the way,

417
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,280
Madam Lin has something urgent to see you.

418
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,080
I almost forgot.

419
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,320
I'll come to you later.

420
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,360
The coroner of the banquet said

421
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,040
that Lu Wencai's wound

422
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,160
is more severe than the sword's.

423
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
It means that the murderer has more than one sword.

424
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,840
That's true.

425
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,600
When he found out that he had lost his hand,

426
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
he didn't die for long.

427
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
His blood had not yet solidified.

428
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,840
The wound was soaked in blood.

429
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,640
It's not obvious.

430
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,320
Now that the blood has dried up,

431
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,560
it's easier to compare.

432
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,600
Brother Lu, you know these?

433
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,040
Mr. Song, you don't know.

434
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,000
My father is the head of the Jianglin Mansion.

435
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,760
We followed him

436
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,480
and started to run to the crime scene since childhood.

437
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,120
We've seen countless bodies.

438
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,200
Brother Lu's experience in the banquet

439
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,480
is more than enough

440
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,720
to go to the exam.

441
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,720
Brother Lu is really good.

442
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,760
Yin Xun always exaggerates.

443
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,480
Brother Song, just listen to him.

444
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,440
By the way,

445
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,920
isn't the sword a single shot?

446
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,760
Even if it's not a single shot,

447
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,000
it's possible that it's hit

448
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,080
several times in the same wound.

449
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,160
Mr. Song, you mean

450
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,440
Lu Wencai

451
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,880
didn't die from the sword shot from the window?

452
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,960
Sword-shaving is a secret weapon.

453
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,120
It's used in a sneak attack.

454
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,120
Normally, it's shot only ten steps.

455
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,400
The more it's shot, the more dangerous it is.

456
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,480
Besides, Lu Wencai's wound

457
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,680
is at the right neck.

458
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
It means the murderer

459
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
didn't kill him from the window.

460
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,040
So,

461
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,040
Lu Wencai wasn't shot.

462
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,040
Someone sneaked into the room

463
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,240
and attacked him from behind.

464
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,280
He died from the sword shot.

465
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
He escaped

466
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,160
and fell into the room.

467
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,120
That explains

468
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,960
why the scene is so chaotic.

469
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,920
Lu Wencai was in the middle of the road,

470
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,480
but he didn't make a sound.

471
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,680
It means the murderer

472
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,720
held his nose

473
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,200
and stopped him from begging for help.

474
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,360
If Lu Wencai was killed like this,

475
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,120
Su Tangli would be in trouble.

476
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,920
As for Xie Xi...

477
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,840
Xie Xi was hurt by Lu Wencai.

478
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,400
It should be hard to handle.

479
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,560
Neither of them could kill Lu Wencai.

480
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,560
That proves what we thought.

481
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,000
The murderer is different.

482
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,640
How did he escape

483
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,240
after he killed him?

484
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,880
That's what I want to know.

485
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,320
Why did the murderer choose Huan Tao Hall?

486
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,560
Song,

487
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,080
is there a path

488
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,600
between Huan Tao Hall and the Bookstore?

489
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,640
Yes.

490
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,320
I'll go and have a look.

491
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,640
If we guess

492
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,800
Lu Wencai's neck was hit by a tree,

493
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,840
blood will be spurted out.

494
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,360
The murderer's clothes

495
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,080
must be covered with Lu Wencai's blood.

496
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,520
What about the blood?

497
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,680
Lu Chang.

498
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,560
Lu Chang.

499
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,200
Look.

500
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,560
What did I find?

501
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,200
Look.

502
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,360
Lu Wencai's poem.

503
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,680
With this poem,

504
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,200
everything is clear.

505
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,920
Lu Wencai might know that

506
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,080
the two kings will enter Huan Tao Hall,

507
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,880
so he brought this poem with him.

508
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,600
He sneaked in here

509
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,400
to show his poems to the two kings

510
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,200
and turn them into a book.

511
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
But he didn't expect the murderer

512
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,000
to be waiting for him here.

513
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,600
The murderer killed him with his own hands.

514
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,800
He took the poem and wrote it.

515
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,480
He didn't have time to destroy it.

516
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
He left it in the hiding place

517
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,360
on the way out.

518
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
The most important thing now

519
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,440
is to find the blood

520
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,760
that was covered with Lu Wencai's blood.

521
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,400
But we looked everywhere.

522
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,800
We couldn't find the blood.

523
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,600
In such a hasty situation,

524
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,480
the murderer still had time to change clothes.

525
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,680
What if he didn't?

526
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,000
So,

527
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,240
if we don't tell him,

528
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,720
it will cost chaos and suffering.

529
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:00,920
I think

530
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,040
it's pretty logical to blame him neither.

531
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:09,240
The

532
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,720
murderer

533
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,720
who poisoned Lu Yuancai

534
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,960
had both Effectless Spell

535
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,080
used this to kill the murder weapon.

536
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,000
technology

537
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:19,920
brought

538
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,760
By showing the poem,

539
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,240
the murderer

540
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Mr. Zhang, why don't you drink?

541
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
I've been drinking since I was a kid.

542
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,240
Thank you.

543
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,080
I'm sorry.

544
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,760
My clothes are all dirty.

545
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,720
I'll ask the guard to change your clothes.

546
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,520
Or it'll be too cold.

547
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,200
The lady from the outside

548
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,120
is not allowed to drink.

549
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,720
I'm sorry.

550
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm sorry.

551
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,960
I'm sorry.

552
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,680
I'm sorry.

553
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,320
I'm sorry.

554
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:47,960
I'm sorry.

555
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,560
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,280
I'm sorry.

557
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,920
I'm sorry.

558
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,720
I'm sorry.

559
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,360
I'm sorry.

560
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,400
I'm really fine.

561
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,320
I'm really fine.

562
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,400
I'm really sorry.

563
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,800
The case has progressed.

564
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,040
You can leave now.

565
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,160
Mr. Zhang,

566
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
what are you thinking about?

567
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,920
Do you need help?

568
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,800
Nothing.

569
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,320
Zhang Song,

570
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,640
where are you going?

571
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,280
You...

572
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,560
Are you looking for

573
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,360
this?

574
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

575
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,480
I'm just copying the records

576
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,320
and going back to room 21.

577
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
Please, please.

578
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,160
No.

579
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,200
Yes.

580
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,060
Bishop,

581
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,840
Minister Lu,

582
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,400
Zhang Song has confessed his guilt.

583
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,720
It's better to reveal the truth.

584
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,240
Yes.

585
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,600
I tricked Lu Wencai to go to the Huan Taoguan

586
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,760
and killed him.

587
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,720
Where did you get the embroidery?

588
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,080
I picked it up.

589
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,080
I saw the word Xie on the embroidery.

590
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,560
I knew it was Xie Xi's.

591
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,320
You threw the embroidery into the window

592
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,400
to frame Xie Xi?

593
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,160
Yes.

594
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,120
Xie Xi was grounded.

595
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,280
He could be a criminal.

596
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,680
Besides, he had a fight with Lu Wencai.

597
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,120
He's the most likely suspect.

598
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,200
What happened after that?

599
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,360
After that...

600
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,060
Huo Anshou

601
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,500
Huo Anshou

602
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,720
God bless me!

603
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,840
If he died in the

604
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,200
memorial tablet that day,

605
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,920
there wouldn't be so many things today.

606
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,360
You made the memorial tablet

607
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,160
of Mingli Hall.

608
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,920
You did it to kill Lu Wencai.

609
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,840
Why did you kill Lu Wencai?

610
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,560
I've been suffering from cold and cold for ten years.

611
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,680
My parents sent me to Songlin Academy

612
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,880
with all their heart.

613
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,200
I wanted to earn fame and make my family proud.

614
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
But I met a despicable person like Lu Wencai

615
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,680
and he bullied me every day.

616
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,520
I was so frustrated.

617
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,720
I couldn't bear it anymore.

618
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,600
I lost my mind

619
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,920
and made a mistake.

620
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,720
You're talking nonsense!

621
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,120
My son is a good man.

622
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,520
How could he bully others?

623
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,640
It was you.

624
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,360
You killed my son.

625
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,600
You're still talking nonsense.

626
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,720
You killed a man.

627
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,760
You're a sinner!

628
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,560
You...

629
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,360
You...

630
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,920
Lu Wencai is a drunkard.

631
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,680
He bullied men and women. Everyone knows that.

632
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,200
My son is...

633
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,600
What?

634
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,280
If your father hadn't

635
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,360
covered up for him,

636
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,960
I'm afraid

637
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,240
he would have been arrested

638
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,360
and sent to the border.

639
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,840
Minister Lu,

640
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,920
why did you change your mind?

641
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,280
You raised

642
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,560
such a despicable man.

643
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Lu Zegang is just

644
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,320
a criminal.

645
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,040
You should be sent to the border.

646
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,560
I...

647
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,360
I'll kill you at any time!

648
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,800
Enough!

649
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,320
I...

650
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,640
Even if you're bullied,

651
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,840
it's not a reason to kill people and frame them.

652
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,800
Tomorrow morning,

653
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,440
take the criminal to Liangzhou Prefecture.

654
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,760
Send Xie Xi and Su Tanglin.

655
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,320
Yes.

656
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,040
I'm sorry.

657
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,560
Please forgive me.

658
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,920
Xie Xi,

659
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,520
you're the eldest son of Duke Yongqing.

660
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,040
You wanted to take the throne

661
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,120
and serve the country.

662
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,680
Now,

663
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,720
you dare to fake the document

664
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,160
and cover up for the criminal.

665
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,800
You even secretly made a deal with him.

666
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,480
You know that

667
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,200
you're a traitor

668
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,560
and a criminal.

669
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,040
You're not worthy of the world.

670
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,680
I'll take the official position

671
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,680
and punish you according to the law.

672
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,880
King of Rui,

673
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,320
how should we deal with Su Tangli?

674
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,480
Should we take him back to the Ministry of Education?

675
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Minister Su,

676
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,520
two lords,

677
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,000
Su Tangli is sick.

678
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,880
But Ministry of Education

679
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
never carried him

680
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,000
to the graveyard before you called out.

681
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,840
He's chocolate bandit!

682
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Besides,

683
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,440
the Ministry of Education

684
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,160
and was killed to get rid of the Ming Dynasty.

685
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,760
Now he's alive.

686
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,520
It's hard for the Ministry of Revenue to do anything.

687
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,800
So I think

688
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,560
we should leave the Su Tang Li

689
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,360
in the Songlin Academy

690
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,920
and let Xu Shanzhang

691
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
take care of it temporarily.

692
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,480
What do you think, Prince Yu?

693
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,280
You're right.

694
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,680
I'm a man of my word.

695
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,600
In that case,

696
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
leave the Su Tang Li for now.

697
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,040
You need to keep a close watch

698
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,520
and prepare for further investigation.

699
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,640
Yes.

700
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,040
Yes.

701
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,160
All right.

702
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,480
Since it's over,

703
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,960
I'll go back to the mansion first.

704
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,080
Yes.

705
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,880
Ma'am Jia.

706
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,080
Yes.

707
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,640
You need to thank Lu Jieyuan

708
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,440
for helping your mansion

709
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,640
to be saved.

710
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,200
I don't dare to.

711
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,280
The case is clear.

712
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,240
It's all thanks to you.

713
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,440
I'm just helping

714
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,880
and don't dare to take the credit.

715
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,280
I'm sorry.

716
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,280
I'm sorry.

717
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,920
I'm sorry.

718
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,440
Thank you, Mr. Lu,

719
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,880
for saving the Su Tang Li.

720
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,840
Prince Rui, you're too kind.

721
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,320
It's your request,

722
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,720
but it's legal.

723
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,360
I'm just being fair.

724
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,240
Recently,

725
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,640
I've checked the files of the Dali Temple.

726
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,880
I found that Su Changhua's corruption case

727
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,120
is full of suspicious points.

728
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,920
The Su Tang Li

729
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,560
is not only his only bloodline,

730
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,640
but also a key witness to this case.

731
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,600
We need to protect him.

732
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,280
companions

733
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:14,900
Our

734
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,740
to ready the silk plant customers

735
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,540
later.

736
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:20,820
I have been great

737
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,260
since 8encer Sun.

738
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,520
I should tell you

739
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,520
that I have been here

740
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,340
sinceinaudible number one.

741
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,380
Being here

742
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,040
makes Falun Tokings

743
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,560
who else?

744
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,780
As for Farming Brigade,

745
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,440
any person with a pattern

746
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,560
can be you.

747
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,820
Duke Yong Qing

748
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,340
has been supporting me

749
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,340
in the court.

750
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,220
Now his legitimate son

751
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,300
is under arrest by Liangzhou Prefecture.

752
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,020
What do you think I should do?

753
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,500
Since His Majesty is here to ask me,

754
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,500
I'll just say no.

755
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,100
Duke Yong Qing is loyal to His Majesty.

756
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,900
If he doesn't plead for him,

757
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,300
he will be heartbroken.

758
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,900
But if he pleads for him,

759
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,980
the facts are there.

760
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,900
Why would he punish him?

761
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,140
My grandfather said

762
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,660
law is the power of the country.

763
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,780
It's the right thing to do.

764
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,940
If one person doesn't do it,

765
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,260
even if he gets one person,

766
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,260
I'm afraid the world will be in chaos.

767
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,740
You want me to

768
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,980
give up the Duke Yong Qing's Mansion?

769
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,180
This time, the Duke Yong Qing's Mansion

770
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,700
must be punished for Xie Xi's death

771
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,580
and even implicate the position of Duke Yong Qing.

772
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,180
It's not about giving up the position of Duke Yong Qing's Mansion.

773
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,940
His Majesty can try his best to comfort Duke Yong Qing

774
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,060
and support the Xies.

775
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,020
In case Duke Yong Qing loses his memory,

776
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,220
he can try his best to comfort me.

777
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,140
This is not only about the law,

778
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,020
but also about the Xies.

779
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,820
Your Highness,

780
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,340
this is really my good side.

781
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,260
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

782
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,620
I will also

783
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,500
get in touch with the Xies

784
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,820
to let them know

785
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,900
that Your Majesty has been caring for them.

786
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,980
Thank you for your help.

787
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,100
I should do all these.

788
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,260
I'll leave you to it.

789
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,540
Please have some soup.

790
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,260
Why don't you...

791
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,540
Is there anything else?

792
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,180
Have an early rest.

793
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,020
It seems that Your Highness still cares about me.

794
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,740
Who shot it?

795
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,180
Two bullets.

796
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,860
Uncle Min.

797
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,220
Leader.

798
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,300
When you grow up,

799
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,660
you'll always be the other person.

800
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,700
If someone suddenly shows up and shares his care,

801
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,660
you'll feel uncomfortable.

802
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,940
You're so pitiful.

803
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,580
I'm jealous.

804
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,980
It's really not right.

805
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,340
You're not going to laugh at me, are you?

806
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,220
I admire and admire you

807
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,860
for your good manners.

808
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,540
How can I laugh at you?

809
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,820
Mr. Qin,

810
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,780
I thought

811
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,580
you're a good friend

812
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,780
and a good friend.

813
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,540
You're a friend worth making friends with.

814
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,340
Now,

815
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,940
I think you're a person

816
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,340
who can't be trusted.

817
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,540
If I have any worries,

818
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,060
I'll just tell you.

819
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,100
Then you'll feel comfortable.

820
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,180
From now on,

821
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,660
whether it's a worry

822
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,740
or a happy thing,

823
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,140
you can tell me.

824
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,860
I'm willing to share your worries.

825
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,340
I'm willing to share your happiness.

826
00:38:37,020 --> 00:39:02,820
I love you, top

827
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,340
Mr. top ten

828
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,980
Who is it?

829
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,300
I forgot.

830
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,820
You've been bullied by Luo Wencai.

831
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,740
Why didn't you tell the chief

832
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,340
and leave the Academy?

833
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,820
Why did you take the risk

834
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,100
to do such an extreme thing?

835
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,820
Are you leaving or not?

836
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,020
You're still worried about the prisoners?

837
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:26,820
Let's go.

838
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,780
What are you suspecting?

839
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,740
Zhang Song just came to the Academy.

840
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,780
I don't want to lose.

841
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,460
But I heard Yang Zishu

842
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,460
always bullied him.

843
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,780
Zhang Song doesn't hate Yang Zishu

844
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,940
that much.

845
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,940
He wants to kill Luo Wencai

846
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,180
even if he destroys his future.

847
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,140
Why?

848
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,620
Oops.

849
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,780
Mermaid Patriarch, Mermaid Patriarch.

850
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,980
I'm so c pies. Come and see.

851
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,340
Damn it.

852
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
Where is the monster.

853
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:06,980
Go.

854
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,500
Since you know it,

855
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,820
I have nothing else to do.

856
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,660
I saw the magic you just played.

857
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,140
That's your childhood stuff.

858
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,180
Luo Wencai is eating, drinking, drinking,

859
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,500
cheating on men and women.

860
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
Everyone knows it.

861
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,620
I'll die.

862
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,300
Ming Shu.

863
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,220
Zhangsun poisoned himself in prison.

864
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,940
Zhangsun or the reason why

865
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,220
the bride has been looking for the brother.

866
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,540
I'll go find him now.

867
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,820
You go find the thief around Luo Wencai.

868
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,940
I have a problem to solve.

869
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,820
I'll go find him now.

870
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,820
I have a problem to confirm.

871
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,020
The poison has entered his lungs.

872
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,580
He's barely breathing.

873
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,540
If you have anything to say, just say it.

874
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,380
Huan Yuan.

875
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,780
Huan Yuan.

876
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,220
Son.

877
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,620
Son.

878
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,900
It's really you, son.

879
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:00,420
It's a long way to go.

880
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:07,140
Don't miss the chance to meet you.

881
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:14,100
It's a good time to meet you.

882
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,380
I'll follow you wherever you go.

883
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,940
If I could see you for a while,

884
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,940
let us pass each other,

885
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,900
Gogwon Где 나로

886
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,540
If the light HISA sheet is sh Damascus их

887
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,980
I've kept my makeup deep

888
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,260
and I pray to the Lamar

889
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,040
to give her a new life

890
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,580
If I could see you both tentfully,

891
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:23,740
Nothing can stop me from longing.

892
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:35,120
Never
