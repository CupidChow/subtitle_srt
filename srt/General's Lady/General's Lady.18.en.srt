It's Jin'er...?

29
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,250
Young Madam Bai, you're wearing such plain clothes today.

30
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,810
It's remarkably different from your past colorful ones.

31
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,350
This is quite a different style.

32
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,530
Zhu'er and I are going to the temple to light incense and pray for blessings for the manor.

33
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,880
This... What is Zhu'er holding?

34
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,480
Since we're going to the temple then we certainly need to bring some tribute.

35
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,560
It is such a beautifully carved box. It must be the finest of tributes.

36
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,520
Let me take a look.

37
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,830
They are just normal tributes.

38
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,590
We put them in this box because we were in a rush. There's nothing to see.

39
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,070
Since Young Madam Bai is so sincere in her prayers,

40
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,210
then why don't you bring me along?

41
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,480
Going to the mountains to pray is very boring.

42
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,430
I'm afraid that you don't have that patience.

43
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,400
I won't be. I'm not busy at all.

44
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,270
Moreover, I've been back for a while now but haven't gone to pray yet.

45
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,910
In order to burn incense and pray, one must be pure and have fasted.

46
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,030
One must not have distractions in her mind in order to have a pure character.

47
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,920
Going so casually like you,

48
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,760
I fear we won't receive any blessing and would receive disasters instead.

49
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,250
All right, there is no need to say anymore, Young Madam Bai.

50
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,070
I just shall not go.

51

won't I become the evilest person ever?

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,750

57
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,630

58
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,750

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,690
If I didn't see you going out in a rush and followed you,

61
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,050
then something big would've happened today!

62
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,830
I was just following Concubine Bai. I didn't know that this would happen.

63
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,340
Following Concubine Bai?

64
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,070
Why?

65
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,180
Just now, I noticed...

66
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,040
Sit down and talk.

67
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,750
I noticed that Concubine Bai's actions were very strange.

68
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,060
The way she dressed was completely different from normal.

69
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,650
Moreover, her actions were suspicious.

70
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,370
She said she was going to go burn incenses, but she was hiding the tributes that she was going to bring with her.

71
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,740
It seems like she was afraid that I would see something. I felt like something was wrong.

72
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,060
Furthermore, she clearly knew I was following her,

73
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,340
but she purposely led me to a small alley.

74
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,000
Now that you say that... That night in the forbidden room,

75
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,250
I also saw a mysterious shadow that went in the direction of Concubine Bai's room.

76
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,270
However, that person seemed to be quite familiar with the manor,

77
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,010
so I had no other thoughts.

78
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,360
That matches up. There's definitely a problem with Concubine Bai.

79
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,130
Moreover, I heard from my mother that a lot of things in the manor have been stolen recently.

80
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,490
We can't let this matter be known.

81
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,840
Don't bother with this matter. I will go investigate this myself.

82
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,600
Without knowing the truth yet, we must be cautious of countercharges.

83
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,370
Why were you in the yard in the middle of the night?

84
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,800
How did you see a shadow? Do you not sleep at night?

85
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,070
Wait a second!

86
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,760
Zhu'er, you're walking in such a rush.

87
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,610
Are you hiding something?

88
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,740
Third Young Miss is here. What's the matter?

89
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,650
Who is this person?

90
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,830
Why does he look so unfamiliar?

91
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,060
This person copies and writes scriptures for my Madam Bai.

92
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,010
Scriptures?

93
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,020
What scriptures is he copying? What scriptures is he writing?

94
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,100
Where are the scriptures?

95
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,150
Third Young Miss, this is actually my cousin.

96
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,310
Because something happened at home, he impermissibly came to look for me here at the manor.

97
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,790
I'm afraid that someone would find out so I'm taking him out of the manor immediately.

98
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,150
He won't take something from the manor, will he?

99
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,890
Recently, there has been a lot of things going missing in the manor.

100
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,700
He wouldn't, he wouldn't. Third Young Miss, rest assured.

101
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,450
My cousin and I definitely aren't the type of people to commit crimes.

102
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,160
If you don't believe me then you could have someone search his body.

103
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,770
That's not necessary.

104
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,250
I'm just giving you a friendly reminder.

105
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,120
Don't let anything slip;

106
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,380
or else, it'll ruin your Young Madam Bai's reputation.

107
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,170
Thank you, Third Young Miss, for your reminder.

108
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,370
I'll take my cousin to leave the manor immediately.

109
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,110
It won't happen again. Let's go.

110
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,580
How could you two be so careless?

111
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,750
Young Madam, it was very hard to hide it!

112
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,850
Besides, if he left sooner before daybreak,

113
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,530
nothing would have happened. Right?

114
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,420
What? You're blaming me now?

115
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,570
I do not dare! It's just that it was very dangerous just now.

116
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,770
My logic was momentarily clouded, that's why I spoke nonsense!

117
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,020
Please punish me, Young Madam Bai.

118
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,720
Zhu'er, in this manor, I can only trust you.

119
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,440
Why would I blame you?

120
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,530
Tell him not to come here again today.

121
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,750
Or else, people will get suspicious. I will find a chance to meet him.

122
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,600
Yes.

123
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,720
Young Madam Bai!

124
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,030
Scared me to death!

125
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,950
Why did you suspiciously come here to my court?

126
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,200
If you didn't do anything bad, then you shouldn't be afraid of people coming.

127
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,700
If you didn't do anything wrong, then what are you scared about?

128
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,420
Wait! Young Madam Bai, where are you going?

129
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,610
With who? To do what?

130
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,390
Why should I tell you where I'm going?

131
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,390
We don't know each other well, why should I tell you?

132
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,140
Ever since you came back, the manor's rules have turned into a mess!

133
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,020
You're somehow concerned about me now. Hurry and go back to your general's manor.

134
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,140
I can't do that. After all, you are my father's lover right now.

135
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,340
Naturally, you are also someone dear to me.

136
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,410
Of course, I have to care about you.

137
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,450
I will definitely love you on my royal father's behalf.

138
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,290
I will properly protect and care for you, Young Madam Bai.

139
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,040
There's no need!

140
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,300
I heard that you are going out. Then you should know about the hardship in the world, Young Madam Bai.

141
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,290
Don't keep in touch with those unnecessary people and create trouble.

142
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,570
Cut off what you need to cut off, then there won't' be trouble.

143
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,680
Don't you think so?

144
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,880
Who says I'm going out?

145
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,040
Oh right, Young Madam Bai!

146
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,870
If you want to go out, then summon me at any time!

147
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,820
I have a lot of time! I can go with you any time!

148
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,660
They have been finally going against each other recently.

149
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,680
It seems that if we want to bully that brat Shen Jin,

150
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,300
then Young Madam Bai must make the first move.

151
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,540
You're right. Let's see what Shen Jin will do.

152
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,350
Let's just wait and watch the show.

153
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,770
What should I do?

154
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,300
Madam, she left.

155
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,370
Does she really suspect me?

156
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,380
No. If she did suspect you, she would have already told the prince.

157
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,660
Why would she let you off so easily?

158
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,640
That's true.

159
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,290
It's just that in "one moment she's like the wind and in the next, she's like the rain." <br> <i>(T/N: unpredictable)</i>

160
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,820
I can't tell what she's thinking.

161
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,360
She makes me flustered.

162
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,070
Stay in place for a few days first.

163
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,750
Don't go outside anymore.

164
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,440
I can't do that.

165
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,120
<i>[Tingxuan Inn]</i>

166
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,100
<i>[Tingxuan Inn]</i>

167
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,290
<i>[Tingxuan Inn]</i>

168
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,470
<i>General, why are you treating me like this?</i>

169
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,120
<i>What should I do then?</i>

170
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,660
Hey! Enough!

171
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,560
Jin'er?

172
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,980
Jin'er, don't blame... It's n-not the general's fault, it's all my fault.

173
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,360
I didn't know it was the general who asked me to come here.

174
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,200
I thought it was you who asked to meet with me here.

175
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,720
It's not the general. It's not the general who asked me to come here.

176
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,730
Young Madam Bai, stop acting.

177
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,140
My husband isn't muddle-headed like my royal father.

178
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,240
Besides, my husband is a reckless soldier.

179
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,230
He'll draw his sword and kill without a second thought!

180
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,840
Thankfully, I arrived in time and saved your life.

181
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,260
Young Madam Bai, you must remember

182
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,660
that I was the one who saved your life!

183
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,760
Husband, don't be angry at Young Madam Bai anymore.

184
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,370
I will go take a walk with you so you can calm down.

185
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,950
All right.

186
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,380
Jin'er... Jin'er!

187
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,250
Take this and burn it!

188
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,280
This—

189
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,460
She used your name to call me out.

190
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,660
I knew it was her, but I wanted to see what she wanted to do.

191
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,060
However, your expression didn't change one bit.

192
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,930
You made Young Madam Bai so angry her face turned green!

193
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,380
Why do you still smell like a fox?

194
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,710
Then, why don't you take off all my clothes?

195
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,910
In your dreams!

196
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,840
You're such a stupid general.

197
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,070
Since you knew long ago, why didn't you take me along?

198
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,780
Thankfully, I arrived in time today.

199
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,160
If it was someone else who went there today, you would never be able to defend yourself!

200
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,550
Right, right, right. Fortunately, My Lady arrived in time and saved me from trouble.

201
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,390
Rou Rou! Prepare hot water! The general wants to take a bath!

202
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,260
Who wants to take a bath?

203
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,610
The stench of fox!

204
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,820
<i>[Rui Royal Manor]</i>

205
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,510
<i>[Rui Royal Manor]</i>

206
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,560
Here.

207
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,200
Be quick and neat!

208
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,740
It is the Mid-Autumn Festival today.

209
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,960
Everything must be in order. There must not be a single mishap.

210
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,700
If anyone messes up,

211
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,980
be careful of your skin!

212
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,710
I got it. Go on.

213
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,950
It's clear that Concubine Bai has a lover. Do you have any thoughts?

214
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,310
Tonight is the Mid-Autumn Festival, so everyone in the manor will come together.

215
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,120
Concubine Bai hasn't made any moves for days. She'll definitely do something tonight.

216
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,060
Let's wait and see what happens. Then we'll think of a way to deal with her.

217
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,800
No problem.

218
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,560
<i>Your Highness, here is another toast to you.</i>

219
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,680
<i>All right, all right, all right.</i>

220
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,960
As long as you are happy,

221
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
I will listen to whatever you say!

222
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,560
Drink however much wine you want!

223
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,060
Your Highness, I don't want anything.

224
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:03,200
I just want to be with you forever, never to be apart.

225
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,900
Concubine Bai is the best, the best!

226
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,050
This Concubine Bai indeed has some tricks.

227
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:14,320
Look! That brat Shen Jin has been behaving recently.

228
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,150
That's right. She suspiciously hides in her room all day long.

229
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,540
Just like a cowardly turtle!

230
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,840
That bitch.

231
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,510
She doesn't even know her place.

232
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,900
She wants to go against me? Now she knows how great I am.

233
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,860
Older Sister, your way of using someone else as a knife to kill is really efficient. <br> <i>(T/N: have someone else do one's own dirty work)</i>

234
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,580
Tonight, we shall continue with our victory.

235
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Drink another cup, My Prince.

236
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,670
Young Madam.

237
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,420
This is a high-quality Suzhou embroidery. This is a Mid-Autumn holiday gift for you, Young Madam.

238
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,580
- Zhu'er. <br> - Yes.

239
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Young Madam, I personally prepared this gift especially for you.

240
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,300
Let me personally put it on for you.

241
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,200
It's so pretty!

242
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,300
Young Madam, look. That brat is eating and drinking

243
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,200
at your banquet, but is not giving you any presents.

244
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,600
She doesn't respect you at all.

245
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,300
Your Highness.

246
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,400
The girls, Zi'er and Jing'er are indeed respectful and graceful daughters of the manor.

247
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,600
Those who are from low-ranked homes and cannot be presented aren't worthy of being compared.

248
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,800
They're all my biological children. This is the Royal Manor.

249
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Today is the mid-autumn festival. I didn't prepare a present for Young Madam Bai.

250
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm sorry for the lack of etiquette.

251
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,000
However, I did prepare a present for my royal father.

252
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,600
You even have a present for me?

253
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,700
Royal Father, you like jade.

254
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,400
This was personally selected by my mother.

255
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,800
All right. Let me take a look.

256
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
It's a great jade!

257
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,200
It's a great jade!

258
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,700
It's a great jade! It's a great jade!

259
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,200
Everyone at the imperial court like military strategies.

260
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,800
Only I... like jade the most.

261
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Concubine Chen, it is still you who knows my heart well.

262
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,000
As long as you like it, Your Highness.

263
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,800
Concubine Chen, I like it.

264
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,300
Come! Have a drink with me.

265
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Be careful, Your Highness.

266
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Let's drink together!

267
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,700
- Your Highness, you haven't finished drinking with me yet. <br> - Drink, drink, drink.

268
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,100
- Where did you go? Hurry and drink with me. <br> - Let's all drink.

269
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,400
- Let's all drink. <br> - Your Highness.

270
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,900
Quickly sit. Didn't you say you would drink until you were drunk?

271
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,700
Yes, yes! Let's drink until we're all drunk.

272
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,600
You lied to me again.

273
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,500
Come on, Your Highness. I'll pour it for you.

274
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,500
This Concubine Bai keeps making my royal father drink.

275
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,550
Jin'er, what is strange about it?

276
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,880
Have another drink.

277
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,000
There's definitely something going on.

278
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,600
How come there are two moons now?

279
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,800
My Prince, isn't that just you and me?

280
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,300
- Yes. <br> - Let's keep drinking, My Prince.

281
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,100
<i>Let's drink. Let's drink.</i>

282
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,390
Older Brother Bin, I have unfrequented you lately.

283
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,600
It's all that Old Man Rui's fault.

284
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,200
He got drunk and vomited on me, wasting all my efforts.

285
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,000
This time, I brought all my belongings out.

286
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,600
You can rest assured. I've calculated it and it's enough for us to survive a lifetime.

287
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Older Brother Bin, don't be mad.

288
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,200
I've decided to not take you for granted anymore.

289
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Who are you?

290
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,000
How dare you, thief! Where did you take Older Brother Bin?

291
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,100
If you want gold and silver then I have them.

292
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,000
I can give them to you right now! Give me back my man now!

293
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,800
Come out!

294
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,800
Older Brother Bin, are you okay?

295
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,000
Xiao Rou, you finally came.

296
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,800
Brother Bin!

297
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,890
It's you two who captured my man!

298
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,270
It's not just us two. There's also Royal Father.

299
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,880
Royal Father! Royal Father!

300
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,700
Royal Father!

301
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,300
Hurry up! Hurry up.

302
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,800
Royal Father, look. They are two adulterers!

303
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,600
Your Highness, it was this person who kidnapped me here.

304
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,900
He also forced me to take all of the valuables from the manor.

305
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,300
Your Highness, look. My neck has a mark from that sword.

306
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,700
Your Highness, you have to seek justice for me.

307
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,200
Does that mean you don't know this person?

308
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,000
Your Highness, how would I know him?

309
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,700
I don't even know why I'm here.

310
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,100
Your Highness, save me!

311
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Royal Father, take a look.

312
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,700
These jewelry items that have our manor's emblem on them, were all hidden in the silver vault of our Rui Royal Manor.

313
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,000
And you gave the silver vault's keys to Young Madam Bai.

314
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
How could everything be brought here within a day?

315
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,230
<i>[Rui]</i>

316
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,600
Tell me.

317
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,400
Are you having an affair with him?

318
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,200
Your Highness, I wouldn't dare to no matter how daring I am.

319
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,500
Your Highness!

320
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,400
Okay. This man has committed the crime of robbery.

321
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,900
- Lieutenant General! <br> - Here.

322
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,900
- Drag him out and flog him to death. <br> - Yes.

323
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,200
Your Highness, I'm innocent.

324
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,390
It was this Bai Rong, who tricked you into allowing her to enter the manor and stole the valuables of the manor.

325
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,000
It has nothing to do with me.

326
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,400
No! Your Highness.

327
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,300
Your Highness, it was him! It was he who forced me and stole my key.

328
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Your Highness, I'm innocent.

329
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,800
Your Highness, hurry and kill him. He has nothing to do with me.

330
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,500
How dare you, bitch!

331
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,200
You said that we would elope together with this old man's money and stay together forever.

332
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,200
I didn't think you would force me to my death when in difficult times!

333
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,600
- Don't slander me! <br> - Enough!

334
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,700
Your Highness! Your Highness, spare me!

335
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,000
Your Highness! Your Highness!

336
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Your Highness!

337
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,500
Son-in-Law, it's all thanks to you for what happened today.

338
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,100
Otherwise, I still wouldn't know.

339
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,000
No, no, no. This is Jin'er's work.

340
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,300
You should thank her.

341
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,000
Jin'er,

342
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,100
you're indeed my good daughter.

343
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,200
Royal Father, this Bai Rong used your kindness to do evil doings.

344
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,200
I ask that you can treat my mother better, Royal Father.

345
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,800
I definitely will.

346
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Good daughter.

347
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,590
What happened today is an embarrassing family affair.

348
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,500
You must not let this get out.

349
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,800
You cannot spread this.

350
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,100
You must not let this get out.

351
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
Yes, My Lady.

352
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Father-in-Law and Mother-in-Law,

353
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,000
Jin'er and I have disturbed you two for a long time. Sorry to trouble you.

354
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,200
Son-in-Law, why say that?

355
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,600
We're a family. You are now my dynasty's prestigious great general.

356
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,800
Having you stay in my manor is an honor.

357
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,600
Now everyone in the capital is waiting to make friends with you.

358
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,800
Of course, the general's manor is already completed now.

359
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,200
Let's leave this opportunity to become friends with you for others.

360
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,600
Jin'er, come back often when you have time.

361
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,200
Go on.

362
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,220
Go on.

363
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,930
My Lady, spring is evidently in the air today.

364
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:26,090
Are you willing to throw away etiquette and ride on the same horse as me

365
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,100
to enjoy the capital's scenery?

366
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,060
Why can't I? We should enjoy all the pleasures in life.

367
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,030
Rou Rou, you go back first.

368
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,710
Yes.

369
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,930
The miss of Rui Royal Manor is actually a guest on my horse.

370
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,140
I am deeply honored.

371
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,150
The Imperial Court's Great General of the Flying Cavalry is actually my imperial messenger on a horse.

372
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,280
Thank you.

373
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,850
Why are you flustered?

374
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,880
Did she leave?

375
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,550
Older Sister, thankfully you didn't go see her off.

376
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,060
Otherwise, you would be extremely angry.

377
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,730
Older Sister, you don't even know. That brat Jin's parade

378
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,360
was so outrageous that the public flocked to see.

379
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,640
I heard that the general's manor is decorated lavishly with gold and jade.

380
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,790
I wonder why Jin'er is so lucky.

381
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,580
She got such a great husband!

382
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:59,800
But then again, this great of a husband was originally yours!

383
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,550
Shen Jin. She and I are irreconcilable!

384
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:08,010
<i>[Yongning Manor]</i>

385
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,150
I feel the most at ease and free in my own manor.

386
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:48,170
You are free, but I am not at ease at all.

387
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,650
I have been at the border for many years; thus, I know little about the court and public affairs.

388
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,990
Coming back to the capital this time, I must quickly establish relationships in the imperial court.

389
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,300
I understand. Is there anything I can help with?

390
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,030
One should be satisfied to have a confidante in life.

391
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,250
But I, Chu Xiuming, am luckier than that.

392
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,010
This confidante is actually the wife whom I deeply love.

395
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,490
I, myself, will bear the responsibility of establishing a place for us here.

396
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,240
Husband,

397
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,650
I know. You are a good heroic man!

398
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,570
In the past, no matter how burdensome a matter is,

399
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,790
even if the skies fall down, you can bear it yourself.

400
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:48,110
But things are different now. You have me now.

401
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,280
You and I will be together for the good and the bad times.

402
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,750
I will certainly go through everything with you.

403
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,500
Jin'er... thank you.

404
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,960
Besides, it is not like you don't know that I have a few tricks.

405
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,050
If I can be your military strategist,

406
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,470
then we will definitely be invincible and dominate the capital.

407
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,690
Yes, yes, yes. You're my capable and virtuous little assistant.

408
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,730
Tell me! What are we plotting?

409
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,010
I just entered the capital.

410
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:29,310
If we want to do anything from now on, we must obtain the court officials' approval and help.

411
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,030
For things to be accomplished, we must be justified.

412
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,210
I understand.

413
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,010
I don't understand court affairs,

414
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,040
but having one more friend is better than one more enemy. Right?

415
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,570
You are right, Jin'er.

416
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,840
Then let's capture them, one by one.

417
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:51,580
You are right.

418
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,270
All the capital's officials are led by Lord Situ.

419
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:59,870
"In order to capture the thieves, first capture the ringleader. In order to shoot a bow at a person, first shoot at the horse." <br> <i>(T/N: to get things done effectively, one must find the keystone)</i>

420
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:04,300
This... Have you worked with Lord Situ before?

421
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:10,600
Situ... is arrogant and high nosed. He normally doesn't like soldiers like me.

422
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:17,340
Husband, according to my experience,

423
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,870
if you want to make friends, you must give them what they like.

424
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,910
Give them what they like?

425
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,580
Lord Situ does have a favorite hobby.

426
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,640
What hobby?

427
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,010
Jin'er, you're amazing!

428
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,700
Before I married you, I frequently played in the marketplace in the capital.

429
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,490
I'm an expert at these kinds of betting sports competition.

430
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:49,240
I never imagined Lord Situ would like playing pitch pot.

431
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,420
Husband, listen carefully!

432
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,170
Pitch pot requires—

433
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,910
Like this?

434
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,240
Husband, you're indeed amazing!

435
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,000
Your husband has been on the battlefield for a long time. How could I possibly miss a little pitch pot?

436
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,050
Then let's do another round!

437
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,640
