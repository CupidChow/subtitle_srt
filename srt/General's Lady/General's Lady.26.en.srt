19
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,510
His Majesty has decided to convict Chu Xiuming's wife.

20
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,250
The entire Rui Royal Manor has been imprisoned.

21
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,600
According to his personality, he will definitely protect her.

22
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,840
When that happens, Chu Xiuming will be guilty of

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,010
protecting a criminal.

24
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,040
How is the situation?

25
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,760
General, the entire Rui Royal Manor has been imprisoned together!

26
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,880
Prepare a horse for me immediately! I am returning to the capital!

27
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,410
Yes!

28
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,570
You brat! This is all your fault that the Rui Royal Manor is in this predicament.

29
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,140
You alone deserve to die, why did you drag the entire manor into this?

30
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,770
Stop making a fuss! Go back and rest!

31
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,110
Mother, it's all my fault. I dragged everyone into this.

32
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,830
How were you wrong?

33
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,640
You originally weren't willing to marry so far away.

34
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,390
It was they who plotted against you. What did you do wrong?

35
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,720
It's just... my Jin'er has suffered.

36
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,880
It's fine if I suffer.

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,070
I'm afraid my child will suffer.

38
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:04,100
Mother, don't worry. General will come and save us once he finds out.

39
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,720
General will certainly have a plan.

40
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,760
Miss even prepared this land deed as part of my dowry!

41
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,110
She told me to leave, the further the better!

42
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,030
I always said that I wasn't willing to die with her.

43
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,510
That wasn't the truth at all.

44
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,870
Now, I wish I'm the one in prison instead.

45
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,530
Rou Rou, don't worry. I will do whatever I can for Lord Jin.

46
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,190
General will be back soon. Lord Jin will be out in a few days, too!

47
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,200
You cannot lie to me.

48
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,210
When did I ever lie to you?

49
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,440
- General! <br> - General!

50
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,540
I already know the situation. I want to see my wife.

51
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,600
General, His Majesty has declared that no one can see them!

52
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,740
I must see my wife!

53
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:07,190
Child... I didn't give you good food recently.

54
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,890
But you must hang in there!

55
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,440
Once we're out, I will definitely give you delicious food!

56
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,500
Jin'er.

57
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,720
You've suffered.

58
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,570
Husband, why did you come so late?

59
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,450
It's all my fault. I came late.

60
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,960
I think about you every single day.

61
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,800
I am eating and sleeping well here.

62
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,110
Don't worry, Husband!

63
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,090
Don't be afraid, Jin'er. I'm here.

64
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,600
I will beg His Majesty for mercy.

65
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,080
I'm not afraid. With you here, I am not afraid of anything!

66
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,180
To be able to marry you in this lifetime

67
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,470
is the best thing I've ever done in my life.

68
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,270
You treat me well, love me, and listen to me in everything.

69
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,510
I will always remember that!

70
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,200
Don't say that, Jin'er. I will definitely beg His Majesty to spare you!

71
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,900
Give me a few more days, all right?

72
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,780
No matter how long it takes, I will wait.

73
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,280
Husband, you must remember.

74
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,210
If His Majesty won't agree, you must not offend him!

75
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,840
- You must live on well and take good care of Xiuyuan! <br> - Jin'er.

76
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,400
I swear on the seas and mountains that I will forever love

77
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,820
and accompany you in this life.

78
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,400
In this lifetime, I want only you.

79
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,280
No matter what I must do, I must save you!

80
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,920
Have you forgotten? We still have to go and live

81
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,140
on the frontier fortress with our son.

82
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,510
General, someone is coming.

83
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,350
- Husband, hurry and go! <br> - Jin'er!

84
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,920
- Hurry and go! <br> - Jin'er! <br> - Hurry and go!

85
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,700
Jin'er! Jin'er!

General!

93
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,840
I saw court officials purposely mention your matters in front of His Majesty.

94
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,630
The emperor is furious! You came back to the capital on your own this time.

95
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,650
Even if you go beg for mercy, it's useless.

96
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,370
I privately inquired about this.

97
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,120
All the ministers of the imperial court are gloating on your misfortunes.

98
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,240
General, you cannot take any major actions.

99
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,020
Jin'er has been suffering in prison for many days now. I cannot wait any longer!

100
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,480
General! You must not act recklessly!

101
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,040
If I were to act recklessly, then I would have taken Jin'er away just now!

102
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,850
- I want to see the emperor. <br> - The emperor won't see you!

103
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,150
Even though you weren't captured,

104
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,480
the emperor will definitely know it was you after he hears about it.

105
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,090
There's one person who can help me.

106
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,090
Her Ladyship is my younger sister. Naturally, I should help.

107
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,750
However, you were highly favored by His Majesty before; thus, there were many people in court who were jealous.

108
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,050
Now, many people are waiting "to throw stones at a man who has fallen into a well." <br> <i>(T/N: kick a man when he is down)</i>

109
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,280
If I step forward now,

110
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,350
I'm afraid you will attract even more trouble.

111
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,370
Isn't it better if I wait until His Majesty calms down before I ask for forgiveness on your behalf?

112
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,250
I cannot wait any longer!

113
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,900
My Lord, please help me see His Majesty. I thank you, My Lord!

114
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,620
All right, all right.

115
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,780
For my younger sister, I will do my best!

116
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,180
Thank you, My Lord!

117
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,720
You're welcome.

118
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,770
Your Majesty, please let Jin'er go.

119
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,300
How can I spare her for the crime of lying to the emperor?

120
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,020
Lord Yongning, you returned to the capital on your own accord. I'll let it go.

121
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't interfere with this matter.

122
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,180
Jin'er is my wife. How could I not interfere?

123
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,610
What do you want?

124
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,440
As long as you let Jin'er go, I am willing to take responsibility for all of her crimes!

125
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,280
You're coercing me?

126
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,340
Don't think I don't dare to punish you!

127
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,070
I do not dare.

128
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,320
If you don't dare, then why haven't you left?

129
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,440
Your Majesty, how do you intend to punish Jin'er?

130
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,540
You have no right to ask about what I will do!

131
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,480
Chu Xiuming, do not

132
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,210
ruin your family's reputation for a mere woman!

133
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,920
- General!<br>- General, did His Majesty agree to let her go?

134
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,680
Then, General, what do you intend to do?

135
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,450
There is something I need your help with.

136
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,950
Hurry and go!

137
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,070
Jin'er! Jin'er!

138
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,630
- I'm here to take you away! <br> - Husband!

139
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,610
Husband, you must not! Aiding a prison escape is punishable by death!

140
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,500
Don't talk so much! Hurry and leave with me!

141
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,150
What are you doing?

142
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,070
- Jin'er! <br> - Husband, I cannot go with you!

143
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,280
If I leave with you, not only you but the entire Rui Royal Manor will be implicated!

144
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,170
- Jin'er! <br> - Go, Jin'er, hurry and go! I'm begging you!

145
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,300
If not for your own sake, then for the sake of the child in your belly!

146
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,930
Jin'er, go! General, take Jin'er away!

147
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,210
Jin'er, let's go!

148
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,840
- I won't go! <br> - Hurry and go!

149
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,450
- Guards! Guards! Someone has come to let a criminal go! <br> - Shut up!

150
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,640
- Someone— <br> - Stop yelling!

151
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,940
General, let's go!

152
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,310
Let's go!

153
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,700
Guards! Someone has let a prisoner go!

154
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,570
Shut up!

155
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,940
No one is allowed to talk about what happened tonight.

156
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,130
If anyone dares to speak even half a word about this,

157
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,130
from now on, you will not be my daughter anymore!

158
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,600
Do you hear me? Do you understand?

159
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,880
This way!

160
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,880
Stop!

161
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,610
Hurry! Stop!

162
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,230
This way!

163
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,050
Hurry!

164
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,880
Hurry!

165
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,860
After them!

166
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,140
Let's go!

167
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,200
Older Brother. Sister-in-Law.

168
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,100
Husband, His Majesty will surely investigate and find out that you did this.

169
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,180
I should go back. I cannot drag you down anymore!

170
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,030
Jin'er, trust me. I have a plan.

171
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,020
The sun will rise in two hours. I will escort you two out of the city.

172
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,390
- Ruonan is waiting outside. <br> - Then you leave first.

173
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,410
I will go back and check on the situation.

174
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,150
Let's go.

175
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,090
<i>[Zhao Ji Textile Store]</i>

176
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,470
<i>[Yong He Fragrant Oil Store]</i>

177
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,180
Wife, hurry and hide!

178
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,390
Are you all right?

179
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,720
Leave first! I'll distract them!

180
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,700
Let's go!

181
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,450
Let's go!

182
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,080
My Lady.

183
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,320
Husband, is your injury okay?

184
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,700
It's fine.

185
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,050
Wife, what's wrong?

186
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,480
It's nothing. I'm just a little startled.

187
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,720
My stomach feels a little sick.

188
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,140
Don't be afraid. I'll take you out of the city now.

189
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,760
Stop.

190
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,010
- Go, go. <br> - Go on.

191
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,770
Stop.

192
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,620
Let them go.

193
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,570
What's wrong with your arm?

194
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,350
My Lord, I just finished moving some merchandise. Perhaps some dye has gotten on my arm.

195
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,420
There's no need to worry.

196
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,030
There's still no news of the fugitive from yesterday. How could you be so reckless in guarding the city?!

197
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,010
Lord Chu, the city gates are very tightly guarded.

198
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,200
The wanted criminal surely will not get out of the city.

199
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,320
Carefully check the citizens who are leaving the city today!

200
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,500
Yes.

201
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,730
- Continue searching! <br> - Yes.

202
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,010
Stop.

203
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,930
General!

204
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,560
- Jin'er! <br> - Jin'er.

205
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,060
- Hurry and come down. <br> - Come on.

206
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,450
Be careful.

207
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,750
Here.

208
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,280
- It's all right now. <br> - Husband.

209
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,230
You two have finally gotten out of the city safely. I almost went looking for you all.

210
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,340
Jin'er's body is weak. We need a doctor quickly. Let's set out.

211
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,010
My village is close to here. There's Uncle Hua who understands medicine.

212
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,410
How about we go directly to my village?

213
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,720
To your village?

214
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,190
To your village? We must not.

215
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,940
The village is a place you've worked hard to protect.

216
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,360
If we go there, it may be implicated.

217
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,570
- Xiuyuan, how far are we from the place you arranged for us? <br> - Four more hours.

218
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,190
I'm afraid... Sister-in-Law won't be able to make it.

219
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,750
It's already come to this. What is more important than Jin'er's body?

220
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,490
Don't waste time. Hurry and come with me.

221
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,670
Brother, Ruonan's village is remote and is very hard to find. How about we go there first?

222
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,180
That's right.

223
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,750
Ruonan, the village means a lot to you.

224
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,290
Today, in order to save me, you want to take such a huge risk.

225
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,360
My conscience feels really guilty.

226
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,460
Jin'er, why are you being so courteous with me?

227
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,860
Haven't we already become one family?

228
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,360
You don't need to be so courteous with family.

229
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,040
I will never be able to repay you for your kindness today.

230
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,680
Then I will have to trouble Miss Ruonan.

231
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,300
Let's hurry and go. Let's not waste time.

232
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,360
Let's go.

233
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,050
Careful.

234
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,800
Come here!

235
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,880
Come here! Sit here!

236
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,240
I will take Jin'er to my house now.

237
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,020
I'll go with you.

238
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,200
You two should stay back.

239
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,460
Uncle Hua has an odd temper. He is both deaf and mute.

240
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,300
He was caught in a fire before and scarred his face. So, he rarely sees strangers.

241
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,450
You don't need to worry about leaving Jin'er with me.

242
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,630
Brother, you don't know the villagers well.

243
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,200
However, don't worry, Miss Ruonan will certainly take good care of Sister-in-Law.

244
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,530
Hu Zi, go find Uncle Hua.

245
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,870
- Tell him to hurry to my home. <br> - All right!

246
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,190
You will be all right.

247
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,320
All right.

248
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,560
All right. Thank you, Uncle Hua.

249
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,700
It's all right! Uncle Hua said you were just startled.

250
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,540
You just need to take some miscarriage prevention medicine.

251
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,600
<i>Child, well done.</i>

252
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,630
<i>I will definitely protect you.</i>

253
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,230
Ruonan built this village to take in

254
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,010
the weak, disabled, homeless, and orphaned people.

255
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,300
I never imagined that Ruonan

256
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,150
to be a real righteous heroine.

257
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,950
You and I have won many battles, yet we are no match for this real hero.

258
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,570
I feel very guilty about how rude I was to Ruonan before.

259
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,530
I also want to apologize to you.

260
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,950
Older Brother, it's all already in the past. There's no need to mention it.

261
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,520
Besides, it's because of what happened before that lead to Ruonan truly accepting me.

262
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,710
Very well.

263
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,100
This time, I really thank you all for helping me save Jin'er.

264
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,330
What is there to thank for? We are a family.

265
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,190
Just let Sister-in-Law rest here.

266
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,340
The mountainous path to here is difficult to travel.

267
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,570
This village is rather remote, too.

268
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,820
With Ruonan here, I can be at ease.

269
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,800
What is the next part of the plan?

270
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,910
Those who ambushed us were not wearing official clothing,

271
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,030
but they were able to catch up to us in such a short period of time.

272
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,910
They must have been prepared.

273
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,640
It's just... all of their attacks were aimed at Jin'er.

274
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,010
I haven't figured out why they want to kill Jin'er.

275
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,790
Why is their target Sister-in-Law?

276
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,280
Perhaps someone is plotting something secretly.

277
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,240
His Majesty should know that you did this very soon. He will surely be furious.

278
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,380
Once Sister-in-Law's body improves, why don't you take her into hiding first?

279
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,410
I, Chu Xiuming, have never been a deserter.

280
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,700
Besides, even if we escape to the ends of the earth,

281
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,680
we will never be at ease if the emperor wants to capture us.

282
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,600
I once promised Jin'er that I'd give her a stable life.

283
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,290
Also, if I escape, the general's manor, the Rui Royal Manor,

284
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,530
even you... will all be implicated.

285
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,320
If you're not leaving, then could it be that you want to return to the city

286
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,190
to let His Majesty directly capture and convict you?

287
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,020
Xiuyuan, I have my own plans.

288
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,120
Just help me and protect this village well.

289
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,520
You lost them?

290
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,380
My Lord, we will set out immediately!

291
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,630
Even if we must turn the city inside out, we will find them.

292
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,760
You've already been exposed.

293
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,490
The enemy has already been alerted. You can leave.

294
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,010
- Yes. <br> - Yes.

295
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,540
It seems that the plan to kill Chu Xiuming's wife to make him rebel

296
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,170
won't be so easily accomplished.

297
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,390
Where... could they be hiding?

298
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,670
Mother!

299
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,550
Thank you.

300
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,800
You're here?

301
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,890
How is my wife?

302
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,080
Uncle Hua said Jin'er is fine.

303
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,200
She was just startled and will be fine after taking some miscarriage prevention medicine.

304
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,900
That's good.

305
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,060
Then I'll go see her.

306
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,700
Hurry and go.

307
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,050
Jin'er.

308
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,950
Is your body better now?

309
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,020
Do you know how my mother and Royal Father are doing?

310
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,870
What if His Majesty orders them all to be executed in a moment of anger?

311
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,060
Don't worry.

312
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,880
Before they find you, they won't carelessly punish those of the Rui Royal Manor.

313
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,900
Besides, Prince Rui is royalty. How could he be thoughtlessly punished?

314
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,220
How about you taking me to see the emperor? I'll personally admit my guilt!

315
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,680
I'll tell him that it was all my idea!

316
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,110
I'd rather sacrifice myself than drag down my mother, Royal Father, and you!

317
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:22,660
Jin'er, do you trust me?

318
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:31,010
Then stay here and rest. Leave everything out there to me.

319
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:41,980
This house is too boring. I'll take you outside for a walk.

320
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,170
All right.

321
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,710
Only at the border do you have such peace.

322
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,610
I haven't been back there in so long.

323
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,790
I wonder how Auntie Qing Qiu, Xiao Cong, and Bao Zitou are doing.

324
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,780
If you miss them, once your body improves, we will go back.

325
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:14,490
Husband, do you still remember the first time we met?

326
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,740
Wearing gold armor and a mask,

327
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,110
you rushed headlong into battle and defeated the enemy forces.

328
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,230
Of course, I remember.

329
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:28,500
I also remember that day I left you all alone in the wilderness.

330
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,840
I never told you this.

331
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,890
That day, you rushed to me on horseback and saved me from danger.

332
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:42,200
At that moment, you were so heroic and touched my heart.

333
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:48,130
Starting from that moment, you fell in love with me?

334
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,460
After I entered the manor, I created trouble and tried to run away.

335
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,450
I turned the manor into a mess and almost committed a grave error at the military camp.

336
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,340
Those days weren't very stable.

337
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,630
But thinking of it now, they were so beautiful.

338
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,560
That day when you disappeared from the military camp, I searched the entirety of the general's manor,

339
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,370
the entire military camp, but I couldn't find you.

340
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,010
I feared I would never see my Jin'er again.

341
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,820
That day I swore,

342
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:32,520
after I found Jin'er, I'd keep her by my side forever

343
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:38,190
to love her and to protect her until death.

344
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,570
However, that day was the happiest day of my life

345
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,600
because I finally learned how you felt, Husband.

346
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,320
I really wish we never returned here,

347
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,330
and stayed by the border forever, just us two.

348
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,390
Jin'er...

349
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,690
I know you are uneasy but believe in me.

350
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,290
I will definitely keep your entire family safe.

351
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:30,240
Since I made this promise, I will surely fulfill it.

352
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,160
Once everything has concluded,

353
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,950
let's go back to the border to live the rest of our lives with our child.

354
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,480
Let's go.

355
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,800
Wife! Let me help you.

356
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,600
This scent is very familiar.

357
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,800
I also came here to look for this last time.

358
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,500
However, the flowering season had already passed, so I did not find it.

359
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,200
My Lady, you've seen this before? What is it?

360
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,400
I don't know.

361
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,700
Husband, why are you so interested in this?

362
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,000
This plant might have something to do with the 8th Prince.

363
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,800
Go and ask Elder Sister Ruonan! She might know something.

364
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,980
Elder Sister Ruonan, do you remember the potted plant the child gave me the other day?

365
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,400
I even came here especially to look for it.

366
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,600
I remember. What of it?

367
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,000
I saw that the grass patch has traces of being restored.

368
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,800
Does someone usually take care of it?

369
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,700
All of the flora in the village is looked after by Uncle Hua.

370
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,600
How about this? Let's go and ask him about it.

371
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,600
Well? What did Uncle Hua say?

372
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,630
The thing you gave me just now was this plant. It's called the phoenix plant. <br> <i> (T/N: literal translation is "immortal bird") </i>

373
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,580
Phoenix plant?

374
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,700
I wonder if it's the same as the Falcon Tribe's sky-lantern plant?

375
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,300
Sky-lantern plant?

376
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,500
We'd heard of that before when we traveled to the Falcon Tribe as armed escorts.

377
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,200
General, why are you inquiring about this?

378
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,800
I am merely curious.

379
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,200
General, if you wish to know more then I can ask around.

380
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,600
We used to go there often as armed escorts.

381
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,800
I'll have to trouble you, then.

382
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,500
It's my pleasure.

383
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,100
Younger Sister Jin'er, you must be tired. I'll take you back so you can rest.

384
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,900
Go on.

385
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,300
Let's go.

386
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:16,000
<i>The design on the jade pendant, ancient lock, and letter are all the same.</i>

387
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,200
<i> I used these clues to find out the deal with the 8th prince. </i>

388
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,600
<i>That line of poetry inscribed inside the 9th Princess' rouge pot counts as a coincidence.</i>

389
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,000
<i>That allowed me to open the 8th Prince's seal.</i>

390
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,200
<i>Soon after, that in turn led me to the final clue - flower pollen.</i>

391
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,400
<i>The pollen belongs to the Falcon Tribe.</i>

392
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,700
<i>But if this phoenix plant produces the same flower,</i>

393
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,800
<i>then all of this is connected to an insider. </i>

394
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,200
<i>This person went through a lot of trouble to hand me these bits of information</i>

395
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,500
<i>through the Rui Royal Manor.</i>

396
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,000
<i>However, this person never took the initiative to look for me.</i>

397
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,500
<i>Why exactly is that?</i>

398
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,200
<i>The Princess Consort of Rui and the 8th Princess Consort had a very close relationship.</i>

399
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,400
<i>This insider must've known that fact, which is why they contacted the Princess Consort of Rui.</i>

400
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,100
<i>Could it be that the 8th Prince's manor still had survivors?</i>

401
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,300
<i>Where on earth is this person?</i>

402
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,600
<i>General.</i>

403
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,030
<i>What's the matter? Did something happen?</i>

404
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,300
Everything's fine.

405
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,100
Xiuyuan told an employee of the textile store to bring news. The city is safe.

406
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,800
All right. I understand.

407
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Miss Ruonan, you must've gone to a lot of trouble looking after Jin'er during this period of time.

408
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,700
Don't worry. Jin'er is my good friend.

409
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,500
I will definitely take good care of her.

410
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
Get some rest early.

411
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,120
Your Majesty, we've combed the entire capital for the whole of last night till now,

412
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,200
but still have not been able to locate Shen Jin.

413
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,400
There is only one place we have not searched yet.

414
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Where is that?

415
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,000
The general's manor. Shen Jin has been rescued by someone.

416
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,700
Although no one saw who did it,

417
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,400
General Chu is the person most concerned about this matter,

418
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,000
yet he has not made any moves the entire day.

419
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,500
You suspect he's the one who rescued her?

420
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
This subject does not dare.

421
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,900
However, in order to find this fugitive,

422
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,810
why don't we search the general's manor?

423
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,800
If even General Chu is missing,

424
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,400
then it's possible that both of them have already escaped from the capital.

425
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,400
Immediately take some men with you to search the general's manor.

426
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

429
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,000
The general has not returned for a whole night. I can't get a hold of Su Su either.

430
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,900
What on earth has happened?! This is making me so anxious!

431
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,300
Open the doors! Quickly!

432
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,100
Mi–!

433
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,500
- My Lord. <br> - Carefully search every corner of every room!

434
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,000
<i>Yes!</i>

435
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,300
My Lord, this is the general's manor! Who dares search this place?

436
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,900
This is His Majesty's verbal decree. The general's manor will be searched.

437
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,400
Tell your general to come out and receive the imperial edict!

438
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,180
The general has fallen ill and is resting inside.

439
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,300
The general's wife is missing,

440
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,500
yet the General is in the mood to rest?

441
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:05,400
It looks like I'd better personally invite General Chu out here.

442
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
You can't!

443
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,600
<i>The general has already commanded that no one is to disturb him!</i>

444
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
<i>My Lord! My Lord, you must not enter.</i>

445

<i>The general has already commanded that no one is to disturb him!</i>

446

<i>My Lord! You must not enter!</i>

447
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,400
General Chu is not here at the manor, right?

448
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,700
Naturally, that is incorrect!

449
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,000
It's just that these are the general's chambers.

450
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,100
No one can enter without the general's permission.

451

Lord Liu, how can I help you?

452
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
General Chu?

453
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,400
His Majesty's verbally ordered a search of your manor.

454
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,600
Could it be that His Majesty is afraid that I rescued my wife?

455
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,200
Or was it you who was whispering suggestions in His Majesty's ear

456
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,000
to deliberately create trouble for me?

457
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,400
General Chu,

458
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,400
is His Majesty's will something that could possibly be so easily influenced by others?!
