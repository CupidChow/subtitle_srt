00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,810
Miss Ruonan.

20
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,580
My Lord, please.

21
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,560
I must win this bid.

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,880
But just in case, I have some questions for My Lord.

23
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,100
Is the bid truly only based on quality, price, and quantity, and not because of personal relationships?

24
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,210
Miss Ruonan, do not worry. This matter will definitely be fair.

25
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,230
Then I will be at ease.

26
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,530
Here, let me offer you a drink

27
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,910
as my appreciation of you coming today.

28
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,040
Please.

30
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,810
I bought these especially for you. Please accept them.

31
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,440
There's no need. I do not accept gifts for free.

32
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,160
Besides, I don't usually like dressing up.

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,240
They all say girls like makeup and jewelry and yet you do not.

34
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,030
You really are different.

35
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,650
Miss, previously, you saved my life.

36
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,080
If you have any requests today, I will not hesitate, for any reason, to complete them.

37
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,470
There's no need to dwell on the past.

38
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,320
Since we are both members of the Jianghu, I'll accept you as my brother. <i> (T/N: Jianghu - brotherhood which follows the structure and moral code of the martial arts as a way of life)</i>

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,870
If I do not accept this present, I'm afraid it will show disrespect for My Lord.

40
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,570
So I will keep the hairpin. Please take back the rest.

41
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,210
That's good, too. Miss Ruonan, try this hairpin, see if it suits you.

42
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,540
- Right now? <br> - Yes.

43
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,230
I'll help you.

44
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,280
My Lord, is something wrong?

45
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,680
It looks very good on you.

46
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:18,420
Recently, you left this in my shop. I am returning it to you today.

47
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,370
Then... since I tried on the hairpin already, I will take my leave.

48
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,990
Miss Ruonan! I suddenly asked you many questions a few days ago.

49
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,090
I apologize.

50
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,220
There's no need to think about that. It is in the past, there's no need to bring it up again.

51
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,490
I don't have to bring this up, but my feelings for you are true.

52
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,010
I hope you'll give me a chance.

53
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,250
If My Lord is my admirer,

54
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,190
I want to ask, do you know me well?

55
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,280
Do you know what my personality is?

56
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,540
What type of love do you have?

57
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,950
Is it a short term fate

58
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,670
or do you intend to love me alone for this entire life?

59
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,500
My intentions toward you are certainly not frivolous. From my observations of you in the last few days,

60
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,910
you're not pretentious like other gals. You're loyal and straightforward.

61
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,010
Since I love you, I want to marry you.

62
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,850
I want to love and protect you for life and you alone.

63
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,150
You know me well. But I know nothing about you.

64
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,750
What is your background? What have you gone through?

65
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,310
Right now, what is your current situation?

66
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,230
If you want to know, I will tell you everything. This is the third time I've seen you.

67
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,920
I will come to visit every day to let you get to know me better.

68
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,790
Find out what kind of person I am. Then you can consider if you'll accept my love.

69
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,550
If My Lord wants me to know you better, I will accept that.

70
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,560
I just hope you will do as you say.

71
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,830
Of course!

72
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,690
Since you are done talking, I will take my leave.

73
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,400
I'll see you off!

74
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,470
I can go back myself. See you tomorrow.

75
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,560
Your Majesty. Recently, I've been investigating who embezzled military funds.

76
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,550
I've discovered some clues.

77
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,040
What clues?

78
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,400
It seems like someone wants to frame General Chu.

79
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,790
I'm afraid there is a rebel in the court.

80
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,590
But the set-up situation is too obvious.

81
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:49,140
Or perhaps they are trying to cover their own trail.

82
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,900
General Chu is a valued general.

83
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,730
If someone wants to get rid of him, they need military power.

84
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,530
If General Chu did this on purpose, then my heart aches.

85
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,490
Go and investigate it secretly.

86
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

87
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,190
Brother Xiao Su, I know it is inconvenient for you to act now.

88
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,290
But you know many people in the court.

89
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,420
Could you investigate something for me?

90
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,420
Go ahead.

91
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,270
The day the 8th Prince Manor caught on fire,

92
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,650
was it an accident or was it intentional?

93
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,360
I've heard someone mention this before.

94
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,420
That fire was indeed very suspicious.

95
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,350
However, why are you suddenly investigating this?

96
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,660
Do you suspect someone?

97
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,830
Go and investigate for me first.

98
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,790
All right. But this happened a long time ago, I'll need some time.

99
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,770
General, please wait then.

100
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,340
I appreciate you doing this.

101
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,930
Farewell.

102
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,660
Customer! Customer, our shop just opened!

103
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,750
All of our prices are 20% lower than the original price!

104
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,280
If there's one you like, I'll have someone deliver it to your manor!

105
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,360
- All right. <br> - I guarantee you'll be satisfied!

106
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,170
Take a look! Pick what you want!

107
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,590
This is all good merchandise!

108
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,320
Miss, ever since we lowered our prices by 20%,

109
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,920
customers keep coming in, we are doing great business!

110
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,620
Of course! Our fabrics were pretty good, to begin with.

111
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,780
But we can't do this forever.

112
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,610
I have to find a way to win the palace bid.

113
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,710
Xiuyuan went over there again?

114
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,720
Did Ruonan use some kind of trick?

115
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,340
Rou Rou, I'm going out! Watch the shop!

116
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,970
All right!

117
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,780
Ruonan.

118
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,790
My Lord, didn't I tell you there's no need to come again?

119
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,390
You misunderstood. I came to tell you about the palace bid.

120
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,750
Your shop is a finalist. Go and prepare some fabric samples.

121
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,230
That's wonderful! I'll go prepare a sample right now.

122
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,940
You can take it back with you today.

123
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,910
All right. I'll go tell the other shops, I'll be back later then.

124
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,170
My Lord,

125
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,920
why are you always coming over here?

126
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,630
You never visit my shop this often.

127
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,570
You misunderstand, My Lady. I came to tell her about the palace bid.

128
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,890
The palace bid?

129
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,740
That's right. I was just about to come and tell you, too. Your shop is also a finalist.

130
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,070
You can go prepare some samples.

131
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:02,950
So... Ruonan's shop is also preparing samples?

132
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,360
Of course. Lord Jin, we have to fight fairly.

133
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,680
Since you say we have to compete fairly, I'll be frank.

134
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,630
Your shop's prices are 20% lower than others.

135
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,580
Taking into account the amount spent on opening your store, the store rental, and the salaries paid to your employees,

136
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,860
how are you earning a profit?

137
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,380
Do not worry, I have my ways.

138
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,070
I am not worried about your profit.

139
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,940
If you keep lowering your prices, how are other shops supposed to get business?

140
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,250
My store relies on earning small profits but having a quick turnover rate, too.

141
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,040
Therefore, the price is very suitable. Besides, it was a small business to start with.

142
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,820
I can only care about my own shop. I cannot worry about other fabric shops.

143
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,870
- Ladies! Ladies! <br> - Shut up!

144
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,030
Wu Ruonan, let me tell you! You're using low prices to get all the customers, that's a cruel trick!

145
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,770
Lord Jin, I never thought of doing that.

146
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,600
On the contrary, you, a general's lady, insist on competing with us commoners for business.

147
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,580
Are you still thinking about how we fought over territory when we were young?

148
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,840
I, Shen Jin, never dwell on the past!

149
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,040
We were only rivals when we were young and inexperienced.

150
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,190
- So, why must you continue fighting with me now? <br> - Lord Jin!

151
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,390
There's no need to talk anymore. I know what price I'm settled on.

152
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,820
You can just go do your own business.

153
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,870
Fine. Since you put it like that, let's just have a price war.

154
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,620
My Lord, if I can win the bid for the procurement of fabric samples,

155
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,270
I can lower my price by 30%.

156
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,330
- I can do 40%. <br> - I can do 50%!

157
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,880
I can do 60%, to get that business!

158
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,950
No matter how much money you put out there, this business bid is mine!

159
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,590
Shen Jin, I will let you know this, too. That bid is mine!

160
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,260
- My Lord! <br> - My Lord!

161
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,700
My Lady. Miss Ruonan. You should think the price over more.

162
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,710
After all, you can't do business for no profit, right?

163
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,850
Rou— My Lady!

164
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,350
Who has provoked my Jin'er?

165
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,610
Tell me and I will avenge you.

166
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,460
Today, Xiuyuan came to Ruonan and me to tell us about

167
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,630
preparing samples for the Imperial Palace's bid.

168
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,970
So I asked Ruonan,

169
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,600
how does she earn any profit when her prices are 20% lower than the prices of the other fabric stores?

170
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,460
I never thought she would disregard the other stores

171
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,420
and insist on selling her fabric at this low price long term.

172
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,970
Also, about the bid for the Imperial Palace, she doesn't care how low she has to drop her prices,

173
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,070
she intends to compete with me!

174
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,630
So that means... she has vowed to win the bidding?

175
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,480
Don't you think she's doing this on purpose? Huh?

176
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,570
She made me so furious today!

177
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,610
All right. Don't be angry, Jin'er.

178
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,580
The marketplace is similar to a battlefield.

179
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,620
How could she allow you to profit just because you're her friend?

180
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,470
I'm still angry.

181
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,310
I don't care how much I have to lower my prices. I must compete with her right to the end!

182
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,330
Jin'er, the moon looks beautiful tonight.

183
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,540
Why don't you take a stroll with me? Perhaps your mood will be lifted after walking round after round.

184
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,120
I was a little excessive with my fury earlier.

185
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,670
But... I'm not an unreasonable person.

186
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,910
It's just that this matter really vexed me today.

187
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,530
All right, all right. Jin'er, look.

188
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,050
The crescent moon looks exceptionally bright tonight.

189
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:28,150
The crescent moon reminds me of our days on the border.

190
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,620
Husband, do you ever miss those days?

191
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,520
I do miss those days since we lived there for quite some time.

192
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,050
However, it feels the same no matter where I go since I have Jin'er by my side.

193
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:48,400
I feel the same way. There's no need to be afraid of anything no matter where we go since I have you by my side.

194
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,290
Let's go.

195
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,580
Xiuyuan, I've been busy lately. We haven't talked in a long time.

196
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,730
Elder Brother, you've been busy with your own affairs. Don't worry about me. I'll look after myself.

197
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,120
Are you satisfied with your job as City Supervisor?

198
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,840
Actually, nothing significant has happened yet. But Sister-in-Law met with a thorny situation recently.

199
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,590
She mentioned the incident regarding the Ruonan Fabric Store to me last night.

200
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,940
What are you going to do about this competition between the two rival stores?

201
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:43,830
I plan to give half of the palace purchasing orders to Sister-in-Law's store, and the other half to Ruonan Fabric Store

202
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,130
So does that mean both stores are equally competitive?

203
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,700
Not really. It's just that... On one side, it's my sister-in-law's store;

204
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,260
and on the other, it's Miss Ruonan's store.

205
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,190
You seem to really care about Miss Ruonan.

206
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,280
What sort of intimate relationship do you have with her?

207
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,880
Elder Brother, do you remember the incident where I fell over a cliff as a child?

208
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,540
A child then came along and rescued me with a horsewhip.

209
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,900
Of course, I remember. I searched for you for ages that day.

210
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,310
That child was Miss Ruonan.

211
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:17,000
We've been separated for so many years. I never thought I would meet her again in this place.

212
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,980
So she was the woman you mentioned to Jin'er whom you've been acquainted with for a long time?

213
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,800
That's right. When she rescued me, their armed escort agency was passing by.

214
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,100
If she had not rescued me that day, I would not be sitting in front of you right now.

215
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,780
So, will you give her special favor in the palace bids?

216
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,330
I will do my job regarding the palace bids.

217
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,370
The prices at the Ruonan Fabric Store are the lowest in the city.

218
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,840
The quality of her fabrics is also quite similar to Sister-in-Law's store. Her store truly is the best choice.

219
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,610
- But... <br> - But what?

220
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,750
Elder Brother... I wish to marry her.

221
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,010
Does she know?

222
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,560
She hasn't agreed yet.

223
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,530
Miss Ruonan and I haven't known each other for very long,

224
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,470
so she wants to get to know me better.

225
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,830
Therefore, I would like her to understand me and accept the admiration I have for her by meeting with her every day.

226
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,330
Xiuyuan, have you made known your true identity to her yet?

227
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,000
This matter involves a wide array of other topics. I haven't told her yet.

228
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,630
If I'm going to marry her and make her my wife, I'm going to have to tell her the truth.

229
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,510
- I will tell her everything. <br> - You cannot do that!

230
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,780
I know how you feel about this lady.

231
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,150
But since she has already made herself clear, then don't insist on it any longer.

232
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,060
She may not have agreed yet, but I still have to do my best so she can accept and understand me!

233
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,710
Xiuyuan, you have your own calling.

234
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,540
This is not the time for you to throw it all away on love!

235
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,370
She was the one who rescued me first! I've been carrying this sentiment of gratefulness toward her all along.

236
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,300
Now that I have met her once more, I must cherish this moment and not miss this opportunity with her again!

237
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,840
I want to protect her just like how you protect Sister-in-Law.

238
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,110
I must protect Ruonan well.

239
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,460
I've made up my mind on this matter. Elder Brother, you can stop trying to persuade me further.

240
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,180
She's only a common outsider who roams the street; she's a child of Jianghu.

241
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,080
Her status is so far removed from yours, why do you feel so strongly attached to her!

242
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,900
Elder Brother! How can you utter such a thing!

243
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,470
I will make my own decision regarding this matter.

244
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,240
Xiuyuan!

245
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,010
Has Ruonan made any moves these past few days?

246
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,110
She has neither stepped out of the main entrance nor the side gate.

247
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,090
She's been as quiet as a mouse.

248
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,620
If the enemy will not move, then I will not move either.

249
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,970
Rou Rou, I need you to keep a close eye on her for the next few days.

250
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,440
If a situation should arise, then you must report back to me immediately.

251
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,940
Yes!

252
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,280
Don't worry, Miss.

253
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,080
You may leave everything to me.

254
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,160
I promise to keep a close eye on things. I won't make any careless mistakes.

255
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,380
Sir, what sort of fabric are you interested in?

256
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,420
Is the owner of the store around?

257
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,920
I am the owner of this fabric store.

258
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,050
There is a matter I would like to discuss with you.

259
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,130
But I'm afraid this place won't be convenient enough for us. I would like to invite you to tea, is that all right?

260
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,100
Of course. There is a tavern close by.

261
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,090
Please wait a moment, My Lord.

262
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,480
General!

263
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,860
<i>What?</i>

264
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,910
Has my husband arrived?

265
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,990
The general just left with Elder Sister Ruonan.

266
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,710
That Wu Ruonan! Not only is she secretly in contact with Xiuyuan,

267
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,110
but now she has even dared to touch my general!

268
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,670
Rou Rou, I'm going out for a while!

269
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,750
Miss, please don't do anything rash! You have to remain calm!

270
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,830
What am I going to do now?

271
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,480
How should I address you, sir?

272
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,590
I am Chu Xiuming.

273
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,780
You're Great General Chu?

274
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,830
You are also Shen Jin's husband?

275
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,420
That is correct.

276
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,380
Why have you come to see me, General?

277
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,570
Could it be because of the Imperial Palace's sample purchases?

278
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,810
I have come here today because of Xiuyuan.

279
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,180
Xiuyuan is my deputy general. He has been with me for many years.

280
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,010
I treat him as I would my younger brother.

281
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,860
Miss, I hear he's been disturbing you these past few days.

282
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,940
I've come to apologize on his behalf.

283
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,390
General, you are too polite.

284
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,680
However, I have already made myself clear to him.

285
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,690
Why have you come to involve yourself in our affairs, General?

286
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,980
Xiuyuan grew up in the army. He is a simple man.

287
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,180
I'm afraid that his behavior might've been somewhat inappropriate,

288
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,980
and that is why I've come here specifically to talk to you, Miss.

289
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,310
I wonder... What are your intentions toward Xiuyuan, Miss?

290
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,210
He and I have not known each other long.

291
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:24,800
Also, I've told him that I'm not interested in being immersed in love.

292
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,640
Miss, since you've expressed your disinterest in Xiuyuan,

293
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,500
please distance yourself from him, so he can have no more illusions about you.

294
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,550
I have made my own arrangements for him.

295
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,520
What you're referring to really has nothing to do with me.

296
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,090
But it's his business whether he comes by to visit me or not.

297
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,010
Miss Ruonan,

298
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,380
I did not come here to discuss this matter with you.

299
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,770
I came here to request that you distance yourself from him,

300
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,450
so that he won't waste any more of his time on you.

301
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,800
If the time he spends on me is a waste,

302
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,660
then why are you coming to talk with me on his behalf?

303
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,480
Is this his will or your intentions?

304
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,930
These are my intentions.

305
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,740
Miss, I would like you to please stay away from Xiuyuan.

306
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,730
My Lord, I believe you have already said all that you came here to say.

307
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,490
I still have to conduct business at the fabric store. I will take my leave first.

308
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,210
How strange, I just saw them a moment ago.

309
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,270
Why did they disappear all of a sudden?

310
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,500
<i>Take a look!</i>

311
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,820
What's wrong?

312
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,480
Husband, why are you here?

313
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,630
I was doing something nearby.

314
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,980
Then since you were nearby, why didn't you come and see me?

315
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,580
Didn't you say it yourself?

316
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,630
Don't visit the shop so much or else people will start talking.

317
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,130
I did say that.

318
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,360
Then please get back to work. I have to return to my fabric shop, too.

319
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,080
All right. You have worked hard, My Lady.

320

<i>[Fireworks]</i>

321
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,230
Since you won't tell me the truth,

322
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,140
then I'll go find someone who will!

323
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,830
You were looking for me?

324
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,610
Did you see my husband today?

325
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,260
Shen Jin, keep an eye on your husband. Don't let him butt into other people's business.

326
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,490
What do you mean?

327
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,190
Please go tell him.

328
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,090
Whether I like someone is my own business.

329
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,140
Many years have passed since childhood.

330
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,950
I do not believe a person's feelings can linger for that long.

331
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,210
His request is absolutely ridiculous!

332
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,970
Do not use this matter to bother me anymore.

333
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,010
What does she mean?

334
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,950
This... Am I going to lose not only my business,

335
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,370
but my husband, too?

336
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,230
<i>[Yongning Manor]</i>

337
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,500
Jin'er.

338
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,160
Why did you come so early today?

339
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,500
General.

340
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,650
Today, did you really go to do something, or did you go see someone?

341
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,900
Today, I did go see someone.

342
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,390
I went to discuss something with Miss Ruonan.

343
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,470
Thenm did you go ask her for new clothes

344
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,900
or did you go catch up with her?

345
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,450
You misunderstand, I—

346
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,570
Don't tell me you went to spy on her business!

347
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,090
I do not believe it.

348
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,960
You had nothing to do with it.

349
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,850
Ruonan wants me to tell you,

350
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,110
whether she likes someone or not is her own business.

351
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,940
A long time has passed since childhood.

352
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,130
She doesn't believe a person's feelings can linger for that long.

353
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,490
Your request is absolutely ridiculous!

354
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,540
She wants you to stop bothering her!

355
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,820
Is this what you're talking about?

356
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,560
I already made things clear with Miss Ruonan!

357
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,720
But she just won't accept it!

358
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,900
General, in the future, the shop has nothing to do with you.

359
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,280
Whether you're willing to see Ruonan also has nothing to do with me.

360
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,930
Jin'er, I really still have to go talk with her.

361
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,940
Fine. You can go if you want.

362
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,270
There are still things to do at the shop. Don't wait for me to return tonight.

363
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,000
They must be childhood lovers!

364
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,090
They're not even trying to hide it in front of me!

365
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,970
It just has to be Wu Ruonan!

366
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,520
She's not only competing with me in business,

367
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,490
but she wants to take my husband, too!

368
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,390
That's not right.

369
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,410
Ruonan and I have played on the streets together since childhood.

370
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,990
How did she meet my husband?

371
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,260
Rou Rou, it's your turn.

372
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,650
They already met up.

373
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,790
They must have known each other since childhood!

374
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,780
Hey, Rou Rou, wake up! Let's do another round!

375
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,690
You still want to play?

376
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,000
Miss, when are we going home?

377
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,210
Forget this, you've been working all day.

378
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,200
Then let's go home.

379
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,740
Then I'll go prepare right now!

380
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,900
Miss Ruonan!

381
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,870
What's the matter?

382
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,570
The samples have been submitted, you just need to wait for news.

383
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,120
Understood.

384
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,760
I asked someone to bring me this bracelet from the Western region.

385
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,650
I wonder if you like it?

386
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,940
There's no need to give me these things in the future. I don't like wearing them.

387
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,850
Also, the clothes you gave me are uncomfortable. I will return them to you on another day.

388
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,880
If you don't like them!

389
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,360
Then I will have people make new ones.

390
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,630
You can just leave those clothes in your closet.

391
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,660
My Lord, I accept your good intentions.

392
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,900
But you do not need to come again. I also do not want to see you.

393
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,960
You said you'd give me a chance! Why are you suddenly being like this?

394
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,920
I was willing to give you a chance before.

395
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,870
But I'm not willing anymore. Please leave.

396
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,050
I will not leave if you do not tell me why!

397
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,790
Miss, I am willing to make you a promise and pledge my undying love for you.

398
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,180
I will love you alone.

399
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,200
Why aren't you speaking?

400
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,540
You and I are not from the same world.

401
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,490
You are a court official.

402
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,150
I am just a simple commoner.

403
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:32,450
From status to lifestyle, there is a large difference between us.

404
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,490
If you do not like my status, I can give it up for you.

405
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,110
I can come and work for your shop.

406
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,740
I am not a person who runs after riches and status.

407
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,570
If I can be with the person I love, I am willing to live a simple life.

408
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,530
You really think that way?

409
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,630
If you change your mind one day and decide you don't like this lifestyle,

410
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,430
then I will become an abandoned wife!

411
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,580
I never change my mind once I've decided on something!

412
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
This is just one reason.

413
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,340
Second, you appear in front of me every day. I find it very bothersome.

414
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,390
I have never had feelings for you.

415
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,470
That was the case in the past

416
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,110
and that will be the case in the future.

417
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,830
Miss! You must not know me well enough yet!

418
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,650
- I can-- <br> - If you keep bothering me, I will stop being polite!

419
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,610
My Lord, please disappear from within my presence from now on.

420
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,620
The farther the better.

421
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,500
I do not want to see you again.

422
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,180
Miss Ruonan...

423
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,960
I have bothered you today.

424
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,890

Then I will go notify the other shops.

Xiuyuan, wait!

00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,630
Um... I have something to ask you.

446
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,370
Go ahead, Sister-in-Law.

447
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:21,060
To a man, is it hard to forget a childhood love?

448
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:28,450
For me... I will remember it for my entire life.

449
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,900
I will love only her alone.

450
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,050
Then do you know if your big brother had a childhood love?

451
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,440
I've never seen one, he probably did not.

452
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,230
Your ages are very different!

453
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,220
If your big brother had one, you probably wouldn't know.

454
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,900
Sister-in-Law, why are you asking about this?

455
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,690
Come here. Let me tell you.

456
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,810
It's all right to tell you.

457
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:18,020
Your elder brother went to see Ruonan from across the street.

458
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,030
He went to look for Miss Ruonan?

459
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,850
For what?

460
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,400
I'm not sure of the details.

461
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,900
But after they met, Ruonan told me to tell your brother

462
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,890
that many years have passed since childhood.

463
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,170
She doesn't believe that a person's feelings can linger for that long.

464
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,650
She also wanted me to tell him not to bother her anymore.

465
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,750
Ruonan must be his childhood love!

466
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,260
Or else, why would she say that?

467
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:56,640
After I told your brother, he said he still had to go talk with her!

468
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,750
Sister-in-Law, I think you really misunderstood him.

469
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,560
What do you mean?

470
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,570
Ruonan's matter has to do with me.

471
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,570
So you mean... you are the one pursuing Ruonan?

472
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,570
Then since Ruonan just told you to stop bothering her,

473
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,990
it might be the result of your brother's conversation with her!

474
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,300
I do not know either. I went to talk with Big Brother recently.

475
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,410
Big Brother told me to stop seeing her.

476
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,530
How come?

477
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,310
Does he want to split you two apart?

478
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,960
I do not know either.

479
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,100
Sister-in-Law, Ruonan is stubbornly refusing to see me.

480
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,970
If I want to see her, what should I do?

481
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,610
I misunderstood your brother.

482
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,790
But I will not approve of him interfering with lovers!

483
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:57,480
Xiuyuan, don't worry! I'm here!

484
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,300
I will help you fix this matter!

485
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:06,390
Sister-in-Law, aren't you and Ruonan competitors?

486
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,270
Why are you willing to help me?

487
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:13,790
You are my brother-in-law! How could I get in the way of your marriage?

488
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,420
Ruonan is my old friend, too!

489
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,040
If she marries you and these two shops become one,

490
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,490
then we won't have to worry about business in the future!

491
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:30,140
Sister-in-Law, what a great idea! Please have a cup of tea!

492
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,420
Sister-in-Law!

493
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,780
Jin'er.

494
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,250
Husband, you're back? Sit.

495
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,480
Wife, are you still angry about yesterday?

496
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,420
I wanted to come and apologize to you this morning.

497
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,750
Who knew you would go to the shop so early?

498
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,880
So I bought this for you.

499
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,550
Come, I'll put it on you.

500
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,230
It looks like... I committed a grave crime.

501
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,770
It made my Jin'er so angry.

502
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,830
All right. I will allow you to punish me however you want.

503
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,370
You will agree to whatever request I have?

504
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:59,270
Of course! I will agree to any request from you!

505
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,510
I want Xiuyuan to marry Ruonan!

506
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,310
I cannot do that.

507
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,090
Why not?

508
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,280
I have arrangements for Xiuyuan.

509
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,720
What arrangements?

510
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,750
Xiuyuan has been thinking about Ruonan for years!

511
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,220
Marriage between them is their private matter!

512
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,020
It's too cruel of you to step up and split them apart!

513
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:36,700
I already told you Xiuyuan's real identity! Did you forget?

514
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:42,130
What does Xiuyuan's real identity have to do with marrying a wife?

515
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,480
Do you want him to be alone until death?

516
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,890
Jin'er, Xiuyuan's identity is unique.

517
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,650
Now is not the time to let him waste time on puppy love.

518
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,960
Puppy love?

519
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,140
Then, what do we count as?

520
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:06,600
You are the greatest general, but you are wasting time on me.

521
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:12,150
Chu Xiuming, do you remember you once told me that I am your weakness?

522
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:16,490
Then now, you can just throw me away as you'd like?

523
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,830
Those are two different matters. I'm different from Xiuyuan.

524
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,170
Of course, you and Xiuyuan are different!

525
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,600
You went and interfered with Xiuyuan's matters.

526
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,880
You made Ruonan say cruel words to Xiuyuan and push him away!

527
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,650
You really didn't see the pained look on Xiuyuan's face today.

528
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:39,170
If you really are thinking on his behalf, why must you split them up?

529
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,400
I have already made a decision on this. You do not need to worry about it.

530
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,940
I have also made a decision on this matter! Husband, you do not need to interfere!
