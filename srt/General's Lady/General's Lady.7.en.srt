00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,700
Within this military camp, whose position is the highest?

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Bao Zitou, you answer.

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,400
It's...

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,600
Ah, it's the general!

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,200
What did I tell you back then?

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,200
Back then...

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,800
Lord Military Inspector, your position is the highest here.

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,200
There's no need to make things hard on my subordinates.

27
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,620
Who are you?

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,600
I am Lord Yongning, Chu Xiuming.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,150
Oh, so you are Chu Xiuming?

30
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,790
My official position as the Military Inspector

31
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,220
should be a grade higher than yours, right?

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,900
Precisely.

33
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,000
Since my position is higher than yours,

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,800
why do you disrespect us?

35
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,200
I am not sure what you are referring to.

36
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
I am confused.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
My Lord, if I treated you badly just now, please be forgiving.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,800
I came here by an imperial court order.

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,400
It was such a long and rough journey.

40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,100
Why haven't I even been given a cup of tea?

41
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,000
This is a military camp. We don't have as many supplies as other places.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Our soldiers fight to protect the country.

43
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,300
We dare not lust after small pleasures.

44
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,600
The soldiers usually live on plain water and simple congee.

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,800
What do you mean?

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,700
Plain water and simple congee?

47
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,500
Then, what have your military funds been used on?

48
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,700
The Imperial Court has not given us funds in two years.

49
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,000
In order to shoulder the concern of the Imperial Court,

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,800
after our soldiers finish training every day, they work on farmlands.

51
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,300
We make all our own daily necessities.

52
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,800
This is too much!

53
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
Don't discuss political matters.

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,000
All right!

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,600
I understand your suffering.

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,900
To appreciate the soldier's hard work, I'll treat everyone to a banquet today.

57
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,300
You cannot.

58
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,500
The soldiers are used to eating like this.

59
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,800
If they suddenly gorge themselves on rich food, I'm afraid they will get sick.

60
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
Then they can at least drink alcohol, right?

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,800
I want to drink with all the soldiers, can't I?

62
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't worry.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,800
I will pay for everything today.

64
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,400
It will have nothing to do with you.

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Alcohol is forbidden in a military camp.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can't do this and I can't do that!

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,100
Is this how you treat the Military Inspector?  You're totally disregarding me!

68
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,000
I do not dare.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There's nothing you don't dare to do!

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,800
You're working against me on purpose!

71
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,900
I will fire you today, do you believe me?

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Do you believe me?

73
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,700
You don't believe it! I'll rip off your armor right now!

74
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,600
- My Lady! 
 - Miss!

75
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,690
- My Lady, calm down! 
 - Let me go!

76
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,600
Let me go!

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,700
- My Lady! 
 - Let me go!

78
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,470
- My Lady! 
 <i> - Don't touch me!</i>

79
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,700
<i>- My Lady! 
 - Miss!</i>

80
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,600
<i>-My Lady! 
 - Miss! 
 - Let me go!</i>

81
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,400
That Chu Xiuming! He really lives up to his title of a general.

82
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,700
It's fine if he disrespected me in the past,

83
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,500
but I'm the Military Inspector now and he still ignores me!

84
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,800
No, I cannot accept this!

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,400
The trouble he's created for me now, I'll have him repay it ten times over!

86
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,400
I will have him understand what "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned" means!

87
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,400
And she is petty as expected.

88
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,600
Cut the crap!  Hurry and think of a plan!

89
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,200
I must beat that Chu Xiuming!

90
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,200
It looks like you have a held grudge against Chu Xiuming for a while.

91
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Grudge? It's vengeance!

92
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,100
Let me tell you. Do you know what "Two hearts are not one" means?

93
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,590
What "It's hard to come to an agreement, return to our original paths" means?

94
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,000
<i>(T/N: These are quoting the "Divorce Letter" Chu Xiumin wrote her)</i>

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,200
What do they mean?

96
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,600
Then do you know "Go our separate ways, both will find happiness"?

97
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,200
He will be happy, but I won't be happy!

98
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,000
These... should be words used in divorce letters.

99
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,900
It's enough if you know about it. Don't talk about it.

100
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,400
Yes, yes, yes, Lord Military Inspector.

101
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,200
Why are you calling me by that title, too?

102
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,000
Xiao Su, when did you become so polite with me?

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,400
But... I really never imagined it.

104
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,500
The little brat from the past is an official now!

105
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,900
It was just a coincidence.

106
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,600
However, when I'm with you, Lord Jin, I will always be that little brother who scaled the walls and ripped off tiles with you.

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,800
Xiao Su! You're awesome!

108
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
You're awesome!

109
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,000
I never imagined it. You gave me a big gift as soon as we met up!

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,700
I have a higher official position than Chu Xiuming!

111
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,800
It's not a big deal.

112
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,700
How is it not a big deal? I'm higher than him!

113
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,400
Why did the emperor suddenly order the second miss of Rui Royal Manor to be a Military Inspector?

114
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,200
I heard she was divorced by Chu Xiuming

115
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,800
and fled from the manor in shame.

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,200
If the emperor did this,

117
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,000
he must suspect Chu Xiuming.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,200
We must make good use of this chance.

119
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,700
The matter regarding the military pay, how has that been handled?

120
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,200
Chu Xiuming is just a soldier. He hasn't received military funds for two years.

121
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,700
He's brought the soldiers to cultivate land

122
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,300
without a single complaint.

123
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,400
How about we use this chance to push the blame onto Chu Xiuming?

124
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Your words make sense, General Zuo!

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,800
When that happens, the emperor will summon Chu Xiuming back to the capital for interrogation.

126
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,600
After Chu Xiuming leaves his own territory,

127
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,000
he will be like fish meat and we will be knives.

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,300
At that time, attacking the imperial city...

129
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,700
will be an easy task!

130
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,700
Good!

131
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,200
Lord Liu's strategy is brilliant!

132
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,800
We will be eagerly expecting the future revolution!

133
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,200
What's the logic behind letting Her Ladyship come to the frontlines as a Military Inspector?

134
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,000
There must be something going on behind this.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,900
No matter what, it's good if Lady is back.

136
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,100
Who knows what trouble she'll create coming back this time.

137
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,800
Be careful, everyone.

138
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,200
It seems like Lady has come for you, General.

139
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,000
So what if she has?

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,500
Please be careful and don't anger Our Lady.

141
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,800
Or else, we'll be affected, too.

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,400
Did she bribe you two? You keep speaking up on her behalf!

143
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
- I do not dare! 
 - I do not dare!

144
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,300
From now on, there is only the Military Inspector.

145
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,400
There is no more lady.

146
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,100
Military Inspector! The general requests an audience.

147
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,800
I refuse!

148
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,400
Rou Rou, you can take your leave. I want to speak to your mistress alone.

149
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,200
Yes.

150
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
What's wrong with you?

151
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,100
You didn't hear what I said?

152
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Since you left, why did you return?

153
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,200
I am a divorced wife. Where can I go?

154
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,000
Chu Xiuming, I'd like to ask you.

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,200
Were you afraid I'd return or hoped I'd return?

156
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,800
Even if you were returning, you shouldn't have returned with this identity.

157
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Then, what identity should I use?

158
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
The general's wife?

159
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,500
Or Second Miss of the Rui Royal Manor?

160
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,000
I think being a military inspector is better.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,400
Must you be like this?

162
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,600
Starting from today, I will officially assume my position.

163
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,500
I will supervise everything in your military camp and your manor.

164
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,900
Aren't you reaching a bit too far?

165
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,000
How can I bother you with my manor?

166
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
It's not a bother.

167
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,000
I, the Military Inspector, am exactly someone who is this hardworking and loves being bothered about trivial matters.

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,300
The general just needs to remember my military service.

169
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,200
However, I've heard that a military command is unchangeable like a mountain.

170
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,400
I don't know if the words of an official as high as me are effective.

171
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Can I order around the people in the camp?

172
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,200
Since you were sent by imperial decree,

173
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,300
everyone in the camp will listen to your orders.

174
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,900
- Really? 
 - Really.

175
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,390
Yesterday, I heard you say there was no tea in this military camp.

176
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,550
I prepared some high-quality tea for myself.

177
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,910
General, are you interested in having a taste?

178
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,320
Military Inspector, have some tea.

179
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,980
Military Inspector, please have some tea.

180
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,750
Good, good.

181
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,990
Since you are so courteous,

182
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,210
then I will enjoy it.

183
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,140
Chu Xiuming! Do you want to burn me to death? You did that on purpose!

184
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,620
I wouldn't dare.

185
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,410
This was your tea.

186
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,970
I'm only presenting Buddha with flowers offered by someone else.

187
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,610
You—

188
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,930
Gather all the soldiers!

189
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,390
I came here to supervise by imperial order.

190
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,530
Some people may not like it.

191
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,110
They think since I'm a woman,

192
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,240
I cannot bear serious responsibilities.

193
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,030
Today, I will compete with General Chu!

194
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,760
All soldiers will bear witness!

195
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,990
If Lord Military Inspector competes with me,

196
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,730
I'm afraid it won't be fair.

197
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,530
What wouldn't it be fair?

198
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,080
Don't worry, General.

199
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,030
You and I can shed off our status during the competition.

200
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,080
We will compete as equals!

201
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,450
Men and women are different.

202
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,540
They differ greatly.

203
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,100
You underestimate me, General!

204
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,310
Even though I am a woman, I do not burden others with my responsibilities.

205
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,060
Women can do just as well as men. General, just do your best.

206
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,310
There's no need to go easy on me!

207
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,970
Very well.

208
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,680
Inspector, please pick your weapon first.

209
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,480
Don't need weapons.

210
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,040
Then you can make the first move.

211
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,440
I didn't say we were having a physical fight either.

212
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,970
Then, Lord Military Inspector, what do you want to compete with?

213
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,100
What does Her Ladyship want to compete with?

214
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,340
This competition tests the soldiers' ability to escape after being captured.

215
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,770
After the competition begins, we will each hold a feather in our mouths and go underwater.

216
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,470
Besides holding our breaths, we must undo the locks in time.

217
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,320
The person who surfaces first will win.

218
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,430
If anyone forfeits or encounters danger, they can spit out the feather.

219
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,140
If either of you sees a feather float up to the surface,

220
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,100
pull the chain and save the person below.

221
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,620
It's that simple.

222
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,850
General, do you have any objections?

223
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,650
It's fine as long as the inspector is happy.

224
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,260
General, in order to be fair,

225
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,920
you cannot use internal kungfu. 
 <i>(T/N: Type of kungfu that harness one's internal energy)</i>

226
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,580
Otherwise, it's an unfair advantage.

227
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,920
This...! This isn't very proper!

228
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,730
How could the general...

229
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,200
Cut the crap! Watch the surface!

Chu Xiuming! Did you go crazy or are you an idiot?

259
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,280
Just treat me as going crazy or being an idiot.

260
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,930
You could have forfeited, why did you have to do that?

261
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,960
You were certain I would save you?

262
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,680
You were certain I wouldn't abandon you?  Is that right?

263
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,080
- Yes. 
 - You-!

264
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,410
Chu Xiuming, let me ask you this.

265
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,650
If I was the one in danger today, what would you have done?

266
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,980
I would have done the same as you and try my hardest to save you.

267
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,880
Then, why did you have to divorce me

268
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,080
and insist on driving me away?

269
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,790
Lord Inspector, it's not proper to discuss personal relationships here.

270
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,110
Go back and rest.

271
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,770
Chu Xiuming! You only know how to avoid the problem!

272
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,110
When will you directly face your feelings?

273
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,830
You clearly have love in your heart, but you won't admit it!

274
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,810
Are you torturing me or yourself?

275
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,230
If being with me brings so much pain to you,

276
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,130
then you should leave quickly.

277
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,080
If I could forget about you after I left,

278
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,540
I wouldn't have returned!

279
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,220
Since you're not willing to leave, then I'll go.

280
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,550
Miss, do you want to eat something?

281
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,260
Rou Rou, I want to drink alcohol.

282
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,080
You can't! Alcohol is forbidden in camp.

283
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,000
Why are you angering me just like Chu Xiuming?

284
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,530
Now that you mention the general, I just heard the general returned to the manor.

285
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,400
He can return to his manor.

286
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,230
I'll stay in my camp.

287
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,580
Since I became the Military Inspector, I shouldn't just vent my frustrations.

288
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,860
Military affairs must come first.

289
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,720
Miss, you're talking more and more like the general now.

290
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,020
So what if I sound like him?

291
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,640
That Chu Xiuming is intent on divorcing me.

292
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,570
You said general wants to divorce you, but where is the divorce letter?

293
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,170
I ripped it up!

294
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,350
Who can prove that?

295
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,590
I personally proved it, who else needs to prove it?

296
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,660
I mean, you said the general divorced you,

297
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,280
but you ripped up the divorce letter. Who can prove he divorced you?

298
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,410
No— I did rip it up, but he can write another one!

299
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,000
Then, you can rip it up again!

300
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,220
Is there any use lying to myself like that?

301
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,940
Then is there any use in lying to yourself, at all?

302
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,700
Miss, I know you love the general and can't let him go.

303
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,890
If you give up now, you will definitely regret it in the future.

304
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,410
So get your spirits up!

305
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,040
Even if you have to lie, you shouldn't lie to yourself!

306
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,610
You have to "lie" the General back to your side!

307
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,660
Then... how should I lie?

308
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,740

My Lady, when will you move back in here?

315
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,790
If you don't come back, Xiao Cong will wither.

316
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,450
That's right. The condition in the barracks is definitely worse than here at the manor.

317
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,460
Come back more often, we'll make good food for you.

318
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,940
Okay.

319
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,220
The general...

320
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,690
The general woke up early today.

321
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,500
He's in the library dealing with official matters right now.

322
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,310
Then prepare some food for me. I'll go find him later.

323
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,040
And then we will eat a meal together.

324
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,180
All right, great!

325
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,370
Please, My Lady.

326
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,610
<i>[Yongning Manor]</i>

327
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,280
General.

328
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,530
General, please go on with your duties, I won't bother you.

329
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,360
I wouldn't dare to let Lord Inspector prepare the ink.

330
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,100
In this general's manor, there is no military inspector, just your wife.

331
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,340
But you and I are not married anymore.

332
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,340
The divorce letter has already been destroyed, no one else knows about it.

333
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,300
If General insists on divorcing me,

334
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,370
then you should explain the reasons to the emperor. Right?

335
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,980
Until then,

336
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,600
General can you maintain the wedding status with me for the moment?

337
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,940
All right. I'll oblige you for now.

338
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,510
In front of other people, let's treat each other as spouses.

339
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,650
But in the army camp, you're still my military inspector.

340
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,310
All right.

341
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:51,690
Now, no matter if it is a wife or military inspector,

342
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,870
I'm earnestly requesting that you go back to the barracks.

343
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,790
The army can't be one day without a general, nor can the army's matters be delayed

344
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,430
because of our personal feelings.

345
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,260
My Lady, do you mean it?

346
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,530
Don't worry, I won't make trouble anymore.

347
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,330
I want to help you handle the biggest and smallest matters of the army.

348
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,950
I won't cause trouble.

349
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,060
After all, protecting our homes and our country is a big responsibility.

350
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:26,460
Both in public and private, I should be of some help.

351
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,030
You need not worry about the affairs of the General's Manor,

352
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,010
I will handle them accordingly.

353
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,280
I won't let General worry about it.

354
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,300
Good. Then let's go back immediately to the barracks.

355
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,720
General, please wait.

356
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,640
I had them prepare a meal already. Let's go back once we are done eating.

357
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,960
<i>[Yongning Manor]</i>

358
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,380
<i>[Yongning Manor]</i>

359
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,170
This is for you.

360
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,120
What is this?

361
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,350
A pardon warrant.

362
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,190
What's it for?

363
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,030
In the barracks, military discipline is above all.

364
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,710
If you act as you did before and violate the military rules,

365
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,950
this badge can give you a pardon.

366
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,000
Then I have to keep it safe. Thank you.

367
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,580
You're welcome.

368
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,320
Thank you.

369
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,000
Stop right there! Stop!

370
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,200
You all, the night is moonless and the wind blows hard,

371
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,630
where are you going with these kids?

372
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,220
I'd advise you to refrain from taking the side of an evildoer,

373
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,020
free those kids now!

374
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,530
Stop.

375
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,570
General.

376
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,250
- Leave. 
 - Yes, Sir!

377
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,670
Let's go.

378
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,400
Impudent.

379
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,610
General, where are you sending these kids?

380
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,050
Yama's palace? 
 <i>[Yama is the King of Hell]</i>

381
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,400
These are my barracks.

382
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,810
It's not your place as a little palace guard commander, to give orders.

383
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,950
General, I wouldn't dare.

384
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,070
How would I have enough free time to meddle in the general's affairs?

385
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,600
I want to ask you...

386
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,390
What is your purpose in being sneaky all day?

387
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,240
The moon is beautiful tonight. I have a date with a beautiful lady.

388
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,660
Farewell, General.

389
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,230
<i>Lord Jin.</i>

390
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,360
Lord Jin, did you want something?

391
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,080
I brought back some dishes from the General's Manor. It'll improve your meal.

392
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,430
Wow. Then I am gladly accepting the invitation.

393
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,900
It's right there.

394
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,980
General!

395
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,920
Watch carefully that man named Xiao Su.

396
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,460
General, are you speaking about that little palace guard next to the Military Inspector?

397
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,490
That's right.

398
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,450
What is suspicious about him?

399
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,500
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

400
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,300
Cautiously investigate that Xiao Su!

401
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,440
If there's the slightest abnormal move, quickly report to me!

402
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,120
Yes, Sir!

403
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,250
<i>[Army Barracks - Restricted Area. Entry is forbidden.]</i>

404
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,020
<i>[Those who violate this order will be punished.]</i>

405
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,910
Have some tea.

406
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,210
Rou Rou, have you seen Chu Xiuming and the others?

407
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,040
No, I have not.

408
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,770
Tell me. What exactly are you looking for?

409
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,150
What's the matter, Great General Chu?

410
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,910
Are you afraid that your innumerable crimes will be exposed by me?

411
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,830
According to legend in the Imperial Court, Lord Yongning is a tyrant who doesn't know his limits,

412
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,970
preys on the people, and brings calamity and chaos to the country.

413
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,990
It looks like everything I've heard is true.

414
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,830
It has always been beneath my dignity to be understood by people.

415
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,870
Since you don't want to answer,

416
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,670
let's just forget it.

417
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,110
He trespassed in the army barracks, a restricted area.

418
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,470
He will be punished according to martial law.

419
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,470
He will be beaten to death with a staff.

420
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:44,510
<i>Hold it! Stop it! Stop, stop, stop!</i>

421
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,580
- Let me see who will dare to touch him! 
 - Move aside!

422
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,270
<i>Su Su!</i>

423
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,130
He's with me!

424
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,840
Who dares touch him?

425
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,780
How're you feeling? Are you hurt?

426
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,460
He's with you?

427
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:06,990
Lord Military Inspector, everyone is treated equally under martial law.

428
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,110
This person trespassed in a restricted area.

429
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:13,150
Even if you're a military inspector, you still cannot bend the law due to favoritism.

430
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,660
I'm the Military Inspector, all of you have to listen to me.

431
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,140
Besides, you should've clarified the situation before doing anything else.

432
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,040
Just as you cannot be excessively tolerant toward villains, you also cannot kill good people unjustly.

433
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,420
It should be fine if I use this to redeem Xiao Su's life, shouldn't it?

434
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,470
You cannot go back on your word.

435
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,740
I prepared this especially for you.

436
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,030
You're actually using it to save his life?

437
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,870
Since you already gifted it to me,

438
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:00,130
then how I make use of it is of no consequence to you.

439
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:07,220
In any case, no one is to harm Xiao Su today.

440
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,570
Fine.

441
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,310
I fulfill my promises.

442
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,720
Since you're using the token to pardon him,

443
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,020
he shall be pardoned.

444
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,670
General!

445
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,040
Su Su, are you all right?

446
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,480
I'm fine. Thank you, Lord Jin.

447
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,120
You've all arrived.

448
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,410
- How many days have you gone without a bath? 
 - Have you been good?

449
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,670
- You stink! 
 - Why are there children here?

450
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,270
They are here due to the goodness of the general's heart.

451
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,950
He took in the orphaned children of the rebel army and thought it would be inconvenient to disclose it publicly,

452
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,350
so he established this secret area.

453
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,740
Isn't that right? Isn't that right?

454
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,220
- How many are there? 
 - One, two...

455
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,360
<i>- three, four... 
 -  Count how many there are.</i>

456
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,810
- Five,  six... 
 - Are you telling the truth?

457
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,730
- Seven, eight... 
 - Of course, I am!

458
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,710
Our general is as kind-hearted as a Bodhisattva.

459
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,190
He disregarded them being former enemies and searched for these children everywhere so they could be raised well.

460
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,000
Did you miss me?

461
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,160
- Pinky swear. 
 - Here, let's pinky swear.

462
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,340
Pinky swear.

463
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,380
I misunderstood.

464
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,700
- Look at what I have in my hand. 
 - Have you all been behaving yourselves lately?

465
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,650
- Does this look nice?  
 -   Yes, it does.

466
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,780
Count how many there are.

467
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,210
Three?

468
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,110
- What are you playing? 
 - There are eight beans.

469
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,310
<i>He's with me! Who dares touch him!</i>

470
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,970
<i>He's with you?</i>

471
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,070
<i>In any case, no one is to harm Xiao Su today.</i>

472
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,170

Lord Military Inspector, tonight is a full moon.

00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,640
According to the rules in the barracks, all of the officers and soldiers must eat and drink together tonight.

492
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,910
You should join us in the festivities as well, Lord Military Inspector.

493
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,800
Then... will the general be there, too?

494
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,670
Of course, he will. All the officers and soldiers will be present.

495
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,070
This subordinate of yours will take his leave first.

Lord Jin, it's been too long since we've drunk to our hearts' content.

500
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,610
I'm actually risking breaking martial law to drink with you.

501
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,750
That is why you have to do me a favor.

502
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,090
Our Lord Jin is still unwilling to be at a disadvantage.

503
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,750
Tell me what you need.

504
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:59,250
Actually, I need to consult you on military business.

505
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,680
Military business?

506
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,640
That's right. I've taken responsibility and became a military inspector.

507
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,550
I can't possibly keep being reckless and causing trouble, can I?

508
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,310
It looks to me as if... you wish to help Chu Xiuming, isn't that so?

509
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,150
That's right.

510
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,930
Rumors say that the Devil General is a bloodthirsty, brutal tyrant who does not have any limits.

511
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,950
He refuses to spare even innocent children, so much so that he kills every last one of them.

512
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,210
Those are all rumors, they're not true. I know him.

513
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,820
And besides, helping him is akin to helping myself.

514
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,980
The two of us should be of one mind and be in agreement whether publicly or privately.

515
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:41,070
All right. Since Lord Jin firmly believes in him and the situation surrounding him,

516
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,540
I, Xiao Su, will support you wholeheartedly.

00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,940
Then, Su Su, let me thank you.
