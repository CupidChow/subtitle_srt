Can't you at least take two of my attacks?

141
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,210

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,440
You're my soldier.

161
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,940
My soldier must listen to my orders.

162
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,100
Fine, fine. I'll be careful.

163
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,510
You done talking? I'm going to practice.

164
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,050
Stop!

165
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,710
I'll practice with you.

166
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,580
Okay!

167
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,560
How interesting, General! You keep avoiding her.

168
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,600
It'll be hard to win!

169
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,810
If you keep running, I won't hold back!

170
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,970
Hurry and stop! Don't hurt yourself!

171
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,140
Cut the crap! Watch this!

172
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,400
General, I've won. Thanks.

173
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,160
Um...be careful, General.

174
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,140
Don't catch a cold!

175
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,890
How amazing! She beat the General!

176
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,010
That was rather talented.

177
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,390
<i>She's not bad.</i>

178
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,110
That's really amazing.

179
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,280
Pretty good!

180
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,430
Let's continue. Come.

181
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,440
It seems like this arranged marriage worked very well.

182
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,010
I hope General can watch over the borders properly for me.

183
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,710
Your Majesty, on this trip, I heard some...rumors.

184
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,410
Oh?

185
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,890
Let's hear it.

186
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,090
It seems like...General has a spy in court.

187
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,090
Where did this news come from?

188
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,290
I'm not sure about the details.

189
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:02,930
However, General Chu has a good news source. He is aware of all of your actions.

190
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,930
Cut off the transfer station that send things to the General's Manor.

191
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,230
Investigate this thoroughly.

192
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,900
Is Xiao Su in the city?

193
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,100
He is. You want to summon him?

194
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,440
Have him await my orders.

195
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,870
Yes.

196
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,030
I will take my leave.

197
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,610
This is from Lord Liu.

198
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,000
You've worked hard.

199
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,800
<i>Kites!</i>

200
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,880
Candied fruit!

201
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,200
<i>Candied hawthorns!</i>

202
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,810
Yearning, yearning.

203
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,520
If one's asking when the yearning ends,

204
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,990
whenever else than once we meet?

205
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,710
Brother, let me ask you about someone. Do you know Lord Jin?

206
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,340
I don't.

207
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,980
<i>[Travellers' Pavilion Hall]</i>

208
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,380
Madam, let me ask you about someone.

209
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,050
Do you know of Lord Jin?

210
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,320
I'm sorry, I don't.

211
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,470
It's okay.

212
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,530
Come come come. Take a look!

213
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,360
Young Master, take a look!

214
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,160
- Extremely good porcelain. Buy one!
- I want to ask about someone.

215
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,610
Please give me some money.

216
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,150
Thank you.

217
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,510
My Lord! My Lord! Give us some money!

218
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,650
Give us some money, My Lord!

219
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,170
My Lord!

220
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,320
Thank you! Thank you My Lord!

221
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,350
-You all want some?
-Yes!

222
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,020
Alright. Let me ask you about someone.

223
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,260
-My Lord, who are you looking for?
-Who are you looking for?

224
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,490
In the past, there was a person on this street called Lord Jin.

225
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,560
-Oh! Lord Jin! I know, I know!
-I know!

226
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,020
I was so thirsty after beating the General! Thanks!

227
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,250
My Lady, we have to face the possibility of an ambush every day.

228
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,340
We might lose our lives here.

229
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,130
The General is busy with military affairs.

230
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,090
He has to maintain the army and defend against the Falcon Tribe.

231
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,610
His mind has been wandering recently.

232
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,120
He's worried about your safety.

233
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,050
I...know he's busy.

234
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,040
I came to help share his burden.

235
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,330
Besides, who told him to—

236
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,650
do something that made me angry?

237
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,890
General has spent many years guarding the border on his own.

238
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,990
He is a quiet man who hides his emotions in his heart.

239
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,290
He has to protect the royal court and millions of citizens.

240
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,720
If he was in a bad mood and offended you,

241
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,510
I hope you will be understanding!

242
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,680
That's not what I mean.

243
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,980
I understand what you mean, Deputy General.

244
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,350
Thank you, my Lady!

245
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,170
General. I just received news.

246
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,710
The Emperor has ordered the transfer stations to hold everything coming and going from the General's manor.

247
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,620
Including letters from Rui Manor?

248
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,260
Yes.

249
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,070
Have someone watch the Lady, and add guards around the camp.

250
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,050
Yes, I will follow your order.

251
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,360
<i>No one knows about this besides me and her.</i>

252
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,320
<i>Why did the royal court suddenly decide to investigate the letters?</i>

253
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,870
<i>Was the person at Rui Manor discovered?</i>

254
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,970
Everyone choose a weapon that fits you!

255
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,160
Brother, let's associate and work together!

256
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Let's become the best partner! Come!

257
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,020
Fight in pairs!

258
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,660
-Yes!
-Yes!

259
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,560
You! Come at me!

260
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,160
Have a taste of my secret weapon!

261
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,630
That's right! It's the Shen style ferocious spiked club!

262
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,120
Are you afraid?

263
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,380
Wolf, let's go! Bite him! (T/N Spiked club is known as wolf-teeth club in Mandarin)

264
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,520
N-n-no!

265
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,520
Put it down. I'll pick a new one for you.

266
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,670
Wolf, wolf, I will be back.

267
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,870
What are you going to choose for me? A big sword?

268
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,530
No.

269
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,720
-A long spear?
-No.

270
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,120
How about flying darts?

271
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,000
This is an insult from Chu Xiuming on my ability!

272
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,580
It's an insult to my character!

273
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,410
The skills I learnt with Susu,

274
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,990
why aren't any of them useful?

275
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,450
Thankfully, Rou Rou was prepared and gave me osmanthus candy!

276
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,540
Or else, drinking this tasteless congee every day,

277
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,880
I'll die!

278
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,690
Yummy!

279
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,220
What are you doing?

280
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,370
I-!

281
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,940
Chu Xiuming, you did that on purpose!

282
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,700
Everyone only gets one bowl a day! What am I supposed to eat?

283
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,970
There's something wrong with this congee.

284
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,450
Is there arsenic or poison?

285
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,210
I think there's something wrong with <i>you</i>!

286
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,850
If you want to eat, just get another bowl.

287
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,480
Forget it!

288
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,070
Even the kitchen staff must be carefully investigated.

289
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,640
I understand.

290
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,780
<i>New soldiers are taking a bath! Everyone come together! Dont' be late!</i>

291
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,360
Even bath times are pre-set in the military.

292
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,220
There's so many soldiers taking a bath together.

293
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,680
I won't have a chance!

294
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,930
If I stand here without moving,

295
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,060
I won't break a sweat.

296
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,740
Why don't I return to the manor to bathe?

297
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,780
It's not that close.

298
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,410
I can't go back and forth every day.

299
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,250
You want to go to the bathhouse?

300
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,610
Um...I...I was taking a walk after dinner.

301
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,850
This is for washing my face!

302
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,860
My face is all dirty after a day of practice.

303
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,850
If you want to take a bath, you can go to my tent.

304
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,030
Why?  Go to your tent?

305
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,780
Didn't you divorce me?

306
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,610
Even if I'm covered in dirt I won't go to your tent to bathe!

307
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,890
Chu Xiuming. You won't give me a weapon, and you won't let me eat.

308
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,730
Now I can't even take a bath!

309
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,240
You're not only torturing me in food and drink,

310
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,520
you also want to take advantage of me? In your dreams!

311
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,910
You're done?

312
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,100
Come, come.

313
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,190
My lady.

314
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,130
Bao Zitou! Where are my blankets?

315
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,600
Your blankets have been arranged.

316
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,190
I will take you there right now.

317
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:59,230
Bao Zitou! This is the General's tent!

318
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,020
He wants me to spend the night here?

319
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,970
Yes, my lady.

320
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,460
Then go tell the General!

321
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,250
I voluntarily entered the military!

322
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,170
So I should receive the same treatment as the other soldiers!

323
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,400
Besides, why didn't he come discuss this with  me,

324
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,390
and instead decided it for me?

325
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,950
I'm not going!

326
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,810
Also, General should know this very well!

327
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,070
I have no right to enter his tent!

328
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:26,540
My lady, please stop fighting with the General.

329
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,470
Take me to the new soldier tent right now!

330
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,160
I'm tired, I want to rest!

331
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,090
Please!

332
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,790
General, this...

333
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,220
If she wants to live there,

334
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,550
then make arrangements for her.

335
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,340
The soldiers won't dare to make a fuss.

336
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,850
Yes!

337
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,450
<i>Come help me fold this.</i>

338
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,830
Okay.

339
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,060
So tired, let's sleep.

340
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,760
It's been a long day.

341
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,200
Aiya...

342
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,370
Everyone! Where should I sleep?

343
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,130
Why don't I sleep outside?

344
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,260
Hey! Wait!

345
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,310
Come back, come back!

346
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,950
That's not what I meant!

347
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,060
Bao Zitou, they all-!

348
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,120
It's fine!

349
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,050
No! There's still practice tomorrow! This is not right!

350
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,480
Um...is there any other place to sleep?

351
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,440
Don't worry, my lady. The soldiers are all rough people.

352
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,030
They usually sleep outside during practice.

353
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,680
Just rest here.

354
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,190
I-!

355
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,290
This won't do!

356
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,130
When they're soldiers, they die on the battlefield!

357
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,120
When I'm a soldier, I'm going to itch to death in the camp!

358
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,080
This is too embarrassing!

359
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:55,240
It's so late already. Everyone should be asleep, right?

360
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,830
Then no one will discover me, right?

361
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,950
Stop right there! Who is it?

362
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,920
Come out! If you don't, we'll have to go in.

363
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,510
What's going on?

364
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,250
- Your Ladyship? 
 - Your Ladyship?

365
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,630
General, Her Ladyship has arrived.

366
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,980
You've gone through a lot of hardships these past couple of days.

367
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,210
Some tea from the manor has been brought here. Please have some.

368
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,410
General, just be frank with me.

369
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:32,320
Since I've violated martial law, you should simply accord me the punishment befitting of the crime.

370
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,110
This subordinate of yours will take his leave.

371
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,000
If you refuse to return to the manor, you'll have to sleep in my tent every night

372
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,370
and you'll have to bathe here as well.

373
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,900
Since you've given me the divorce letter, I'm no longer your wife.

374
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,100
Why should you be so concerned about me?

375
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,320
General, what do you mean by this?

376
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,230
Every single person here is male.

377
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,370
It would be very inconvenient for you to sleep and bathe here.

378
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,700
Moreover, everyone in the army knows you're a girl. How're you going to live together with them?

379
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,720
I have to stay here just because you tell me to?

380
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,720
You absolutely must stay here!

381
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,720
There is only one room here. How am I supposed to stay here?

382
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,440
I'll have another bed made and sleep there.

383
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,330
We will sleep in the same room and not bother each other.

384
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:31,070
Chu Xiuming, you're saying the same thing you said back in the manor.

385
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,320
You've swept everything under the carpet so cleanly.

386
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,790
I, Shen Jin volunteered to join the army. I have my own plans.

387
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,830
You don't have to worry about me.

388
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:50,310
I'll agree to any demands you make,

389
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,730
as long as you don't cause trouble within the army and stay here obediently.

390
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,860
You'll give me... whatever I want?

391
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,080
A true gentleman never goes back on his words.

392
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,030
All right, General.

393
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,030
I didn't sleep well at all last night and I'm extremely tired.

394
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,080
I want to drink some wine and relax a little.

395
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,950
You know that wine is prohibited within the army, so by making such a request, you're obviously–

396
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,770
Seeing as I'm only a little girl,  how would I know that wine is prohibited within the army?

397
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:22,500
You were the one who wanted to meet my needs. All I want is some wine.

398
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,590
You're a formidable and great General, how could you not have any wine with you?

399
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,030
Fine.

400
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,180
If I give you wine, does that mean you'll agree to my request?

401
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,540
I'll agree to your request as long as you give me wine.

402
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,980
"How many times can I laugh heartily throughout my life,"

403
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,070
"I have to drink 'til I'm drunk since I'm drinking with such great friends." (T/N quoting poetry from Tang dynasty)

404
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,730
I feel so carefree.

405
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,580
I have beautiful scenery to admire

406
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,090
and I also have wine to drink.

407
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,350
General, you're still the one who has been thoughtful.

408
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,680
I just knew you had wine with you.

409
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,220
But that means you have violated martial law.

410
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,030
If I'd let you drink on camp grounds, who knows how much trouble you would've caused.

411
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:20,700
Chu Xiuming, do you really think I'm one of your subordinate troops?

412
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:26,770
Let me tell you this. I'm your wife whom the Emperor has bestowed upon... You...

413
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,050
Let me offer you some advice.

414
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:36,170
You believe you're so infallible, don't you know?

415
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,390
You have the worst temper

416
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,100
and you walk around all day with that serious look on your face.

417
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,030
I can't spot a single bit of humaneness in you.

418
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,210
What are you doing? Haven't you already divorced me?

419
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,510
Don't touch me.

420
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,650
People say, "Women's hearts are just like a needle at the bottom of the sea." (T/N Chinese proverb: women's minds are hard to understand.)

421
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,180
You're a grown man,

422
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,030
yet you're cold one minute and hot the next.

423
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,420
I protected the manor for you.

424
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,070
I came to the army camp because of you.

425
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,760
I've done so much for you,

426
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,000
yet you not only wish to divorce me, but you also wish to chase me away from you.

427
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,400
You used to call me "my Lady" all the time,

428
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,360
but now you don't even want to look at me.

429
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,960
I don't mean anything to you anymore.

430
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,060
I dare you to call me "my Lady" again.

431
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,680
Look! You just won't do it.

432
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,480
Look at how heartless you are!

433
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,690
There's a lake here!

434
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:08,460
Thank the spirits of the sky and land. I can finally take a bath.

435
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,770
There's a lake in front of you! Be careful!

436
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,460
My Lady!

437
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,100
My Lady!

438
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,660
My Lady.

439
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,050
It's too dangerous getting in the water while drunk.

440
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,200
Get out of the lake and put your cloths on quickly.

441
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,700
Look at these strange things you're saying.

442
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,920
How am I supposed to take a bath if I don't take off my clothes?

443
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,890
Heaven must be truly on my side. There's actually a lake here for me to bathe in!

444
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:57,010
Chu Xiuming, did you just call me "my Lady"?

445
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,140
Did you?

446
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,710
I was under a state of duress just now, so I accidentally blurted it out.

447
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,670
I will never call you that again.

448
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,290
Fine, don't then.

449
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,000
But why have you turned your back towards me?

450
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,850
Do you want to turn around and take a bath with me?

451
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,780
If you wish to take a bath, do so and then quickly put your clothes back on.

452
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,810
I will wait for you up there.

453
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,790
We're in the middle of the wilderness, and it's just the two of us here.

454
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,420
And... I've got so little on.

455
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,780
Do you dare turn around to look at me?

456
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,810
Stop being mischievous.

457
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,530
I'm not being mischievous!

458
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:37,200
Are you even a man? Do you dare turn around and face me?

459
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,650
It's not safe wading in unknown waters while drunk. Aren't you going to quickly come up?

460
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:46,330
Chu Xiuming! I am your wife who you legally and legitimately married!

461
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,410
Not only are you divorcing me,

462
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,460
you won't even turn around and look at me.

463
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,990
I'm telling you, if you won't turn around today, then I'm never coming up to the shore!

464
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,520
If you're still angry because of the divorce letter,

465
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,030
then I'll apologise to you.

466
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,680
But you must get out immediately, and put your cloths back on!

467
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,250
It's not safe wading in unknown waters while drunk. What if–

468
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,260
My Lady!

469
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,130
<i>[Bonus Scene]</i>

470
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,150
General, what are your thoughts on Her Ladyship's performance at the barracks?

471
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,790
She came here because of me.  It has nothing to do with anyone else.

472
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,930
General, I think it would be better if you explained matters to Her Ladyship

473
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,900
to prevent her from causing trouble and being a laughingstock.

474
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,150
Her behaviour this time is completely different than the previous times.

475
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,920
She's been very unreasonable.

476
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,350
I don't think she'll cause too much trouble.

477
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,920
She'll probably remain here at the barracks for a few more days, then return to the manor.

478
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,170
Now that Her Ladyship is at the barracks,

479
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,200
you can see her all the time and take care of her in secret.

480
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,100
That's also a beautiful thing.

481
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,370
Speaking of taking care of her in secret, both you and Bao Zitou have not spared any effort on that front.

482
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,430
General, just pretend that you're unaware of it. After all, Sister-in-law is still a lady

483
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,500
and cannot be compared to our soldiers in the army.

484
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,100
I am well aware of that fact. I won't make things too difficult for the both of you.

485
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:10,110
When the time comes, I will tell her the whole truth so she can return to the manor soon.
