<i>Auntie, Auntie! Auntie!</i>

25
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,030
Ming'er, come.

26
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,430
<i>Ming'er, looking at your imposing and vigorous figure,</i>

27
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,790
Once you grow up, you will definitely be a big general who protects the country!

28
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,730
I want to protect you and the baby in your tummy!

29
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,170
Ming'er, a man has to protect the world.

30
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,040
Besides protecting your own family,

31
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,840
you must also become powerful.

32
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,240
You must use your own power to protect those who are being bullied.

33
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,570
I will remember your lessons, Auntie!

34
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,080
Ming'er, look.

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,870
My mother gave this to me.

36
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,100
Today, I will give this to you.

37
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,870
It will keep you safe and happy.

38
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,650
Once you grow up, give it to the person you love.

39
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,550
Have her keep it close to her heart,

40
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,450
so it can stay with her and protect her, okay?

41
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,600
<i>Auntie. I will fulfill my promise.</i>

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,400
<i>I will protect the one I love and guard the one I care for.</i>

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,680
<i>I will also find the truth for you.</i>

Good! Good!

47
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,100
Good!

48
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,880
-Good!
-Good!

49
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,070
Rou Rou! Do you smell that?

50
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,750
Give me another stick!

51
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,350
- <i>It's delicious.</i>
- Wow!

52
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,630
Here, let me give you one.

53
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,130
They're eating like this?

54
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,450
I don't know! This is the first time I've seen this too!

55
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,530
This meat has been cut into little pieces

56
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,920
and then skewered on a stick!

57
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,830
And then roasted on this charcoal fire!

58
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,380
Those should be Falcon Tribe specialty herbs!

59
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,380
I wonder what it tastes like!

60
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,430
I want to know what it tastes like. We just need to try it!

61
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,450
-My Lady! My Lady, My Lady!
-What?

62
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,630
My Lady, our diet is very different from the Falcon Tribe.

63
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,530
And we have just arrived. I'm afraid our bodies have not yet settled.

64
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,470
Look, this type of eating isn't very sanitary.

65
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,680
This meat is directly touching the charcoal fire.

66
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,550
There's soot on the meat. My Lady, you shouldn't-

67
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,190
Shouldn't try it, okay?

68
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,450
Lieutenant General, you're right!

69
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,340
This method of eating isn't very sanitary,

70
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,380
and this taste can't compare to top tier expensive foods,

71
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,330
but...the Falcon Tribe specialty herbs are so delicious!

72
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,060
We've eaten like this in the military camp before.

73
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,410
It's about the same idea!

74
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,610
It's very similar to our roasted chicken!

75
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,440
But we don't have these herbs.

76
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,790
Why don't we buy some and take it back to the  manor?

77
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,860
Lieutenant General! You have a stick too!

78
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,470
My Lady, I'd better not try it.

79
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,630
If anything happens to you-

80
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,580
If you get sick...

81
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,370
I can take you to the doctor, right?

82
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,510
Crow's mouth! (refers to a jinx) If you don't want to eat it, then don't eat it. I'll eat it myself.

83
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,790
How delicious!

84
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,640
It's here! Let's sit there!

85
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,000
My Lady, there are too many loitering people in this tavern.

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
Why don't we go somewhere else?

87
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,900
What's wrong with loitering people?

88
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,070
Besides, General wants us to meet up here.

89
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,830
If he can't find us, then what should we do?

90
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,160
You are right.

91
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,760
Fine, then My Lady must promise me you won't do anything to bring attention to yourself.

92
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,970
Don't worry, I'm very careful!

93
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,080
What would you like to eat?

94
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,950
I ate too much meat today.

95
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,340
Give us some alcohol to quench our thirst, and then some small dishes.

96
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,390
Okay!

97
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,380
My Lady! You cannot drink alcohol!

98
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,000
Why not?

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,780
Falcon Tribe alcohol is strong! You can get drunk easily!

100
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,680
The side dishes will be ready soon. Please start enjoying this first.

101
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,390
I won't embarrass myself, right?

102
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,800
Come, Lieutenant General. You've worked hard. Have a cup.

103
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,180
Lieutenant General!

104
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,550
General wants me to take care of you. I shouldn't drink.

105
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,350
You won't do anything! How boring!

106
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,620
-Let's drink, Rou Rou.
-Come.

107
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,080
Boss!

108
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,540
Why do I think today's alcohol isn't alcohol, but water instead?

109
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,320
Come.

110
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,600
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

111
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,130
Go away! What are you doing?

112
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,550
What are you doing? Let go of me!

113
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,270
Stop!

114
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,920
A big grown man like you is bullying a little girl?

115
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,980
If I can't touch her, then why don't I touch you?

116
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,010
-Miss!
-Rou Rou! Protect Her Ladyship!

117
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,440
-This way!
-Xiuyuan, be careful!

118
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,880
It's dangerous!

119
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,810
Stop meddling, Miss!

120
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,320
Lieutenant General is here, it's okay!

121
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,910
Impudent!

122
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,320
Ta Rou!

123
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,370
Get lost!

124
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,130
Let's go!

125
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,420
What happened?

126
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,500
-Husband!
-General!

127
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,350
-My Lady.
-Husband, someone was bullying me!

128
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,820
Thank you for your help just now.

129
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,900
It's okay, it's okay! It was just a small matter.

130
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,760
It's okay now.

131
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,080
So you two saved my wife? Thank you.

132
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
You don't look like locals.

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,370
If you come across something like this again, it's best not to interfere.

134
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,080
Thank you for the reminder. G-

135
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,460
It's getting late, let's go back.

136
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,380
I haven't finished my business here, and I'm afraid it's too late to go back now.

137
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,820
Let's stay here tonight.

138
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,360
Thank you for protecting my family today.

139
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,500
-If you don't mind, why don't you have a meal with us?
-There's no need.

140
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,170
We're very willing, very willing!

141
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,710
Alright. Then let's go elsewhere. Come.

142
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,180
My Lady.

143
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,240
Please.

144
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,590
So you two are siblings?

145
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,760
Little Sister Ta Rou, Brother Hu Te, thank you for saving me today!

146
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,670
You've already thanked us many times.

147
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,520
How about you drink a few more cups with me?

148
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,010
I haven't drank so happily in a while!

149
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,750
Drinking is simple! Come!

150
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,510
-Cheers!
-Come!

151
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,240
Brother Hu Te, you don't know.

152
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
In the past, I was the Lord Jin who ruled over the streets!

153
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,610
I never imagined I'd be troubled by a few bastards today!

154
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,210
After I got married, my circumstances changed drastically.

155
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,610
My Lady. Watch your etiquette.

156
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,660
Brother Hu Te, my wife is very straightforward. I hope you don't mind.

157
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,900
Women should be like Her Ladyship.

158
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,710
Not losing out to a man!

159
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,870
I never imagined I would find a confidante here!

160
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,030
Come! Let's drink another cup!

161
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,610
Brother Chu. I just know you're from the capital, but not your full name.

162
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,780
It's not proper to just call you Brother Chu.

163
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,400
You can just call me Chu Ming.

164
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,070
Brother Chu Ming, I know all of the stores here.

165
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,130
If you run into any trouble, just tell me!

166
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,850
Then thank you, Brother Hu Te.

167
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,000
What kind of business do you do?

168
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,660
I'm just a small officer. It's not worth mentioning.

169
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,430
This miss, why aren't you drinking?

170
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,080
T-then let's drink!

171
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,210
Here!

172
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,970
- Drink! 
 <i>- Tell Her Ladyship to drink less!</i>

173
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,670
I'll drink first!

174
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,880
- Jin'er is happy today. It's fine if she drinks a few more cups. 
 - Cheers.

175
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,430
Big Brother Xiuyuan, don't you think you should drink a cup to me?

176
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,830
Miss Ta Rou is a girl, I...!

177
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,300
What? You won't drink with a girl?

178
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,540
I will drink a cup to you!

179
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,260
Since you're not willing to make the first move, I'm not willing to drink it!

180
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,280
Then...then...

181
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,090
How can I make you drink?

182
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,870
Get married to me!

183
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,960
If you get married to me, I'll drink with you every day!

184
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,550
Shouldn't it be you marrying him,

185
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,790
-not him getting married to you?
-I-!

186
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,610
Rou Rou! Don't talk nonsense!

187
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,940
I heard there's a saying from your people.

188
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,060
It goes...

189
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,830
There is a beauty in the northern lands,

190
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,720
Peerless and independent,

191
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,930
One glance from her and a city collapses,

192
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,340
Another glance and a nation crumbles.

193
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,850
In your heart, Brother Xiuyuan,

194
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,780
am I family to you?

195
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,830
Any person who sees me will like me!

196
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,520
If you continue being so cold, I'm going to be angry!

197
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,790
If you...pour another cup for me,

198
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,880
and then drink a cup yourself, I'll forgive you!

199
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,550
I will drink a cup to you, Miss Ta Rou!

200
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,830
You're not sincere at all. I don't want to forgive you.

201
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,940
Unless...unless you can...

202
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,060
Please go ahead.

203
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,110
Take a walk with me!

204
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,230
That's a small matter! I will keep you safe!

205
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,730
Thank you Big Brother Xiuyuan!

206
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,640
Come! We are drinking happily today!

207
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,620
I'm lucky to meet you all!

208
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,790
-Come!
-Cheers!

209
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,380
Cheers.

210
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,540
Brother Hu Te, you are getting drunk. You should stop drinking.

211
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,230
Drinking is a happy thing!

212
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,000
Why should he stop? Come!

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,030
-Drink!
-Rou Rou! How could you talk to my husband like that?

214
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,790
Husband, hurry and punish Rou Rou!

215
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,970
General! I was wrong!

216
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,730
Please don't kill me!

217
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,460
General? Your titles are so strange.

218
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,950
Of course! Our General is the grand Lord Yongning, Chu Xiuming!

219
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,690
- Rou Rou is drunk! 
 - -She's drunk!

220
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,030
She's talking nonsense. She's always like this.

221
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,280
She's always like this.

222
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,010
Come.

223
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,310
Brother Hu Te, she's drunk. Don't think about it.

224
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,320
How could I not?

225
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,750
It's such a happy day!

226
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,170
How could we drink with cups? Come! Drink!

227
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,410
Come! Cheers!

228
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,340
-Come! Cheers!
-Cheers!

229
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,580
Come, eat some more, My Lady.

230
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,750
Here.

231
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,230
Big Brother Xiuyuan. You're not married yet?

232
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,140
Do you have someone you like?

233
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,210
N-no.

234
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,970
Are you not interested in women?

235
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,800
You've misunderstood. I just don't have the time to think of romance.

236
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,380
You just haven't come across a suitable girl yet.

237
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,550
If there is a suitable girl, what would you do?

238
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,960
I haven't met one yet. I don't know.

239
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,160
Actually, I'm the same.

240
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,810
I've never met a man who's touched my heart before.

241
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,330
Besides one person.

242
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,630
To have obtained your affection, that person must be talented!

243
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,360
Of course!

244
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,210
The person I like won't be like anyone else.

245
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,830
It's just...I just met him not long ago.

246
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,120
I wonder...if he will like me?

247
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,020
Surely no one will reject you, right?

248
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,810
Then...the person I like is you!

249
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,640
Are you willing to spend your life with me?

250
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,780
Miss Ta Rou, you are so talented. I am just a crass person.

251
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,840
How could I hope for that?

252
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,080
Sit down!

253
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,940
Sit down!

254
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,480
The old calluses on your hands,

255
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,060
are from using the sword for a long time?

256
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,040
We often roam all over the country.

257
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,760
We come across bandits all the time.

258
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,180
Practicing the sword is for self protection.

259
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,680
My father's hand is also like this.

260
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,520
Father died when I was young.

261
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,010
Mother was too heartbroken and fell ill. She died too.

262
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,150
Now, Big Brother and I are the only ones left.

263
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,430
But he's too strict with me!

264
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,260
Seeing your hands,

265
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,190
I thought of my father.

266
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,310
I'm sorry. I made you think of unhappy things.

267
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,010
Of course! Of course it's your fault. It's all your fault!

268
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,450
If you take another walk with me tomorrow, I'll forgive you!

269
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,700
Okay! Okay.

270
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,970
It's getting late. I'll walk you back.

271
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,260
Then...I'll walk you back to the inn, and then you'll walk me back home!

272
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,030
Okay!

273
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,420
Lie down, lie down, lie down!

274
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,320
Don't move!

275
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,380
Don't move! If you move I'll hit you!

276
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,990
This feels awful!

277
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,910
If you feel awful My Lady, go back and rest.

278
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,070
I'll go once Rou Rou falls asleep.

279
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,040
Husband. I am too happy that I could come here today!

280
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,980
I not only ate lamb meat on a skewer!

281
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,800
I drank alcohol too!

282
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,670
I also bought a lot of presents for the entire manor!

283
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,690
It's all thanks to you, Husband!

284
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,090
I want to reward you!

285
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,920
Oh? What is my reward?

286
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,680
I am too lucky to have married you!

287
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,610
That you could marry me is also the best thing that happened to me.

288
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,180
To be able to be with Su Su,

289
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,740
is also the happiest thing for me!

290
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,100
Rou Rou! You're not happy to be with me?

291
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,740
Happy, happy! But General always wants to kill me!

292
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,840
I'm afraid!

293
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,360
It's okay! Don't be afraid, I'm here!

294
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,430
If General dares to kill, then...I will reward him!

295
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,450
It'll be fine once he's rewarded.

296
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,080
-It still feels awful.
-Drink some more.

297
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,610
I shouldn't have drunk so much.

298
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,550
My stomach feels like it's on fire.

299
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,090
It looks like I have to forbid you from drinking ever again.

300
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,790
You'll not only hurt your body, but also go on a drunken rampage.

301
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,950
Do you still remember what you just did to me?

302
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,360
I am your wife!

303
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,520
Are you going to punish me for what I did to you?

304
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
It looks like you have a poor memory.

305
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,600
Then I'll have to reenact it for you.

306
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,080
I was drunk then! I didn't do it on purpose!

307
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,090
It wasn't there, it was here!

308
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,130
But Wife. You must not drink alone outside anymore.

309
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,610
I'm afraid others will get to see

310
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,190
how cute my wife is when she's drunk.

311
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,840
Yes sir!

312
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,900
Alright. I'll go outside and get some sobering soup for you and Rou Rou.

313
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,500
You'll feel better that way.

314
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,250
Okay. Come back soon.

315
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,850
Okay.

316
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,540
Who dares to hurt my Brother Xiuyuan?

317
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,170
Could these people be out for revenge for the incident at the inn today?

318
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,690
These people are skilled with the sword.

319
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,280
They're different from the people during the daytime.

320
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,930
Every sword was aimed at you. It seems like you're the target.

321
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,910
Xiuyuan, go and feed the horses and pack. We'll leave as soon as the sun rises.

322
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,450
Okay!

323
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,010
Where  is Ta Rou?

324
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,520
Gather the others and assemble here right away.

325
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,160
Elder Brother, why did you attack them?

326
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,750
Ta Rou? What are you doing here?

327
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,420
Were you following us?

328
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,410
What is going on?

329
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,610
This is none of your business.

330
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,900
They are our friends. How could you behave in this way?

331
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,660
If you stick your nose in my business, I will not let you off!

332
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,620
General, there's no sign of them.

333
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,280
We can't stay here any longer. We have to leave now.

334
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,430
- Stop right there! 
 - Stop right there!

335
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,650
- Stop right there! 
 - Xiuyuan, take them away from here!

336
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,610
- Husband... 
 - How could I be afraid of these few men?

337
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,680
Don't worry about me. Now, go!

338
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,920
<i>You must be careful!</i>

339
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,740
- The general... 
 - He'll be fine.

340
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,490
Hurry.

341
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,060
Your Ladyship, Rou Rou. You must not come out no matter what happens.

342
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,650
- Xiuyuan! 
 - Deputy general, be careful!

343
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,830
Young Miss.

344
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,460
Who are you? Why are you pursuing us so closely?

345
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,080
- You can't. Miss, you musn't go. 
 - Stay right here.

346
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,830
- What are you doing! You can't go!  
 - Rou Rou, stay here and wait for the general.

347
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,790
Young Miss!

348
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,260
Let him go! I'm Chu Xiuming's wife.

349
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,720
Hu Te!

350
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,760
Hu Te, I do not know why you're doing this today.

351
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,230
But if you persist, I will not show you any mercy.

352
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,530
Young Miss! Young Miss...

353
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,000
Young Miss...

354
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,700
Rou Rou!

355
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,700
General! General... The deputy general and Young Miss have been captured by them.

356
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,370
Which direction did they head towards?

357
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,770
I think they went that way.

358
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,520
Stay here and don't move.

359
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,640
Why did I let her go...

360
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,660
I'm so stupid. So stupid!

361
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,900
General!

362
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,600
What should we do now?

363
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,010
This territory belongs to the Falcon Tribe. It is impossible for us to move about without restraint.

364
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,100
I need you to go and look for someone.

365
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,500
Master, what are our plans now?

366
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,060
<i>We cannot show our faces anymore.</i>

367
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,710
<i>If the Chief finds out we've captured these two people, we'll be punished according to the law.</i>

368
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,560
<i>Are we going to release them just like that?</i>

369
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,340
No. His wife is in my hands. He will not run away.

370
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,330
Send some men over to keep watch over them. Remember, by no means must this information be leaked.

371
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,360
Yes.

372
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,370
Elder Brother. Xiuyuan is hurt and bleeding.

373
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,850
His wounds should be bandaged up at the very least.

374
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,200
He won't die from bleeding this little. You should leave this place quickly and go back.

375
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,860
I can leave things alone, but you must tell me why you're doing this.

376
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,620
I already told you to stop prying into this matter.

377
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,580
Father always taught us to treat others with civility ever since we were little

378
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,020
and never to treat our friends in this manner.

379
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,710
Friends? Do you even know who they are?

380
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,600
They are friends who drank and fought with us.

381
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,470
What rubbish! They purposely hid their true identities from us.

382
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,350
They never treated us as their friends!

383
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,710
Let me tell you.

384
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,450
They are the very people who beheaded Father on the battlefield!

385
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,330
They are the ones who killed Father?

386
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,490
Chu Ming is Chu Xiuming.

387
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,310
Our Father died by his sword!

388
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,450
Ta Rou, we were ruined, orphaned and have been impoverished up until now

389
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,790
all thanks to Chu Xiuming.

390
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,700
This is the only opportunity we have to kill our mortal enemy with our own hands.

391
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,980
Our parents who are in the <i>Nine Springs</i> must be allowed to close their eyes in death and die contentedly.

392
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,280
<i>(Nine Springs – the underworld)</i>

393
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,530
There are too many people who come in and go out everyday.

394
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,700
Drunkards and fights are a common sight. I really have no impression of that incident.

395
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,300
Please think through it once more.

396
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,910
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

397
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,020
Xiuyuan. Xiuyuan!

398
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,410
Xiuyuan, wake up.

399
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,020
Your Ladyship?

400
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,210
How are your injuries?

401
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,860
I'm fine.

402
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,350
Have the people inside woken up already?

403
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,150
The Master has instructed us not to let anyone in.

404
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,980
It's Ta Rou.

405
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,410
Your Ladyship, I remembered that you're an expert when it comes to picking locks. Are you able to unlock us from the outside?

406
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,680
- I'll give it a try. 
 - All right.

407
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,390
My hairpin can't release this particular lock. We'll have to think of another way.

408
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,310
It's very quiet outside. It sounds very spacious and empty, and moreover, I can hear the birds chirping.

409
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,030
We should either be on the mountaintop or in the mountain range.

410
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,680
The person we saw just now was Ta Rou.

411
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,570
Could it be that the trap last night was set up by them?

412
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,410
I'm not sure about that. But I'm sure the target of the person who captured us must be the general.

413
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,470
I'm convinced they're waiting for the general since they've not killed you yet.

414
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:53,220
This won't do. We can't let my husband be lured into their trap as he tries to rescue us.

415
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,050
I have to look for something else that can release the lock.

416
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,640
Rou Rou, how did it go?

417
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,130
I've already sent the letter to Princess Ma Ya's manor,

418
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,210
but the gatekeeper said she's not at home.

419
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,620
He allowed me to write her a letter and then made me leave after that.

420
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,440
I'm afraid we are running out of time to wait.

421
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,900
It's all my fault.

422
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,930
It's all my fault for getting drunk and spewing nonsense.

423
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,410
General! General!

424
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,680
<i>Who is that?</i>

425
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,700
Regarding the disturbance yesterday at the tavern – who was the man and woman who subdued you?

426
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,340
What disturbance at the tavern? I've never seen you before in my life.

427
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,270
Tell me! What is Hu Te's true identity?

428
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,910
Please let me off, I don't want any trouble.

429
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,150
Are you going to tell me or not?

430
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:02,290
I can't tell you anything even if you beat me to death! I know nothing! Please let me off.

431
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:12,130
What? You're letting them go so easily?

432
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,700
It seems this He Te has a lot of influence here. Nobody dares to speak up.

433
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,180
We must investigate somewhere else.

434
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,510
This lock has two mechanism. I can open the first one.

435
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,340
I need a slimmer pin for the second one.

436
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,440
Your hairpin wouldn't work?

437
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,470
Hey!

438
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,740
Eat. This is to stop the bleeding.

439
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,870
Yesterday night, you purposely drew me and planned with Hu Te to capture me.

440
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,100
That's not it!

441
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:09,400
Forget it. There's no need to talk about it with you.

442
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,830
Ta Rou, we never displeased your brother Hu Te.

443
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,100
Why are you keeping us captive?

444
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,940
You really don't know why my brother is doing this?

445
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,610
Miss Ta Rou, if you know about it, please tell us.

446
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:26,100
We will definitely make up for our mistake.

447
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:33,020
Your husband is Chu Xiuming.

448
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,430
We didn't hide from you on purpose.

449
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,190
We just didn't want to cause trouble.

450
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,500
Chu Xiuming killed so many of my people, yet you still dare come here!

451
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,100
Both sides stopped the war now.

452
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,890
Do you want to pour oil on the war fire and go back to fighting?

453
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,480
He killed my father.

454
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,640
This is hatred for kiling my father.

455
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,470
Your father.

456
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:08,600
Miss Ta Rou, once on the battlefield, life and death doesn't belong to us anymore.

457
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,300
General...

458
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,700
I am Chu Xiuming's wife, but Xiuyuan has nothing to do with that.

459
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,670
I hope you can free him.

460
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,270
Madam.

461
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,700
You are all together. How he is not related to this?

462
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,970
Miss Ta Rou, even though I have known you shortly,

463
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,870
I am convinced you are a good person.

464
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,150
You can tell good from bad.

465
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,220
You lost your father to the battlefield,

466
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,330
but we also lost many friends.

467
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,140
It seems miss Ta Rou won't help us.

468
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,640
Her hairpin might open the lock.

469
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,800
General. Eat a little.

470
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,230
You haven't eaten for a whole day.

471
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,380
How come nobody knows about this Hu Te?

472
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,850
It's not that they don't know. It's that they don't dare speaking.

473
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,760
Eat first. I'm going to look again.

474
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,610
Ta Rou.

475
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,760
If you want to let them go, you're the enemy of your tribe.

476
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,480
you're the enemy of your tribe.

477
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,070
- Big brother. It's Chu Xiuming who killed Father.

478
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,790
Taking his life is enough.

479
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,550
His wife and Xiuyuan has nothing to do with it.

480
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,870
After Father died, the leader made him take his place.

481
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,970
Other tribes are even further away from us.

482
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,520
Our tribe declined this low, yet you still don't repent.

483
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,110
You even dare to beg for mercy on our enemy!

484
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,710
Is it because big brother don't have Father's guidance

485
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,280
that you didn't inherit his position.

486
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,510
Shut up! Father loved you too much. He spoiled you too much.

487
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,470
If you dare ask about this again,

488
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,210
I won't show mercy.

489
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,800
Yes.

490
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,080
My Lord. When are you coming to save Jin'Er?

491
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,510
Jin'Er really misses you.

492
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,430
Miss Ta Rou.

493
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,430
What do you want to say?

494
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,670
A strand of grass got caught in you hair.

495
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:10,600
My Lord, Chu Xiuming is staying at the inn, asking about your whereabouts.

496
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,010
Bring him a letter.

497
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,500
Yes.

498
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,450
Hurry.

499
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,640
I love you so much.

500
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,790
But you still used me.

501
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,350
Don't you like me even a little?

502
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,780
I...

503
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,970
Guards! Lock them in!

504
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,570
There's no need.

505
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,250

506
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,070
Miss Ta Rou!

507
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,020
I am already here. Please go back.

508
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,610
Xiuyuan brother, I walked such a long way.

509
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,270
I am a little thirsty.

510
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:30,160
What if... we go in and drink some tea?

511
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,730
Wait for me here.

512
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:48,640
