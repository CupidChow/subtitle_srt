18
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,600
My lady, please rest here tonight.

19
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,350
He actually dismissed me to here.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Rou Rou.

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,940
Just now, he wasn't willing to speak an extra word to me.

22
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,680
In any case, I'm his wife! How could he be so cold?

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,260
Also there's that guy with the big bearded guy just now. I was almost murdered by him!

24
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,200
Miss, staying alive is the most important thing.

25
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,340
Did you say that all of his previous wives are dead? 
 (phrase she use for dead - 死翘翘 si qiao qiao - is slang thus inappropriate)

26
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,650
I heard that they're all dead.

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,920
They wouldn't still be here, right?

28
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,820
Ladies, my lady didn't mean anything by that!

29
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,900
Please don't bother yourselves getting angry at her!

30
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,850
Amitabha. Amitabha. 
 (merciful Buddha)

31
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,530
- That's enough! 
- Please don't bother yourselves getting angry at her.

32
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,770
It's just a house.

33
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,790
Even if a demon is cultivated, it would be a stone demon.

34
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,180
Please don't bother yourselves getting angry at her. Amitabha. Amitabha.

35
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,950
Rou Rou!

36
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,050
Could it be that he doesn't like me?

37
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,230
That's why he made me stay here.

38
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,250
How can that be possible, Miss? You're a natural beauty.

39
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,550
In this frontier fortress, out of a hundred people, there's not one person as beautiful as you.

40
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,930
This moon is the same as the one at home,

41
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,530
but this place really isn't suitable for anyone to stay in.

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,080
I promised Mother that I wouldn't make her worry.

43
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,950
Moreover, this is a marriage bestowed by the Emperor.

44
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,140
I must stay.

45
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,570
I can't implicate her.

46
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,990
Reporting to General, among the wedding entourage, there indeed was a spy. He has been killed.

47
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,670
Her Ladyship has already settled down.

48
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,670
How should she be dealt with?

49
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,860
After all, she's part of the royal family. How could we neglect her?

50
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,730
I will make the arrangements. You may leave.

51
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,210
Yes.

52
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,120
What? The general wants to come see me?

53
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,630
Yes.

54
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,220
Put all of these on me. I can't be a disgrace to the Rui Royal Manor.

55
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,460
Okay.

56
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,540
Put this on.

57
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,310
Rou Rou, do I look alright?

58
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,880
Really pretty! You can definitely charm everyone.

59
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,050
Miss, the general is here.

60
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,000
- General. 
 - General.

61
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,350
My lady looks a little different today.

62
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,610
If you likes it, I can look like this everyday.

63
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,920
Your attitude today is vastly different to yesterday's.

64
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,510
What's your purpose for getting close to me?

65
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,940
As the saying goes, follow the man you marry, whether he be fowl or dog.

66
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,350
Since I am your wife, how could I not try to get close to you?

67
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,430
You have compared me to a fowl and a dog.

68
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,750
Then may I ask, what are you, my lady?

69
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,510
I am the daughter of the Rui Royal Manor,

70
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,240
the one bestowed by the Emperor to be General Chu Xiuming's wife.

71
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,700
Since you are set on being my wife,

72
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,660
then why was there a spy in your wedding entourage?

73
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,390
A spy?

74
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,660
This—

75
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,840
I didn't know!

76
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,580
Since we are speaking of it, I want to ask you,

77
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,930
why did your welcoming entourage escort me to such a dangerous place?

78
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,860
Could it be that you suspect that I am a spy?

79
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,300
You're overthinking, my lady.

80
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,530
These are hometown dishes prepared for you. It's dangerous out there,

81
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,730
please rest here for a few days.

82
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,980
No wait, I came here to fulfill the marriage order bestowed by the Emperor,

83
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,640
but I never held a marriage ceremony. I'm afraid it'll be difficult to say we followed the imperial edict.

84
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,840
Besides, I really came here for my mother, that's why I was forced to come here.

85
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,850
Please believe me, General.

86
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,530
General!

87
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,080
Why did I make the effort to dress up for him? I'm so annoyed!

88
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,240
I let it pass when he abandoned me and when he ignored me,

89
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,680
but now he's even suspecting me of being a spy?

90
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,430
Miss, I've heard that in the army, if someone is suspected of being a spy, they'll be killed.

91
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,510
Do you think they might have added poison to the food?

92
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,460
If it continues like this, we really could die.

93
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,940
The old plan?

94
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,470
It's fine.

95
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,610
Miss?

96
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,080
<i>[Yong Ning Manor]</i>

97
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,850
- Miss. 
- My lady.

98
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,590
After observing my lady for so many days, it's truly strange,

99
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,830
I can't tell if she's a spy or not.

100
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,490
The Falcon Tribe hasn't made any movements today. Go to the frontier fortress, get intel on the situation.

101
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,000
I accept the order!

102
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,280
Be careful.

103
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,640
Miss. It's so boring!

104
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
I'm about to go insane!

105
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,020
I'm also about to go insane from boredom.

106
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,050
Rou Rou, this is what that big head Zhang gave to me as collateral for his debt. 
<i>[The Devil Lord Yongning]</i>

107
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,310
I never thought that it would actually be quite useful here.

108
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,800
I'll read some of it to you. Let's kill some time.

109
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,380
"The general's manor used to be a pit of thousands of prisoners,"

110
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,350
"with millions of dead bodies buried underneath."

111
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,670
"It's full of evil spirits."

112
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,580
"The Demon General was the bane of others' existence, killing his three wives,"

113
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,460
"keeping them in the old house."

114
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,660
"They lived as his people, died as his ghosts,"

115
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,500
"never to reincarnate."

116
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,950
"It's been said that in that old house,"

117
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,750
"there are often sounds of a woman weeping bitterly."

118
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,230
Miss, don't read it anymore.

119
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,480
I won't be able to sleep at night.

120
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,100
This Chu Xiuming, he's using this handsome face of his tricked me in giving him my weak trust!

121
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,960
I can't believe I, Shen Jin, can't correct him!

122
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,940
Then, what do you plan on doing?

123
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,620
Since it's a wedding planned by the emperor, we still haven't achieved our wedding.

124
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,660
Tell me, if his fourth wife also dies.

125
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,380
then he can't report to the emperor anymore,

126
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,920
and confirms his Devil General nickname.

127
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,990
Then, shouldn't you also die?

128
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,590
I don't want miss! You can't die.

129
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,340
If you die, what is Rou Rou going to do?

130
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,240
Rou Rou can't die with you.

131
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,070
If you're dead, you are the General's wife,

132
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,690
then what is Rou Rou?

133
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,210
We can't write on Rou Rou's grave, General's wife's maid.

134
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,350
I still haven't taken my husband's name.

135
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,660
You're so panicky!

136
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,110
I was always so panicky. Panicky people live longer.

137
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,510
Moreover, if you're dead, you'd still need someone to handle everything.

138
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,410
There must be someone to burn money and incense for you.

139
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,350
Also, if you want to confirm Devil General's title,

140
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,400
there must be someone to talk about it for you.

141
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,480
Don't worry. Leave this to me!

142
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,250
I will definitely tell widely about your

143
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,250
wronged death and write it down in the annals.

144
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,560
What is this?

145
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,420
Poison.

146
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,540
Poison? How come do you have poison?

147
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,750
It's also what that Big head Zhang gave me to pay is debt.

148
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,120
It's said to be able to pretend death.

149
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,310
What's that real death, fake death? Is it that mysterious?

150
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,750
What are you doing? You can't eat it miss.

151
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,880
Fake death, real death. What if it's real death?

152
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,680
- Then dead it is. 
 - Miss!

153
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,820
Miss, how can you eat everything!

154
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,380
Don't swallow it! How come you're still swallowing it?

155
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,220
Spit it out! Miss! Miss!

156
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,840
You swallowed it?

157
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,990
Wait! I'm going to get a doctor!

158
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,690
Help! Help!

159
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,100
<i>Help! Help!</i>

160
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,090
<i>Quick! Help!</i>

161
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,480
Guard it strictly.

162
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,680
It's bad! It's bad!

163
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,040
Miss! Our miss ate poison!

164
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,010
- Quickly go get the doctor. 
 - Yes!

165
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,500
It's so hot, it's so hot!

166
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,650
Hurry and give me some breeze!

167
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,800
What's up with this fake death medicine?

168
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
It's so hot!

169
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,970
W-w-wind!

170
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,300
Why did my tongue turn numb?

171
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,400
W-w-wind!

172
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,200
What's going on with my tongue?

173
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,400
W-w-wind! Wind!

174
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,600
My tongue!

175
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,500
Coming again, coming again, you come every day!

176
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,400
Aren't you tired of coming every day?

177
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,700
Coming again, I'm not going to run away!

178
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,900
Leave with us! Or else!

179
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,400
The general sent you two?

180
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,200
I just took some medicine!

181
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,830
I'll be fine if a doctor comes!

182
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,400
Why do you have to force me to come with you?

183
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,300
Put that down, knives are dangerous!

184
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,600
Put it down, put it down!

185
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,000
Why are you so violent?

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,390
-Go!
-What are you doing?

187
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,610
Don't touch me you!

188
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,480
My husband the general... I!

189
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,400
-Go that way!
-Don't touch me!

190
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,700
It's dangerous! You're so mean.

191
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,720
I don't know the way, this place is so big!

192
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,100
How can I go?

193
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,000
You lead the way! Lead the way!

194
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,400
<i>Does she have connections with the Falcon Tribe?</i>

195
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,800
<i>Or is she a spy from court?</i>

196
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
<i>Is she a spy for both sides?</i>

197
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Why did Miss leave?

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,400
Didn't she just take some poison?

199
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,500
Go back and stay in the room. I'll go take a look.

200
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,200
Yes.

201
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,700
What's going on? I feel awful!

202
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,600
Hurry up!

203
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,600
This way!

204
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,700
Don't push me!

205
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,300
Hurry up!

206
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,200
Hurry up!

207
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Go on!

208
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,000
Fine, fine, let her rest for a bit.

209
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,700
Boss told us to abduct Chu Xiuming's new wife,

210
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,000
going back to threaten them for last time's disgraceful defeat.

211
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,200
We have successfully completed our mission today!

212
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,300
After we go back, let's first beat up this new wife!

213
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,500
We'll skin her face, whip her hard, taking revenge for our brothers.

214
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,400
Heroes can't resist a beauty!

215
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Chu Xiuming will do everything he can to save his wife!

216
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,000
When that happens...remember our trap!

217
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,300
Use her life to exchange for Chu Xiuming's life!

218
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,900
Shut up!

219
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,790
W-what's going on?

220
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,500
Wake up! Don't fake being dead!

221
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,720
T-t-this! She's dead!

222
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,100
Boss told us to capture her alive!

223
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,500
W-w-what should we do?

224
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,600
T-this!

225
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,560
I misunderstood you.

226
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,000
Get up and go home with me.

227
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,150
I misunderstood you.

228
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,400
You are not a spy from the Falcon Tribe.

229
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,800
You fell outside of my predictions, and lost your life.

230
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,790
I was wrong.

231
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,200
No matter what, you are still my wife.

232
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,270
Now you are dead.

233
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,600
You are filial.

234
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,000
You came here for your mother.

235
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I will take good care of your mother.

236
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I'll bring you back home.

Miss! Miss, say something!

00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,000
What's wrong, Miss?

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,900

Miss! Miss!

250
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,300
General! I heard someone from the Falcon Tribe broke in. How is the situation?

251
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,200
The two people from the Falcon Tribe dressed as soldiers

252
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,000
and broke into the manor to take away Lady.

253
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,000
-Lady is already...
<i>-Miss!</i>

254

Miss, don't abandon me!

-You-!
-Miss!

257
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Chu Xiuming, you do have some conscience!

258
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,600
This fake death medicine's effect is long and awful!

259
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,700
- You're saying... 
- I'm really...

260
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Why did you eat that fake death medicine?

261
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,600
What if you really died?

262
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,100
I wouldn't die, I wouldn't die.

263
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,300
That was awful!

264
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,800
Lady! I want something from you!

265
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,700
What?

266
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,800
This?

267
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
Precisely.

268
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
Here.

269
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,100
Thank you Lady.

270
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,000
Why do you want this?

271
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,600
Just give it to me!

272
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,400
Why should I give it just because you want it?

273
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
My apologies, Lady.

274
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,300
Give it back to me!

275
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,950
-Help! Men!
-Lady!

276
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,100

Miss Rou Rou!

286
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
-It's a misunderstanding, Miss Rou Rou!
-Stop right there!

287
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,700
Miss Rou Rou, it's all a misunderstanding!

<i>Lady, I want something from you.</i>

289

<i>Why do you want this?</i>

290
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,600
General, this is Lady's luggage.

294
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,600
Do you know that I am the Devil General?

295
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,200
On the battlefield, you are indeed the Devil General.

296
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,800
General. Is there a problem with this jade pendant?

297
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,100
Then what should we do with Lady?

298
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Once Lady wakes up, she'll continue making a fuss.

299
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,900
Perhaps she really does have what I want.

300
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,800
I will secretly observe everything Lady does.

301
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,250
At the right time, I must get something from her mouth.

302
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,580
Rou Rou.

303
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,750
Miss, you're awake?

304
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,420
What happened? Why did I pass out?

305
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,870
Did that devil king take my pendant? I'm going to ask him for it!

306
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,320
Miss! Miss!

307
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,970
Why is the door locked?

308
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,870
That big beard locked it. He's afraid we'll run away.

309
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,030
I begged him for half a day but it was useless.

310
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,930
That devil king is too petty!

311
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,440
Petty?

312
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,940
He underestimates me too much!

313
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,130
Continue.

314
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,900
There is nothing unusual among the Falcon Tribe troops.

315
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,450
However, I predict that they are preparing for an ambush.

316
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,520
Get ready for them.

317
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,220
Yes, General.

318
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,000
Lady's identity...?

319
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,080
Her actions are indeed strange.

320
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,960
I must continue investigating if she's a spy.

321
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,590
What should we do?

322
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,790
Continue watching her closely.

323
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,510
General. This lock was ingeniously created.

324
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,070
It was made by the successor to the Heaven Lock Sect.

325
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,230
There is no way Lady can escape this time.

326
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,580
He thinks small tricks like this can stop me?

327
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,040
As a child I could escape even a steel box when Chen Zi and Chen Jing locked me in there!

328
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,600

Where are you going?

331
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,860
You're going to ask the general for the jade pendant?

332
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,830
Will he return it just because I ask for it?

333
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,580
I can't beat him and I can't just steal it.

334
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,610
If I want the jade pendant, I can only get it myself!

335
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,450
Let me get revenge for this lock first!

336
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,380
We should completely be on guard.

337
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,840
We cannot give the Falcon Tribe any openings.

You want to lock me up with a flimsy lock?

341
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,920
Let me tell you! I openly walked straight out of my room!

342
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,110
You want to confine me? Not a chance!

343
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,440
Acknowledge your mistake and hand it back to the other.

344

I'm going to leave the manor and have some fun!

I'll get back at you once I'm not angry anymore!

Stop!

You were in the wrong first.

382
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,040
If you didn't use this flimsy thing to lock me, would I have locked you?

383
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,070
Lady...how did you open this heaven's lock?

384
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,420
That's easy!

385
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,850
It's so easy for you to open locks.

386
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,410
Before you married me,

387
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,620
have you had similar experiences?

388
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,020
It's all in the past, there's no need to bring it back up.

389
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,830
I'll only ask you one thing. His Majesty ordered to marry you as soon as I arrived.

390
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,860
But you keep dragging out time!

391
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,930
This is an insult to the emperor's decree!

392
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,780
I could send someone to report to the emperor and have you punished!

393
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,000
You are right, Lady.

394
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,050
This time, I have not made proper arrangements. It is my fault.

395
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,520
Please calm down first.

396
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,310
You want me to calm down? It's simple.

397
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,240
You just need to satisfy three requirements from me.

398
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,900
First, I can go in and out of the manor whenever I want.

399
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,940
Second, I must ride on your horse out of the city right now.

400
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,780
Don't worry, I won't run away.

401
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,160
Besides, your horse is so slow! I can't run away even if I wanted to.

402
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,010
Third...

403
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:44,240
I don't know yet. I'll tell you when I think of it.

404
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,300
I can agree to entering and leaving the manor at will.

405
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,450
But leaving the city on my horse...why do you want that?

406
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,410
I lost all face at the city gates today, I must get it all back!

407
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,170
I'm sure you wouldn't dare to run away.

408
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:05,040
If you run away...I'll kill Rou Rou.

409
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,400
I already said I won't run away, I just need to get back some face!

410
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,520
That's right, that's right, General!

411
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,150
Our Miss promised she definitely won't run away!

412
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,480
Alright. Then I will give my order right now.

413
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,630
I will have the guards at the gity gates let you pass.

414
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,610
Thank you General!

415
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,500
I forgot to tell you. I don't know how to ride.

416
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,960
General, you know how to ride, right?

Didn't you also say you don't know how to ride?

No! Who says I can't? I want to ride!

480
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,950
The kitchen always delivers these dishes.

481
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,830
I already told them to make some of the dishes you like.

482
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,420
But they always say it's expensive to send ingredients here!

483
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,320
How cheap!

484
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,220
I haven't been full ever since I came here.

485
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:59,030
Miss. Did something good happen when you went out riding?

486
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,580
Something good? No.

487
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:06,190
However, we can go wherever we want in the manor now! We can go outside too!

488
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,560
This is great! I never imagined that this general looks really cruel and mean,

489
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,620
but he's not a bad person!

490
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,530
How is he not bad? You heard it yourself.

491
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:18,820
He said if I run away, he'll kill you!

492
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,880
I heard nothing!

493
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,860
Don't worry, I won't run away.

494
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,570
Let's live well here!

495
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,850
There's nothing bad now anyway.

496
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,110
Miss. You've changed.

497
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,530
How so?

498
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,560
I became prettier?

499
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,890
To say it in Second Miss's words,

500
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,790
your heart has been moved! 
<i>(she fell in love)</i>

501
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,070
Rou Rou. Eat some more vegetables.

502
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,410
You need to grow taller. Once cold, the dishes aren't tasty anymore.

503
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,300
That's right, Miss. Did you get your jade pendant back?

504
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,150
I was having so much fun I forgot!

505
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,550
Tomorrow. I'll get it back tomorrow for sure.

506
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,350
This squash is really good!

507
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,240
Lady! Come in.

508
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,040
General, have some tea, have some tea!

509
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,760
Just be frank with me.

510
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,200
General.

511
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,690
Can you give my jade pendant back to me?

512
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,330
Where did you get this from?

513
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,280
My mother.

514
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,730
Then when your mother gave it to you, did she say anything to you?

515
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,970
<i>He looks so anxious.</i>

516
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,440
<i>There must be something he wants!</i>

517
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,170
Let me think about it.

518
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,950
Well??

519
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,090
I can't remember!

520
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,400
This is no small matter. Lady, please think over it carefully.

521
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,540
<i>He really does want something.</i>

522
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,140
I'm lately suffering from hunger and cold. I'm feeling anxious.

523
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,970
My brain is going to go dead!

524
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,620
I must have something good to eat.

525
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,050
Perhaps I'll think of something.

526
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,490
-Then Rou Rou...
-Stop using Rou Rou to threaten me, okay?

527
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,690
I'll give you one day. You must remember.

528
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,960
How could one day be enough?

529
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,220
Then how many days do you want?

530
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,810
Three hundred!

531
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,230
Do you believe that I can have you killed in three days?

532
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,770
I-I believe you...

533
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,160
Of course I believe that.

534
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,420
But the more you scare me, the foggier my brain gets!

535
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,310
Then what do you want?

536
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,710
Mend accordingly to the problem!

537
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,600
If I'm starving, give me something good to eat!

538
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,900
If I'm tired, serve me well!

539
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,560
Only then I can properly recover.

540
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,330
You want to know, I then can know without reserve, speak all I don't know of!

541
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,920
It's say all you know and say it without reserve.

542
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,040
That's all about the same!

543
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,030
I'll tell you everything, okay?

544
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,370
-Bao Zitou!
-Yes!

545
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,810
General.

546
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,860
Satisfy all of her requests for food and clothing.

547
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,310
Yes.

548
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,600
I'll only give you three days.

549
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,710
You must keep your word! Then I won't be holding back!

550
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,630
Bao Zitou, let's go!

551
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,680
Miss, hurry and eat!

552
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,130
Come and eat with me!

553
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,880
Then I'll eat!

554
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:47,950

555
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,770

557
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,910
Bao Zitou, I just wanted to ask.

558
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:16,670
Um...what is the punishment for stealing a military horse?

559
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,210
Beaten fifty times.

560
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,220
Then...what about stealing the general's horse?

561
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,920
Then that person will be beaten 100 times.

562
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,010
What if that person steals General's horse and then runs away?

563
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,140
Beat that person until he dies.
