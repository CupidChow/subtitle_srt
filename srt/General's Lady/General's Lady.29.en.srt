Lord Situ!

21
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,080
It is me.

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,320
- Chu Xiuming? <br> - Greetings My Lord.

23
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,030
Wait... you— Aren't you a wanted criminal?

24
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,170
I know.

25
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,770
You...You... How could you come here?

26
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,640
I have a request.

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,530
You still cannot come to my place!

28
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,000
What am I supposed to do?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,290
Nine generations of my family will be killed for hiding you!

30
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,350
If I capture you, how can I face my little sister?

31
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,430
Aren't you making things hard on me?

32
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,360
Lord Situ, have you heard of a type of gold nugget that's stored in a glass orb

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,740
and can change its shape?

34
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,220
A gold nugget?

35
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,940
A gold nugget that can change its shape...

36
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,570
I've never heard of it before. I do not know!

37
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,500
Such a rare item. It sounds quite nice.

38
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,670
Where can I find it?

39
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,960
Then have you ever heard of the accident that happened sixteen years ago?

40
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,750
Sixteen years ago?

41
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,020
I did not hear about it. I do not know.

42
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,790
I do not know anything. I do not know.

43
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,510
My Lord, if you know, can you tell me?

44
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,450
I will be forever grateful!

45
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,360
I already told you I do not know. I do not know anything!

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,710
Just take pity on this old man!

47
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,590
Don't try dragging me into this anymore!

48
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,320
I will lose my head!

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,710
You... Leave! Go, go, go!

50
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,220
I will pretend... I never saw you!

51
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,830
I have overstepped my boundaries.

52
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,070
Such a rare item.

53
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,320
I have to ask the head eunuch who was in charge of purchases.

54
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,780
It's a shame, he has already retired.

55
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,090
But I heard he built a house in the capital.

56
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,870
He was going to live out his days in the capital.

57
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,500
Tomorrow, I will go ask.

58
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,540
Thank you, My Lord!

59
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,570
Sister Ruonan, I'm begging you!

60
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,220
Can you let me see my miss soon?

61
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,180
Rou Rou, just what is going on?

62
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,860
I really cannot tell you.

63
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,600
Then, just wait a few more days.

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,550
Once things have calmed down, I will find a way to take you there.

65
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,100
No!

66
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,760
You cannot wait even a few days?

67
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,150
A life is in danger, I cannot wait a moment longer!

68
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,240
Miss!

69
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,640
- Miss! <br> - Slow down, Rou Rou!

70
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,050
- Miss! Mis-- <br> - Slow down! Rou Rou!

71
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,040
Rou Rou, be careful!

72
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,510
- Rou Rou, can't you be a little more steady on your feet? <br> - You're so careless.

73
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,000
I was too happy to see you!

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,760
Hurry and tell your miss why you needed to see her so badly.

75
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,370
Oh, no!

76
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,040
I didn't hurt my baby, did I...

77
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,490
<i>I bought it at the shop up ahead.</i>

78
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,290
<i>Your clothes are so pretty.</i>

79
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,220
<i>Really? I just had it made.</i>

80
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,440
<i>Really? No wonder.</i>

81
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,540
<i>Buns! Buns for sale!</i>

82
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,780
<i>Hurry!</i>

83
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,940
Hurry!

84
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,420
Hurry and follow closely!

85
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,620
You're pregnant?! When did that happen?

86
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,830
Not so loud, Miss! I still have my reputation!

87
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,240
You're worried about your reputation?

88
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,140
- If you cared about your reputation, why would you do something like that? <br> - I know, I know.

89
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,610
So I came to find you right away, right?

90
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,530
You are my only family member.

91
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,220
That is why I came to talk with you immediately.

92
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,050
Where is that bastard, Xiao Su?

93
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,140
He does not know yet!

94
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,660
Miss! Do not blame him!

95
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,330
I did it willingly.

96
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,610
This is all my fault.

97
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,900
Because I could not bear to let you go,

98
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,470
that's why you still aren't married to Xiao Su. It is my fault.

99
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,140
How could I blame you?

100
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,220
I do not want to leave you either!

101
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,110
I do not blame you!

102
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,190
Sister Ruonan, do you know where Xiao Su is now?

103
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,800
Xiuyuan can probably contact him.

104
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,420
Then I will have to trouble Xiuyuan to bring that fiend, Xiao Su, here!

105
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,330
What are you going to do?

106
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,240
Put on a wedding!

107
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,950
All right!

108
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,750
Miss... the wedding is not important.

109
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,600
Rou Rou, you are my closest little sister.

110
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,180
I do not want you to have any regrets.

111
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,490
I have you and Su Su.

112
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,960
I am very happy!

113
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,860
Then let's make you even happier!

114
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,490
I want Rou Rou to be the happiest bride!

115
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,410
Miss, you are so good to me.

116
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,130
Then, wouldn't the wedding be a little rushed?

117
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,170
Drink...

118
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,190
Follow closely!

119
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,240
Go!

120
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,120
You do not need to be like this.

121
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,250
It's all your fault that you offended the one person you shouldn't offend the most in the world.

122
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,140
You cannot blame anyone. Just blame your bad fate.

123
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,760
Spare me! Spare me!

124
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,290
Commander Yun, our next step—

125
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,100
Do not use my title when we're outside the palace. The walls have ears.

126
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,690
Yes, Sir.

127
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,960
<i>I already told you I do not know, I do not know anything!</i>

128
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,430
<i>Just take pity on this old man!</i>

129
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,860
<i>Do not pull me into this anymore! I could be beheaded for this!</i>

130
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,150
<i>You... Leave! Go, go, go! </i>

131
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,590
<i>I will pretend... I never saw you!</i>

132
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,020
<i>Could it really be the emperor...</i>

133
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,360
Keep a good eye on him. I will go back and report first.

134
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,220
Bring him over tonight after I return.

135
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,100
Yes, Sir.

136
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,100
- You two, take him over there! <br> <i> - Yes, Sir!</i>

137
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,660
<i>Move faster!</i>

138
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,970
Brother Chu, where are you taking me in such a rush?

139
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,260
I cannot tell you!

140
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,440
Miss Ruonan, where are we going?

141
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,270
I cannot tell you!

142
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,500
You cannot tell me?

143
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,620
Rou Rou, I'm finally going to marry you off.

144
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,210
I really cannot bear to see you go.

145
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,600
Miss, I am not being married off.

146
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,850
- It is marrying into this family. <br> - What?

147
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,960
I am marrying Su Su into this family!

148
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,290
From now on,

149
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,430
Su Su and I will stay by you and General for life.

150
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,060
Wherever you two go, we will go too.

151
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,180
We have to see this entire world together

152
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,800
and watch the flowers bloom and fall.

153
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,950
But I do not even know where he is,

154
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,890
or what he is doing.

155
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,130
How can we see the world together and watch the flowers bloom and fall?

156
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,900
That's right, Miss.

157
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,140
Where is the general? Why haven't I seen him?

158
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,940
Come.

159
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,170
How pretty!

160
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,110
<i>I hope... it isn't you.</i>

161
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,940
Brother Chu! Brother Chu! This is too rushed!

162
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,590
Brother Chu! This is about getting married!

163
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,000
This is too rushed!

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,120
- Why? <br> - Why!

165
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,140
You did that and you're asking why?

166
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,420
Are you not willing to marry Rou Rou?

167
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,890
Of course, I am willing to marry Rou Rou! But I didn't prepare anything!

168
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,110
You don't need to prepare. We've prepared everything for you.

169
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,420
I— How could I not prepare?

170
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,480
I still haven't proposed to Rou Rou! That is too disrespectful to her!

171
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,710
You'd best be obedient;

172
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,950
or else, Sister-in-Law will show you proper respect!

173
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,360
Sister-in-Law is furious over what you did!

174
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,760
I... I...

175
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,740
What did I do?

176
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,650
Rou Rou, Look! I brought you your wedding gown!

177
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,590
- Come and take a look. <br> - Sister Ruonan!

178
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,410
Take a look!

179
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,800
Hurry and look!

180
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,200
How beautiful!

181
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,980
You could find such a nice wedding gown on such short notice?

182
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,850
Rou Rou, your miss prepared this a long time ago;

183
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,860
or else, how could we just happen to find a gown that fits you?

184
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,200
Miss!

185
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,630
All right, the bride cannot cry!

186
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,380
Hurry and take a look!

187
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,290
Rou Rou, this wedding is a bit rushed.

188
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,940
If not for everything that has happened recently,

189
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,420
I would have had you married a long time ago!

190
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,960
The thing I want to see most is you getting married.

191
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,290
I hope nothing will go wrong. Let's not have any more regrets.

192
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,820
Oh, what am I saying!

193
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,390
Why do I feel like an old mother marrying off her daughter?

194
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,670
Miss. Sister Ruonan.

195
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,980
I have something to tell you.

196
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,720
I might not be pregnant.

197
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,010
- What! <br> - What!

198
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,690
Do not be angry at me.

199
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,720
- Ruonan... <br> - Hmm? <br> - Why do I feel like this brat tricked us into granting a marriage?

200
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,240
Rou Rou, did you...

201
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,570
Me?

202
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,530
Brother Xiuyuan, look! This outfit fits me quite well!

203
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,260
My clothes!

204
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,590
Brother Xiuyuan! Why are you treating me like this?

205
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,890
Are you Eunuch Shi?

206
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,450
Do not talk. I will save you.

207
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,160
Surround them!

208
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,530
Hurry!

209
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,960
Surround them! Hurry!

210
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,360
<i>How did they come so quickly?</i>

211
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,080
<i>Could it be... they were waiting for me?</i>

Xiao Su, the three of us have been friends since childhood.

218
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,020
I wouldn't have kept Rou Rou at my side for so long if not for that promise I made you.

219
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,240
Now... I will return her to you.

I hope you will love her, trust her, guard her, protect her.

Do not worry.

Rou Rou, I only want you to live a simple life.

225

I want you to be a person who is not sad.

I want you to be together with Su Su forever.

I understand!

230
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,590
Rou Rou...

231
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,220

234

They can only disappear within your memories.

235
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,460
Miss, what did you just say?

236
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,380
What does that mean?

237
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,710
Uh... I want Su Su to read to you some more books!

238
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,320
Don't be a foolish girl all your life!

239

- General, you are finally back! <br> - General!

267
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,430
What's wrong? What happened?

268
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,190
General! Miss left!

269
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,440
She went to admit her guilt!

270
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,750
When did that happen? How could this happen? What were you doing?

271
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,660
General, do not panic! Xiuyuan and Xiao Su have returned to check in the city.

272
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,920
They should be back soon.

273
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,710
I thought she was tired and went to rest last night, so I did not bother her.

274
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,910
When I came to find her this morning, she was gone!

275
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,320
She only left behind this letter!

276
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,750
<i>[I've already entered the Palace to admit my guilt. Please do not worry about me.]</i>

277
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,990
- All right, all right. <br> - Just this? Did she leave anything for me?

278
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,280
How are things? Did you find her?

279
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,500
No. We asked the guards at the gate. Sister-in-Law did not appear.

280
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,630
Could Jin'er have disguised herself and gone in during the night?

281
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,870
Last night, a group of imperial guards went outside.

282
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,660
I do not know what they went to do.

283
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,310
<i>You do not need to be like this. It's your fault that you offended the one person who shouldn't be offended the most in the world.</i>

284
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,380
<i>Commander Yun, our next step— </i>

285
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,810
<i>Do not use my title when we're outside the palace. The walls have ears.</i>

286
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,240
Could it really be him?

287
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,080
General, I wonder if we are thinking of the same person?

288
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,280
General, there is something I wonder if I should say.

289
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,010
Hurry and speak!

290
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,510
No one else knows about your agreement with the emperor, right?

291
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,230
The emperor might be trying to kill two birds with one stone.

292
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,590
On the one hand, he can capture the rebel and on the other, he can take away your military power.

293
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,570
Do not forget.

294
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,210
The emperor's order was to kill with no mercy.

295
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,330
I am entering the palace!

296
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,710
Whether it is Jin'er turning herself in or the emperor having her captured,

297
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,510
she should be in the emperor's hands!

298
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,420
- Brother, I will go with you! <br> - You cannot!

299
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,040
The matter is between His Majesty and me. Do not get yourself involved!

300
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,310
On the surface, you belong to the Chu Family Army.

301
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,340
If I do not make it back, you must take good care of the army for me!

302
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,310
- Brother, but— <br> - There are no buts!

303
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,670
<i>I will go with you.</i>

304
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,320
No one is more suitable to go with you than me.

305
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,220
I want to see how he is going to face his Eighth Elder Brother.

306
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,180
It might not be a bad thing for Eighth Prince to appear.

307
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,610
If he really is investigating what happened,

308
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,450
then my appearance will not be wrong.

309
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,280
If he is the main culprit,

310
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,300
then my appearance will be even better.

311
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,990
I will have to trouble you, Uncle.

312
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,500
Wait for news from me. I will go arrange for you two to enter the palace.

313
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,950
Do not worry. I will be fine.

314
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,620
All right, go back.

315
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,760
Yes.

316
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,750
Father, you have to keep your word!

317
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,960
All right.

318
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,320
Go on now.

319
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,310
An'er,

320
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,730
if something really happens to me this time,

321
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,330
do not be too sad.

322
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,600
Take it as fulfilling my wish to be with your mother.

323
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,840
Promise me. You must live well with Ruonan.

324
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,450
Hurry up!

325
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,000
<i>Chief Liu.</i>

326
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,490
Sirs, looks like you're all pretty busy.

327
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,120
What took you so long? Hurry up!

328
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,300
Eunuch Da was just wondering why the flowers were so slow today.

329
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,190
We will hurry!

330
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,020
<i>Did you all hear that? Put some strength into it!</i>

331
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,820
That's right. I will go with you.

332
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,200
Or else, you will surely be scolded.

333
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,680
All right, all right. Our thanks to you Lord Xiao.

334
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,840
- Go on. <br> - Let's go!

335
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,700
Be careful!

336
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,280
Those in the back, follow closely!

337
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,690
Hey, how can flowers be placed there?

338
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,780
Move them that way! I'm talking to you!

339
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,430
You! This way!

340
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,150
- What is wrong with you all? <br> - Hurry up!

341
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,420
You are so slow today!

342
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,910
If the superiors blame us, I will not let you off lightly!

343
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,340
Eunuch Da, we won't mess things up for you.

344
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,260
We will deliver the flowers right away!

345
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,270
Hurry up!

346
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,020
- Eunuch Da. <br> - Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

347
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,750
Isn't this Lord Xiao?

348
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,230
Send me a few more people. I will take the emperor's flowers over.

349
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,870
All right!

350
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,460
I'll take these two. Come on.

351
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Stop!

352
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,170
- What is wrong? <br> - I will take a look first.

353
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,610
Lift your head.

354
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,590
Is there a problem?

355
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,770
What is wrong with you?

356
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,400
- What's wrong? <br> - He... He is so ugly!

357
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,870
He might scare the emperor!

358
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:42,120
Eunuch Da, just tend to your own business and don't interfere with other things.

359
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,440
- Let's go! <br> - Well...

360
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,890
What's wrong with Lord Xiao today?

361
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,160
What are you all looking at? Get back to work!

362
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,540
- Do you all understand? Hurry up, hurry up. <br> - You're all dillydallying so much.

363
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,190
Everything is going according to plan.

364
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,800
Do you have news of Jin'er?

365
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,670
No.

366
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,530
Lord Xiao, if anything happens to Xiuming and I,

367
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,640
you must tell Xiuyuan to flee.

368
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,180
Yes.

369
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,220
Xiao Su, you don't need to stay with us. We know where to go.

370
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,400
Go and prepare your things.

371
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,850
Then you two be careful.

372
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,440
All right.

373
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,100
- This is... <br> - This rare item...

374
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,680
I looked everywhere to get it and brought it especially for Your Majesty!

375
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,750
This item looks so familiar.

376
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,510
General Chu... Oh, no, no.

377
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:48,930
I should say, Chu Xiuming, once mentioned this item to me.

378
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,740
I thought it was a fresh idea.

379
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,010
So I found it, especially for Your Majesty.

380
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,520
Then I will take my leave first.

381
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,400
You may leave.

382
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,880
- Greetings, Your Majesty. <br> - Greetings, Your Majesty.

383
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,680
You may rise.

384
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,920
Chu Xiuming!

385
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,650
Your Majesty, take a look at who this is.

386
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,520
This commoner greets Your Majesty.

387
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,520
Are you... Eighth Elder Brother?

388
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,930
Eighth Elder Brother!

389
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,920
I never imagined Your Majesty would still remember me.

390
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,860
Glass orb?

391
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,260
The criminal Chu Xiuming has snuck into the palace to harm His Majesty!

392
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,680
Go in and see if they're all dead yet!

393
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,170
Yes!

394
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,460
General Chu? You made it out?

395
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,110
I was just about to go in to see you.

396
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,420
Lord Situ, are you satisfied now?

397
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,630
Everything went as you wished. The emperor is dead.

398
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,980
He is dead?

399
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,430
You killed the emperor! What should we do?

400
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,270
Stop acting now.

401
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,340
There are no outsiders here.

402
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,130
How do you know if these are my people?

403
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,230
General Chu... Oh no, no.

404
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,170
Criminal Chu Xiuming!

405
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,640
You are quite smart!

406
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,210
Jin'er is in your hands, too?

407
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,090
Brother Xiuming, I did not want to do this!

408
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,370
But you forced me until there was nothing I could do!

409
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,010
Besides, it's just too bad you're so young.

410
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,920
This person killed the emperor!

411
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,820
Kill without mercy!

412
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,400
Kill Chu Xiuming! I will reward you heavily!

413
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,770
Attack!

414
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,450
All of you, attack!

415
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,430
Attack!

416
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,320
Kill him! Kill him! Attack!

417
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,510
Kill him! Kill him!

418
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,570
You came just in time! Hurry and kill this criminal, Chu Xiuming!

419
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,490
Kill him!

420
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,520
Xiao Su!

421
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,250
Xiao Su and that Chu Xiuming are co-conspirators!

422
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,270
All of you, arrest them both!

423
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,050
Let's see who dares!

424
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,680
I am the prime minister!

425
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,640
He is just the head of the Imperial Guard!

426
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,650
All of you think carefully! Who will you listen to?

427
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,160
If you want to survive, hurry and capture them!

428
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,510
Lord Situ! Do you really intend... to rebel?

429
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,670
The rebels are you, Xiao Su, and him, Chu Xiuming!

430
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,780
Who is the rebellious one!

431
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,410
I...

432
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,580
<i>Come.</i>

433
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,620
<i>Your Majesty. Uncle. Are you both all right?</i>

434
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,060
<i>How could this be?</i>

435
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,420
<i>That glass orb again!</i>

436
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,560
<i>Situ?</i>

437
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,250
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

438
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,810
<i>I'm willing to trust you. Are you willing to trust me?</i>

439
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,070
<i>Why should I not?</i>

440
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,980
<i>Much gratitude, Your Majesty.</i>

441
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,670
I clearly sent away all the Imperial Guard!

442
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,240
How did you come so quickly?

443
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,440
That is because we knew long ago that someone was watching me!

444
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,980
That's why we decided to give you a taste of your own medicine.

445
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,840
<i>General.</i>

446
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,580
<i>There is something I wonder if I should say.</i>

447
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,120
<i>Hurry and speak!</i>

448
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,600
<i>No one knows about your agreement with the emperor, right?</i>

449
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,180
<i>The emperor might be trying to kill two birds with one stone.</i>

450
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,980
<i>I want to enter the palace!</i>

451
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,570
You! When did you start suspecting me?

452
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:48,170
You told me you were going to ask Eunuch Shi about the glass orb's origin.

453
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,820
The rest of the events that followed were too much of a coincidence.

454
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,720
You led me step-by-step into suspecting His Majesty!

455
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,700
It is like everything was perfectly prepared for me to see!

456
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,640
That is because you were too stupid!

457
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,670
I was afraid if I did not make it more obvious, you would not understand!

458
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,190
Then I must thank you, Lord Situ!

459
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,650
You were the one who gave me that glass orb back then, right?

460
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,370
You told me to give it to Eighth Elder Brother,

461
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,180
so I could become closer with Eighth Elder Brother!

462
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,380
Eighth Elder Brother!

463
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,100
Were you injured by that thing back then?

464
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,550
Situ!

465
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,210
So it was you who harmed my entire family!

466
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,020
I did not want to!

467
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:42,090
You kept investigating the military funds back then. You kept coming at me.

468
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,690
When they told me you were still alive, I was so startled!

469
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:52,400
Eighth Prince who was so awe-inspiring back then has actually declined to such a degree!

470
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,480
Situ!

471
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,460
I will kill you right now if you keep talking nonsense!

472
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:03,810
Chu Xiuming, do you really think you won?

473
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:08,410
Do not forget! Shen Jin is still in my hands!

474
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:12,760
If I die, that woman will not live for long either!

475
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,470
Where did you hide Jin'er?

476
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,200
Do you think I'm a fool?

477
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,450
Will I tell you?

478
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,280
Is there anyone there?

479
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,300
