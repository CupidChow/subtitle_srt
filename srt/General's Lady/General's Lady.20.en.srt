00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,820
Younger Sister Jin.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,740
If you are leaving, then take me with you.

21
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,990
I was the one who brought you here. I've let you suffer.

22
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,840
Younger Sister Jin, if you've been mistreated, please let me know.

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,710
Since you said that then I will be frank, Brother-in-Law.

24
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,590
Is that Yun Niang your younger cousin?

25
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,960
She is.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,470
Is she your concubine?

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,090
Yun Niang is indeed my concubine.

28
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,420
Yun Niang, since you have offended Younger Sister Jin, shouldn't you quickly apologize?

29
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,850
General's Lady! It's all this little woman, who overestimated their capabilities and offended you. <i>(This little woman (小女子) – humble third-person pronoun used when talking about oneself.)</i>

30
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,850
If you must blame someone, then blame it all on this little woman.

31
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,490
It has absolutely nothing to do with the manor of the Marquis of Yongle!

32
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,310
Yun Niang is pregnant.

33
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,840
Since she has already apologized, please allow her to get up, General's Lady.

34
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,710
That's right. Yun Niang, hurry and get up. Don't harm the child.

35
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,970
Here.

36
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,310
Brother-in-Law, there is something I want to ask you.

37
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,350
Go ahead.

38
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,560
Why do I seem to recall that only nobility who are conferred as Dukes or higher <i>(He is only a marquis, a rank lower than a duke.)</i>

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,650
could have concubines?

40
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,550
Younger Sister Jin, in this, I am at fault.

41
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,930
My Young Miss is a noble concubine, so she's naturally different from other concubines.

42
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,820
What nonsense are you spouting?

43
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,540
Madam, please do not be angry. That was what the Heir Apparent said himself.

44
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,700
What an arrogant maidservant!

45
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,850
Wouldn't her mistress be even more impressive, then?

46
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,100
Her Ladyship is present, what is this nonsense you are spouting? Slap your own mouth!

47
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,960
Please don't, Aunt. <br> <i> (T/N: One's mother's elder sister.)</i>

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,010
She's been with me ever since I was little. My mother handpicked her for me.

49
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,390
Just spare her this once. I beg of you.

50
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,930
What rubbish is this servant girl saying?

51
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,980
Your status is so lowly, you won't be able to bear the responsibility after shooting your mouth off like that!

52
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,370
I only wish... that I'll be able to remain by Elder Cousin's side.

53
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,180
I am even willing to be a maidservant!

54
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,590
I'm begging you, Your Ladyship.

55
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,440
Younger Sister Jin, I am to blame.

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,130
Another day, I will host a special banquet and invite you and Third Younger Brother-in-Law so I can apologize with wine.

57
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,860
Yun Niang is pregnant, why don't you just let it go for today?

58
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,770
Brother-in-Law, forget about apologizing.

59
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,950
It's just that this Yun Niang does not understand the rules.

60
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,780
If the child is educated by her when it's born, wouldn't that be a scandal?!

61
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,520
My Lady, please rest assured.

62
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,110
I will certainly educate my child properly.

63
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,670
That's right, that's right. Don't worry, My Lady.

64
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,140
I will surely teach this child well.

65
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,990
Madam, you are getting old. I'm afraid you may not have the energy for it.

66
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,940
Besides, etiquette isn't something that can be learned in a day or two.

67
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,450
Those of us from the Rui Royal Manor learned the rules from those in the palace since we were little.

68
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,010
Amongst all of my sisters, Elder Sister Shu is the most educated and reasonable.

69
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,820
Elder Sister Shu is the most suitable person to raise the child.

70
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,770
Younger Sister Jin, I do want a child,

71
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,540
but the child's biological mother is around. How could I dare?

72
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,000
Shu'er is the most filial.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,480
I was thinking that it was because she wasn't paying attention that her child was aborted.

74
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,620
It's inevitable that she would feel hollow and long for her child.

75
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,080
I was also thinking of letting Shu'er raise the child once the child was born.

76
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,170
Abortion?

77
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,470
Why didn't you notify the Rui Royal Manor about such a significant matter?

78
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,600
In any case, her child would've been a legitimate grandchild of the Rui Royal household!

79
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,700
Why on earth didn't you tell us?

80
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,870
My Lady! This is the Heir Apparent's first child.

81
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,420
Naturally, the child should be raised by you.

82
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,530
Since Yun Niang has agreed to it, then please rest assured, General's Lady.

83
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,990
We will take good care of Yun Niang during her pregnancy.

84
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,070
Madam, this Yun Niang has been living in the manor for a long time.

85
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,990
It would be impossible to publicly disclose the matter of her becoming a concubine.

86
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,140
However, she is your relative after all.

87
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,880
This child is also Eldest Brother-in-Law's flesh and blood.

88
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,260
After she's given birth, why don't you give her a sum of money,

89
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,990
marry her off back to her hometown, and forget about the whole matter?

90
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,640
Elder Cousin! I am your woman, too!

91
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,020
How could I marry someone else?

92
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,630
Younger Sister Jin, you make a fair point.

93
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,930
But... Yun Niang is pregnant with my flesh and blood after all. I–

94
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,140
Eldest Brother-in-Law, you may disregard your own official career,

95
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,650
but you cannot disrespect the reputation of the Rui Royal Manor!

96
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,820
If my husband Chu Xiuming were to be implicated in your mess, I cannot predict how he will take matters into his own hands.

97
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,830
General's Lady, you're right. We will do as you say.

98
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,860
I know how difficult this must be for Madam and Eldest Brother-in-Law.

99
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,100
But fret not, I will leave this matter for Elder Sister Shu to handle.

100
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,850
I'm tired now so I'll be returning home first.

101
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,980
Let me send you off.

102
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,450
It'll be fine.

103
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,180
<i>[Yongle Manor]</i>

104
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,920
Younger Sister Jin, if it wasn't for you,

105
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,560
I really wasn't sure how I was going to live out the rest of my days.

106
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,320
Elder Sister Shu, stop being so courteous. You always looked out for me in the manor.

107
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,970
This small matter is nothing.

108
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,110
But I know that girl, Yun Niang, won't be willing to give up in regards to today's matter.

109
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,320
If she starts creating trouble again, come find me at any time.

110
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,490
To be honest, I'm not that adamant about wanting her child.

111
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,520
After today's commotion, I'm afraid Yun Niang will not be willing to give the child to me.

112
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,220
This child will become the eldest son of the Heir Apparent of the Marquis of Yongle when he's born.

113
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,610
Your mother-in-law and Eldest Brother-in-Law are hoping fervently for a son

114
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,890
thus they will definitely make sure that Yun Niang has peace of mind during the pregnancy.

115
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,050
If this malicious Yun Niang were to raise the child,

116
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,570
then the child would be bound to become a villain after he has grown up.

117
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,950
Why don't you let the child stay with you? I know you will definitely raise the child well.

118
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,420
You have a point there.

119
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,940
But Younger Sister, what I reminded you of before...

120
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,080
About having a child, you should start thinking about it.

121
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,430
All sorts of feelings are welling up in my mind after witnessing your family affairs.

122
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,290
Elder Sister, I will take your advice to heart.

123
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,090
I'm going to head back first.

124
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,630
<i>[Yongle Manor]</i>

125
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,110
Husband.

126
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,050
Jin'er.

127
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,270
This is a nourishing soup that I made especially for you. Hurry and drink it all.

128
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,760
Husband, you must be tired.

129
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,860
I'm not.

130
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,660
On the contrary, you must be tired from working to open the textile shop, Jin'er.

131
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,480
Lately, I've been busy with other things

132
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,970
so I can't help. I hope you are not angry.

133
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,370
How would I dare to be angry at you?

134
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,570
I should be at home taking care of you.

135
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,930
But because of the textile shop, I've been busy and neglected you, Husband.

136
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,140
Don't' be angry with me, Husband.

137
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,690
There's not even enough time for me to cherish you, how could I possibly be mad at you?

138
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,520
Husband. I have something to ask you.

139
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,920
Is there something in regards to the textile shop that is troubling you?

140
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,970
Jin'er, please ask. I will help you as much as I can.

141
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,850
I will naturally take care of the textile shop, you don't need to worry.

142
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,620
It's just... We have been married for a while now.

143
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,490
We spend every day like this together, is there anything you're tired of?

144
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,900
What kind of question is that? I feel like I don't even see you enough every day.

145
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,520
I wish I could have you by my side for every moment.

146
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,650
Then... Husband, do you want a son?

147
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,730
Having a son is definitely good,

148
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,300
but this isn't something we can have just because we want it.

149
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,940
You've been taking care of the textile shop recently so your body is fatigued.

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,590
How about we wait for the textile shop to be on the right track

151
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,360
and for your body to recuperate before having one? Is that okay?

152
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,710
Okay. I will listen to my husband.

This fabric, from embroidery to its color, is the most fashionable lately.

Why do they have such good business?

- Okay. <br> - Please. This way.

Miss, this treatment is not bad. I can also brew tea for our customers.

201
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,780
- Customers will definitely be happy! <br> - This is a first-class fabric that just came from Jiangnan.

This embroidery is also very popular right now.

204
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,270
- Many officials from the capital like to make their clothes from this material. <br> <i>- Is that so?</i>

205
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,460
- The price is also absolutely reasonable. <br> - Hey!

206
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,620
How much for this fabric?

207
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,450
Miss, that piece of fabric is fifty copper coins.

209
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,180

Miss, you really have great taste.

211
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:12,470
Miss, have a look. The embroidery on this, was all hand embroidered.

212
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,730
So the price is a little more expensive.

213
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,630
80 copper coins.

214
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,990
This fabric, at other textile shops, would cost 100 copper coins!

215
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,070
Why is it so cheap here? Are these clothes authentic?

216

All the fabrics in our shop are real.

Including the production and transportation costs,

their price is still 20% lower than ours.

231
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,090
From where are they making a profit?

232
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,290
How about we also lower our prices?

233
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,850
We've already set prices at their lowest since it is the grand opening.

234
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,550
If we lower the price even more, then we would have no profit.

235
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,640
Then that means we cannot compete with this textile shop.

You're Lord Jin from South street and I'm Brother Nan from North street.

Back then we were the bosses of the opposite ends of a street.

You... How come you are a girl?

247
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,130
You're Rou Rou?

248
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,900
Not seeing you for a few years, you're now a big girl.

249
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,610
Where did you go?

250
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,330
We agreed to go against the people on Changsheng Street together but then you suddenly disappeared.

251
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,480
Rou Rou and I looked for you for a very long time!

252
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,410
We even thought that you were in danger.

253
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,150
Back then, I was really poor and having a hard time in the street.

254
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,850
I encountered the Armed Escort Agency recruiting escorts, so I just happened to go with them to do the escorting.

255
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,710
I've really traveled all over the lands.

256
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,600
But you, on the other hand, seem to be

257
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,920
very well-dressed.

258
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,810
Miss is now the wife of Lord General Yongning.

259
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,810
Wife of a general?

260
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,250
That's great. That's really impressive.

261
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,800
Did you also come to buy fabric? Did you see anything you like?

262
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,310
It's a long story.

263
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,170
I opened this Jin'er Textile Shop across the street today.

264
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,980
But isn't it a coincidence? This store also newly opened today.

265
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,670
It stole all of my business. So I came to have a look.

266
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,150
Why are we talking while standing?

267
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,630
- Let's go sit somewhere. <br> - Yes, yes!

268
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,700
It's been such a long time since we met! Rou Rou, go get Su Su, too!

269
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,200
- Okay! <br> - Su Su is also here?

270
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,660
- Yes! <br> - Let's go, let's go.

271
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,670
- Let's go, let's go. <br> - Hurry.

272
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,620
I, Ruonan, thought no girl was any match for me until I met you.

273
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,290
She's a girl even more masculine than men!

274
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,220
Do you remember? Back then you came alone to South street to steal my territory.

275
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,130
She arrogantly said she could take on the three of us.

276
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,320
In the end, she got beaten up by us.

277
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,140
I remember! But back then Sister Ruonan was bald.

278
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,080
- I even thought she was a guy! <br> - What?!

279
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,670
That's not what I remember. Clearly, I beat the three of you.

280
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,130
Especially Rou Rou. I held her to the floor to beat her.

281
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,480
- How is that possible?! <br> - No, no.

282
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,930
- It wasn't like that back then. <br> - You remember it wrong!

283
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,860
Back then, it was Rou Rou who hit you more than a few times.

284
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,910
Also, how could I possibly let our Rou Rou get beaten?

285
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,960
Exactly!

286
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,350
It seems it was a lifetime ago.

287
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,150
- Thinking about it... Hasn't it been four to five years since we have seen Ruonan? <br> - Yes.

288
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,340
Back then, we wouldn't have known each other if we didn't fight. It really was a coincidence.

289
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,620
Being able to meet up again today is really fate.

290
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,670
A toast to this fate!

291
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,710
<i>Cheers!</i>

292
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,030
Ruonan, I, Lord Jin, am now the general's wife.

293
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,350
I'm no longer the little lackey who was always bullied in the street.

294
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,450
If there's anything, just tell me. If I can help you, then I'll definitely help you.

295
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,170
Lord Jin, we met again after such a long separation. It's already great that we're all still alive!

296
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,730
From now on, there won't be any difficulties. Only good things!

297
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,600
From now on, there won't be any difficulties, only good things?

298
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,700
Let's drink again to those words!

299
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,140
- Come on! <br> - Come on.

300
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,520
<i>Cheers!</i>

301
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm in such a good mood today!

302
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,170
Ruonan, come to my textile shop and choose some nice fabrics.

303
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,310
I'll have my seamstress make you a few nice clothes!

304
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:15,140
There's no need for that. Traveling around, what I'm wearing is enough.

305
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,140
It's not. I opened this shop not long ago.

306
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,760
I haven't even sold a piece of fabric.

307
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,600
Just take it as a blessing to me.

308
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,080
All right. That's fine.

309
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,400
But I must pay for the fabric. I can't let you suffer a loss.

310
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,110
All right. As you wish!

311
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,170
- Let's go! <br> - Let's go!

312
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,870
- Then you two go. <br> - Okay.

313
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,760
Come on.

314
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,890
I never thought that the one fighting with us back then was a girl!

315
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,320
I really miss that time.

316
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,830
Come on, Ruonan. Chose whatever you like!

317
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,590
I'll gift you whichever one you like.

318
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,870
Earlier you said you went to the shop across the street. How was it?

319
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,070
They sell the same fabrics as mine,

320
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,560
yet their prices are 20% lower than mine!

321
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,750
They stole all the business.

322
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,600
Why don't you lower your prices, too?

323
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,150
This fabric is of high quality.

324
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,240
If I lower my prices, then I can't earn any money.

325
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,630
So I suspect that there must be something fishy about this shop.

326
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,870
They must have used some underhanded tricks!

327
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,680
My Lady.

328
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,790
Lord Xiuyuan, what is it?

329
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,170
I'm on duty as a City Supervisor right now. I heard that the Imperial Palace is in the process of procuring a batch of fabric

330
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,420
but the price must go through a bid. I came by to inform you, Your Ladyship.

331
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,550
The Imperial Palace is procuring a batch of fabric?

332
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,700
What are the requirements for the bidding?

333
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,220
These three requirements of importance: price point, quality, and quantity.

334
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,290
If these three requirements are met, then the bid will be successful.

335
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,350
I'm very interested in this.

336
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,510
I won't lose to any other store when it comes to quality.

337
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,880
However... the remaining stock...

338
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,880
I really do have to replenish the stock from Jiangnan.

339
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,090
It's just the price!

340
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,680
The store opposite mine is selling at too low a price! I surely won't be able to beat them.

341
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,170
Your Ladyship, I have to notify every textile shop regarding the bid.

342
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,350
I have to go notify the shopkeeper of the shop across the street later.

343
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,480
Why don't I go with you? I shall go meet that shopkeeper.

344
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,150
Ruonan, wait for me here. I'll come back soon.

345
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,410
You guys don't need to go.

346
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,260
I already know.

347
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,390
What do you mean, "You already know?"

348
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,380
I'm the shopkeeper of the Ruonan Textile Shop across from here.

349
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,820
Ruonan.

350
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,820
Ruonan!

351
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,770
Lord Jin, I'll come back another day.

352
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,700
<i>[Ruonan Textile Shop]</i>

353
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,480
Wait a moment!

354
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,950
Lord, is there anything else?

355
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,510
- I have good tea inside. Why don't you go inside to have a seat? <br> - Okay.

356
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,910
Please.

357
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,000
<i>[Ruonan Textile Shop]</i>

358
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,750
That Wu Ruonan is clearly the shopkeeper of the "Ruonan Textile Shop" opposite mine,

359
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,700
but she didn't tell me?

360
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,850
She even tricked me into telling her information!

361
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,250
What is the meaning of this?

362
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,170
Does she think of me as a fool?

363
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,200
<i>I really like this color.</i>

364
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,390
<i>Yes, their shop is so cheap.</i>

365
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,770
<i>- It's quite nice.</i> <br> - Drink some tea.

366
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,290
Thank you.

367
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,010
My Lord, what is it that you want to tell me about the bid?

368
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,210
Miss, what is your full name?

369
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,310
Wu Ruonan. Just call me Ruonan.

370
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,190
Why do you have such an expression?

371
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,870
- I have a few questions to ask. <br> - Go ahead.

372
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,330
During the Wuxu period, you were about ten years old. Did you ever go to the forest by the border?

373
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,190
Ten years old?

374
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,730
Tell me.

375
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,820
That's right. That year, I went to make a delivery with my master.

376
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,730
It really is you! On a rugged mountain road in the forest, you met a little boy.

377
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,800
He almost fell down the cliff!

378
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,560
I think...

379
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,540
I think that did happen.

380
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,970
At that time, you helped him.

381
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,760
You used a whip with this pendant on it!

382
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,790
You tied it around that boy and saved his life.

383
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,680
<i>How could you be so careless?</i>

384
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,190
<i>If I didn't save you in time, you would have fallen down the cliff!</i>

385
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,980
<i>Thank you. What is your name?</i>

386
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,170
<i>- We are children of Jianghu. It was nothing, why dwell on it? <br> - Young Master! <br> (T/N: Jianghu means a society with loose structure and rules)</i>

387
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,890
<i>Young Master Xiuyuan!</i>

388
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,800
<i>Your family has probably come searching for you. Hurry and go back with your family.</i>

389
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,480
<i>- From now on, when you are alone, be more careful. Don't run around everywhere. <br> - Young Master!</i>

390
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,790
<i>Where are you going?</i>

391
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,650
<i>Children of Jianghu will, of course, travel in Jianghu.</i>

392
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:46,020
<i>I am the youngest armed escort in my agency. I have boundless prospects ahead of me!</i>

393
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,590
<i>Then will we meet again?</i>

394
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,360
<i>Let's follow fate!</i>

395
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,030
Ever since that moment that you saved me, in all these years,

396
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:26,150
I've been trying to find you in order to say thank you.

397
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,770
It was nothing. Why dwell on it?

398
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,950
I've saved countless little boys before.

399
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,750
From the moment I saw you as a child,

400
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,060
my heart was captured.

401
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,870
I...

402
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,850
I, Brother Nan, am a child of Jianghu.

403
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,360
I have no intention to love someone.

404
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,430
Please go back, My Lord.

405
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,260
Then I'll come to see you another day.

406
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,280
Such coincidences actually exist in this world!

407
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,200
A few days ago, I was preparing for the grand opening. Right?

408
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,290
I saw the shop across the street was doing the same thing!

409
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,980
Guess what they are selling.

410
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,470
Could it be that... they're selling fabric?

411
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,200
Exactly!

412
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,090
Also, their fabrics and mine

413
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,160
are about the same in quality, but theirs are 20% cheaper than mine!

414
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,840
Even more of a coincidence is

415
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,020
that this shop owner is the friend I used to play with on the street!

416
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,340
If she's selling it for cheap, then change your price.

417
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,310
I was just trying to run a small business.

418
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:07,110
For the grand opening, I intended to make small profits but sell a lot. My prices are already at their lowest.

419
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,730
If I lower them any further, I won't be able to get back my costs.

420
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,560
Looking at how worried you are, should I think of some ideas for you?

421
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,770
There is one thing that you can really help me with, Husband.

422
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,680
Go ahead.

423
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,780
Xiuyuan came today, too.

424
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,230
He mentioned that the royal palace is going to use a bidding process

425
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,080
to procure a batch of fabric.

426
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,330
But I can't beat her in terms of price.

427
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:37,200
Neither can I obtain a huge amount of funding in a short period of time

428
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,300
to acquire such a large batch of fabric to restock.

429
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,600
If you're worried about money,

430
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,450
I'll figure it out for you.

431
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,790
Money isn't the most important problem!

432
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:53,080
Husband, can you help me come up with an idea to get me this business deal?

433
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,010
I'm afraid I can't do that.

434
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,380
First, I cannot interfere with court procurements.

435
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,280
I can't step forward to help.

436
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,300
It's best that I don't come into contact with court matters in case I do anything to dissatisfy someone.

437
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,390
Secondly, Xiuyuan is a city supervisor,

438
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,610
but plays favoritism.

439
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,810
That is not how I do things.

440
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,190
Hearing those words makes me a bit upset,

441
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,060
but you are right.

442
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,920
I don't know how to talk well. Don't be angry, Jin'er.

443
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,480
Why would I be angry?

444
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,000
I should use my own effort to win the bid for this deal.

445
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,390
I should use my sincerity to get this business.

446
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,980
If you have any troubles in the future,

447
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,340
you must remember to vent to me about it.

448
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,010
Isn't that a certainty?!

449
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,260
If I don't come vent to you, who else would I vent to?

450
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,330
You're done talking now?

451
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,510
Let me take a good look at you.

452
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:31,080
Let me comfort myself by looking at the cause of my longing today.

453
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,640
If we lower our price by 20%,

454
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,050
only then will we be exactly the same as Ruonan from across the street.

455
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:02,150
But if I do that, our profits will become next to nothing.

456
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,060
If I want to get more stock,

457
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,910
then I have to use money from the manor to fill the deficit.

458
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,660
On top of the rent and other expenses...

459
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:14,420
Then... if this continues, is our textile shop going to shut down in one month?

460
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,110
Unless we get the business order from the royal palace!

461
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:23,310
Looks like I have to go beg our Xiuyuan.

462
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,950
Then, Miss, I will go out and get some customers.

463
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:37,180
Miss, isn't that Lord Xiuyuan?

464
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,210
- This... It is. <br> - It's him!

465
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,620
Recently, Jiangnan silks are selling well. There is very little left in inventory.

466
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,630
Have Brother Chen take people to escort another delivery of stock here.

467
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,020
Got it. I will go do that right now.

468
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,540
Wait.

469
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,940
What is Lord Xiuyuan looking at?

470
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,700
Does that mean Sister Nan also wants to compete in the bid for the business with the royal palace?

471
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:17,560
This escorted delivery will be a long journey. It would take at least two months to go there and come back.

472
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,960
If we get the business deal with the royal palace, I'm afraid I won't be able to deliver it all at once.

473
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,540
But we haven't gotten the deal yet, right?

474
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,320
How could we possibly wait for the bid to be over before restocking?

475
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,400
That would cause a delay and there may be some obstacles in between.

476
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,260
<i>How about this? Have Brother Chen transport all the goods back in a single trip this time.</i>

477
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,210
<i>Then, what about the money?</i>

478
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,340
<i>We have already split all the money we have earned.</i>

479
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,370
I— This—

480
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:46,290
I have some money saved. If I put all of it into this, it should be enough.

481
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,710
Go take care of it.

482
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,140
Okay, I'll get going then.

483
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,430
My Lord, are you here to buy fabric?

484
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,130
This is a gift for you, Miss Ruonan.

485
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,530
At my textile shop, there are many people who come and go. Since you are a city supervisor,

486
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,980
others will misunderstand that I am trying to gain favor with you.

487
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,700
You mean...

488
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,590
Regarding the bad, I have a question.

489
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,050
How about we meet at a tea house tomorrow and discuss this privately?

490
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:28,420
Let's do as you said. I'll get going now.

491
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,820
My Lord!

492
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,340
My Lord, please take this gift back with you.

493
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,620
You hold onto it.

494
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,890
I really cannot accept it.

495
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:56,660
This— Sister Ruonan is actually giving a gift to Lord Xiuyuan!

496
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,420
He also accepted it!

497
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,700
He's "turning his elbows outwards!"<br> <i>(T/N: help an outsider instead of the people close to him)</i>

498
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,400
This Xiuyuan clearly knows that I am locked in a deadly business battle with the shop across the street,

499
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,340
yet he dares to see them privately!

500
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,470
I will surely teach him a lesson, if he dares to favor them!

501
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,770
Rou Rou, go invite Xiuyuan over here!

502
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,210
I will go do that right now.

503
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,600
Xiuyuan.

504
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,000
I invited you over here to ask you about the bid.

505
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,950
Go ahead, Sister-in-Law.

506
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:44,650
Since you have informed all the city's fabric stores of the procurement by the royal palace,

507
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,230
then you should know which stores will be the most likely to secure the bid.

508
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,610
Can you tell me?

509
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,720
These past few days, I have indeed visited all the fabric shops. There actually are a few that are suitable.

510
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,660
But based on the quality and price, your store's chances are quite high.

511
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,110
And which other stores?

512
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,490
The store opposite you, Ruonan Textile Shop.

513
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,700
What prices are they offering?!

514
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,980
I'm afraid I can't tell you those details.

515
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,920
But I can share a little.

516
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,250
Her prices are the lowest. Sister-in-Law, just be prepared.

517
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,260
Xiuyuan, although I am your sister-in-law,

518
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,390
I don't want to make things difficult for you by asking you to favor me.

519
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:35,620
Ruonan is my friend but she is also my competitor.

520
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,470
I hope you won't lie and favor anyone. That is best.

521
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,250
Sister-in-Law, rest assured. That is a certainty. I've always been open and honest and won't be favoring anyone.

522
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,390
That is good, that is good. You can go now.

523
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,850
You don't have any other questions?

524
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,860
That's all.

525
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,330
I have a question then.

526
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,040
Go on.

527
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,220
Stop looking. There's been nobody for several days now. Go ahead.

528
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,310
What is a good gift to give to a woman?

529
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,660
Fabric!

530
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,530
They can make some new clothes. All women love that.

531
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,310
I, your sister-in-law, sell fabrics!

532
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,090
But, Xiuyuan, who are you giving a gift to?

533
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,500
To a girl I've known for a long time.

534
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,960
A girl you've known for a long time?

535
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,800
Does Chu Xiuming know about this? How come I don't know?!

536
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,530
Which family is the girl from? Tell me.

537
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,320
You two don't know each other. You two don't know each other.

538
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,710
Drink some water, don't choke.

539
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,220
You're even blushing, Xiuyuan!

540
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,850
Bring her here to my store on another day to select some fabrics.

541
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,230
I'll make her a set of nice clothes.

542
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,180
At the same time, let me see what kind of girl she is.

543
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,490
That's not very convenient, right?

544
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,860
Besides clothes, what else can you gift?

545
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,340
Cosmetic and perfume. Women also like cosmetics and perfume.

546
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,540
You can also gift hairpins and pendants.

547
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,860
Then I understand now.

548
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,510
But, Xiuyuan, don't be troubled.

549
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,460
I know it would not be appropriate if you were to go buy cosmetics and perfume.

550
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,270
But I can go buy them for you!

551
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,970
After I've bought it, you can then gift it to that girl. What do you think?

552
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,340
That would be best. I will give you the money later, Sister-in-Law.

553
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,440
Of course.

554
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:45,860
<i>[Yongning Manor]</i>

555
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,080
Husband, you're back?

556
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,770
Wife, you've opened a textile shop. How come you are looking at cosmetics and perfume?

557
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,050
Could it be that, because business is not good, you are preparing to switch industries?

558
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,580
I picked out all of these for your younger brother, Xiuyuan.

559
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,680
He said he wants to give a gift to a woman he has known for a long time.

560
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,790
I, as his sister-in-law, should definitely put in some more effort.

561
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,620
A woman he has known for a long time?

562
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,190
How come I never knew he had a woman he has known for a long time?

563
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,390
Of course, you wouldn't know!

564
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,100
Currently, Xiuyuan is a city supervisor! He is busy all day.

565
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,940
Getting to know a few officials' daughters is quite normal.

566
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,830
When would he have the time to tell you about everything?

567
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:47,130
Besides, Xiuyuan has also reached the age where he should start getting to know someone who could be his future wife.

568
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,750
Then he should tell us about it so we can scope them out on his behalf.

569
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,020
They all say that older brothers are like fathers. They really are not wrong!

570
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,590
Oh right! Jin'er, if you find out who the woman is that Xiuyuan is talking about,

571
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,630
you must tell me.

572
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,190
I got it, Lord Older Brother!

573
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,840
Also, you are busy all day. You need to remember to rest properly.

574
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,960
I know my husband dotes on me.

575
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,040
But I must do what I already promised others I would do.

576
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,100
Not to mention, it's Xiuyuan's matter!

577
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,610
Okay, my wife. It is already late.

578
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,450
I'm also tired. Let's rest early.

579
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,310
Tomorrow's matters can be left for tomorrow to do.

580
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:30,100
This is an order. Do you hear me?

581
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,950
Since the Lord General has made an order, then following his orders is the sincerest form of respect.

582
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,290
Let's go.

583
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,890
Husband, I have a question for you.

584
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,490
What is it?

585
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,990
Come, let's sit down.

586
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,730
Regarding the procurement by the royal palace, the prices that Ruonan and I offer are at an advantage.

587
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,510
But at the moment, I do have a troublesome matter.

588
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,220
If I do get the business deal, I need to deliver the goods as soon as possible.

589
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,670
But the source for these fabrics is very far from the capital.

590
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,600
This land and water transportation would also require quite a lot of time.

591
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,850
Are you thinking of purchasing the order in advance?

592
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,750
Yes, I am indeed considering that.

593
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,780
But if we fail to get the bid, I would have acquired an abundance of fabric.

594
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,580
I'm afraid it will be difficult to sell it all in a short amount of time.

595
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,500
Jin'er, your concern is reasonable.

596
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,220
Then, other than customers who come to your shop, are there any other customer streams?

597
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,540
Last time, when I delivered clothes to Xiuyuan, it reminded me of something.

598
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,940
The Rui Royal Manor uses a lot of fabric every year.

599
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,770
In the capital, there are quite a few high-ranking officials!

600
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:55,250
I was thinking, can my textile shop specifically supply them with fabric?

601
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,650
Jin'er, we've spoken about this. Let's not draw too much attention to ourselves.

602
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,050
If you do that,

603
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:05,940
then everyone in the capital will know that my wife is selling fabric throughout the place.

604
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,990
I'm not asking for your help. I just want your opinion.

605
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:16,050
If you think that by doing so you will lose face, then I won't do it.

606
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:21,340
Jin'er, don't get angry. This is not what I meant.

607
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,520
If you really want to do that, then I won't stop you.

608
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,960
I am your strongest support backing you up, Jin'er.

609
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:36,260
I know you dote on me and love me, and are my biggest supporter.

00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,140
It's just that, I also want to be able to do something.

611
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,970
That's why, in a moment of impatience, I brought up those kinds of ideas.

612
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,810
I understand.

613
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:50,200
I also believe my Jin'er can provide for half of our household.

614
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,170
Then you just need to stay by my side and assist me.

615
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,720
Okay! I accept your command!

616
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:01,460
But... it's already late. Shouldn't we also rest early?
