Mother says everything is fine.

00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,920
She also says, now that I am someone's wife,

54
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,370
I mustn't only be occupied with playing around, but rather, learn more feminine skills.

55
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,240
She's even enclosed an embroidery pattern for me to follow.

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,390
I really miss the desserts Mother used to make.

Miss, wait for a bit then. I'll go to the kitchen and make some for you.

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,300
All right!

59
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,680

61

What are you trying to do? Return it to me.

63
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,310
My Lady, I am ordering you to leave the city with me.

64
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,360
Oh my!  It seems that there are also times where you ask others for help.

65
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,680
I'm not asking, I'm giving an order.

66
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,030
Why should I obey you?

67
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,190
This is a matter of life and death. You must come with me.

68
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,660
You absolutely cannot leave without me?

69
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,530
Tell me. What do you want?

70
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,400
- I want to sleep in your bed. 
 - You–!

71
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,100
What I mean is, I want to sleep in your bed, not with you.

72
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,600
You'll sleep on the long chair and I will sleep in the bed. We will have nothing to do with each other.

You know about it?

83
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,220
In the past, my royal father didn't like me.

84
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,410
My older sisters often locked me up in my room.

85
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,760
For the sake of freedom, what kind of lock have I not opened before?

86
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,230
Legend says this lock was created by a bandit!

87
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,450
He fell in love with the daughter of a wealthy family.

88
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,090
In order to pursue her,

89
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,850
he secretly entered the royal palace and stole the Night Pearl.

90
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,290
He used this lock to lock it in a casket,

91
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,020
wanting to gift it to her.

92
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,610
He never imagined that when he returned to her side,

93
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,940
she was already dead from an illness.

94
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,260
So he lifted his sword and killed himself for love!

95
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,320
He killed himself for love!  Think about it!

96
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,400
After that, many people still wanted to get their hands on the Night Pearl.

97
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,770
But no one could open this lock of fallen flowers and lovers ever again.

98
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,040
He loved in vain.

99
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,100
In pain yet cannot forget.

100
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,030
Aren't you afraid that I made up this story?

101
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,920
Please open the lock, My Lady.

102
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,500
What?

103
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,980
Open the lock.

104
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,050
This...

105
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,180
What is troubling you?

106
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,440
What's wrong, Lady?

107
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,240
Please explain.

108
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,940
Turn around.

109
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,410
This won't do.

110
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,660
No.

111
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,920
This one is good! This one will do.

112
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,820
My Lady, why are you touching my hai—?

113
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,580
Don't misunderstand, I need this to open the lock.

114
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,180
It's open, it's open! Indeed, there is no lock I can't open!

115
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,740
However, this lock is indeed quite amazing.

116
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,960
It's all thanks to your help.

117
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,140
Does my hair really have such a miraculous use?

118
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,840
As long as it's hair, it'll do.

119
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,690
Then, My Lady, why didn't you use your own hair?

120
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,780
It hurts a lot, right?

121
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,580
It's not like I'm an idiot. Only an idiot would pull their own hair out.

122
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,090
You—!

123
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,160
You move aside.

124
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
He's scary enough! Yet you screamed as well!

125
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,900
You scared me to death, scared me to death!

126
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,450
Um...

127
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,720
Bats! B-Bats!

128
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,450
Are they gone?

129
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,750
Are they gone?

130
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,930
What a wimp, to be scared to this extent.

131
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,160
What is this place?

132
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,410
It's cold and dark!

133
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:03,060
Hey! I can do it myself. It's so dark, don't take advantage of me!

134
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,810
Be careful, there are black bats everywhere.

135

No. I might as well rely on myself!

149

You brought me to such a dangerous place!

153
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,420
There's traps and hidden arrows!

154
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,790
Don't you just want to kill me?

155
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,220
I'm standing right in front of you! Just kill me!

156

All right, you're the one who isn't doing anything.

00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,390
Once I get back, I'm telling His Majesty that you're defying the royal marriage edict!

160
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,590
What is this? Another trap?

161
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,060
You're a great general!  Why did you set so many traps?

162
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,560
I don't believe that I can't find the exit!

163
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,940
All right. I admit it. I can't find the exit.

164
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,220
If you don't want to kill me, then let me out of here right now!

165
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,870
Wait!

166
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,970
Is this another trap?

167
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:13,140
Hey! You're a general, with such a large manor.

168
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,380
Did all your money come from here?

169
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,250
Don't spout nonsense!

170
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,340
Petty.

171
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,120
There's another box inside!

172
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,280
We're going to be rich!

173
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,210
Let's go!

174
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,240
Big devil, we've finally escaped!

175
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,460
You've grown quite bold.

176
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,340
You even dare to call me "big devil" now?

177
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,490
But what is this? You even had to bring it out.

178
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,220
Don't ask. This is a gravely important item.

179
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,750
Don't tell anyone about it.

180
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,390
Fine, I won't tell.

181
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,270
You're hurt!

182
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,160
It's nothing.

183
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,710
How is it nothing? You're bleeding! Let me see!

184
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,780
It's nothing.

185
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,050
We should go back.

186
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,210
No! I should take a look at your injury when we get back.

<i>[Tomb of the Prince]</i>

188
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,320
Let me put medicine on it.

189
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,820
Does it hurt?

190
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,260
No.

191
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,990
Do none of these hurt?

192
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,970
They're all old injuries. Why would they still hurt?

193
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,690
Why is your back covered with so many scars?

194
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,800
Are you afraid?

195
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,640
If you're afraid, have Bao Zitou come take care of it.

196
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,620
I'm afraid.

197
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,790
My heart just aches for your past sufferings.

198
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:58,940
I'm also afraid you'll have new wounds in the future.

199
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,320
No one has ever said such things to me before.

200
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,860
I've never treated a person this way before either.

201
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,820
My Lady, to show your true emotions like this,

202
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,360
is it just because I blocked an arrow for you in the tomb?

203
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,390
It's all thanks to that arrow.

204
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,310
You could have just protected yourself,

205
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,450
yet you got hurt for me.

206
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,530
Although I haven't been here for long,

207
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,790
but the Chu Xiuming whom I've interacted with

208
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,590
and the Devil General I've heard of, are completely different!

209
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,650
How so?

210
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:10,630
You're stubborn and hardheaded because you carry the heavy burden of protecting the country.

211
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,770
You have become numb to killing and earned yourself a bad reputation

212
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,960
because you have to frighten the enemies and protect our safety.

213
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,350
That is my responsibility as a general.

214
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,260
I've been mischievous here in the manor,

215
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,010
but you unexpectedly tolerate me and never blamed me.

216
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:36,150
That is because I originally thought you were a spy.

217
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,700
On the surface, I pretended like I didn't care about you,

218
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,130
but actually... I've been secretly observing you the whole time.

219
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,190
Then, what about now?

220
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,790
I apologize.

221
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:03,440
You being a spy was all a misunderstanding.

222
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:11,710
Chu Xiuming, you're the real spy.

223
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,060
What do you mean by that?

224
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,580
I decided to get married in a moment of anger, never thinking

225
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,010
that I would meet a devil in the flesh.

226
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,440
I was treated as a spy,

227
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,420
but I never imagined I'd meet a loyal general.

228
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,540
I had originally lost all hope.

229
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,490
But I never imagined...

230
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,480
that I would fall in love with the Devil General.

231
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:01,170
Chu Xiuming, I'm saying I have fallen in love with you, do you understand?
