- General. <br> - Did you find anyone imprisoned?

21
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,640
No, General.

22
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,360
Xiao Su, let's split up to search. You go ask the people of the manor.

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,380
Find the housekeeper and see if anyone knows where Jin'er is.

24
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,870
Yes.

25
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,270
Child, it will be all right.

26
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,080
Your father will definitely find us. It'll be okay.

27
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,710
Child, it'll be okay. Your father will definitely find us.

28
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,390
It will be okay.

29
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,630
General!

30
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,470
How did it go on your end?

31
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,040
Don't panic. All of us will search together! We will definitely find her!

32
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,660
Jin'er is still pregnant and I don't know if she's dead or alive.

33
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,490
How can I not panic?

34
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,190
I will definitely protect you. I will definitely protect you.

35
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,210
You must not give up! I will not give up either!

36
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,710
Don't give up, Child. I will not give up either.

37
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,380
I will protect you.

38
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,910
I will protect you.

39
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,880
I will protect you.

40
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,790
Where exactly did you imprison Jin'er?

41
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,800
Guess.

42
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,230
Situ, why make things hard for a woman?

43
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,910
Actually, I also cannot bear to see my younger sister go.

44
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,830
What a shame.

45
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,680
That's right.

46
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,700
That day, she probably ran to the city gates to find you. Right?

47
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,390
What were you doing then? Let me think.

48
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,680
I recall! You were probably running around everywhere since I tricked you.

49
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,920
General! He is trying to anger you! Why fall for his tricks?

50
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,660
Lord Situ, I will be frank today!

51
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,400
If the general's lady is harmed in any way,

52
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,830
I will use your entire family's lives to pay for it!

53
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,390
You two? You two wouldn't.

54
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,150
You two are not me. I am a bad person!

55
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,860
You two are righteous men. How could you possibly do it? Am I right?

56
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,490
General! General!

57
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,970
General!

58
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,310
Mother. Mother Consort.

59
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,720
General, were you talking about my Jin'er just now?

60
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,560
I am sorry, Mother. I did not protect her well.

61
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,860
That means... you cannot find my Jin'er?

62
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,120
I will definitely find her. Don't worry, Mother.

63
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,930
I trust you. I believe you will definitely find JIn'er!

64
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,810
Has everything been revealed?

65
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,650
Yes, Mother Consort.

66
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,620
Good. I did not have Jin'er relay those messages in vain.

67
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,250
You must find Jin'er quickly. She's still pregnant.

68
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,660
She deserves it! Was that brat Shen Jin captured?

69
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,830
Isn't she the Lady of Lord Yongning?

70
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,960
Isn't there nothing she cannot do?

71
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,150
If it wasn't to save the entire Rui Royal Manor,

72
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,630
how would Jin'er have been captured by Situ when she went to take the blame for everything?

73
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,370
You are all blood-related sisters. Why are you so evil and cruel?

74
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,690
If she really dies, will your heart feel happy then?

75
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,260
Son-in-Law! Son-in-Law!

76
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,420
Do not waste time here anymore!

77
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,000
Hurry and find my Jin'er!

78
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:38,560
Chu Xiuming! You should hurry up.

79
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,670
Before night falls, I am afraid Younger Sister will be dead!

80
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,410
Is she really going to die?

81
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,170
Do not worry. That girl has so many tricks up her sleeve.

82
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,040
She will not die.

83
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,290
That is good. That is good.

84
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,940
I've done what His Majesty asked me to do. He should let the entire Rui Royal Manor go free now.

85
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,660
Perhaps His Majesty forgot about them?

86
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,470
I will go do that now.

87
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,520
Just now, Situ said Jin'er was captured at the city gate. How could he have done it himself?

88
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,010
We must find the person who captured Jin'er.

89
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,050
Go and do something for me.

90
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,110
All right.

91
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,590
Situ has already been imprisoned, he will never be able to return!

92
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,610
Do not obstinately refuse to see the error of your ways and be blindly loyal to a treacherous official!

93
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,900
If one of you tells us where the whereabouts of the general's lady,

94
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,170
then you can make up for your crimes, and I will spare your life!

95
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,020
L-Lord Xiao, we really do not know anything.

96
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,810
You don't know?

97
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,410
It's already come to this and you all are still concealing matters on his behalf? Then you all have only one fate!

98
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,380
Death!

99
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,700
We really do not know anything!

100
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,380
<i>Yeah!</i>

101
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,400
<i>Commander Yun, our next step...</i>

102
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,990
<i>Do not mention official titles outside the palace. Be careful, someone may be listening.</i>

103
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,720
Where is Commander Yun?

104
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,160
Commander Yun? Something happened at home, so he has not been in the palace for days.

105
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,820
Where is his home?

106
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,200
<i>[Yun Residence]</i>

107
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,280
<i>They're carrying a corpse out.</i>

108
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,030
Let's go.

109
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,470
<i>Who did this?</i>

110
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,150
I really don't know where to go to look for Jin'er anymore.

111
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,160
Perhaps Situ is the only one who knows now.

112
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,540
But he's an old bastard!

113
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,960
How much longer do we have until night falls?

114
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,470
Perhaps two hours?

115
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,430
He might have just been lying to you!

116
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,160
What if he was telling the truth?

117
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,090
Nothing can happen to my Jin'er.

118
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,110
Lord Situ, I beg you to tell me the whereabouts of my wife.

119
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,810
You are the formidable Lord Yongning.

120
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,440
How could you beg a criminal like me?

121
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,030
Stop saying such useless words, Lord Situ.

122
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,370
Tell me.

123
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:52,010
What must I do for you to return my Jin'er to me?

124
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,560
Will my life do?

125
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,960
Take your life?

126
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,020
That will not do.

127
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,970
If you die,

128
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,620
my younger sister will be left behind to live all alone and sad in this world.

129
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,330
How awful would she feel? My heart would ache for her!

130
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:17,080
I just want you, Chu Xiuming, to feel utterly helpless

131
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,720
and live as though you are in hell.

132
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,160
Lord Situ, I beg you to let Jin'er go.

133
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,030
Let her go?

134
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,040
For Jin'er, I can do anything.

135
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,560
I have nothing now anyway.

136
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:58,790
I also want you to lose everything.

137
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,190
Live your entire life in regret!

138
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:09,520
Did you know? She cannot see anything in there.

139
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,070
She cannot hear anything either!

140
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:18,900
Your woman, in a dark cave

141
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,830
that no one knows about, will be

142
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,580
tortured by her fears until she dies!

143
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,130
Oh right! There is almost no time left.

144
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,640
However, her time of suffering

145
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,390
is almost over.

146
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,790
Because... she is going to die.

147
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,160
She is going to die!

148
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,460
She is going to die!

149
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,410
She is going to die!

150
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,920
Die!

151
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,960
She is going to die!

152
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,870
<i>Younger Sister, look at these pots of mine. What do you think? Which one do you like?</i>

153
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,420
<i>Could he have hidden a secret room under here?</i>

154
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,020
<i>Perhaps he hid a lot of jewels and treasures there!</i>

155
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,690
<i>Is he not afraid of falling down there?</i>

156
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,230
I know where she is.

157
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,610
The secret room.

158
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,500
It's where the pitch pots are.

159
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,980
Chu Xiuming, have you gone crazy?

160
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,660
Chu Xiuming! Stop right there!

161
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,940
You—!

162
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,450
<i>[Situ Manor]</i>

163
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,130
- General. <br> - General.

164
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,360
This is it!

165
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,300
Jin'er! Jin'er!

166
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,370
There must be a mechanism. Let's split up to search!

167
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,890
- Chu Xiuming? <br> - Jin'er?

168
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,260
General! General! General!

169
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,240
General!

170
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,730
Jin'er! I finally found you!

171
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,290
Chu Xiumimg you bastard! What took you so long?

172
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,840
Jin'er, wait until we get out to yell at me. Okay?

173
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,110
Now, I must find a way to get you out of here.

174
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,110
Don't move! You're being sucked in, too!

175
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,320
Jin'er. Jin'er, listen to me.

176
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,160
Neither of us must move. The more we move, the deeper we will sink in.

177
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,530
That won't work. We have to get out of here.

178
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,460
Or else, we will be buried alive here!

179
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,330
The door has already closed now.

180
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,210
We have to find someone on the outside to open the mechanism.

181
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,040
We still have to wait?

182
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,900
Do not worry. We can get out once Xiao Su finds the mechanism.

183
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,360
What if he also falls down here like you?

184
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,270
Chu Xiuming, stop digging. It is useless.

185
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,450
You will just get yourself sucked in deeper like that.

186
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,710
Do not panic. We will definitely hold out until Xiao Su finds the mechanism.

187
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,210
If Xiao Su could have found it, he would have been down here long ago!

188
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,240
Chu Xiuming, stop lying to me. It wouldn't be the first time you've lied to me, right?

189
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,230
Are you still angry, Jin'er?

190
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,240
I stopped being mad at you a long time ago. I kept hoping you would find me sooner.

191
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,670
Next time, do not run off all by yourself again.

192
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,490
Got it?

193
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,070
Next time, I will not.

194
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,700
Chu Xiuming, do you still remember

195
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,270
the three conditions I mentioned when I first arrived at the general's manor?

196
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,780
I remember.

197
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:13,700
I already took you horse riding and gave you good food.

198
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,150
Then... the third condition is

199
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,370
no matter when or where or what happens,

200
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,960
I, Shen Jin, want to be with you, Chu Xiuming, forever.

201
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,360
Even if we die, we must die together!

No way!

236
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,410
Eighth Older Brother, I must discuss this properly with you!

237
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,740
The throne was originally yours to start with, right?

238
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,100
That was many years ago!

239
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,420
You have ruled the court and captured the hearts of the people.

240
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,440
- The people love you— <br> - Don't, don't, don't!

241
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,650
Let's not talk about the objective facts yet.

242
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,980
Let's discuss the things between us first.

243
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,490
I saved your son, right?

244
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,040
That is right.

245
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,410
- Thank you, Your Majesty— <br> - No! Don't call me that yet.

246
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,480
We haven't finished settling this yet.

247
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,300
We don't know who will be the emperor from now on just yet.

248
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,930
No matter what, I must thank you, Your Majesty.

249
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:34,520
Back then, in order to save my son, you changed his name and sent him to the Chu army.

250
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,770
I remember all of that!

251
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,840
That is not right! Why do your words make me sound so difficult to deal with?

252
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,070
I changed his name to keep him safe.

253
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,040
Do you think I wanted this throne?

254
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,020
That's natural. That's natural.

255
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,160
Then Eighth Older Brother, doesn't that mean that you owe me a favor?

256
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,210
All right, all right. I owe you a favor.

257
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,520
Look. In these past sixteen years,

258
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,370
I have done everything I could, given it my all to care for this empire.

259
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,290
This was supposed to be your job!

260
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:14,460
Tell me. Don't you owe me another favor?

261
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,380
Al[ right, all right. I owe you another favor.

262
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,960
Eighth Brother, it has been so many years now.

263
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,280
I have never given up on finding the person who harmed you.

264
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,820
Now, the truth has been revealed.

265
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,920
It may not be all of my doing, but I can get credit for a part of it. Right?

266
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,400
Tell me. Doesn't that mean you owe me yet another favor?

267
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,070
I—!

268
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,550
All right, all right. I owe you yet another favor, all right?

269
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,380
Eighth Brother! Since you say that, let me ask you.

270
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,370
Can you bear to see me sit in that seat

271
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,000
and never having a day of peace?

272
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,350
Go, go, go, go.

273
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,380
Eighth Brother!

274
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,160
I've always wanted to explore Jianghu since I was young.

275
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,620
My dream, since childhood, has always been to travel the world with a sword in hand!

276
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,560
Eighth Brother! Just spare me!

277
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,210
At this age, I only like to plant some flowers and things like that.

278
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,200
In this state, how can I possibly be the emperor?

279
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,080
Don't worry. There is another candidate.

280
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,730
Who?

281
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,380
He's here!

282
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,820
Come, come, come!

283
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,160
- Come with me! Come, come, come! <br> - Royal Father!

284
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Eighth Brother, Eighth Brother, come, come. Eighth Brother!

285
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,040
Come, come, come.

286
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,650
Sit, sit, sit, sit. Sit!

287
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,380
Xiuyuan, no, An'er!

288
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,460
- Your–! <br> - The "An" in your name is the "peace" in "may you bring peace and stability to the empire."

289
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,790
You are a man of our Shen family as well!

290
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,610
You are strong and righteous!

291
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:03,090
A man has to bear his rightful responsibility and destiny!

292
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,960
Your Majesty, I do not dare!

293
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,770
- You dare! <br> - Your Majesty!

294
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,880
That's not right. You have sons, too!

295
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,490
Why don't you put your son in this position?

296
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,670
- Who would harm his own son like that? <br> - You—!

297
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,730
Eighth Brother, let's go!

298
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,620
Let's go drink!

299
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,790
Go, go, go! Hurry!

300
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,330
- That's not a good idea, right? <br> - Come on!

301
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,660
Your Majesty! Royal Father!

302
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,260
- It's fine! <br> - He's just a child!

303
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,110
Let's go, let's go!

304
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,050
Your Majesty.

305
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,700
- Give it to me! <br> - Give it to me!

306
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,410
- I am the older sister, you must concede to me! <br> - Why?!

307
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,390
I am the younger sister so you should concede to me!

308
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,870
That's not the rule!

309
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,780
Third Sister! Aren't you going to control her?

310
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,340
Are you going to let her bully me like this?

311
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,070
Stop fighting, you two!

312
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,960
I'll get some new fabric and let you two pick first, okay?

313
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,920
Second Sister, just let Fourth Sister have it first this time. Okay?

314
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,520
Third Sister is the best!

315
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,250
No! I already let her have it last time!

316
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,450
It's mine this time!

317
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,750
Eldest Sister! Third Sister always helps Fourth Sister!

318
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,180
Aren't you going to say something on my behalf?

319
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,000
You two are already married,

320
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,320
why are you still acting like children?

321
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,930
Let me ask you two. Do you act like this at home, too?

322
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,010
- Of course not! <br> - Of course not!

323
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,900
- Give it to me! <br> - Give it to me!

324
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,920
Give it to me!

325
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,320
I never imagined

326
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,370
the refined and noble young man from back then

327
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:50,020
is now the emperor. He is indeed fitting for the role.

328
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,910
Look at you! You cannot casually gossip about the emperor!

329
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,540
What can't I say?

330
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,030
If we are living well, can't I praise him a little?

331
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,700
If you really want to say something, then our Miss Ruonan

332
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,880
is really the mother of the world who has everyone's hearts!

333
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,490
How did you scold me just now?

334
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,110
Can you call her "Miss Ruonan?"

335
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,030
That's what you are criticizing me for?

336
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,590
Am I wrong?

337
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,380
You are naturally right.

338
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,360
Our empress really is the mother of the world!

339
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,190
She not only cares about the wellbeing of us simple commoners,

340
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,540
but also pulled together all of the Armed Escort Agencies to become one.

341
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,200
Letting everyone earn money together rather than undercutting and discriminating against each other.

342
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,430
Yes.

343
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,910
I never imagined that everyone could really have food to eat.

344
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,440
- Everyone has work to do. <br> - <i>Read it with me again.</i>

345
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,480
The world really is at peace, everything is in peace!

346
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,160
Yes!

347
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,210
<i>"We go out for pleasure, hand in hand."</i> <br> <i>(T/N: "An Outing to the Eastern Field" 《游东田》 was written by the Chinese poet Xie Tiao (谢朓 ) of...)</i>

348
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,280
<i>"We go out for pleasure, hand in hand."</i> <br> <i>(...the Southern and Northern Dynasties. This poem was translated by Witter Bynner.)</i>

349
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,150
<i> "Seeking clouds, we ascend a tiered kiosk."</i>

350
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,470
<i>"Seeking clouds, we ascend a tiered kiosk."</i>

351
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,960
Enough, enough, enough! That's almost enough!

352
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,900
You can get these things anywhere! Why are you taking them to the border?

353
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,090
What do you know?

354
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,510
These are all Her Ladyship and General's daily necessities!

355
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,510
They're used to these.

356
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,770
Isn't the things from the border better than those here?

357
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,600
Her Ladyship keeps ordering things from the border to be shipped here at the capital.

358
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,080
That's true.

359
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,460
- The weather and food at the border are great. The people there are even better! <br> -That's right!

360
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,250
Even Ninth Princess comes to vacation at the border!

361
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,100
That's right!

362
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,000
Slowly, slowly.

363
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,850
Be careful! Be careful!

364
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,600
Yes! The people there are great!

365
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,290
If the people were not great, would they be staying here?

366
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,180
You guys said that you were here to help Her Ladyship and the general move things back to the border.

367
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,990
But this is just great. Two people came, but only one is going back!

368
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,650
They're all sisters!

369
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:48,750
Isn't it natural for Her Ladyship to have Xiao Cong take care of Rou Rou?

370
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,490
Once Rou Rou gives birth, your Xiao Cong will be back!

371
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,970
How is it that simple?

372
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,090
The capital is so "flashy" and the people are even more so. <br> <i>(T/N: Flashy (花里胡哨) but without substance)</i>

373
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:00,430
What am I going to do if my Miss Xiao Cong ends up becoming dazzled and refusing to go back?

374
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,320
Why have you become just like Rou Rou now?

375
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,180
What are you two arguing about?

376
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,080
- General, Your Ladyship. <br> - General, Your Ladyship.

377
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,050
- My Lady, Bao Zitou said you kept Xiao Cong here on purpose. <br> - You—!

378
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,970
I do not dare! I do not dare!

379
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,100
From what I see, there's nothing you don't dare to do!

380
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,700
Why are you only talking about me?

381
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,370
Why aren't you talking about your general?

382
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:24,460
Husband, I think Xiao Cong should stay here with Rou Rou. She doesn't need to go back!

383
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,380
I will listen to you about everything.

384
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,010
You all! Hurry up!

385
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,330
The people inside, hurry up!

386
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,940
Eldest Sister already gave birth.

387
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,040
Why hasn't mine done anything yet?

388
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,140
My Lady, turns out you are also hoping to discharge your cargo as soon as possible?

389
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,140
Are you hoping as well?

390
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,600
I cannot wait!

391
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,380
Husband, you are so bad!

392
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,330
But... you shouldn't go back with me to the border this time.

393
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,440
Stop! That is not up to discussion!

394
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,640
We agreed on it! How can you be like this?

395
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,270
- Your body now is—! <br> - Do you even care about what I say?

396
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,810
- Really. <br> - But— <br> - Miss!

397
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,230
- My Lady! <br> - Miss!

398
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,420
- Slow down, slow down! <br> - Stop holding me back!

399
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,080
- Miss! <br> - Slow down! <br> - You're heavy right now!

400
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,060
I cannot bear to see you go!

401
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,920
Su Su, she's only three months pregnant!

402
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,240
You cannot even see her stomach yet, how is she heavy?

403
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,160
That's right! It looks like there's nothing there!

404
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,710
- Don't pat it! <br> - He's already controlling everything!

405
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,690
Don't pat it! Be careful!

406
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,520
Miss! Take me back with you!

407
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,580
This—! He's controlling everything! He won't let me do anything!

408
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,090
It's so boring!

409
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,250
Wife, don't rush! We can discuss everything!

410
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,280
I'm telling you! I have backing!

411
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,530
If you dare to continue controlling my food and drink, I will go back to the border with Miss and the general!

412
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,690
I do not dare to! I do not dare to!

413
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,840
I think Rou Rou's idea is not bad.

414
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,160
Then, Rou Rou, come back to the border with us.

415
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,410
That way, no one can control you, am I right?

416
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:47,490
Good, good, good! My Lady, that is a great idea!

417
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,230
Let us all go back to the border together!

418
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,630
Miss Xiao Cong.

419
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,010
- Brother Baozi! <br> - Wife!

420
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,170
Let's tear up that slavery contract.

421
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,560
- Do not worry when I'm the one handling things. <br> - Okay!

422
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,700
When I first entered the general's manor, how did you threaten me?

423
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,340
You said I was a spy! And you wanted to kill me, too. Right?

424
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,220
No, no, no! That... was a misunderstanding! A misunderstanding!

425
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,410
You just can't bear to see your Miss Xiao Cong go, right?

426
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,690
That's fine.

427
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,400
After I give birth to this one, I will have a second one!

428
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,850
After I have the second one, I will have a third one!

429
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:25,880
Your Xiao Cong can just stay with me in the capital!

430
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,330
- Miss Rou Rou, you cannot! <br> - General!

431
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,590
General, Emperor and Empress have come to visit.

432
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,160
- Eldest Brother, forego the formalities! <br> - You don't have to be so formal.

433
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,250
We're not in our courtly attire.

434
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,860
Ruonan...

435
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,380
Your Majesty. Her Majesty. Why have both of you come here in your everyday attire?

436
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,080
We know that you have been hoping to go back to the border,

437
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,910
so I issued a decree allowing the both of you to travel back there together.

438
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,900
Her Majesty could not bear to part with you, Sister-in-Law, so she accompanied me to send you off.

439
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,760
What does it matter even if I can't bear to part with you?

440
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,350
Younger Sister Jin'er belongs to that vast expanse of land.

441
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,170
You've already been accustomed to being carefree and unconstrained over there.

442
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,690
I can't bear to part with you either, Eldest Brother.

443
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,500
The capital may be pleasant, but it's not as free as the frontier.

444
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,320
Besides, the Imperial Court has a myriad of matters to be taken care of and too many social engagements.

445
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,390
Even if I want to learn to handle those things, I won't be able to.

446
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,310
I know I can't stop you.

447
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,160
I'll have to trouble you with protecting the frontier, then.

448
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,280
With Xiao Su, General of the Imperial Guard, protecting you here at the capital,

449
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,180
I feel at ease to return to and defend the frontier.

450
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:37,000
By the way, Your Majesty,

451
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,900
I think it's better if I return alone this time around.

452
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,820
I would like Your Majesty to rescind your decree.

453
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,440
The journey is long and it is not convenient for my wife.

454
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,690
I think it would be better if she remained here in the capital.

455
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,570
I did not think this thoroughly.

456
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,420
- Sister– <br> - You were thorough! You were very thorough.

457
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,660
I want to go back!

458
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,850
- Jin'er, stop throwing such childish tantrums. <br> - No.

459
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,660
Younger Sister Jin'er, just rest assured.

460
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,820
There aren't any concubines or children in the general's manor. You're the only Young Lady there.

461
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,110
Of course.

462
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:07,130
How can this Great General ever escape my clutches?

463
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,040
That's right.

464
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,120
<i>Third Younger Sister!</i>

465
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,740
- Greetings, Your Majesty. <br> - Imperial Uncle, forego the formalities.

466
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,850
Thank you, Your Majesty.

467
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,240
Greetings, Royal Father, Mother Consort, and Mother.

468
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,040
That... Jin'er, this trip...

469
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:46,660
to the frontier... I am...

470
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,300
Y-You should say it.

471
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:59,310
Jin'er, you really must look after yourself well on this trip with Lord Yongning back to the frontier.

472
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:02,280
You are with child, after all.

473
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,580
Yes, Mother Consort.

474
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,230
Quickly.

476
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,190
Have you packed all your things?

477
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,640
I've brought the clothes and shoes I've made for the baby. Remember to take them with you.

478
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,170
Mother, I can't bear to part with you.

479
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,250
Your Majesty! I'm afraid I'll have to disobey your decree this time!

480
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,640
- I won't be able to go back with Chu Xiuming this time! <br> - Why?

481
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,550
- What's wrong? <br> - Someone isn't letting me leave...

482
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,920
I'm about to give birth!
