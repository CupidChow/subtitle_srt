19
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,720
You and Xiuyuan are undoubtedly different!

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,030
You interfered with Xiuyuan's matters without permission.

21
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,280
You had Ruonan speak cruel words to Xiuyuan and push him away.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,110
You really didn't see the pained look on Xiuyuan's face today!

23
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,500
If you really are thinking on his behalf, why must you break them up?

24
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,630
I have already made my decisions about this, you do not need to worry about it.

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,600
I have also made my decisions about this.

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,300
Husband, you don't need to interfere!

27
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,080
Xiuyuan's feelings are clear.

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,980
But I don't know how Ruonan feels!

29
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,870
I am the sister-in-law, and Xiuyuan has no parents.

30
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,380
How about I go propose a marriage for him?

31
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,570
I'll go tomorrow! This a great idea!

32
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,360
Time to sleep.

33
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,700
<i>I cannot become soft-hearted about Xiuyuan's matters.</i>

34
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,990
<i>I must keep the bigger picture in mind.</i>

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,520
Ruonan, come, come! Sit here, sit here.

36
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,610
Have a seat, have a seat.

37
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,170
Lord Jin, the people of your manor have really been coming one after another.

38
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,270
Tell me. What is it?

39
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,950
My fabric shop is very busy.

40
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,300
Then I'll get straight to the point.

41
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,170
Today, I'm here to formally propose marriage to you on behalf of my younger brother-in-law.

42
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,290
Younger brother-in-law? Who?

43
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,240
Chu Xiuyuan!

44
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,570
But your general clearly said that Xiuyuan is his lieutenant general.

45
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,750
He probably just didn't tell you clearly.

46
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,510
In any case, I came to propose marriage for him!

47
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,650
If you marry him, my husband and I will certainly treat you very well!

48
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,040
But your husband told me to stay away from your brother-in-law.

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,050
That is a misunderstanding. Don't take it seriously!

50
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,660
I've known Xiuyuan for some time now.

51
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,470
He's a sincere and kind person.

52
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,830
If you marry him, you will definitely be happy!

53
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,780
Let me ask you. Do you really have no feelings at all for Xiuyuan?

54
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,730
If you haven't decided yet, then give him some more time!

55
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,720
Spend some more time with him.

56
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,050
You will definitely like him!

57
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,530
I am a woman,

58
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,370
but the burdens I bear are no less than a man's.

59
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,100
You're unmarried and your family isn't here.

60
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,030
Why do you bear such heavy burdens?

61
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,980
Haven't you always been curious as to why I can continuously have prices that are lowered by 20% at my textile shop?

62
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,010
I am undoubtedly curious!

63
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,650
Do you dare to come with me somewhere?

64
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,730
Why wouldn't I?

65
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,030
<i>You've back?</i>

66
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,630
Miss Ruonan.

67
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,320
<i>You're back.</i>

68
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,160
<i> Big Sister Ruonan! Big Sister Ruonan! </i>

69
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,840
Miss Ruonan, you're back?

70
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,840
- Hello. <br> - Miss Ruonan, you're back?

71
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,410
How has your body been doing, Grandmother?

72
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,860
Not bad.

73
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,730
Did you eat the nourishing herbs I brought for you all last time?

74
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,800
My body is fine!

75
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,970
- Stop spending money on me. <br> - It's nothing.

76
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,540
- Eat it at ease, it's a small matter. <br> - Thank you so much.

77
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,540
Miss, we've embarrassed ourselves. We are very close with Brother Nan.

78
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,180
You don't know. Back then, when I was pregnant,

79
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,080
my husband fell off a cliff and died while escorting a delivery.

80
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,410
If Brother Nan didn't take us in, I'm afraid I would have died a long time ago as well.

81
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,230
So in my next life, even if I have to be a servant,

82
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,040
we must repay Brother Nan.

83
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,060
- Brother Nan treats us so well. <br> - It's all in the past now, don't mention it.

84
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,840
- I will never forget it for as long as I live. <br> - By the way,

85
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,140
I've got the money for repairing your house. Take it, quickly.

86
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,430
- Thank you. <br> - Before the rainy season comes, hurry and finish the work.

87
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,750
Thank you so much.

88
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,970
It's nothing. Take care of your body, Grandmother.

89
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,810
All right, all right. Then we'll get to work.

90
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,060
- Go on. <br> - Let's go.

91
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,750
- Go and play. Go. <br> - <i>Let's go play!</i>

92
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,190
Be careful!

93
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,180
<i>Give it to me!</i>

94
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,900
They... were exaggerating a little bit.

95
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,760
Go in and take a look.

96
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:17,300
So...you gave the money you earned from the fabric shop to them?

97
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,130
That's why you chose to earn small profits with a high turnover rate.

98
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,220
You're half right.

99
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,180
Then... the other half is?

100
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,130
That year, I left the capital and travelled in the south as well as the north with the Armed Escort Agency.

101
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,450
They all really took care of me.

102
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,760
In the blink of an eye, many years had passed.

103
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,120
The Armed Escort Agency's escorts and family members all slowly became old.

104
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,430
They spent their life being escorts.

105
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,700
They spend every day with their lives on the line.

106
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,190
Not only did they not earn much money, but they were also injured.

107
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,250
Now they are old.

108
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,590
Not only can they not walk, but they also can't do other work.

109
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,010
So... you brought the escorts and their family members here?

110
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,890
They are old,

111
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,330
but I've just reached the pinnacle of my youth.

112
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,350
In these years, the agency made many deliveries, especially fabrics.

113
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,840
The risk is low but the profits are large. I am also familiar with those cloth merchants.

114
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,540
Besides, we were all originally escorts.

115
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,050
Thus, I saved up money to open this textile shop.

116
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,670
I bring those who can still work and escort our own deliveries.

117
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,010
We save a lot of money that way.

118
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,960
This is why I can always keep my prices 20% lower than everyone else.

119
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,950
Then... it's because you want to support them

120
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,970
that you are not willing to marry.

121
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,800
I believe this isn't a charity.

122
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,350
Those who have strength can escort deliveries.

123
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,590
The weak, women, and children can stay at home and work.

124
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,600
Everyone will work as their ability allows.

125
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,430
They will support themselves through their own abilities.

126
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,700
They can support this entire big family.

127
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,250
I do not want them to work as servants.

128
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,010
I want them to live properly and with dignity.

129
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,280
I didn't know you were doing things like this.

130
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,610
I even wrongly blamed you, too!

131
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,190
I wandered the streets as a child.

132
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,960
I have grown accustomed to seeing how these people are regarded beneath others.

133
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,090
In this mortal world, there doesn't seem to be a place where we can go.

134
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,500
Now that I have some ability, this is all I can do.

135
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,280
Once the fabric shop makes a profit, I want to open a second store, a third store.

136
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,770
Once I have even more ability,

137
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,240
I hope that in this world,

138
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,420
all of those who suffer and cannot live because they are poor,

139
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,360
can live better lives through their own ability.

140
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,440
I hope I can use this method

141
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,100
to let everyone who is like me live their lives well.

142
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,950
The two of us once wandered the streets similarly.

143
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,890
However, I have only given back some small kindness and favors.

144
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,430
I only guaranteed that they would have a few meals to eat. Nothing more than that.

145
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,780
Now, I have great clothes and goods,

146
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,760
yet I wasn't able to give more help to others.

147
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,460
I extremely admire your actions

148
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,020
while feeling ashamed of myself.

149
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,600
Ruonan, you are really doing a great deed.

150
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,750
Not just Xiuyuan, even my general wouldn't be a match!

151
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,300
It's not that I have no feelings for Xiuyuan.

152
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,950
His sincerity and kindness have continuously moved me.

153
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,560
However, at this moment,

154
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,160
the most important thing is to allow more people to escape pain and suffering from poverty

155
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,680
and live a better life as soon as possible.

156
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,960
Those are my thoughts right now.

157
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,980
<i>- Hurry up! <br> - I'm coming!</i>

158
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,820
<i>Be careful.</i>

159
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,510
<i>I've caught you!</i>

160
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,440
<i>I'm coming to catch you!</i>

161
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,000
Elder Sister Ruonan is my role model!

162
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,370
I feel like a little sailboat traveling along the vast ocean

163
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,240
which has finally found its purpose for sailing!

164
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,230
I'm willing to experience the beautiful scenery with her in the "moderate wind and beautiful sun," <br> <i>(T/N: Idiom – fine sunny weather; especially during spring)</i>

165
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,330
and I'm also willing to experience the howling wind and torrential rain with her which causes one to tremble with fear.

166
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,100
Elder Sister Ruonan, you're my "good teacher and helpful friend." <br> <i>(T/N: great mentor)</i>

167
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,520
Then, in your heart, what am I, Jin'er?

168
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,560
- My husband. <br> - Husband?

169
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,340
I want to ask you...

170
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,620
How do I, your husband, compare to your Elder Sister Ruonan?

171
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,840
How can I compare the both of you? There is no room for comparison.

172
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,760
You two are not even on the same level. How can I make the comparison?

173
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,880
Is that so?

174
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,400
Of course! You don't even know! Today, Elder Sister Ruonan was just so—

175
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,260
What are you doing?

176
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,440
It seems that if I don't enforce the "obediences" on you a little, <br> <i>(T/N: from Confucius' Three Obediences and Four/Five Virtues)</i>

177
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,650
then you won't pay attention to me anymore.

178
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,840
Stop fooling around. I still have important business to attend to.

179
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,100
"Stop fooling around"? "Important business"?

180
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,350
Are you're saying I'm fooling around,

181
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,250
or that our relationship isn't important?

182
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,180
Who said that? Which deceitful wretch dared to say that?

183
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,580
If I'm not mistaken,

184
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,110
it is the deceitful wretch right in front of me who said it.

185
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,160
Well... I didn't say it on purpose.

186
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,170
The important thing is, today, Elder Sister Ruonan was simply–

187
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,670
Chu Xiuming! How dare you bite me?

188
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,400
It seems that I normally spoil you too often, which is why you are ignoring me.

189
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,950
When have I ignored you?

190
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,830
You still dare to quibble with me?

191
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,320
My Great General, could it be that you are jealous?

192
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,480
Elder Sister Ruonan is only a lady.

193
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,540
Nasty General. His devilish nature has finally come to light.

194
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,740
As more time passes, nothing can be hidden.

195
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,290
All that talk of loving me was just a lie.

196
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,590
Xiuyuan! What are you doing just standing there?

197
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,120
Sister-in-Law? I was just passing by.

198
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,160
Come here for a bit.

199
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,270
I still have things to do later. Let's talk another day.

200
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,210
All right. I really don't mind shouting till everyone in the streets can hear me.

201
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,610
Actually, it's really nothing. I'll go over now.

202
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,070
Sister-in-Law, just be direct and tell me what you wish to say.

203
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,210
Xiuyuan, how can you be so impatient?

204
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,850
Here, try the tea. See how it tastes.

205
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,880
Sister-in-Law, I have already drunk the tea. Just tell me what you want to say.

206
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,210
Tea tasting is a form of enjoyment.

207
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,940
It can help one forget all the troubles of the mortal realm

208
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,580
and help one feel relaxed and joyful.

209
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,630
When one tastes tea, one must sip and savor every mouthful

210
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,220
so that one can experience both the bitterness and sweet scent.

211
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,490
Will this do?

212
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,730
There's a saying which goes, "A good horse matches well with a good saddle."

213
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:15,050
Thus, good tea leaves require a good tea set to match.

214
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,460
Scented green tea requires the use of a porcelain teapot.

215
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,050
Buddha Pu'er requires the use of a ceramic teapot.

216
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,460
Sister-in-Law, what's the meaning behind your words?

217
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,700
Give up.

218
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,690
Give up on what?

219
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,100
Elder Sister Ruonan.

220
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,410
Sister-in-Law! How could you possibly be the same as my elder brother?

221
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,320
I thought you would support me and understand me!

222
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,070
Did you understand any of the things I just told you?

223
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,660
Sister-in-Law, are you saying I'm too anxious?

224
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,480
What else?

225
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,200
You said Ruonan and I aren't compatible!

226
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,070
Perhaps your elder brother is thwarting the both of you

227
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,610
because he feels that Ruonan's social background is inferior to yours.

228
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,200
But what I'm telling you now is the total opposite.

229
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,570
Elder Sister Ruonan is an ambitious person with lofty ideals.

230
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,690
She isn't like those other ladies out there. She has great plans on her mind.

231
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:19,020
The responsibility and burdens she has to bear are inconceivable by either of us.

232
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:25,270
Tell me. Is a lady like her someone you can have or be matched with?

233
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,030
Sister-in-Law, I know that.

234
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,130
But I'm not willing to give her up. I'm willing to do my best!

235
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,960
Why are you so disobedient?

236
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,130
If you weren't my younger brother-in-law, then I wouldn't have interfered in this trivial matter.

237
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,660
Sister-in-Law, say no more. I have already made up my mind.

238
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,080
Thank you, Sister-in-Law.

239
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,180
You!

240
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,010
You're usually so quiet that you never utter a single word, but it turns out you're as stubborn as a donkey!

241
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,980
Just now, I really upheld the demeanor of an elder sister-in-law!

242
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,460
Even I am in awe of myself.

All right.

00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,780
Are you all right?

250
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,770
I'm all right. Thank you for your concern, My Lord.

251
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,700
- General. <br> - Where's my wife?

252
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,410
Her Ladyship was here for a while in the morning and then she left.

253
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,340
She might've gone to the store across from us to talk business.

254
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,940
Give this to her when you see her.

Please.

<i>- Elder Sister Ruonan! <br> - Jin'er.</i>

259
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,180
You've been working so hard these past few days.

260
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,050
I've brought some great pastries for you. Try them.

261
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,490
Jin'er, you're too courteous.

262
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,960
You're the one who's being courteous with me.

We're going to be family very soon. Stop behaving as if we are strangers.

264

Take this first. I'll brew a pot of good tea for you in a bit.

265
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,630
- All right. I'll accept it then. <br> - Hey!

266
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,190
Husband! Why are you here?

267
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,070
Great General, could it be that you've come to supervise and check to see if I'm slacking on the job?

268
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,670
Jin'er, you're always mentally and physically exhausted when you come home.

269
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,410
I always thought that it was due to you being busy with the shop,

270
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,660
and my heart even ached for you.

271
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,620
Today, I came to see you with your favorite pastries.

272
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,890
I never thought you would disregard your store

273
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,980
to go there to ingratiate yourself with her.

274
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,060
General, why do you say such things?

275
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,830
Your employee said you came in the morning,

276
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,740
but then you went out and never returned.

277
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,550
Turns out, you were busy buying pastries

278
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,090
to gain the favor of your so-called rival.

279
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,990
General, are you really angry because I disregarded my store today

280
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,640
and came here to chat with Elder Sister Ruonan?

281
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,560
You've been calling her "Elder Sister" left and right.

282
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,740
Are you really going to become one family with her?

283
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,950
Have you forgotten my instructions?

284
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,030
The instructions you have given me are one too many!

285
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,110
There's too large a disparity between the social status of her and Xiuyuan!

286
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,430
Stop trying to win her favor by fawning on her and playing matchmaker.

287
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,270
General, you couldn't be further from the truth.

288
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,000
Younger Sister Jin'er and I were only chatting.

289
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,810
It is not the gaining favor and matchmaking that you think is going on.

290
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,650
You, a noble general, and I, a common person of the city, are indeed very different.

291
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,680
It's a good thing Younger Sister Jin'er isn't snobbish like you.

292
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,610
General, what's the matter with you today?

293
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,190
Your words have crossed the line. Quickly apologize to Elder Sister Ruonan.

294
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,570
Why should I apologize to her?

295
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,010
I've known Elder Sister Ruonan ever since I was little. I've been around lowly people for years.

296
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:43,360
So according to your logic, our statuses are vastly different. Right?

297
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,310
Jin'er, stop messing around.

298
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,870
You're the Lady of Lord Yongning, my wife.

299
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,200
You keep causing a scene with me over this unrelated person.

300
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,450
What drivel are you spurting? How is Elder Sister Ruonan an "unrelated person"?

301
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,080
Jin'er, there are too many people here. You'd better return home with the general.

302
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,690
Elder Sister Ruonan, please don't be angry.

303
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,340
The general just likes to crack jokes. He didn't mean what he said.

304
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,450
I never crack jokes.

305
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,500
General, I think you'd better hurry up and return home

306
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,540
to avoid losing your precious face in front of the common people!

307
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,100
Jin'er! Do not forget your status as the general's lady!

308
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,150
But before I met you, I was merely a person amongst the common people.

309
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,930
This is a fact that cannot be changed!

310
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,990
If you continue to be importune,

311
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,320
then I think there's no need for this textile shop to continue its business!

312
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,820
Do whatever!

313
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,360
<i>[Ruonan's Textile Shop]</i>

314
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,060
Jin'er!

315
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,000
Jin'er.

316
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,600
Jin'er, are we going to sleep in separate beds again?

317
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,400
You're right!

318
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,600
Then technically, that bed is mine. Right?

319
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,200
What do you mean?

320
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,300
After you bully me, you even want me to sleep on the floor?

321
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,400
Fine, fine, fine.

322
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Today, at the textile shop, my words were indeed out of line.

323
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,900
- Then do you know where you were wrong? <br> - I wasn't wrong.

324
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,400
- But— <br> - Jin'er! Look.

325
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,800
You knew I was against her and Xiuyuan.

326
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,800
However, you keep making things hard for me and keep going against me.

327
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,400
Today, if I wasn't angered by your words,

328
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
then I wouldn't have acted that way.

329
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,300
So what you mean is that I was wrong and I was the one making a fuss out of nothing?

330
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,000
Jin'er.

331
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,000
Ever since we returned to the capital,

332
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,300
court affairs have already troubled me enough.

333
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,900
I just want to return and reunite with you as soon as possible every day.

334
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,400
But every day, you're like this.

335
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,500
I'll get tired too if I always have to comfort you.

336
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,300
Then don't comfort me!

337
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
Is that Miss?

338
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,300
At this hour, if it's not Miss, is it you?

339
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,600
But what is Lord Jin running off to do at this hour?

340
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,500
Who knows. Let's not care about her.

341
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,700
Let's cherish the little time we have together.

342
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,800
You're right!

343
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Was that the general?

344
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,600
Could it be that they had a fight?

345
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,400
Who knows?

346
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,700
Let's not bother with them. They've been married for so long now,

347
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,200
"they'll fight at the head of the head of the bed and then make up at the foot of the bed." I'm used to it already. <br> <i>(T/N: fight and makeup quickly)</i>

348
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,100
Are they always like this?

349
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,700
Su Su.

350
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,100
In the future, will we be like them, too?

351
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,900
Always fighting over this and that.

352
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,800
We will not.

353
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,000
In my eyes, nothing is more important than you.

354
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,200
In this world, when a woman has the ambition for meritorious service and great writings

355
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,000
then she should do her best at them.

356
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,500
Do not leave behind any regrets!

357
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,300
Although women's bold spirits are not innate,

358
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,800
we must be able to endure all of the trials we face!

359
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,700
We must advance bravely and use different means to obtain the same result!

360
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,200
No. We cannot use different means to obtain the same result.

361
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,700
Why should we women use different means to obtain the same result?

362
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,830
Why should we be magnanimous, tolerate everything,

363
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,400
and be generous in our tolerance?

364
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,600
As long as they don't provoke us, then it's fine. Right?

365
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,800
Yes, yes, Younger Sister Jin'er.

366
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,400
But if your husband doesn't agree to us interacting,

367
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,100
then it's also good for us to contact less.

368
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,400
Then you two won't always fight.

369
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
That won't do, Elder Sister Ruonan!

370
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,600
You must bring me along with you! I'm going to leave everything behind!

371
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,400
I'm want to become one with you!

372
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,000
Who do you want to become one with, Jin'er?

373
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,100
Come home with me!

374
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm not leaving with you! Let go of me!

375
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,100
Jin'er, stop causing trouble!

376
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,400
I just want to cause trouble, what can you do about it?

377
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,700
General, don't be anxious. Let go of Jin'er first.

378
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,100
Miss Ruonan, it's best that you do not speak.

379
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,300
I'm afraid I may not be able to hold back and "hit" a woman. <br> <i>(T/N: literal translation is "move my hand")</i>

380
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,800
Oh? Then we'll have to see whose hand is better.

381
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,100
Let me tell you. You cannot be mean to my Sister Ruonan like this!

382
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,600
- Come at me instead! <br> - Do you insist on being like this?

383
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,400
General, do "you" insist on being like this?

384
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,600
I advise you to be quiet.

385
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,300
Older Brother! Please be rational.

386
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,400
Another person is here?

387
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,400
Xiuyuan, do you remember what I said to you before?

388
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,200
I already gave you my answer.

389
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Ever since this woman appeared,

390
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,700
we haven't been at peace, including Jin'er!

391
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,800
You two... better respectfully stay away from Jin'er!

392
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
You're not allowed to say that about our Sister Ruonan!

393
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,700
You're the one who should respectfully stay away!

394
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,700
Jin'er.

395
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,200
Go home with me immediately. I will not say it a second time.

396
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,000
I will not go back!

397
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,800
I can say it again to you, too. I'm not going back!

398
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,500
Chu Xiuming, you can divorce me like you did before!

399
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,200
All right.

400
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,400
Then don't go back.

401
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,200
I'm drunk. I'm going back now.

402
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,400
Jin'er, where are you going?

403
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,400
What do you have to say? Sit down and talk.

404
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,600
There's no need to sit. It's just a few words.

405
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,000
Even if my sister-in-law refuses to tell me,

406
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,400
I know you have many hardships.

407
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,600
You don't need to hide from me in the future.

408
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,600
I will stop bothering you, too.

409
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,300
But I will keep waiting for you.

410
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,700
You just need to know that I'm willing to bear everything with you.

411
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,980
This is medicine for external wounds.

♫ <i> The cool breeze blows </i> ♫

419
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,800
Jin'er, what's wrong? Tell me.

420
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,400
I just missed you, Mother.

421
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
All right.

422
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Then I will just hold you well. Don't cry.

423
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,200
Mother, you always smell so nice.

424
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,800
Can I sleep with you?

425
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Why can't you?

426
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,200
I will help you change and wash up. Let's rest early, all right?

427
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,000
Mother, don't go! Don't leave me, all right?

428
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,400
All right.

429
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,500
I won't go. I won't go.

430
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,600
General.

431
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,400
Did you find anything in regards to the fire at Eighth Prince's manor?

432
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,100
I secretly investigated through many people, but no one knew anything.

433
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,600
That day, everyone in Eighth Prince's manor died in the fire. Not a single person survived.

434
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,200
But I heard some rumors.

435
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,300
His Majesty?

436
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Have you heard of them as well?

437
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It is known to everyone.

438
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,800
That year, Eighth Prince was the crown prince.

439
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,000
He died in a big fire.

440
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,600
The current emperor's ascension to the throne is naturally surrounded by rumors.

441
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,600
General, do you suspect His Majesty?

442
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,700
The consort of Eighth Prince was my aunt.

443
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,000
She took good care of me. I want to uncover the truth for her.

444
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
General, I have been with His Majesty for many years.

445
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,600
On the surface, he seems to believe the words of those corrupt officials,

446
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,400
but, on the inside, he is intelligent and understands everything clearly.

447
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,800
Moreover, in his heart, he has great ambitions.

448
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,300
He truly cares for the people. He is certainly not an incompetent ruler.

449
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,020
Don't worry, Brother Xiao Su.

450
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,700
I just wanted to inquire about it during this trip to the capital.

451
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,160
Really? Shen Jin came back in the middle of the night by herself?

452
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,480
Of course! The servants on night duty told me.

453
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,630
The entire manor knows now.

454
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:21,470
She deserves it! I knew she was putting on an act back then.

455
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,310
She was most likely driven out of the general's manor.

456
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,250
She had nowhere to go, so she was forced to return.

457
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,810
She was so arrogant then. Let's see how she'll deal with it now.

458
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:41,170
Come on. Let's go see our sister, Lady of Lord Yongning.

459
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,810
But... Mother told me to make a trip to her room.

460
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,890
She has something to say.

461
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,370
Look at how cowardly you are!

462
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,780
Really?

463
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,260
Greetings, Consort Mother.

464
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,300
Consort Mother, I've missed you terribly as you've been attending to Empress Dowager's illness for many days.

465
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,880
Your mother has also come back to the manor. Did you go greet her yet?

466
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,200
After seeing you, I'll go to Mother.

467
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,110
That's good then.

468
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,810
Younger Sister, you are here as well?

469
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,530
Second Sister.

470
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,380
It's been a long time since we met, Younger Sister. You seem much more chubby.

471
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,770
You're looking more and more "steady." <br> <i>(T/N: slang for fat)</i>

472
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,950
Enough. You two sisters should chat.

473
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:32,180
I will get out of the way.

474
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,760
I'll walk you out, Consort Mother.

475
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,130
Third Younger Sister, you're indeed different after becoming Lord Yongning's wife.

476
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,210
You made a trip to the border

477
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,550
and have forgotten the etiquette that you've learned at the capital.

478
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,020
Older Sister Zi, what an attitude.

479
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,940
Father and Mother always taught me that there's a hierarchy to follow when it comes to showing respect for seniority.

480
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,360
As an older sister here,

481
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,810
how could you sit and not move, Younger Sister?

482
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,540
But I'm the wife of a count. Older Sister Zi, you haven't gotten married yet.

483
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,090
You haven't been conferred any official positions or imperial titles, have you?

484
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,640
There is no need for formal greetings since we are at home after all.

485
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,400
If we were outside then you would have to formally greet me, Older Sister Zi.

486
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,350
We're family so why be so concerned with all these things, Second Sister?

487
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,970
I know you respect the rules the most.

488
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,750
But we're at home, after all.

489
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:36,250
Let's just act formally when we're in public.

490
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,800
Younger Sister, I asked you a question when I entered but you have not answered me yet.

491
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,820
Why did you come back alone in the middle of the night?

492
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,960
There's nothing going on, right?

493
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,710
Thank you for your concern, Older Sister.

494
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,780
Younger Sister, you look more fragile.

495
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,930
Could it be that you were chased out by Lord Yongning?

496
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:05,310
You're so pitiful. You've gotten so much skinnier.

497
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,780
Older Sister, are there problems with your eyes?

498
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,350
You just said I got chubby.

499
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,740
A lady like you, who hasn't gotten married yet,

500
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,720
won't be able to understand the

501
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,830
inclinations and interests of a married couple

502
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,800
You!

503
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,310
Greetings, Older Sister Jin.

504
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,940
I'm feeling hot-tempered right now. You'd better not provoke me.

505
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,180
How come you're talking to me like that?

506
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,160
What an obedient Younger Sister.

507
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,570
Older Sister Zi, you're here?

508
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,980
You called her "Older Sister Jin" in such a happy, sweet manner.

509
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,410
Older Sister, why are you talking to me like that?

510
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:05,360
Enough, stop using the same act here and there. Stop acting.

511
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,790
I—

512
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,070
Who did I provoke and offend?!

513
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:19,010
- Madam, don't worry. General treats Miss very well. <br> - Mother!

514
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,270
How come you're here?

515
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,610
My Lady, General wasn't at ease that you came back alone so he immediately sent me over.

516
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,380
He also told me to bring a lot of your daily necessities.

517
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,210
Does he really not plan to let me go back?

518
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,800
Jin'er, since you're already the general's wife then you can no longer be so temperamental.

519
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,310
You must have the bigger picture in mind for all things. Don't cause a ruckus.

520
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,560
No, Mother. It's not like what you're thinking.

521
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,380
Forget it. You should sleep for a bit. You didn't sleep well at all last night.

522
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,360
I'm making a trip to the fabric shop. Let's go.

523
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,040
Madam.

524
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,010
Why did you stop?

525
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,690
If I don't ask you then are you planning to not say anything?

526
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,400
Say what?

527
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,310
Nothing.

528
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,110
What exactly am I suppose to say?

529
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,710
I said to stop following me!

530
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,770
That won't do.

531
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,420
Consort Mother. Mother. Don't worry about me and Jin'er.

532
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,040
But—

533
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,890
Although that brat, Jin, doesn't have a good temper,

534
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,680
she isn't someone who causes a ruckus for no reason.

535
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,500
Lord Yongning, I hope you can be tolerant.

536
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,000
Consort Mother, you're too courteous.

537
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,720
Jin'er is kind at heart. She is occasionally stubborn,

538
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,290
but I see it as her being cute.

539
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:50,040
It's completely my fault this time.

540
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:55,900
I just want her to calm down a bit. Then I shall console for her forgiveness and bring her home.

541
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,470
Mother, please forgive me.

542
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,510
It's fine, it's fine. As long as you two are fine, that's good.

543
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,190
Look. Is this fabric good?

544
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,080
The workmanship is meticulous, and the material is sturdy and durable.

545
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,640
Do you two have nothing better to do?

546
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,070
Xiao Su, how did you know that Rou Rou was here?

547
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:27,380
- We communicated via telepathy. <br> - Only a ghost would believe that!

548
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,710
That's not important.

549
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,570
Forget it. You two may leave. Go as far as you can.

550
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,740
Let's go, let's go.

551
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,300
Wait a second!

552
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,880
What?

553
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,540
Rou Rou, do you really, really, really not have anything to tell me?

554
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,540
Is there something that I should be telling you about?

555
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,580
Xiao Su, leave alone. Rou Rou will stay behind to help me with the fabric shop.

556
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,000
My Lady, it's not that I'm not willing to tell you.

557
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,750
It's that if I tell you then you'll be angry.

558
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,010
Say it!

559
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,870
Right now, no one can mention you in front of the general.

560
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,410
If you are mentioned in front of him, he suddenly turns hostile.

561
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,080
He made me leave the general's manor because he didn't want to see my face.

562
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,900
If he sees my face then he'll think of your face.

563
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,160
- Get lost! <br> - Let's go, let's go.
