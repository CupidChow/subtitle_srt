My Lady, don't worry. I've already given orders. They won't move.

That's good, then.

Princess! You're back!

-Big Sister.
-Princess, why don't you move out today?

29
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,290
Okay!

30
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,080
Actually, I think I've been bothering you here for a while.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,430
I feel a bit apologetic.

32
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,930
I think...I can move to the inn near the market for now.

33
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,480
It'll be easier to shop that way.

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,810
Why wait? Why don't you move out today?

35
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,980
-My stuff is still...
-Xiao Cong!

36
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,840
Princess, your luggage is all packed up. We'll send it over later.

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,030
Yuan'er, hurry and escort the princess to the inn!

38
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,970
Hurry, hurry! It's getting late, okay?

39
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,250
It's going to rain soon! Hurry and go!

40
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,850
Let's go, Princess.

41
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,200
This...

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,760
That easily?

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,580
Not even one soldier was needed?

44
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,140
Do you think... It's a case of <i>the mantis stalking the cicada yet being unaware of the oriole behind? 
 (Idiom - to pursue a narrow gain while neglecting a greater danger.)</i>

45
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,390
You mean...the princess has a plan in store?

46
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,760
No way, no way!

47
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,310
It's fine, it's fine!

48
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,370
If you say that, then the princess really doesn't plan on giving up.

49
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,570
Of course!

50
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,050
She answered so certainly! There must be a trap!

51
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,510
I've never seen our Miss at such a disadvantage before!

52
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,270
Rou Rou. It's hard for us to see each other. Let's not worry about others.

53
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,040
No way!

54
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,180
Lord Jin didn't spoil you for nothing. You care for her so much.

55
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,870
How could I not care? She's starting to threaten me!

56
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,780
She said she'll have you stay at the military camp forever,

57
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,760
never taking half a step into the manor!

58
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,670
If she continues having these pent-up frustrations,

59
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,840
She'll definitely vent her anger at me. That won't do.

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,690
If I can't see you, what will I do?

61
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,910
Okay, I'll listen to you.

62
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,650
Let's think of a perfect plan for our Lord Jin.

63
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,800
I don't need any woman besides you.

64
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,300
To have you in this life, I am satisfied.

65
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,920
I won't think of anything else.

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,640
But Lady, you can't just drive her out of the manor!

67
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,770
I didn't drive her out, she left willingly. A lot of people can serve as witness.

68
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,200
You're not feeling heartache over her, are you?

69
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,260
Lady, are you tired?

70
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,880
No.

71
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,410

Don't call me "General" when we're outside.

Has my daughter fallen for someone?

145
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,610
That's why you won't go back with me?

146
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,030
All of the men in the Chu Army are brave and good at fighting.

I will go tell the Emperor!

151
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,270
The Emperor will definitely grant marriage to my precious pearl!

152

Royal Father, you must keep your word!

That General isn't bad!

155
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,170
I'm sure! That princess wants to choose the General to be her Golden Sword Prince Consort!

156
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,620
I just knew she had tricks up her sleeve!

157
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,340
But she's a princess! If the Emperor grants marriage and tells the General to divorce you,

00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,320
she'll directly become the General's Lady!

159
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,880
No way, I trust the General!

160
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,010
What use is that?

161
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,080
He can't resist a royal decree. Think about your marriage here.

162
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,280
The General wasn't happy about it. But he still married you!

163
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,380
-That's different!
-What's different?

164
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,680
I wasn't there before! He didn't have someone to protect his love!

165
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,710
Rou Rou, you just wait! I won't give up!

166
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,550
I will definitely protect the General. I won't let him become some Golden Sword Prince Consort!

167
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,440
Miss. Why don't we give up?

168
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,370
I think you can't beat that princess!

169
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,740
Rou Rou, how can you boost the enemy's morale and dampen one's own spirit?

170
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,300
She's a brash and ridiculous brat. Should I fear her?

171
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,880
Miss. But I don't think she's brash and ridiculous.

172
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,540
Rou Rou.

173
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,300
Su Su shouldn't come here for now.

174
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,860
Yuan'Er really is as pure as a puppy!

175
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,410
It looks as if his soul will be seduced away soon!

176
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,270
Men! They're all the same!

177
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,840
Don't be angry, don't be angry. Calm down!

178
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,470
Look at Lieutenant General Xiuyuan! He's not even giving her one look!

179
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,570
Lieutenant General, is there anything you like?

180
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,670
Anything I like?

181
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,550
Then...how about food?

182
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,730
I am usually in the military camp. How could I have requirements for food?

183
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,480
It's good as long as I can eat.

184
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,370
Then...do you like sweets?

185
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,470
For example, osmanthus cake?

186
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,540
Osmanthus cake isn't bad!

187
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,120
How strange. When did they get so close?

188
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,670
My Lady, you've worked hard.

189
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,220
Husband, where is Lieutenant General Xiuyuan?

190
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,920
Oh. He went to do work at the city gates today.

191
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,650
Husband. Look, Princess Ma Ya is a beautiful woman, right?

192
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,240
Then...Lieutenant General Xiuyuan isn't married yet, right?

193
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,100
Can they become a couple?

194
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,090
Then can't we help them get together?

195
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,110
If Lieutenant General Xiuyuan really becomes the Golden Sword Prince Consort,

196
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,200
then he can enter into a marriage alliance for the peace of the border!

197
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,330
Then it'll be his glory, and it will be great merit for the country!

198
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,810
- What do you think? 
 - No!

199
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,190
Xiuyuan definitely cannot!

200
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,400
Hey! Why not?

201
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,600
My Lady, I've already repeated it many times.

202
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,670
In this lifetime, I will only spend my life with you.

203
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,320
Stop making a fuss, okay?

204
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,520
I'm making a fuss?

205
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,970
You're the one who doesn't understand the situation. That's why you're blaming me!

206
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,930
Must you wait until the royal order is decreed,

207
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,460
and then you become the prince consort, then you'll be satisifed?

208
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:16,150
I am a coward. I really am afraid I'll lose you.

209
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,060
Did you know? All that I have now,

210
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,000
I keep feeling like someone will snatch it all away!

211
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,110
I cannot afford to gamble, and I cannot afford to lose!

212
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,050
This definitely will not happen. My Lady, please trust me.

213
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,030
Then why can't you trust me?

214
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,900
No no, I can't get angry now.

215
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,000
I must work hard! I must keep watch over my love!

216
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,900
Since the General won't help me,

217
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,360
then I can only depend on myself!

218
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,950
How could Jin'er understand that Xiuyuan,

219
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,880
definitely cannot leave our country's territory?

220
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,600
Lieutenant General...and Princess Ma Ya...

221
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,190
Did I...offend you somehow?

222
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,770
What happened?

223
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,190
Hey...don't...don't cry!

224
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,420
This is blush that I asked someone to bring back from the west.

225
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,580
If you put it on,

226
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,280
you will definitely be prettier than even Chang'e!

227
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,330
Alright. Then I'll force myself to accept it.

228
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,400
I still have to go deliver tea. I'm leaving.

229
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,970
Ah...I...

230
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,900
Miss Xiao Cong definitely likes me!

231
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,410
She made clothes for me,

232
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,750
and let me comfort her.

233
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,160
If I lock them up  together,

234
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,260
a lone man and a lone woman, putting a spark to dry wood,

235
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,630
will they fall for each other?

236
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,760
If the one she likes is the General,

237
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,470
how would she even consider the Lieutenant General?

238
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,810
You bad Rou Rou! Not only are you not giving me ideas recently, you're adding trouble for me too!

239
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,130
Whose side are you on?

240
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,870
Of course I'm on your side!

241
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,850
-Eat.
-Fine, then prove it to me.

242
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,690
How?

243
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,440
Go and tell Xiuyuan and the Princess separately

244
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,270
that I am inviting them to try tea on top of the city gates.

245
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,300
What's so great about the top of the city gates?

246
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,510
Once they go upstairs, you will lock the door behind them!

247
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,490
Very few people go up there. Even if they yell, no one will hear them.

248
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,320
On the second day, we'll let them out.

249
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,360
At that time, they cannot explain themselves! Then they'll have to be married.

250
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,540
Don't you think so?

251
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,660
You want me to do such a big matter?

252
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,870
It's not very proper.

253
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,090
It takes a thousand days to raise an army and one hour to use it.

254
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,630
Rou Rou, I can only believe in you now!

255
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,830
Then what if that Head Commander of the Falcon Tribe blames me, what will I do?

256
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,480
I already came up with a plan for you!

257
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,350
I will have Xiao Su take you away for some time. You can come back once they leave!

258
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,400
Once you return, I'll have you married! How about it?

259
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,910
It's not that simple, is it?

260
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,470
Of course it's that simple!

261
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,220
Then fine. For Miss's happiness,

262
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,750
and for my Su Su, I...

263
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,940
will give it my all!

264
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,640
Miss Rou Rou, what is it?

265
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,080
It's like this-!

266
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,910
Don't rush Miss Rou Rou, talk slowly.

267
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,610
Lord Military Inspector has invited Princess Ma Ya to the city gates to try tea together.

268
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,360
Lieutenant General, you must treat her well!

269
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,260
Her Ladyship arranged this?

270
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,800
Yes! You must! Definitely! Treat Princess Ma Ya! Well!

271
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,590
Understand?

272
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,730
-Okay...
-I'm going now!

273
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,160
<i>I cannot let Jin'er continue being ridiculous.</i>

274
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,720
Lieutenant General Xiuyuan has invited you to take a tour of the city gates.

275
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,180
You must attend.

276
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,810
Then what about Big Sister?

277
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,090
Miss will arrive soon.

278
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,000
Please wash up first. I will wait outside.

279
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,130
Wash up?

280
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,930
<i>I'm sorry, Princess.</i>

281
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:41,310
<i>You even gave me a gift, but I betrayed you like this.</i>

282
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,910
Rou Rou, when is Big Sister coming?

283
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,830
Her Ladyship? She'll be here soon!

284
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,390
Princess Ma Ya, please.

285
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,390
-Princess Ma Ya.
-Lieutenant General Xiuyuan!

286
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,240
Lieutenant General, please treat Princess Ma Ya well.

287
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,120
Our Miss will arrive soon!

288
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,990
She'll be here soon!

289
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,950
It's been locked?

290
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,780
How did it go?

291
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,980
-Have they been locked up?
-Yes! I locked them up!

292
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,110
Good, good. It's good if they're locked up.

293
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,480
Rou Rou. If someone passes by later,

294
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,060
will they hear something?

295
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,450
Everyone knows you're my personal maid!

296
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,450
If they name you, will you be locked up?

297
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,060
Miss! I should have Su Su take me away quickly!

298
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,390
If I get captured, it'll be too late!

299
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,610
No no no! Wait a second.

300
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,040
I...

301
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,810
I...!

302
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,890
Miss! It's been many seconds already!

303
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,660
Aiya! I should just let them out!

304
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,920
If Chu Xiuming finds out, our misunderstanding will become even deeper!

305
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,590
-Let's go!
-Go go go!

306
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,890
Didn't I lock them up? How did they get out?

307
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,900
That's right! How did they get out?

308
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,590
Close to the body, yhe edge of a sword will cost greatly to a short and plucky man.

309
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,840
An untraditional battle will bring victory by surprise.

310
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,550
Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

311
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,650
In war, speed is everything.

312
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,080
I thought he really liked me.

313
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,380
Miss, I think we should go back.

314
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,590
Chu Xiuming!

315
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,850
You made me believe you, right!

316
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,610
My Lady, don't make a fuss. Quickly go back.

317
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,010
Rourou, take My Lady back to rest.

318
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,200
Miss...

319
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,110
<i>Miss...</i>

320
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,370
Let me tell you.

321
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,990
I wholeheartedly accept my defeat.

322
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,950
Miss! Miss!

323
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,890
For Xiuyuan, I can only let Jin'Er suffer from the misunderstanding.

324
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,170
<i>What is big sister saying? I don't understand?</i>

325
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,740
What... defeat?

326
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,320
It's the General found us hidden by big sister, so she lost!

327
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,430
Yes.

328
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,260
Miss.

329
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,980
<i>Miss, do you want to worry me to death?</i>

330
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,010
Either speak up! Or yell about it! Or even cry.

331
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,490
Do not remain silent.

332
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,640
You're are frightening me to death.

333
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,120
This ugly general! He's a bad apple! An unfaithful husband!

334
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,610
He's using his general title to be arrogant and acting upon his desires!

335
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,490
<i>He's just the demon others talk about!</i>

336
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,320
<i>He eats people's flesh, drink their blood—</i>

337
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,190
He's not.

338
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,780
He's a rotten egg! A demon!

339
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,180
Jin'Er. Can I come in?

340
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,000
Miss, it's the general.

341
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,700
<i>She won't see you. My mistress won't see anyone!</i>

342
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,400
<i>General, please go back!</i>

343
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,170
Go attend your own business. Go and find your princess Maya!

344
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,150
Miss.

345
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,810
Miss, did I scold the general too loud earlier?

346
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,430
Will he kill me?

347
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,470
Thanks.

348
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,470
Thanks for always being by my side Rourou.

349
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,960
Then miss, you should protect Rourou.

350
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,720
I need to remain alive to spend my days with my Susu.

351
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,890
I know. It's okay.

352
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,150
Miss, how about you listen to me this time?

353
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,580
I promise you'll be safe and will have no worries.

354
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,630
What idea do you have?

355
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,310
Big brother, you lead the army like a bravely, you're divine and mighty.

356
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,640
How come are you treating sister-in-law so clumsily?

357
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,770
Not knowing how to dote on her?

358
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:03,680
There are some things she must not know of.

359
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,830
If she knew, it would bring her worries.

360
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,490
Just let her misunderstand this stupid general.

361
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:17,220
Now, I just want to manage all the worries behind her back.

362
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,520
That's the best way to protect her.

363
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,830
Sister-in-law is clever. She left her home.

364
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,640
She only has eyes for you.

365
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,780
How come don't you know how to treasure her?

366
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,870
What you think is not necessarily right.

367
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,110
Your ways are not always the best.

368
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,670
You should ask sister-in-law what does she want. What  does she need.

369
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,880
<i>Maybe what she needs is to overcome every difficulty with you.</i>

370
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,930
<i>Maybe what she needs is to be your right hand.</i>

371
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,870
<i>During your struggles, be a shoulder to rest on.</i>

372
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,460
<i>Maybe she doesn't want to be ivy, only knowing how to be clingy.</i>

373
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,970
<i>What she needs is, two people shouldering each other.</i>

374
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,200
Before Jin'Er came into my life,

375
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,980
I was a lone wolf.

376
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,980
I didn't need support in doing anything.

377
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:18,040
But now, I often am scared.

378
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,040
I also don't know how to manage this kind of thoughts.

379
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,170
I don't know what to do.

380
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,550
I'm clearly being good to her.

381
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,620
But it feels like... I am pushing her away.

382
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,800
Big brother, if you keep acting wilfully like this and make sister-in-law run away,

383
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,330
then you will really end up being alone, without any support.

384
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,630
I know that.

385
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,230
<i>Forget it, forget it! I don't want to talk more about this.</i>

386
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,100
How to deal with this, big brother you should think about it yourself.

387
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,830
<i>[Yong Ning Manor]</i>

388
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,700
Rourou, I am really hungry.

389
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,620
Miss, you must persevere.

390
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,060
Only by seing you getting thinner day by day will the general be remorseful.

391
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,900
Only then can we arise his pity and tenderness for you.

392
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,080
But I'm really hungry.

393
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,820
Wait a little.

394
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,520
Miss. Drink some water.

395
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,960
Drink some water and you won't be hungry.

396
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,670
See. General already came five times.

397
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,470
The longer we don't let him in, the more he will feel uneasy.

398
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:00,380
Once the time's right, we'll take him down in one move.

399
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,550
Is that princess still here?

400
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,260
Drink some more water.

401
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,950
I already have Yuan'Er checking on her. Don't worry.

402
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:17,090
Rourou. I have been starving the whole day. Am I thinner now?

403
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,580
It seems that not yet.

404
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,580
Don't drink anymore. What if you get bloated?

405
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,010
Actually, I'm also a little hungry.

406
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,370
I really want steamed buns and dumplings.

407
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,720
- Also beggar's chicken, duck in sauce...
- Rourou, stop it.

408
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,730
I'm really close to give up.

409
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,880
There are definitely still some cold food in the room.

410
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,030
Some leftovers. How about we look for them?

411
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,130
Didn't you say I must lose weight first?

412
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,340
I indeed said that,

413
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,330
but I have been hungry with you the whole day.

414
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,220
I haven't seen any changes.

415
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,650
If we are starving any longer,

416
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:06,200
if Rourou meets such a bad fortune, what to do?

417
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,400
Even Susu won't promise.

418
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,000
Rourou, you're really good to me.

419
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,750
What if you follow me. Just eat less.

420
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,180
Let's go.

421
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,320
Miss, you have to be careful.

422
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,210
- Don't make any noise. 
 - Alright.

423
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,610
Let's go.

424
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,550
How can we eat those?

425
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,830
Miss! Come over here!

426
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,990
Beggar's chicken! Braised pork! There's everything!

427
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,940
It's all you favourites! There's some more here!

428
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,870
It's all hot.

429
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,670
I don't care.

430
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,760
I Rourou only have the protection of the Kitchen's God.

431
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,020
For my happiness with Susu, I need to eat now.

432
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,320
We should bring it back to the room, so people don't see us.

433
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,120
Right. Let's go back. Let's fight tomorrow night.

434
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,530
Miss!

435
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,470
- There's more!
- Should we bring it all?

436
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,910
Yes!

437
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,650
- How will we take it? 
- I will go back first and come back to pick you up.

438
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,430
Why are you leaving me alone here?

439
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,800
You're the lady.

440
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,460
If you're discovered, they won't say anything.

441
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,070
Okay. Go! Quickly!

442
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,740
Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!

443
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,580
Quickly!

444
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,160
It seems she's taking these to Madam.

445
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,660
Every night preparing good meals for Jin'Er can't be disclosed.

446
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,940
Prepare it quietly so that little wife won't get upset.

447
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,850
Yes, General.

448
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,170
General, you are doing so much for Madam,

449
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,090
why can't you tell her?

450
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,060
Once I have thought about it thouroughfully,

451
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:12,620
I will tell here everything and won't hide anything from her again.

452
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,770
It's really late. Are you really going back to the barracks?

453
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,430
Madam won't see me, what's the use in staying?

454
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,840
Take good care of my wife for me.

455
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,930
Don't worry, General.

456
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,360
Sorry,

457
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,960
I should've trusted you.

458
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,670
I was just jealous.

459
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,260
I was just angry that seeing that other women were around you.

460
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,920
I'll be like a lunatic.

I thought you wanted to leave.

I thought you were here to bid farewell.

I didn't dare to say anything.
