00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,680
My Lady, why're you up so early?

22
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:21,150
I woke up early to dress and groom myself so you won't have to see my haggard appearance.

23
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,230
Haggard?

24
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,900
My Lady, why would you look haggard?

25
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,980
My husband, do you not have an idea?

26
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,560
You're not supposed to watch when a woman is getting ready.

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,430
My husband, you should go and have your breakfast.

28
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,500
Go, quickly. Quickly.

29
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,430
Go, quickly. Hurry up.

30
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,330
General, you've returned.

31
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,100
What're you doing, Jin'er?

32
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,440
A new batch of medicinal herbs has just arrived from the medicine hall. I'm testing them.

33
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,820
Why do you need to test them out?

34
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,630
Jin'er, if you've taken ill, you must let me know.

35
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,590
I'm perfectly fine, why would I be ill?

36
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,650
You're overthinking things, general.

37
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,140
General...

38
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,300
It's very late.

39
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,600
I think you should go to bed early, Jin'er.

40
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,500
General...

41

nothing will harm you, Jin'er.

It doesn't matter if you're still in the heyday of your youth, or if you've aged gradually.

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,370

62
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,340
General. I have figured out who the spy in the Ninth Princess' entourage is.

63
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,710
Who is it?

64
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,180
It seems the Ninth Princess has already had a lover before all this.

65
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,980
I heard that he used to be an imperial bodyguard.

66
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,010
He'd been chased out of the palace a few days ago by His Majesty.

67
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,240
What happened next?

68
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,970
The princess became depressed,

69
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,860
so His Majesty allowed her to leave the palace in order to drive away her cares.

70
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,270
The strange thing is,

71
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,590
going by His Majesty's temper, he should've ordered the beheading of that bodyguard,

72
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,320
but now, not only has he allowed the princess to leave the palace, he's even allowed him to be kept alive.

73
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,000
Then again, the Ninth Princess has already been at the manor for quite a few days.

74
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,490
She hasn't even made any moves so far, assuming she's here for the sake of her lover.

75
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,380
<i>The general was not telling the truth.</i>

76
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,580
<i>Neither are we a harmonious couple.</i>

77
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,200
<i>Princess, if you trust me, listen to me and let me make all the arrangements.</i>

78
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,920
So there's actually nothing wrong with my Jin'er!

79
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,480
Did... Something happen to Lord Jin?

80
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,830
That Jin'er!

81
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,980
Not only was she testing me, but she also managed to come up with such an elaborate plan!

82
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,840
She even willing to risk her own life.

83
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,250
Since she came up with this plan within the plan,

84
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,620
now I will pay her back with a game within the game.

85
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,400
Princess?

86
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,750
Princess, what's happened?

87
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,480
Who has dared to bully you in the general's manor? Tell me!

88
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,350
No one has bullied me.

89
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,620
It... It was the general.

90
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,980
The general mistook Su Chen for an assassin and arrested him.

91
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,140
This Chu Xiuming is so muddleheaded!

92
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,910
He didn't even try to clarify the situation before arresting him.

93
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,170
It's all my fault, it's all my fault. I should have made things clear to him.

94
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,730
It's all right. He and I are not fated to be together in this lifetime.

95
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,880
I can only look forward to being with him in the next lifetime.

96
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,770
Please do not say such things.

97
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,140
I'm still here.

98
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,680
I'll tell Chu Xiuming to bring Su Chen back.

99
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,220
I'll go and tell him to do it right this instant.

100
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,780
General, you have worked hard. Jin'er is here to encourage you.

101
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,960
It's only about noon,

102
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,610
and Jin'er has already come here with good wine.

103
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,720
Are you trying to get me drunk,

104
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,430
and make me lose all logical sense?

105
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,010
Do you have any other intentions?

106
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,580
Then I'll be frank!

107
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,120
General, let him go.

108
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,320
Let him go? Let who go?

109
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,010
General, did you catch an assassin in the Princess's room?

110
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,280
That's right.

111
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,240
This person is a horrible criminal! He dared to attack the Princess?

112
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,430
Don't worry, Jin'er.

113
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,330
I, will definitely punish him heavily. I'll kill him today!

114
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,520
You can't kill him!

115
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,430
I can't kill him?

116
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,870
Why can't I?

117
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,100
Is he related to you?

118
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,000
He and I...

119
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,100
-Actually-
-Just who is he?

120
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,950
He is... someone who's closely related to us.

121
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,660
Closely related?

122
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,470
He wouldn't be some kind of friend to you?

123
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,270
He counts...

124
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,500
He's Ninth Princess's lover, right?

125
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,500
You know everything?

126
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,060
Silly Jin'er. Am I that stupid?

127
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,180
Lieutenant General!

128
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,620
Rou Rou.

129
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,720
What terminal illness does Her Ladyship have? You must tell me the truth.

130
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,420
Lieutenant General. Why are your words so mean?

131
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,940
You dare to curse Her Ladyship with having a terminal illness? Her body is just fine.

132
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,440
She's healthy and will live a long life!

133
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,520
Even General knows about this now. You don't need to keep it a secret.

134
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,700
Stop talking nonsense. I think you're the one who's sick.

135
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,280
Our Miss isn't sick!

136
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,530
I-!

137
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,160
If you don't believe me, come to the physicians' office with me. We just need to ask!

138
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,950
Since you also want to help Ninth Princess, then please listen to my plan.

139
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,810
Let's hear it.

140
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,980
Then I will explain it simply.

141
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,020
If there is anything you don't understand,

142
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,650
you can interrupt with questions!

143
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,850
Isn't it just asking for money,

144
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,330
pretending to die, and then running away?

145
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,410
Why wouldn't I understand?

146
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,700
R-r-right.

147
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,900
You could put it that way.

148
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,920
General, how did you know?

149
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,430
Jin'er, your plan is indeed quite...

150
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,560
quite...well thought out.

151
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,840
Of course!

152
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,020
My plan is called tricking the whole world without a single weakness!

153
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,220
If the princess pretends to die of an illness, what will we do about the body?

154
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,450
After the forensic expert examines the body, we will bury her!

155
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,440
Oh...and then?

156
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,300
In the graveyard,

157
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,620
we will make preparations to dig the princess out at any time!

158
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:27,480
Then what if the Emperor wants to take the princess's body back to the capital, to bury in the royal mausoleum?

159
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,010
How will you deal with that?

160
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,290
General...what should we do?

161
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,500
Don't panic, Jin'er. I'm here.

162
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,140
General, you have an idea?

163
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,880
Cut it out! Tell me!

164
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,240
We have to wait until the Chongyang Festival to do this.

165
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,870
How far away is the Chongyang Festival?

166
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,410
Then don't they still have to painfully wait for some time?

167
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,940
What's so hard about that?

168
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,790
Besides, this is your best acting!

169
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,300
My best acting?

170
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,670
If the Ninth Princess elopes, there must be no clues left behind,

171
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,740
with no news at all so that there won't be any grounds for people to talk about it.

172
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,090
Physician Li! What's wrong with Her Ladyship?

173
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,460
Her Ladyship indeed does not have a terminal illness.

174
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,350
Look! Didn't I tell you?

175
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,760
However...

176
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,500
However what? She really is sick, right?

177
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,850
Her Ladyship is not seriously sick,

178
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,750
but...her menstrual cycles are  irregular.

179
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,210
Didn't I tell you-?

180
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,250
Then...what does "irregular menstrual cycles" mean?

181
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,990
Nonsense!

182
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,880
What happened? Why are you panicking?

183
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,340
General! I have something to report!

184
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,930
Tell me.

185
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,230
There's one good news and one bad news. What do you want to hear first?

186
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,850
Good news.

187
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,110
Her Ladyship's life isn't in danger.

188
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,630
I know.

189
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,410
But-! The Lady-!

190
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,330
The bad news is she's not fully recovered yet! There's still lingering effects!

191
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,420
It's just a woman's disease.

192
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,300
Can illnesses be separated by gender?

193
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,410
No no no. We must find the best physician!

194
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,530
No matter what the price is, we must cure Her Ladyship!

195
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,660
It's fine. She just needs to drink more hot water.

196
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,800
General! How could you be like this?

197
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,830
After going through this obstacle, Her Ladyship was lucky not to die!

198
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,530
It is the heaven's blessing on you!

199
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,420
It is also a chance for you to have supreme enlightenment

200
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,220
on how important and precious Madam is.

201
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,000
General, you will know clearly.

202
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,160
I know.

203
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,400
Think about it carefully.

204
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,250
If anything happens to Her Ladyship and she dies,

205
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,020
in this world, you'll never see her face again,

206
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,330
you won't hear her voice, and be all alone.

207
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,260
It is such a sad thing!

208
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,100
I know.

209
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,600
Life is short. Obtaining true love is already very fortunate.

210
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,020
You almost lost Her Ladyship and got her back. You should treasure her more.

211
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,180
You must treat her even better, love her, spoil her, and listen to her!

212
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,170
Do you remember?

213
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,480
I will remember.

214
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,430
If you continue being like this and anger Her Ladyship into running away,

215
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,880
you will find yourself being isolated and with no one to rely on when you are old.

216
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,770
Hey! Starting from today, you must listen to everything Her Ladyship says!

217
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,290
You have to spoil her in food, drink, and clothes, taking good care of her!

218
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,390
Your words make sense. I have some official matters to deal with.

219
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,040
I have to investigate the terrain.

220
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,970
In a few days, I will implement this.

221
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,630
Thank you for your reminder.

222
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,620
You have to keep your word!

223
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,240
-Su Su!
-Rou Rou.

224
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,440
Look, the moon tonight is so beautiful.

225
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,910
Come and enjoy the moon with me.

226
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,020
Su Su, wait a moment for me.

227
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,530
I will bring something to Miss and the General and be right back.

228
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,380
Okay! I'll wait for you.

229
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,100
Wait for me!

230
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,860
General! General!

231
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,620
Gen...

232
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,410
General!

233
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,060
What is it?

234
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,350
I...came to bring something to you.

235
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,610
Okay, put it inside.

236
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,490
Why are there <i>two</i> Generals?

237
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,120
Did I eat too much? I'm seeing things?

238
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,120
Miss! Miss?

239
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
You're calling for me?

240
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,420
What's wrong? Did something happen?

241
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,780
A-are you going on a date with the General?

242
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,070
You don't need to care about that.

243
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,240
What's this? It's for me?

244
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,120
Put it inside the room.

245
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,110
This...

246
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,520
-Miss!
-You must-

247
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,130
General!

248
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,170
I don't need you here, go and sleep!

249
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,590
Let's go.

250
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,990
General! Miss!

251
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,200
I don't need you here. Go rest.

252
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,890
Am I seeing things?

253
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
Why are there Misses everywhere?

254
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,770
Why are there Generals everywhere?

255
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,130
W-why do you look so pale?

256
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,330
Miss and the General are married!

257
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,080
Suddenly a lot of Misses and Generals appeared!

258
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,520
You don't have a fever. What did you eat?

259
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,660
Did you eat something bad?

260
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,280
I must have eaten too much.

261
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,670
Who cares about that. Let's go enjoy the moon.

262
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,660
If not for Sister Jin and General's brilliant plan,

263
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:23,420
Su Chen and I, would have to waste tonight's moon.

264
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,830
Don't be so courteous, Ninth Princess.

265
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,730
The Chongyang Festival is tomorrow.

266
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,940
Jin'er and I will make the proper arrangements to help you two leave.

267
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,980
There's no need to worry.

268
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,190
Ninth Princess, don't worry.

269
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,970
General and I are here. There will be no problems.

270
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,660
Thank you for your kindness.

271
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,210
There is no way Su Chen and I can repay what you have done for us.

272
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,730
We are family!  There's no need to be so courteous.

273
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,880
Big Sister, General's move has borne great risk for me.

274
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,730
Su Chen and I are very grateful.

275
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,000
A close family member of mine gave me this makeup pendant.

276
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,460
When I was getting ready last time, I saw you liked it.

277
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,760
I will leave with you as a keepsake.

278
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,020
Then I will accept it!

279
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,400
It will be a long journey. Please be careful.

280
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,570
Tomorrow, we will use an escape trick that won't be spotted by others

281
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,610
which will eliminate evidence of crime.

282
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,300
<i>[Yong Ning Manor]</i>

283
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,030
General is taking Her Ladyship to enjoy the view during the Chongyang Festival.

284
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,960
What a pair of loving sweethearts.

285
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,550
Our Lady is lucky!

286
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,820
However...why is the General bringing Ninth Princess with him?

287
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,390
She's still a princess.

288
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,300
I really hope this princess disappears soon!

289
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,490
Don't get in the way of the General and our Lady!

290
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,240
You want to die?

291
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,770
Hurry and go!

292
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,130
Miss Xiao Cong!

293
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,320
Is the General in his library?

294
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,620
No!

295
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,690
Then he's in his own room?

296
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,770
No!

297
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,570
Then do you know where the General went?

298
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,150
I don't know!

299
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,090
Miss Xiao Cong...did I offend you?

300
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,500
Why are you so angry?

301
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,490
You offended me in many ways!

302
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,070
Then I will apologize here.

303
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,070
Y-you know what you did wrong?

304
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,610
You're just blindly apologizing.

305
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,200
I don't know.

306
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,920
But if you say I was wrong, then I was wrong!

307
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,340
What a fool.

308
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,950
General and Her Ladyship took Ninth Princess up the mountain to enjoy the view!

309
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,130
Then do you want to go?

310
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,900
-I will take you there!
-I don't.

311
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,720
The Princess, my wife, and I will go up the mountain to enjoy the view.

312
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,900
You all don't need to follow. Just wait here.

313
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,600
I must serve by the Princess's side!

314
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,240
It is a long walk. Your body won't be able to take it.

315
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,400
Instead, you will slow the Princess down.

316
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,280
You. Serve the Princess in her place.

317
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,720
Yes.

318
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,930
Princess, Wife, please.

319
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,460
Come.

320

News just came from outside the palace.

Ninth Princess went up the mountain to enjoy the view for the Chongyang Festival,

accidentally slipped and fell down the cliff.

Ninth Princess can be together with her lover forever!

That's such a happy thing!

378

I hope they can be happy together forever. That way, our efforts won't have been in vain.

As her big sister, I helped her fulfill her wish.

380
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,340
Thankfully, Chu Xiuming trusts me a lot.

381
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,580
He didn't get angry at me for keeping secrets.

382
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,280
I should give him a reward!

383
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,580
How are you going to reward me?

384
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,300
Why are you eavesdropping on me like a thief?

385
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,190
I didn't eavesdrop.

386
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,410
You were talking to yourself.

387

I have you to protect me! Why should I be afraid of a thief?

391
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,300
I just have to protect myself against you!

392
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:43,560
Now that you mention it, you must discuss everything with me in the future!

you're not afraid I'll run away?

What is it? It's made you so worried.

The poets have said that not meeting for one day is like three years.

450
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,500
I've always considered it as pretentious and fake.

Only now that I have you by my side,

I have long become the devoted lover from those poems.

455

00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,640
I cannot bear to be separated from my Jin'er.

But...there is something important I have to do.

Why don't you take me with you?

464
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,120
I definitely won't get in your way!

465
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,600
But I have to go to Falcon Tribe territory.

466
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,640
Bringing you along might not be convenient.

467
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,820
I have important matters to deal with. i don't have the time to play with you.

468
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,410
That's fine. You will deal with your matters.

469
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,260
I will take Rou Rou and play on my own!

470
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,150
But I'm still uneasy.

471
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,420
How about this? Have Lieutenant General Xiuyuan protect you two.

472
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,330
Then once you're finished, come and find us!

00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,610
You must take good care of Her Ladyship.

477
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,950
Don't worry, General. I won't let anything happen to Her Ladyship.

478
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,610
Don't worry! With them here, I'll be fine!

479
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,670
I'm afraid you'll have so much fun, you'll forget about me!

480
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:30,000
You must not get so caught up in official matters that you'll forget me!

481
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,720
Then I will go take care of my matters. Let's meet up at the inn once we're finished.

482
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,970
Okay! Hurry and go!

483
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,510
Look at this! Look at this! 
 - 包子

484
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,010
热气腾腾的包子

485
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,000
Why don't you buy two?

486
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,840
-There's little sheep too!
-Little sheep!

487
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,410
Take a look!

488
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,410
How pretty!

489
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,000
Miss!

490
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,660
This is so unique! I've never seen this before.

491
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,550
Look at this! It's so well made!

492
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,650
There's this too! Does it match my clothes?

493
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,850
-Let me try it on!
-Does this look good?

494
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,550
Let him see it!

495
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,510
Xiuyuan, do I or Rou Rou look better?

496
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,620
My Lady looks good no matter what you wear!

497
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,780
Xiuyuan has good taste!

498
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,080
That's fine! I just need Su Su to think I'm pretty!

499
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,480
How do I wear this?

500
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,110
Rou Rou.

501
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,400
Rou Rou! What do you think?

502
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,550
It looks so good!

503
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,750
It's so pink!

504
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,840
里边看一看啊

505
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,210
Let's go.

506
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,000
Lieutenant General! Come here!

507
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,580
What is it, My Lady?

508
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,460
Try on this pair of shoes!

509
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,700
You don't need to buy a pair for me.

510
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,840
Lieutenant General, you've misunderstood.

511
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,450
I'm buying it for your General!

512
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,360
Since it's for the General, allow me to try it on!

513
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,510
But now that you mention it, let me buy you a pair too!

514
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,950
You don't need to, My Lady.

515
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:33,810
It's fine, it's fine! Look! It fits you so well! Let's buy it!

516
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,500
Boss! I want this pair of shoes!

517
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,180
Okay!

518
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,820
Boss, I want this too!

519
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,250
Okay!

520
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,040
Try this on too!

521
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,010
Thank you My Lady!

522
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,660
It's fine!

523
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,170
-Miss, how does this look?
-Let me see.

524
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,020
Please take a look at this for me.

525

<i>[Bonus Scene]</i>

526
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,900
General, you won this for the person you love.

527
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,980
I am not your lover. I should return it.

528
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,540
I was rash. Please punish me.

529
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:46,320
You and your wife are very deeply in love.

530
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,610
I am very envious of you.

531
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:54,140
I hope that you can put this on Her Ladyship yourself.

532
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,410
From now on, be happy and grow old together.

533
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,340
Thank you for your blessings.

534
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,660
I will not forsake your hopes.

535
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,470
My Lady and I will be together for life.
