Are all of you here?

20
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,800
I'm on a tight schedule today,

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,650
so instead of facing you all one at a time,

22
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,950
why don't I take you all on at one go?

23
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,490
Have you all brought those items from home?

Do you understand the rules?

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,180
Understand!

26
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,870
Does anyone still have questions?

27
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,060
Say.

28
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,950
That... I-I forgot to bring it with me.

29
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,070

00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,530

Lord Jin has won!

32
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,750
Move your meat stall three steps to the left

33
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,750
so it won't block the vegetable booth.

34
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,490
I agreed on the bet, and I have accepted my loss.

35

Lord Jin has won!

36
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,030
Stop hitting your child. If you persist, you'll be hit instead.

Lord Jin has won!

38
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,890
Go home and spend more time with your wife and kids!

39
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,960
Lord Jin has won again!

40

- Pay back the debts you owe over the next few days.
- <i>Lord Jin won again!</i>

41
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,710
Go home earlier to cook.

- Find someone and get married soon. 
 <i>- Lord Jin wins!</i>

00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,630
Lord Jin, you let me win. (T/N A polite saying after winning a game.)

48
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,740
Go ahead. What's wrong?

49
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,070
Lord Jin, please help me open up a treasure chest that was handed down to me by my family.

50
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,230
A treasure chest!

51
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,030
So that was your predicament.

52
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,280
You should've told me earlier so I could open it up for you.

53
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,020
Now I've been embarrassed in front of so many people.

54
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,920
I'll go back home with you later to open it.

55
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,370
There's no need, there's no need. It's here.

56
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,930
That must be it. Over here, over here!

57
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,850
No, no.

58
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,600
It's here.

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,100
I-It's here.

60
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,030
Okay.

61
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,840
I'll open it up for you.

62
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,540
Let me borrow your hairpin.

63
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,630
It's been opened so easily?

64
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,590
Let me see.

65
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,380
It's empty.

66
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,530
Where's your treasure?

67
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,680
I said... I was referring to the family treasure <i>chest</i> that was handed down to me.

68
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,020
Okay, then put the treasure chest away safely.

69
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,650
Lord Jin, your reputation for lock picking is certainly well deserved.

70
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,900
- "Practice makes perfect." 
 - What?

71
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,300
Lord Jin, you're actually...

72
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,230
You can't go around mouthing off like that.

73
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,080
If that Devil General were to overhear you, he'd think I was a thief and lock me up.

74
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,720
How could anyone lock you up, Lord Jin?

75
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,100
That's right.

76
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,160
That's right.

77
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,930
If anyone asks any questions, I was never here.

78
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,610
Don't let him get away!

79
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,950
- Lord Jin! 
 - He's run away!

80
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,410
Lord Jin, don't go!

81
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,730
Move aside!

82
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,600
Stop right there!

83
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,630
Move aside! Move aside!

84
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,070
Stop right there! Stop running!

85
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,230
Move aside! Move aside!

86
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,070
Stop right there! Stop running!

87
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,760
That's amazing!

88
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,830
- Stop right there! 
 - Stop right there!

89
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,990
Move aside! Move aside!

90
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,020
Is it that difficult?

91
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,400
Stop there!

92
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,860
Stop right there!

93
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,640
Did I get it in?

94
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,020
Lord Jin, run!

95
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,430
Run? Go ahead and run!

96
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,990
Really?

97
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,930
<i>[Rui Royal Manor]</i>

98
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,830

99
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,670
Lord Jin!

100
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,040
The young miss of the Rui Royal Manor is indeed an outstanding beauty.

101
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,790
The third miss is certainly devastatingly beautiful.

102
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,860
and is so lovable and docile.

103

<i>[Without the Compass and Square, One Cannot form Circles and Squares]</i>

104
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:41,520
"Without the compass and square, one cannot form circles and squares." (T/N Rules are necessary to form character)

105
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,000
<i>(An idiom by Mencius - without rules, nothing can be done.)</i>

106
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,360
The Emperor is bestowing marriage this time based on the portraits.

107
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,460
But why is  little Jin the only one having her portraits painted?

108
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,540
Her mother was only a servant who washed feet.

109
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,880
If she hadn't taken advantage of Father while he was drunk,

110
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,870
why would we end up with a sister that doesn't do much and runs around wild.

111
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,510
Everything she has in the manor, be it food or clothing, cannot be compared to even my highest ranked servants.

112
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,110
How could she claim to be related to us?

113
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,010
I'm afraid they'll smear our manor's reputation as they're living there in that bungalow.

114
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,700
Elder Sister, do not fret.

115
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,950
It was my servant who led the Painter to his room.

116
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,360
and made sure he painted my Third Older Sister

117
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,470
as beautiful as flowers and precious jade.

118
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,180
You've made her look slightly chubbier.

119
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,130
This... It's better for her to look more ample. It's better for her to look more ample.

120
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,840
Okay.

121
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,290
You can also go down.

122
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,930
Yes.

123
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,450
Why're you still smiling?

124
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,380
You are dismissed.

125
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,400
The imperial edict has arrived!

126
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,290
We just sent out the portrait, and the imperial edict has already arrived?

127
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,730
Aren't they moving a little too quickly?

128
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,890
Why're you still smiling?

129
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,610
Stop smiling!

130
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,160
By the grace of God,

131
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,350
the emperor proclaimed:

132
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,440
It is said that the young ladies of Rui Royal Manor are virtuous, generous,

133
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,100
gentle, kind-hearted and outstandingly beautiful.

134
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,020
Upon hearing this, I am very pleased.

135
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,690
Lord Yongning reached his twenties this year,

136
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,740
it is time for him to get married.

137
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,130
A worthy woman should be chosen.

138
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,720
According the seniority order,

139
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,650
the second Miss Shen still haven't been betrothed

140
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,380
and is worthy to be called a match made in Heaven with Lord Yongning.

141
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,140
In order to see a couple come together,

142
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,480
you have specially been betrothed to Lord Yongning as his imperial concubine.

143
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,010
Everything will be done according to protocols for a princess.

144
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,910
The Board of Rites and head of Board of Astronomy will be in charge.

145
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,130
The blessed time has been chosen. You will depart tomorrow.

146
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,800
And you should marry as soon as you arrive.

147
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,670
So decrees the Emperor.

148
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,810
Chu Xiuming.

149
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,910
Lord Yongning.

150
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,800
The Devil General!

151
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,030
Father always loved Zi'er the best.

152
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,130
You can't force me to that devilish living hell!

153
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,490
Isn't it letting me forfeit my whole life ?

154
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,410
It's true, Your Highness. You always loved Zi'er the most.

155
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,220
I believe, you won't have the heart to

156
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,150
let her be devastated by that tyrant, right?

157
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,580
- My Lord. 
- What does a married women like you know?

158
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,420
If I refuse this, it's defying an imperial order!

159
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,850
It's a crime worth being decapitated!

160
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,720
Father, why are you yelling at Mother?

161
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,360
Mother is just being caring.

162
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,510
She feels sorry for the girl forced into marrying far away from home.

163
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,580
Jin'Er, it's mother who spoke too much.

164
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,350
Father. I heard the wet nurses of the palace saying

165
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,790
that at that time, second sister was born around the same time as the third sister.

166
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,550
When third sister was born, because of an inborn weakness,

167
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,920
she still isn't on the genealogical record.

168
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,680
It's chaotic at the time the children were being born.

169
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,380
It's unclear who was born first, right?

170
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,340
It's true, Your Majesty.

171
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,670
After Eldest sister married,

172
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,490
the Rui royal family didn't have any more daughters of the formal wife.

173
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,540
To the emperor, as long as it's a daughter of the Rui royal family, it should be fine.

174
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,380
According to the family order, I wasn't the second child.

175
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,660
Father, you always said I am pure, because I'm still young.

176
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,800
Thinking like this...

177
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,790
Perhaps Shen Jin is the second daughter!

178
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,490
You pretend all day long to be the girl of a wealthy family, you didn't learn anything good.

179
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,030
You're an expert at malicious attacks!

180
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,620
Jin'er. My Lord.

181
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,770
On the day she was born, Jin'er really came after the second miss.

182
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,810
Your Majesty, I remember clearly,

183
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,720
Jin'er was born first.

184
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,610
Moreover, the portrait that was sent to the palace today was of Jin'er!

185
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,780
Since things are like this,

186
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,330
this wedding alliance is extremely important to the Rui Royal Manor.

187
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,400
No matter which daughter has to marry,

188
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,960
My Lord will be thankful on behalf of all Rui Royal Manor,

189
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,600
and will send her to get married in style.

190
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,040
Good.

191
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,600
She's right.

192
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,950
Let's do it her way.

193
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,660
Then, let's marry Jin'er off.

194
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,320
My Lord!

195
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,580
Thank you, my Lord!

196
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,330
Thank you, Father.

197
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,760
I-

198
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,670
I won't marry!

199
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,080
If you don't then who will?

200
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,050
Jin'er. Jin'er, come back.

201
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,810
- Miss! 
-Jin'er, come back!

202
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,150
Because Shen Jin was weak at birth, she wasn't registered in the family book.

203
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,380
My Lord always remembered it.

204
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,590
Now he dares to open the ancestral hall right before the wedding,

205
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,960
he wants to formally add Shen Jin's name and birth date on record.

206
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,230
Consort Chen, why are you not cooperating?

207
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,260
Even though Jin'er's Eight Characters (T/N One's birth year, month, day and hour used for fortune-telling.)

208
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,060

209
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,430
but the family has our own record.

212

You'd better cooperate.

213
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm not going to send to my daughter to a living hell.

214
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,810

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,680
It's a trap!

324
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:13,560
<i>Great! Great! Great! Great!</i>

325
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,040
Ruoruo.

326
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,810
- Miss, what is it? 
- Let's go.

327
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,690
- Where? 
- They left!

328
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,160
Let's go, quick.

329
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,850
Miss, how come so many people died?

330
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,610
They.

331
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,080
Will they come back?

332
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,450
No way! They must have forgotten us!

333
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,840
They forgot about welcoming the bride.

334
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,930
You are right.

335
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:20,030
They really seem like they forgot us.

336
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,520
Miss, will we die of hunger here?

337
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,070
Even though it's desolate here, but the soil is soft.

338
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,710
If we follow the horse tracks, we can find them.

339
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,590
But they are riding horses.

340
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,360
We don't know how to ride, we can only walk.

341
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,300
How long must we walk?

342
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,090
No matter how long I must walk, I must find the general's manor.

343
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,710
Miss, wait for me!

344
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,080
- Give it to me. 
- I'm too tired.

345
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,770
Miss, I'll soon be to tired to keep walking.

346
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,710
What is this for?

347
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,550
<i>Don't close the doors! We haven't got in yet!</i>

348
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,900
<i>Don't close the doors! Wait for us!</i>

349
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,100
<i>[Eternal Peace Manor]</i>

350
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,370
Miss, it must be here.

351
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,270
We finally arrived!

352
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,180
It's right here. Chu Xiuming! Yong Ningbo Chu Xiuming!

353
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,480
Open the door! Come out and speak!

354
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,850
- Don't pretend to be dead inside!
- Open the doors!

355
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,530
The general's bride arrived! Open the door!

356
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,860
- Open the door!
- The general's bride arrived, open the door!

357
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,670
I knocked until my hand got red, how come no one opens the door?

358
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,730
Miss, there must be no one.

359
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,900
Is it that they are not back yet?

360
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,090
I say, they don't dare coming out!

361
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,280
Let's think about a way to get in.

362
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,740
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

363
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,060
[Eternal Peace Manor]

364
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,920
Let's go.

365
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,980
This wall is too tall.

366
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,020
I don't believe that I, Shen Jin, can't get in!

367
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,930
Look! There should be fine!

368
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,620
It's okay.

369
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,600
Ruoruo, let's go!

370
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,060
Are you ready?

371
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,100
Ruoruo, come up!

372
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,320
It's okay. Please spare me.

373
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,040
Then wait for me at the door.

374
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,400
Once I'm in I'll open the door for you.

375
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,530
Good thing Ruoruo didn't come in.

376
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,670
- Miss!
- What is it?

377
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,780
Give you this.

378
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,700
What is this?

379
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,320
For emergency needs!

380
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,740
I'll wait for you at the door.

381
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,690
Okay. I know.

382
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,760
Such a big general's manor, how come there is no one?

383
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,800
Where's the main gate?

384
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,600
<i>Finally somewhere lighted up!</i>

385
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,600
It's pitch dark.

386
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Even though it's advantageous to take cover, but it's unconvenient to move.

387
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,200
Good thing I'm prepared.

388
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,100
Who are you?

389
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,000
You can't be...

390
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,800
Chu Xiuming's page boy!

391
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,200
Looking at your refined look, you are.

392
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,930
Then I'm not hiding you

393
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:15,200
I'm your general's wife.

394
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
General's wife?

395
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,000
No need to be so courteous.

396
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,900
Can you let me go first?

397
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,500
Don't worry.

398
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,300
I won't tell the General you flirted with me.

399
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,000
But you need to help me do something.

400
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,500
Today when I was in distress, there's one thing I want to ask.

401
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,000
If you help me, I'll repay your kindness.

402
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,340
Where is that devil Chu Xiuming?

403
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,400
Quick, tell me!

404
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,100
Tell me!

405
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,700
Devil?

406
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,500
Look at you this young inexperienced in life, ignorant and ill-informed appearance of yours.

407
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,900
You must not have seen Chu Xiuming on the battlefield killing people without blinking an eye.

408
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,600
It's okay. You're usually in this room cleaning.

409
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,400
It's a fortunate thing.

410
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,000
As long as you tell me where is Chu Xiuming, I'll give you this.

411
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,300
If he's a devil, why looking for him?

412
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,800
Didn't I say? I'm his wife.

413
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,700
He said he'll come get me, but left me behind halfway.

414
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,900
Since you were left behind,

415
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,800
is coming to get married once more?

416
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,900
I walk all this way to get here, not to get married with him.

417
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,000
I came to argue with him.

418
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,300
Marrying me or not is his business, accepting or not is mine.

419
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,800
But he can't leave me behind in a shady manner.

420
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,000
Moreover, I was also forced by circumstances to come here to marry.

421
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,800
<i>Then, leaving me is okay.</i>

422
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,600
<i>But, I can't go back.</i>

423
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,700
How do I explain if I'm going back?

424
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,000
You're just a sloaw coach, there's no use in telling you.

425
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,100
Since you don't know where is Chu Xiuming, you still must know where's the main door?

426
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,300
Tell me where's the main door. My maid is still waiting for me by the door.

427
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,200
Okay, okay.

428
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Thanks for your kindness.

429
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,500
I'm not a spy! I'm accompanying the girl who's getting married!

430
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,800
We came by foot.

431
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,600
I know you are accompanying the bride.

432
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,700
- Where's the lady? 
 - She went in.

433
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,500
Liar! I just came out and haven't seen her shadow.

434
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,000
I saw you talking with this spy when I came out.

435
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,400
You're treating me unjustly!

436
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,900
Miss! Come and save me!

437
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,910
Let her!

438
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,200
- Let go of Rou Rou! Let go of her! 
- Miss!

439
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,900
Miss! Save me quickly!

440
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,400
Let me go.

441
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,300
<i>This Devil General isn't only a demon, but is also unbelievably ugly.</i>

442
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,000
<i>Having an appearance like this, he really is very ugly.</i>

443
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,700
<i>And dares to bully Ruoruo!</i>

444
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,400
Let her go. Look attentively,

445
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,800
Look attentively,I am your wife.
<i>[T/N: Wife and Lady are pronounced the same.]</i>

446
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,400
What are you doing?

447
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,100
<i>Does this mean this demon realized he has a conscience,</i>

448
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,500
<i>or is it that I am naturally the ennemi of demons?</i>

449
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,200
<i>As soon as he saw me, the demon submitted himself to me.</i>

450
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,600
<i>It seems I was destined to act.</i>

451
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,600
Since you recognized my position as Lady,

452
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,900
then you must know where you have been wrong today.

453
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,500
Let's not mention being husband and wife for now.

454
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Let's just talk about how you left me, your wife, in the wild,

455
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
- who do you think you are? 
 - General.

456
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,400
- General.

457
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,600
Still General?

458
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,100
You even kneeled in front of me, what face do you fear to lose?

459
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,300
I'm telling you, a mistake is a mistake.

460
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,000
Just acknowledge your mistake. Moreover, I can't do anything to you.

461
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,200
Afterall, you, Chu Xiuming, are a very outstanding person.

462
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,400
It's just that your reputation is a little bit lacking.

463
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,600
Madam, General—

464
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,800
Again General.

465
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm calling you Chu Xiuming! What's wrong with Chu Xiuming?

466
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,600
Having a name isn't it to be used by others?

467
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,300
<i>Why do you care about those titles?</i>

468
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,500
<i>You aren't born with those titles and won't bring them with you in the afterlife!</i>

469
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,700
Miss!

470
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,600
General!

471
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,200
You're also the general?

472
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
- In your back. 
 - What in my back?

473
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,000
Isn't Chu Xiuming right there? What in my back?

474
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,300
General.

475
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,200
General, Madam came back.

476
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,100
Who is the general?

477
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,200
I am Chu Xiuming.

478
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,700
<i>[Easter egg]</i>

479
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,800
<i>Today's victory, you worked hard.</i>

480
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,100
<i>General, today we beat the Falcon tribe's strongest troops.</i>

481
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,400
<i>Most likely, their strength must have greatly suffered.</i>

482
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,700
<i>The previous three wives were all spies.</i>

483
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,300
General, are you suspecting the new bride is also one?

484
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,100
The Falcon tribe is well informed, using her as a bait is most suitable, but

485
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,400
if it's a spy, bringing her back to the manor to deal with her, there's no way to account for it to the imperial court.

486
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,400
If she was killed by the Falcon tribe, then there's no problem.

487
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,600
<i>This is killing two birds with one stone.</i>

488
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,800
General, this is brilliant.

489
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,170
Where is she?

490
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,100
We only cared about our victory, we forgot about her.

491
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,300
That she's still over there is my fault. I'm leaving right away.

492
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,000
Wait.

493
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,700
Bao Zitou go instead of deputy general Chu.

494
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,300
Yes.

495
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,700
Go back to the barracks first.

496
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,200
Yes!

497
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:08,000
