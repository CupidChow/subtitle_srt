19
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,430
His Majesty has ordered us to search the general's manor.

20
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,610
Don't tell me His Majesty believes I have rescued my wife.

21
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,220
Or was it you whispering suggestions in His Majesty's ear

22
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,070
and purposely causing trouble for me?

23
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:53,480
General Chu, is His Majesty's will something others can influence?

24
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,760
My Lord, we didn't find anything.

25
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,570
General Chu, it's late already. Please rest early.

26
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,410
- Let's go. <br> - Yes.

27
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,410
General.

28
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,840
It's fine as long as Miss is safe.

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,680
I have been worrying the whole day and afraid there would be bad news.

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,380
Su Su, if you have any news going forward quickly let the manor know.

31
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,720
Luckily, the General returned early today.

32
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,120
Otherwise, things would have been really bad.

33
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,320
I know, Rou Rou.

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,160
I will remember this in my heart and let you know immediately.

35
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,410
General, when you go to see Miss, can you bring me also?

36
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,080
At least I can take care of her.

37
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,210
Lord Liu has been slandering me in front of His Majesty for a long time.

38
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,310
He will definitely not let this opportunity go by without dealing with me.

39
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,620
The manor was most likely monitored from top to bottom early on by others.

40
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,360
Rou Rou, it's best that you stay in the manor to act as a cover.

41
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,840
What the general said is right.

42
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,180
Rou Rou, you shouldn't go anywhere.

43
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,800
It's safer to stay here.

44
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,940
The most important thing right now is Our Lady's safety.

45
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,090
I'll stay here in the manor and take care of it for the general and Miss.

46
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,160
You're awake. Here.

47
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,710
The medicine has just been made ready.

48
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,850
Here. Slowly, slowly.

49
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,330
It's best to have it while it's hot.

50
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,630
Where is the general?

51
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,730
Xiuyuan confirmed that the city is now safe so the general made his way back.

52
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,220
Don't worry. I will take care of you.

53
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,590
Here.

54
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,680
I wonder how my mother is doing right now.

55
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,470
I asked Xiuyuan to find out.

56
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,800
Think about it. If the general can return to the city, it means your mother is fine right now.

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,600
You should take better care of your health so you can recover

58
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,470
before thinking about other issues, all right?

59
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,160
If you're still worried, I'll go and take a look personally.

60
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,320
Since my husband asked me to trust him,

61
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,400
so naturally I will trust him.

62
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,690
He will definitely be able to save my mother and the rest of the people from Rui's Royal Manor.

63
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,400
Here, drink this quickly.

64
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,730
It's already been an hour.

65
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,170
Why is he still not here?

66
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,480
Quickly, go have a look.

67
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,770
My Lord won't be coming today. He wants Lord Liu to carry out the agreed-upon plan accordingly.

68
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,970
Finally, it's the highlight of the plan.

69
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,150
- Big Brother. <br> - How was your investigation?

70
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,420
I searched for the whole night, last night, and still could not find out the person in black from that day.

71
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,070
Seems like they are very alert.

72
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,770
So, this is the same as what's inside Eighth Prince's seal?

73
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,650
It's not completely confirmed yet.

74
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,780
Miss Ruonan said she would take a look into it.

75
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,840
So, you're saying that there are clues to my father's death?

76
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,630
We still have to look at the bigger picture. We can't rush it.

77
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,180
I won't be leaving the city for a while. Take good care of my wife and Miss Ruonan.

78
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,300
The village can't be discovered by anyone.

79
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,220
Don't worry, Brother. I will protect them for sure.

80
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,960
<i>[Front Bridge Eighth Prince]</i>

81
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,290
I didn't see anyone.

82
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,500
See to packing some clothes to send to your sister-in-law.

83
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,820
Yes, I will set off in a while.

84
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,120
Go quickly.

85
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,210
Why didn't Brother tell me what was in the letter?

86
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,280
Could it be that it's dangerous?

87
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,850
- Lord Liu. <br> - General Chu.

88
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:37,320
Lord Liu, what is the matter? Why are you using this method to talk with me?

89
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,330
It's not safe to talk here. Please follow me to somewhere quiet, General.

90
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,660
There is no one here. Let's speak here.

91
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,690
Could it be that Lord Liu has a dark secret he can't share?

92
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,030
Why would I have a dark secret?

93
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,820
I came to look for you today

94
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,450
so I could tell you the truth about something.

95
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,410
The truth?

96
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,050
His Majesty ordered me to investigate the issue of the general rescuing someone.

97
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,940
If I find evidence, then I am to immediately arrest the general and execute your wife.

98
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,590
If I can't find any evidence, then I am to create evidence to arrest the general.

99
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,090
Lord Liu, what you're saying is sowing mistrust between me and His Majesty.

100
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,490
Why are you doing this?

101
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,930
You have been guarding the border for years.

102
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,970
You don't know much about the happenings in the Imperial Court.

103
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,580
We were never enemies.

104
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,710
If I had offended you in any way, I was helpless and forced into doing it.

105
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,630
Lord Liu, if this is what you want to say today,

106
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,090
I will excuse myself. Farewell.

107
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,500
You don't have any way out.

108
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,510
General Chu, with just an order from me,

109
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,520
you will be imprisoned for breaking into prison to privately saving a criminal.

110
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,850
Let's not even talk about your wife.

111
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,940
You won't be able to protect yourself from being beheaded either.

112
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,070
His Majesty is determined to go against you.

113
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,220
I can help you to get through this crisis.

114
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,330
Lord Liu, you think so highly of yourself.

115
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,540
You dare to go against His Majesty.

116
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,690
I've done nothing to deserve you doing this favor for me.

117
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,840
Eighth Prince.

118
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,280
I believe you've also heard about what happened back then.

119
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,010
Everyone knew that Eighth Prince was the future emperor,

120
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,210
but a major fire burned his manor to ashes.

121
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,700
Eighth Prince died in the fire. That's how His Majesty ascended the throne.

122
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,440
His Majesty taking over the throne has always been unjustified and undeserving.

123
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,650
Why was there a fire at Eighth Prince's manor? It's very suspicious.

124
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,330
Are you implying that His Majesty had the fire set to his manor?

125
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,860
General Chu, I have been an official for more than twenty years.

126
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,410
Eighth Prince promoted me. That's how I got into the Imperial Court.

127
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,170
But I was a junior official then and

128
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,610
couldn't redress injustice for Eighth Prince.

129
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,040
Lord Liu, what exactly is your intention for wanting to see me today?

130
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,590
Eighth Prince had a good relationship with the Zhu Clan.

131
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,220
His Majesty is now deliberately going against you.

132
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,660
As a former underling of Eighth Prince,

133
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,370
I fear you will end up like him.

134
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,440
If you join forces with me,

135
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,000
I will redress the injustice for Eighth Prince and keep your family safe.

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I merely want to protect my family.

137
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,340
I'm not interested in affairs of the state.

138
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,780
Besides, Lord Liu, this is treason.

139
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,350
You have done great merit for guarding the border

140
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,230
and His Majesty wants to sentence you to death!

141
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,630
You are still so foolishly loyal.

142
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,980
It will only cause the elimination of your nine clans.

143
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,810
His Majesty is deadset on getting rid of you.

144
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,450
General Chu, if you want to protect your family,

145
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,040
why not accept my suggestion?

146
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,760
You want to redress injustice for Eighth Prince.

147
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,170
But what can be done by just you alone?

148
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,750
Eighth Prince has many supporters in the Imperial Court.

149
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,650
You control the army. If there's chaos in the kingdom, only you can mobilize the Chu Army.

150
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,360
By then, with our collaboration, we can succeed.

151
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,780
I can't trust you just based on what you're saying.

152
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,730
I can only confirm when I see the rest of the people.

153
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,180
This can be done easily.

154
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,370
I will make the arrangements to show you our sincerity.

155
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,050
Older Brother!

156
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,450
Xiuyuan, why haven't you gone to the village yet?

157
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,560
Are you going to accept Lord Liu's suggestion?

158
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,890
You followed me?

159
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,210
Older Brother, Lord Liu is very cunning. Don't fall into his trap.

160
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,170
Xiuyuan, do you want to find the cause of Eighth Prince's death?

161
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,210
I want to find the cause of his death,

162
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,750
but we can't use this method.

163
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,620
We finally have a lead about Eighth Prince's death.

164
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,940
Lord Liu said he's a follower of Eighth Prince. I can't give up now.

165
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,070
Older Brother, don't fall into his trap when there's nothing certain.

166
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,950
- I don't agree with this. <br> - Don't talk about it.

167
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Take good care of my wife.

168
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,130
Leave now.

169
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,700
- Older Brother! <br> <i>- Go now.</i>

170
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,740
Sir, I thank you for making my medicine.

171
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,150
I... I forgot you can't hear me.

172
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,120
Many thanks.

173
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,310
It's so bitter.

174
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,190
I have been drinking this for several days.

175
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,270
For the sake of my child, I must finish it.

176
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,720
I thank you. Such beautiful flowers.

177
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,210
<i>Mother, I wonder how you are doing.</i>

178
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,520
<i>I wonder how my husband is doing in the city.</i>

179
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,440
<i>I'm old.</i>

180
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,570
<i>I merely hope that</i>

181
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,270
<i>you'll never need to come back here.</i>

182
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,470
<i>- Mother. <br> - Jin'er.</i>

183
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,110
<i>Mother.</i>

184
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,230
<i> My Jin'er. </i>

185
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,870
<i> My Jin'er is back. </i>

186
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,120
<i>I miss you very much, Mother.</i>

187
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,630
<i>Let me give you a big hug. Jin'er, stop crying.</i>

188
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,200
<i>You are not at fault.</i>

189
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,550
<i>You weren't willing to marry and live far away.</i>

190
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,430
<i>However, you have suffered.</i>

191
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,480
♫ <i> Paint a landscape scene </i> ♫

192
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,600
♫ <i> To capture yesterday's glory </i> ♫

193
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,920
♫ <i> Things look the same, but so much has changed </i> ♫

194
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,650
♫ <i> After seeing the ups and down of life </i> ♫

195
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,180
♫ <i> Sun sets in the western wind</i> ♫

196
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,090
♫ <i> As I finally return in victory </i> ♫

197
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,320
<i>Since young till now,</i>

198
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,390
<i>my mother has been protecting me from getting hurt.</i>

199
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,290
<i>But she has always suffered.</i>

200
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,390
I finally got married and still couldn't give you a good life.

201
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,970
I was so focused on my life with the general.

202
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,200
Not that you are in trouble,

203
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,300
I don't even know how to save you.

204
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,800
If I hadn't replaced my second sister and married on her behalf,

205
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,530
perhaps, all this wouldn't have happened.

206
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,140
But if I hadn't done that, I wouldn't have met my husband.

207
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,700
Mother,

208
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,460
what should I do?

209
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,720
Sister-in-Law.

210
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,070
Xiuyuan!

211
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,940
Xiuyuan, how's my family? Is my husband all right?

212
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,690
The Rui family is fine for the time being. You just can't see them for now.

213
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,880
Older Brother wanted me to bring the medicine that's scarce here.

214
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,660
Rou Rou packed these clothes for you.

215
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,420
If you need anything else, just let me know.

216
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,310
Xiuyuan, why do you look so pale?

217
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,760
I didn't sleep well last night. I'm fine.

218
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,170
If there are any problems, you must not hide them from me.

219
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,260
At this juncture now, we must not hide anything from each other.

220
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,590
Since the Rui family is fine, something must have happened to the general!

221
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,000
Did His Majesty arrest him? Is he all right?

222
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,140
No, no, he's fine.

223
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,130
His Majesty didn't arrest him. It's just that he can't leave the city now.

224
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,780
What's troubling you then?

225
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,930
Sister-in-Law, there's something I couldn't persuade the general with.

226
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,770
There's something you couldn't persuade him with?

227
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,230
Xiuyuan, it's fine. Tell me. I will think of a solution for you.

228
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,240
His Majesty... Lord Liu, who's always antagonistic towards Older Brother, met the general privately,

229
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,370
and told him that His Majesty is going to arrest him.

230
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,480
He wants him to rebel in Eighth Prince's name.

231
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,990
Rebel?

232
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,670
I was afraid Older Brother would be used by others, so I didn't want him to meet Lord Liu and his accomplices.

233
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,530
But he refused to listen.

234
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,910
He wants to protect you and also find out the cause of Eighth Prince's death.

235
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,710
Older Brother is determined. He doesn't want me to be involved.

236
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,760
Did this matter have to get to this point?

237
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,180
I don't think so. His Majesty hasn't made any moves on the Rui family.

238
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,450
Moreover, Older Brother is fine, too. He's not in danger.

239
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,600
Xiuyuan, help me get a letter back.

240
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,150
Sure.

241
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,310
Medicines.

242
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,280
It's medicine.

243
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,830
Hold it properly.

244
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,470
General Chu.

245
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,620
Take a seat.

246
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,240
Come, everyone. Let's sit.

247
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,770
Right Guard General, General Zuo.

248
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,180
Lord Liang from the Ministry of Personnel.

249
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,920
Imperial Historian, Lord Chen.

250
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,720
So you are all Eighth Prince's men.

251
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,500
The four of us were promoted by Eighth Prince.

252
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:11,180
All these years, we have been investigating the cause of his death.

253
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,380
Is there any outcome?

254
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,570
When Eighth Prince was alive,

255
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,850
the former emperor entrusted him to investigate the embezzlement in the treasury.

256
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,150
Eighth Prince ordered me to investigate this in secret.

257
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:28,440
I found out that the current emperor participated in it, too.

258
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,290
After I reported this to Eighth Prince, in less than a day,

259
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,490
his manor caught fire.

260
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,770
I captured the arsonist,

261
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,650
but he killed himself by taking poison.

262
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,920
With the crowning of the new emperor,

263
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,240
the matter simply ended.

264
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,660
Regarding the fire and embezzlement from the national treasury,

265
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,180
was there any evidence?

266
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,990
Well, I'm the witness.

267
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,560
All these years, I have always wanted to redress the injustice for Eighth Prince.

268
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,250
General Chu, I was involved in this, too.

269
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,310
Lord Liang spoke the truth.

270
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,700
However, the power of Eighth Prince was close to crumbling back then.

271
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,740
There was no way to confirm it.

272
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,050
But there's still some remaining evidence of the embezzlement.

273
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,480
No one can prove what you just said.

274
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,510
Since there's evidence, can you show it to me?

275
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,950
Of course, I will show you if you want to see it.

276
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,110
Thank you, Lord Liu.

277
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,890
Come in!

278
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,230
General, please take a look.

279
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,810
Back then, the Imperial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance was in charge of the national treasury.

280
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,750
His underling secretly kept these two ledgers.

281
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,270
One was presented to His Majesty

282
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,870
and the other one held the actual records

283
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,130
of the collusion between the Ministry of Finance and the current emperor.

284
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,970
Not only from the treasury,

285
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,520
they also took from the army funds.

286
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,420
The army funds?

287
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,910
Regarding this, aren't you a victim, too?

288
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,340
His Majesty pocketed the army funds to build a new palace.

289
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,130
Many people have heard of this but no one dared to speak up.

290
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,670
Including the fact that you drove the Falcon Tribe away and then also facilitated peace negotiations with them,

291
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,890
made us Ministers speak highly of you,

292
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,040
but His Majesty was always displeased.

293
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,670
So we stopped bringing it up.

294
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,520
What evidence do you have about the army provisions?

295
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:53,350
This book records the funds that were sent to the border in past years.

296
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,820
Whereas, this book is a true record by our man who was dispatched to the border.

297
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,100
He secretly recorded this.

298
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,150
Every budget item was used to build the new palace.

299
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,890
Our ledger is similar to yours.

300
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:22,280
Since you have a witness and General Zuo also has the authority to mobilize the army,

301
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,560
why didn't you take action earlier?

302
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,240
General, you may not know this.

303
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,950
His Majesty split up the authority of the city troops in advance.

304
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,270
It's insufficient now to rely solely on me.

305
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,070
So, you were waiting for the opportunity

306
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,120
and I've just become your pawn.

307
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,090
General Chu, why do you make it sound so ugly?

308
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:50,560
If we join forces, it's mutually beneficial to all of us.

309
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,800
What plans do you have?

310
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,200
What's wrong? You just arrived and you are leaving now? Not going to visit me?

311
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,700
Miss Ruonan, I'm going back to the general's manor.

312
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,000
I bought some osmanthus cakes. They are in your room.

313
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,400
Since you bought food for me, good then.

314
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,060
Be careful on the trip.

315
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,890
I will be back soon.

316
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:43,520
By the way, the general tasked me to investigate something.

317
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,650
The Falcon Tribe's Heavenly Lantern is known as the Phoenix in the Central Plains.

318
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,920
That's what he saw when he was here.

319
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,050
Did you find out anything else?

320
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,390
Not yet.

321
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,620
Relay this to the general for now.

322
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,150
Yes.

323
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,180
Still not leaving?

324
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,880
Yes.

325
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,660
Will Chu Xiuming really join us in the uprising?

326
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,180
He stayed at the border for two years and didn't receive any military salary at all.

327
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,460
He didn't even complain.

328
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,340
Did we lure a wolf into our den?

329
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:33,370
Lord Liu, was this not a wise decision?

330
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,030
If General Chu had immediately agreed,

331
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,460
I would have been suspicious.

332
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,380
Let's wait for a few days.

333
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,520
I have a way to force him to agree.

334
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,830
<i>[Yongning Manor]</i>

335
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:58,100
<i>I found out that the current emperor participated in it, too.</i>

336
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,030
<i>After I reported this to Eighth Prince, in less than a day,</i>

337
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,480
<i>his manor caught fire.</i>

338
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,180
<i>But there's much evidence of the embezzlement.</i>

339
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,960
<i>Back then, the Imperial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance was in charge of the national treasury.</i>

340
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,740
<i>His underling secretly kept these two ledgers. </i>

341
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,200
<i>One was presented to His Majesty</i>

342
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,930
<i>and the other one held the actual records</i>

343
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,120
<i>of the collusion between the Ministry of Finance and the current emperor. </i>

344
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,110
<i>It wasn't just the state treasury.</i>

345
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,260
<i>Even the funds and provisions for the troops were embezzled as well.</i>

346
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,610
<i>Salaries of the army?</i>

347
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,370
<i>Regarding this, aren't you a victim, too?</i>

348
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,680
<i>His Majesty pocketed the salaries of the army to build a new palace.</i>

349
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,020
<i>Many people were aware of this but no one dared to speak up.</i>

350
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,870
<i>If we join forces, it's mutually beneficial to us all.</i>

351
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,250
Older Brother.

352
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,540
I told you to protect your sister-in-law. Why are you back?

353
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,760
The Heavenly Lantern (plant) of the Falcon Tribe is the Phoenix (plant).

354
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:18,290
They are indeed the same type. The Phoenix.

355
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,660
Please tell Ruonan to check

356
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,180
who else plants this in the city.

357
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,760
Yes.

358
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,090
Is there anything else?

359
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,580
Sister-in-Law has something for you.

360
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,160
<i>[For Chu Xiuming from Jin'er]</i>

361
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,780
<i> Husband, Xiuyuan already told me what you intend to do.</i>

362
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,830
<i> Don't blame him. I forced him to talk.</i>

363
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,500
<i> If it's for the Eighth Prince, you have already investigated this for many years. There must be other ways.</i>

364
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,440
<i> Don't rush this.</i>

365
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,850
<i> If you are doing this for me and the Rui Royal family, please don't. </i>

366
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,560
<i> A general is loyal to the country.</i>

367
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,670
<i> If this turns you into a traitor of the state, </i>

368
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,680
<i> my Rui family and I won't be able to continue to live on.</i>

369
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,210
<i> If you are willing, please return this Token of Safety to me in person.</i>

370
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,960
<i> If anything happens to you, I will go to the netherworld with our child.</i>

371
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,440
<i> We will live and die together.</i>

372
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,700
Older Brother, I took the initiative to tell Sister-in-Law. Don't blame her.

373
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,840
Xiuyuan,

374
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,180
do you know who this Token of Safety belongs to?

375
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,800
My aunt. Your mother.

376
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,450
She was pregnant with you when she gave this to me.

377
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,870
Aunt told me that a real man must have a benevolent mind in order to rule the world.

378
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,150
Other than protecting your family, you must become stronger, too.

379
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:20,750
Take up your sword to protect the weak and those who are being bullied and humiliated.

380
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,960
She wanted me to give this to my beloved one and protect her.

381
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,530
And now, Jin'er has returned this to me.

382
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,120
She wants me to return this to her in person.

383
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,810
If anything happens to me, she will live and die with me.

384
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,180
Older Brother, Sister-in-Law is worried about you.

385
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,910
She's reminding me that,

386
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,890
whatever I'm doing now, it's different from both of your expectations

387
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,860
and that I have lost my direction.

388
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,830
Since you know this, why aren't you stopping?

389
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,150
Xiuyuan, I already told you that

390
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,180
I have my own plans.

391
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,000
What are your plans? Why aren't you telling me?

392
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,310
Older Brother, I really don't understand anything you are doing now.

393
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,780
If you don't understand, just wait until everything is finished.

394
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,160
Then, what about Sister-in-Law?

395
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,660
You won't even explain to her?

396
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,220
She misses and worries about her family every day.

397
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,300
You said everything you are doing is for her sake but you are harming her instead!

398
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,530
She's your wife!

399
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,580
- Xiuyuan-- <br> - If I were you,

400
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,140
I would never let my wife suffer and be in pain.

401
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,580
Fine. I will go and see her.

402
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,280
There are eyes watching you in the manor. I will deflect their attention from you.

403
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,670
Jin'er, do you know?

404
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,200
Ever since our fabric shops merged, the business has been growing every day.

405
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,430
But there's something strange.

406
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,360
The orders from the palace have stopped. They said it's temporary.

407
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,240
Tell me. Did we waste our efforts?

408
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,340
Someone could be creating trouble for us.

409
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,890
Don't worry. I already instructed everyone in the shop

410
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,650
that this fabric shop is fully owned by me, Brother Nan. <br> <i>(T/N: Ruonan's alias)</i>

411
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,540
You have already sold your business to me.

412
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,940
Don't mention me again. I don't want to implicate you.

413
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,830
You are underestimating me.

414
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:09,720
I have been in the community for many years. I won't be tricked so easily.

415
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,320
Here, have some osmanthus cake.

416
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,380
Xiuyuan bought these.

417
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,220
After this is over, I must arrange your wedding.

418
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:29,340
I hope this will end soon and you can see your mother, too.

419
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,060
Your husband has arrived. I won't disturb you any longer.

420
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,470
I'll go and brew a nice pot of tea for you.

421
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,810
Jin'er.

422
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,310
If His Majesty really plans to arrest you, then we'll flee.

423
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,410
This matter will implicate the lives of many, we should not make any rash decisions.

424
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,380
And you think your current behavior hasn't been reckless?

425
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,400
Husband, Lord Liu has been your opponent from the start,

426
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,350
but instead, he's now pulling you in to join his group.

427
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,640
Something is definitely wrong with this.

428
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:25,230
Jin'er, things are not what they seem.

429
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,620
I have made my own plans. Everyone will be all right.

430
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,400
You want me to trust you?

431
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,960
If you want me to wait until this entire issue is solved then I'll wait.

432
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,150
But your recent actions are the complete opposite of the Chu Xiuming I know.

433
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,950
Husband, does Lord Liu have some kind of hold over you?

434
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,140
Lord Liu did not force me into this.

435
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,660
Jin'er,

436
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,930
just wait for me for a few more days. All right?

437
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,810
Chu Xiuming, are you really going to commit treason?

438
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,150
Let's leave here. Please?

439
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,440
Let's go to a place where no one recognizes us and live a good life.

440
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,670
I promised you that I would save your mother and the Rui Royal Manor.

441
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,550
Yes, you did promise me you would do that,

442
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,340
but this is not how you do it!

443
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,300
Husband, I'm begging you.

444
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,230
Please don't do this.

445
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,790
Even if it's for my sake, for the sake of our unborn child,

446
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,780
for Xiuyuan's sake, and for everyone's sake

447
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,910
- so they can carry on living well– <br> - Jin'er...

448
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,730
I will be fine. I just need you to stay put.

449
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,080
If you leave here today, I will go to His Majesty and confess to everything immediately.

450
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,830
Jin'er!

451
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,040
- Stop creating trouble! <br> - You are creating trouble instead.

452
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,110
You are the one who is treating the act of treason like child's play!

453
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,710
You will stay here. You are not to go anywhere.

454
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,440
I will enter the capital immediately!

455
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,150
<i>Chu Xiuming, open thts door!</i>

456
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,340
<i>Hurry up and open this door!</i>

457
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,980
Chu Xiuming, open this door!

458
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,810
Chu Xiuming, have you forgotten? I can open every lock there is!

459
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,850
<i>You cannot lock me in here! Chu Xiuming!</i>

460
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,150
Jin'er, I will solve all our problems.

461
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,340
<i>I will come back and apologize to you in a few days' time.</i>

462
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,950
What husband!

463
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,470
<i>I'm going to write a divorce letter right now and divorce you!</i>

464
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,010
<i>Open this door!</i>

465
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,470
<i>Chu Xiuming, open the door!</i>

466
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,380
What's happened to the two of you?

467
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,580
Elder Sister Ruonan, quickly open the door for me. I have to get out!

468
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,150
Miss Ruonan, I need you to help me guard Jin'er well.

469
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,470
Don't let her out of this village!

470
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,490
I will definitely reward you greatly sometime in the future.

- Chu Xiuming! <br> - Jin'er. Jin'er!

473
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,200
Don't get agitated.

474

Here. What's the matter? Talk to me.

How did you two start arguing in such a short span of time?

476
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,360
Something terrible is going to happen, Elder Sister Ruonan. You have to take me to the capital!

477
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,190
Jin'er, the Imperial Guard are looking for you right now.

478
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,100
You're also pregnant. Are you trying to kill yourself?

479
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,670
I have to stop Chu Xiuming or he'll be in grave danger!

480
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,160
He's a great general, why would he require your help?

481
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,540
I...

482
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,670
Jin'er, no matter what happens,

483
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,150
the most important thing right now is your safety.

484

Think carefully about this. Please?

- But... <br> - Enough.

487
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,440
I know how much you're suffering.

488

Don't worry.
