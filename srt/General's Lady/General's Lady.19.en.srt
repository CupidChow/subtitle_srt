My Lord is indisposed. He will not be receiving any guests.

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,400
I saw a few of Lord Situ's guests enter the manor just now.

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,840
Did Lord Situ also turn them away?

23
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,970
I prepared these pitch-pots for Lord Situ.

Greetings, Lord Situ.

31
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,100
So it is the Great General of the Flying Cavalry who has come. Excuse this old man for not coming out to meet you.

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,020
General, what is the meaning of this?

33
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,510
It is a token of my appreciation. I hope My Lord will accept it.

34
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,150
I am but a military man.

35
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,880
It's an honor to meet you, at last, Lord Situ. I have long admired your ability to rule the nation; hence, my desire to call on you.

36
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,920
My Lord, I heard you are a fan of the game of pitch-pot, so I specially prepared this small gift for you.

37
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,180
Don't make light of this pitch-pot.

"To see the world in a wild flower."

39

There is much insight in this little pitch-pot.

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,230
You're right, Lord Situ.

41
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,580
General, it appears that you also have an interest in this.

42
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,000
My talents are insignificant. I'd merely be displaying my slight skills before an expert such as yourself.

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,790
Husband!

44
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,530
Here, here. You've worked hard, Husband. Quickly have a seat.

45

You've worked hard, you've worked hard.

46
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,570
Thank you, My Lady.

47
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,020
Well? How did it go? Did you take care of Lord Situ?

48
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,740
I don't think I managed to do so.

49
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,540
- Don't tell me you defeated Lord Situ? <br> - Yes.

50
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,340
I've also brought back the winnings for you, Jin'er.

I've miscalculated, I've miscalculated.

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,140
No wonder Lord Situ isn't happy.

53
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,610
General, you're not at war right now where you have to emerge ever-victorious.

54
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,770
Of course, you're happy because you won. But Lord Situ would not be happy at all!

55
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,300
So that's why.

56
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,380
You must go out to battle again tomorrow. Remember! <br> You must lose!

57
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,000

68

General, did you lose to him?

69
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,470
Of course.

70
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,380
I did as you instructed. I completely lost to Lord Situ.

71
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,700
Completely?! How could you have completely lost to him?

72

I miscalculated. I miscalculated yet again!

73
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,240
General, what's important in a pitch-pot game is to have a well-matched opponent.

74
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,920
There has to be an exchange of defeat and victory so that one can enjoy oneself to the fullest.

It seems there is an expert guiding you from behind, General.

92

Why don't you openly and candidly compete against this old man?

93

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,530
Young man, that is a huge claim. After you.

00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,430
Thank you for your courtesy.

96

101
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,040

From now on, you may treat my manor as if it were your manor.

You may come and go as you please. Call upon this old man whenever you please and I shall arrive.

109
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,740
From now on, you must inform me if you require any assistance.

110
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,650
This Old Brother will do my best to help you.

111
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,250
Eldest... Eldest Brother?

112
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,250
That's right! That's right!

113
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,690
Eldest Brother, I won't keep this from you.

114
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,910
The general is actually my husband.

115
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,070
This...

116
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,780
So you are the general's wife!

117
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,550
Then... why have you dressed like this today?

118
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,950
I wanted to secretly learn your excellent pitch-pot technique, Lord Situ,

119
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,840
but you ended up finding out.

120
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,820
Please don't blame me.

121
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,130
Younger Sister, you and I are equally matched. There's no need for you to learn anything secretly.

122
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,850
We're a family in the future.

123
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,060
If there's anything you need my help with, then tell me.

124
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,490
Otherwise, I would feel that you don't respect me as a big brother.

125
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,220
Eldest Brother, my husband has become the Great General of the Flying Cavalry.

126
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,660
It's already considered a pretty high position.

127
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,260
But this little brother of mine,

128
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,110
still needs your help.

129
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,680
Younger Sister, this little brother of yours is like my little brother.

130
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,590
I like this young kid.

131
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,960
Tell you what. There's a position open for a City Supervisor.

132
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,170
I'll let him be in charge.

133
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,910
Thank you, Eldest Brother.

134
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,450
Younger Sister, don't be courteous.

135
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,120
Come on. Let's continue.

136
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,510
- Eldest Brother, you first. <br> - Okay.

137
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,260
Younger Sister.

138
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,710
It went in!

139
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,250
Eldest Brother, when did Sister-in-Law become such close friends with Lord Situ?

140
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,930
<i>Here.</i>

141
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,640
Younger Sister.

142
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,750
Wait a moment. Let me put the pitch-pot away.

143
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,230
Younger Sister, what do you like to eat?

144
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,220
Tell me and I will let them go cook it.

145
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,150
Fish and meat.

146
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,350
No problem.

147
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,750
Younger Sister, what do you think of these household utensils?

148
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,000
If you like them then take one.

149
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,540
No need.

150
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,690
All right, let's go.

151
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,060
Does this eldest brother have a secret room down there?

152
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,590
Perhaps, there's a lot of gold and silver.

153
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,270
Isn't he afraid that he may fall in?

154
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,270
Jin'er, don't spout nonsense.

155
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,510
This time, I have established a heroic contribution.

156
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,400
Husband, what reward do you have for me?

157
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,930
You indeed did a great thing this time.

158
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,340
What do you want me to do?

159
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,870
Why don't I just repay with my body?

160
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,640
Go ahead.

161
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,960
Chu Xiuming, what's with that attitude.

162
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,110
You already belong to me. What are you talking about?

163
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,120
If I knew then I wouldn't have helped you.

164
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,050
Fine, fine, fine.

165
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,540
Jin'er, you've worked hard.

166
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,420
I'll do whatever you like, all right?

167
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,030
Is that enough?

168
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,680
Let's sleep.

169
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,780
Don't sleep. I still haven't finished talking.

170
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,560
Just be frank. No need to be courteous with me.

171
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,010
I wanted to say even though you're in a high ranked position,

172
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,760
when all is said and done, an official's salary is still limited.

173
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,780
Our manor has just been renovated.

174
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,930
We've spent almost all of the savings for this calendar year.

175
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,070
The capital city isn't like the border town.

176
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,690
The daily expenses require quite a lot of money.

177
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,470
Then, what you mean is that I'm earning too little

178
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,490
and can't satisfy your daily spending?

179
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,360
When have I ever spent money extravagantly?

180
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,830
I was thinking that my husband is a prized general.

181
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,950
You can't always be hard-pressed financially

182
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,000
within the social interchanges of the court and lose prestige, can you?

183
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,760
Also, the expenditures within the manor

184
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,840
will continue to increase steadily as you continue to have dealings with people socially.

185
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,340
Besides, there's nothing for me to do all day in the manor.

186
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,000
I also want to look for something to do.

187
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,170
Why don't I start a small business to supplement our family income?

188
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,420
Jin'er, you really are my good wife.

189
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,170
- You've thought about it thoroughly. <br> - Of course.

190
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,940
Then have you thought about what business you wanted to do?

191
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,280
If we're going to do trade,

192
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,130
then it's in order to earn money.

193
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,030
Tomorrow, Rou Rou and I will go on the streets to walk around and take a look

194
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,270
to see what there is that suits me.

195
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,660
You treat me so well.

196
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,710
Then I have to thank you well.

197
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,960
♫ <i> The wind speaks like you </i> ♫

198
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,170
♫ <i> Talking about the distant rain falling </i> ♫

199
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,020
♫ <i> I pause within my dream </i> ♫

200
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,300
These belongings that the general gave me are already dwindling quickly.

201
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,000
I have to use them wisely and strive for a small capital but yield a bigger profit!

202
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,300
Pray for me that my business will be stable.

203
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,050
Please don't let me lose everything I've invested;

204
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,730
or else, I can't afford to stay in the general's manor anymore.

205
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,650
Jin'er.

206
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,270
Husband.

207
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,690
What are you holding?

208
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,320
Let me take a look.

209
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,080
The map of the capital city?

210
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,580
Why do you need the map of the capital city for?

211
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,550
I have something that I want to discuss with you.

212
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,190
Husband, please give me some advice.

213
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,490
Go ahead and tell me.

214
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,720
According to my investigation,

215
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,200
the capital is a rich land that fosters many talents and there's a lot of trade.

216
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,610
Clothing, food, housing, and transport still earn the most money.

217
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,540
You see, it doesn't matter if one is a high official, noble person,

218
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,150
or if one is a common citizen.

219
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,150
When it comes to the bare necessities, one will spend the most on clothing.

220
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,490
There are four seasons in a year. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

221
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,900
The different seasons require different types of clothing.

222
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,470
For example, if a young lady

223
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,180
bought a moonlight colored top,

224
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,140
then she'll have to pair that with a skirt that is pomegranate-red in color.

225
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,250
But what does she do once she's bought that pomegranate-red skirt?

226
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,010
Shouldn't she then pair it with a burgundy-colored inner blouse?

227
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,000
Now that she's gotten her burgundy-colored inner blouse,

228
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,010
shouldn't she then pair that with an evergreen robe?

229
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:43,360
If she has an evergreen robe, wouldn't that mean she should also get a lake blue cloak with that, too?

230
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,160
- If it continues on like this for a long, long time— <br>- Jin'er, Jin'er, Jin'er.

231
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,460
Enough! Just say it. What do you want to do?

232
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,490
I want to open a fabric shop.

233
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,240
Fabric shop? All right.

234
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,150
But...

235
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,870
But what?

236
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,370
But setting up a business is always risky. I must be cautious when conducting business transactions.

237
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,970
It doesn't mean that if I open a fabric shop then I'll earn money,

238
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,700
but I will try my best.

239
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,420
If you don't lose money, then you're making money.

240
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,770
All right. I'll give you all of my private property.

241
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,390
Whether you make a profit or lose money, I'll support you.

242
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,790
Thank you, husband.

243
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,510
<i>That's right. What is that?</i>

244
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,580
<i>Take a look!</i>

245
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,260
Rou Rou, we're tight on time, but we have a heavy task.

246
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,030
We must open the shop sooner and earn money earlier.

247
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,170
But there's only the two of us. We don't have enough hands.

248
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,320
Moreover, we don't have any experience in opening a fabric shop.

249
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,140
You gain experience slowly. No one is born with the skills of making money.

250
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,480
But we don't even know where we're opening our shop.

251
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,920
See, we don't even have a place to spend our money.

252
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,510
Stop spouting nonsense. Let's take a look up ahead.

253
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,890
My Lady.

254
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,180
Look. How's the location of this shop?

255
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,620
<i>Little trinkets! Fragrance pouches! Pretty trinkets for sale!</i>

256
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,230
This shop faces the street.

257
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,650
There's also a lot of people walking by.

258
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,880
But look. Surrounding it are stores with long-established reputations.

259
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,350
If we compete with others then we'll lose money for sure.

260
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,520
Let's take a look somewhere else.

261
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,210
We're still looking, My Lady?

262
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,580
We already walked five streets today.

263
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,480
My legs are going to break!

264
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,220
The location is very important when doing business.

265
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,490
If we want to do business, then we'll have to choose the best location.

266
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,210
Let's go.

267
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,910
And we keep walking?

268
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,140
Rou Rou, take a look. How's this place?

269
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,050
Here?

270
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,810
There are a lot of people, but there's a river that blocks the way.

271
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,810
I'm afraid that it won't be convenient.

272
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,680
See, you don't understand.

273
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,270
When picking a location, you need to look at the Fengshui. <br> <i>(T/N: Fengshui is using Chinese geomancy principles)</i>

274
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,050
This water element generates wealth. If I start my business here,

275
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,530
I can definitely earn a lot of money.

276
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,840
It'll be here then.

277
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,250
Today, I found a shop along Fuheng Street.

278
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,230
It's surrounded by the river, it's an amazing location over there!

279
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,900
If you think it works then it is.

280
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,840
As a supervisor, I've seen all of the shops here in the capital city.

281
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,060
The place sister-in-law picked is pretty good. You really have good taste in picking locations.

282
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,940
I also want to help you,

283
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,050
but because I've got an important post, I can't frequently reveal my identity,

284
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,790
so I can only offer emotional support.

285
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,980
Don't worry, I'm here.

286
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,030
Since the shop has been settled then you have to take care of the business.

287
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,530
Jin'er, what plans do you have?

288
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,020
As for the fabrics, there are silks from the South, and coarse cloth from the North.

289
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,900
Which type did you choose, Sister-in-Law?

290
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,260
I'm still thinking about this.

291
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,630
I plan on having both Southern silks and Northern coarse cloth,

292
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,120
but I'm thinking that these two types might be too ordinary.

293
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,690
If we were to use the dyed cloth from the Falcon Tribe on the border,

294
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,000
then wouldn't it be more special and exquisite?

295
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,090
I don't think that's a good idea.

296
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,100
You can have Falcon Tribe's clothing, but not too much.

297
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,660
This is the capital city after all.

298
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,380
Everyone wears mainly the Han style of clothing.

299
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,320
So when people buy fabric, it's based on what they're used to.

300
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,790
The Falcon Tribe's clothing looks nice,

301
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,750
but won't be worn often.

302
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,640
Big Brother is right. If fewer people wear it, then fewer people will want to buy it.

303
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,370
Then I'll listen to my husband.

304
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,860
Let's make it more local since we're not hoping to earn lots of money.

305
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,810
It's just to help offset some of the household's expenses.

306
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,370
Since everything has been settled,

307
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,650
then we'll use tea in exchange for wine to make a toast for Lord Jin's business.

308
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,550
I wish Lord Jin to have a prosperous business!

309
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,330
I thank you.

310
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,830
Cheers.

311
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,510
Here.

312
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,270
You must put it in the middle. I want a sign that's this length and this width. It has to be bright and stands out.

313
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,340
I want to put lanterns downstairs. Make sure to measure that place correctly.

314
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,730
Don't make a mistake!

315
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,000
There's also this. I've already said this several times.

316
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,050
It is too narrow and must be wider or it won't support the weight.

317
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,640
Go back and revise it.

318
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,600
You may leave now. Remember that.

319
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,960
My Lady, look in front.

320
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,840
Does it look like they're also preparing to open?

321
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,790
That does seem like they're preparing.

322
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,860
I wonder what shop they're opening.

323
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,920
If you want to know then I'll go gather news.

324
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,720
Why gather news about that?

325
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,780
We'll just focus on our work.

326
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,690
That'd be too much of a coincidence.

327
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,680
That they'd open a fabric shop as we're opening a fabric shop?

328
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,110
Focus. Don't bother about them.

329
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,430
I also said that I wanted to change the counter from downstairs.

330
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,110
- How come it's still there? Also, over there. <br> - All right.

331
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,830
Oh, and that one!

332
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,710
General Chu is the bravest man I know.

333
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,340
No wonder the border has been protected so well.

334
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,930
I really admire you.

335
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,450
I heard that the construction of the general's manor has been completed.

336
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,140
How do you like it?

337
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,860
It's a gift from Your Majesty. It'll be perfectly suitable.

338
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,820
Prime Minister is a great minister who has given outstanding service to both the late emperor and myself.

339
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,600
The two generations of the Chu family are also men of integrity,

340
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,070
who built up an indomitable border city.

341
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,820
Your Majesty, I'm flattered.

342
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,850
Protecting the border is my responsibility.

343
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,620
You two are both my left and right-hand men.

344
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,680
I am very grateful.

345
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,390
You two must help me protect this beautiful land of ours.

346
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,200
Of course.

347
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,050
Your Majesty, don't worry.

348
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,850
Regarding the military pay, I will have to rely on you, Prime Minister.

349
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,580
I will obey.

350
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,990
Lord Yongning, you may rest.

351
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,690
Many thanks, Your Majesty.

352
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,970
The three workers salaries,

353
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,080
adding in the Southern silks,

354
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,330
and the rough Northern cloth, as well as one year's rent.

355
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,540
Who would've expected that we would spend so much within a few days?

356
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,510
Husband?

357
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,170
Jin'er, I brought you some delicious food.

358
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,460
You came just to bring me snacks?

359
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,790
I'm so touched.

360
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,390
You put in a lot of effort into this fabric store.

361
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,690
When you get home, you're so exhausted that you fall asleep right away.

362
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,660
We don't even get to talk.

363
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,470
I've missed you.

364
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,250
I understand how you're feeling.

365
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,750
I just want to be a normal businesswoman.

366
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,810
I don't want others to know that this shop is related to a big general like you,

367
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,090
so come less often.

368
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,540
Jin'er, do you not want to see me?

369
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,170
That's not what I meant. Husband, don't misunderstand.

370
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,610
What I meant is that you're busy with government affairs,

371
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,640
and if you come to my shop,

372
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,830
I wouldn't have time to take care of you if I was busy with my business.

373
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,180
So in the future, you'll be busy with your government affairs

374
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,570
and I will do my business.

375
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,680
When everything is on track then I will definitely close my shop early

376
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,930
and go back to take care of you.

377
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:29,890
Good. Since you've put it like that, I won't come anymore.

378
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,140
Husband, you've worked hard.

379
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,420
It's so tasty.

380
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,290
It's tasty, right?

381
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,670
Don't choke.

382
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,710
Drink some water.

383
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,210
Rou Rou, were the curtains that I mentioned last time changed?

384
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,780
It's been changed.

385
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,640
How come the wooden floor isn't fixed yet?

386
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,980
I'll go pester them to do it later.

387
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,770
Rou Rou, I already said that red lanterns will be hung here so that it looks more festive.

388
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,940
How come the sign isn't up yet?

389
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,870
Where did the workers go?

390
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,830
- I'll go rush them right now. <br> - Our grand opening is in a few days.

391
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,620
You're using one Rou Rou like there's five Rou Rous.

392
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,390
Slow down.

393
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,970
Be careful.

394
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,010
They seem almost done across as well.

395
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,370
Who knows. If we open on the same day, it will be twice as lucky.

396
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,270
Younger Sister Jin.

397
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,460
- Elder Sister Shu. <br> - Eldest Lady.

398
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,410
I heard that your shop is about to have its grand opening. I came to congratulate you.

399
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,780
- Did I disturb you? <br> - You didn't.

400
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,150
My shop isn't officially opened yet.

401
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:51,310
Elder Sister Shu came just in time. Let's go inside and pick out nice fabrics and I'll gift them to you.

402
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,390
- Let's go. <br> - Yes.

403
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,300
Big Sister, I brought in some top-grade Southern silks.

404
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,550
Big Sister, you must pick some and go back to make some clothes.

405
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,430
I thank you, Younger Sister.

406
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,040
Be careful.

407
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,980
Big Sister, have some tea.

408
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,700
Rou Rou, bring Xiao Xue along to pick some nice fabric.

409
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,180
Yes.

410
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,500
Let's go.

411
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:23,770
The general is willing to support you. Your relationship together is so good.

412
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,480
It makes us so envious.

413
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,130
What is there to be envious about?

414
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,730
Don't blame me for being a bit talkative.

415
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,250
A woman is meant to first take care of their family.

416
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,430
Now, you have this fabric shop and you're busy every day.

417
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,930
You don't have children yet.

418
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,080
When do you have the time to keep General company?

419
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,440
Sister, don't worry.

420
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,490
My husband is not like most other people.

421
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,040
He really supports me in opening a fabric shop.

422
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,110
That's good then.

423
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,160
But, Big Sister, last time,

424
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,820
the physician said that you'll have more children. Why did he say that?

425
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,560
Big Sister, is there something you can't share?

426
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,020
Actually, a lot of things happened in the manor recently,

427
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,320
but Little Sister, you weren't here.

428
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,020
I didn't have anyone to talk to about it.

429
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:40,580
I'm back now. Sister, don't worry and just tell me.

430
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,050
Ever since I got married into the manor, I settled on

431
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,410
having a happy married life with my husband.

432
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,900
In the beginning, life was good,

433
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,920
but after a while

434
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,770
my husband slowly got tired of me.

435
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,750
I've invited you two here today to ask about something.

436
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,170
General, please be frank.

437
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,330
I've selected you two because you've been following my father for many years.

438
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,210
When things happened to the Eighth Prince, my father came to the capital city.

439
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,580
Was there anything abnormal?

440
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,330
On the day something happened to the 8th Prince?

441
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,900
This incident was too long ago. I don't recall.

442
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,080
I remember back then, your father went to visit His Majesty at his manor.

443
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,940
He didn't bring anyone along.

444
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,050
Does anyone else know about this?

445
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,070
Many thanks, to both of you.

446
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,870
Why did my father go to see His Majesty?

447
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,700
Could it be that the 8th Prince's death really has to do with His Majesty?

448
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,700
Half a year ago, my husband's cousin, Yun Niang's

449
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,050
family ran into trouble and moved into our manor.

450
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,200
I had just gotten pregnant.

451
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,680
Yun Niang was very warm and friendly.

452
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:29,190
Not long after that, I suddenly lost our child.

453
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,570
I was extremely careful with what I ate and wore.

454
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,550
It was only after investigating that I realized

455
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,440
it was due to a bowl of tonic soup that Yun Niang made for me.

456
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,040
The imperial doctor has taken my pulse.

457
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,800
The chances of me becoming pregnant again are very slim.

458
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,900
She actually dared to poison my eldest sister!

459
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,720
She even dared to pick on someone from the Rui Royal Manor? Then, did Brother-in-Law not deal with this issue?

460
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,210
What? What? What?

461
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,270
Rou Rou, go and keep yourself busy. I'm talking about something with Eldest Sister.

462
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,300
All right.

463
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,110
Eldest Sister, please continue.

464
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:10,340
Your brother-in-law treats Yun Niang like a treasure.

465
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,830
He wishes he could hold her in his hand.

466
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:17,870
A few months ago, Yun Niang found out that she was carrying my husband's baby.

467
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:22,940
She was also the relative of Marquis Yongle's mother, who treated her like her own daughter.

468
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,250
I'm afraid that, from the moment that child is born,

469
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,440
I'll be even less important in the manor.

470
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,570
But Eldest Sister is the official wife,

471
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,110
and also the eldest daughter of Rui Royal Manor.

472
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,020
How could they make you suffer like this?

473
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,040
Blame my weak nature.

474
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,490
At that time, Royal Father was too busy being smitten with Concubine Bai,

475
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,680
so I didn't dare tell him about this.

476
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
You weren't here either.

477
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,630
I couldn't rely on any of our other sisters either.

478
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,890
Now that I've returned, I'll support Eldest Sister!

479
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,560
Take me to your manor immediately. I'll teach that girl a lesson!

480
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,620
How are you going to teach her a lesson?

481
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:10,620
I'll handle this matter properly, I won't do anything out of line.

482
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,570
No matter what, the baby Yun Niang is carrying is innocent.

483
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,050
I don't want to be malicious.

484
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,250
Eldest Sister, it's because you're too kindhearted, that's why people feel like they can bully you.

485
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,190
Jin'er will only ask Eldest Sister this one question,

486
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,850
do you want to have another baby?

487
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,960
Of course, I want one!

488
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,350
I've been feeling guilty ever since I lost the baby.

489
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,720
It's my fault that the baby couldn't be born.

490
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,640
But now, my husband rarely spends the night with me.

491
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,230
my own body is also not as healthy as it once was.

492
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:54,730
I'm afraid that it's even more difficult to get pregnant again.

493
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,970
Eldest Sister, Jin'er has a plan.

494
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,800
What is Younger Sister's plan?

495
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,500
Wait for me to settle everything here, then I'll come to the manor to find you.

496
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,140
Who's this?

497
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,860
I hear the general's wife is so amazing, she's opening a business!

498
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,670
We must definitely pay a visit.

499
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,450
Older Sister Zhi. Third Sister Jing.

500
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:36,540
You just need not create trouble. My fabric shop doesn't welcome you.

501
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,260
What's with that expression?

502
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,420
If she didn't have the general backing her,

503
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,690
I definitely wouldn't have let her take half a step into Rui Royal Manor!

504
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,790
Older Sister, once this fabric shop of hers opens,

505
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,850
we definitely must pay a visit.

506
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,470
My Lady, these are fresh tangerines that Miss specially ordered someone to go buy.

507
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,910
You're the first to try them.

508
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,190
You're so considerate.

509
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:09,300
Mother, I haven't seen you for so many days, since I've been busy with the shop's opening.

510
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,440
Jin'er doesn't need to worry about Mother.

511
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,820
As for you, if you're spending all day busying yourself with the fabric shop, who's taking care of the general?

512
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,820
My husband is also busy with official affairs. Besides, there are so many people at the manor.

513
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,820
How could there be no one taking care of him?

514
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,760
Jin'er, your mother will teach you the way of being a wife today.

515
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,710
No matter how busy you are, you can't be busier than your husband.

516
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,740
Your husband is the head of the family,

517
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:37,800
while you should be getting pregnant as soon as possible, in your role as his wife.

518
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,890
The basics of being a woman.

519
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,000
Mother is right.

520
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,240
My husband and I just came back to the capital from the border.

521
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,400
Naturally, there are a lot of things we need to worry about.

522
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,460
We still have the future ahead of us.

523
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,200
Besides, I'm living really well with my husband.

524
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,640
Also, he hasn't brought up having children yet.

525
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,040
Silly girl, his not bringing it up doesn't mean he doesn't want any.

526
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,000
I understand, Mother.

527
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,380
All right. As long as my Jin'er and the general are living happily, that's all that matters.

528
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,840
Mother, have some tea.

529
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,600
Here. Eat this snack, and try this fruit.

530
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,180
All right.

531
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,310
That's Yun Niang.

532
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,600
Mother, my family's youngest sister, Jin has come to pay you a visit.

533
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,100
Greetings, My Lady.

534
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,620
The general's wife is here. Come sit.

535
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,450
Nice to meet you, My Lady.

536
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,530
You are...

537
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,820
You can call her Yun Niang. She is my relative.

538
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,530
- She is visiting for a few days. <br> - I see.

539
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,560
Yun Niang, how about you leave us for a little while.

540
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,790
- Yes. <br> - Hey.

541
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,350
Yun Niang, you look like you're about to give birth.

542
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,660
It's probably best you don't move around too much. Sit down.

543
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,290
Sit.

544
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:17,370
You have been living on the border for so long. Are you getting used to being back?

545
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,120
I grew up here after all so I'm very used to being here.

546
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,770
It's been a while since I last saw Eldest Sister Shu,

547
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,900
so I thought I'd stop by the manor to see her.

548
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,450
Eldest Sister Shu has always doted on me from a young age.

549
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,750
I thank you for your care, Younger Sister.

550
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,270
Lord Yongning's wife and sister really have a loving sisterly relationship!

551
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,530
Yun Niang, where's your husband?

552
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,520
How come you've come to visit while this heavily pregnant?

553
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,540
Youngest Sister Jin, Yun Niang is my husband's cousin...

554
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,890
- and also my husband's concubine. <br> - Huh?

555
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,350
Younger Sister, you may call me Yun Niang.

556
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,660
How come I didn't know I had another older sister?

557
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,410
Don't tell me the Prince of Rui has an illegitimate daughter somewhere out there?

558
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:08,260
Do you have any right to call me your younger sister?

559
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,710
General's Madam, it's just a misunderstanding. Yun Niang didn't mean it like that.

560
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,770
Then, what did she mean?

561
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:22,100
General's Madam, please don't anger yourself over such a trivial matter.

562
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,380
Eldest Sister Shu, how come you never told me about your husband taking a concubine?

563
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,240
How could such a mannerless person become Brother-in-Law's concubine?

564
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,090
Youngest Sister Jin.

565
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,750
I heard Youngest Sister Jin's voice all the way from the courtyard.

566
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,820
- Cousin! <br> - Yun Niang, what happened?

567
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:48,540
Yun Niang, it was clearly you who said the wrong thing and angered Youngest Sister Jin.

568
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,280
Not only are you not admitting to your mistake, you're also acting like this.

569
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,220
Youngest Sister Jin, don't be angry. There's definitely some sort of misunderstanding.

570
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:04,060
It appears this Yongle Manor doesn't welcome me at all. I'll take my leave then.

571
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,260
Shu'er, hurry up and go stop your younger sister!

572
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,270
Youngest Sister Jin!

573
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,130
If you are leaving, then take me with you.

574
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:23,370
I was the one who brought you here. I've let you suffer.
