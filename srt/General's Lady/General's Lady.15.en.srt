-General!
-Remember! If I don't return, go back immediately!

23
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,780
Yes!

24
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,460
Hu Te. This has nothing to do with my family.

25
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,140
Let them go.

26
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,970
Husband!

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,960
My Lady! Xiuyuan! Are you both okay?

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,390
We're both fine!

29
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,110
Chu Xiuming. Let's clear our debts today!

30
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,900
My father, Ba Te'er, died under your sword on the battlefield!

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,250
Today, I will have you repay with blood!

32
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,360
Hu Te! Both sides have come to a truce!

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,460
The people are all living peacefully!

34
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,700
This is what your father and the soldiers bought with their fresh blood!

35
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,550
Your actions now are inducing warfare!

36
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,900
Shut up!

37
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,870
You killed my father! Getting revenge for my father is the right thing to do!

38
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,110
I did kill Ba Te'er!

39
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,400
Half a year ago, 24 of our soldiers were walking near our border.

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,350
Your father led 50 soldiers and ambushed our soldiers.

41
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,790
He killed more than 10 of our infantrymen.

42
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,720
I took 7 men with me and we killed our way out of the tight encirclement.

43
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,090
But your father kept pursuing us!

44
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,870
If I didn't kill him,

45
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,420
the soldiers who risked their lives with me would be the ones who died!

46
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,270
Stop arguing! A life for a life!

47
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,180
My mother was killed by the Falcon Tribe!

48
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,760
My father also killed under your sword while protecting me.

49
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,910
Am I supposed to kill all of you to get revenge for my father?

50
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,390
Warfare by the border has continued for years.

51
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,060
How many soldiers on both sides have been sacrificed?

52
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,550
The cruelty of the battlefield means someone must die!

53
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,860
Our warfare is to protect our country!

54
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,680
Every soldier sacrificed, was for our country and for the glory of our ancestors!

55
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,130
You're just trying to save your own life!

56
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,530
You destroyed my family! Today, I must take your life!

57
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,660
If my life can allow you to put down your hate,

58
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,400
can allow you to put down your hate,

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,130
then take it.

60
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,830
Alright! Give me your life!

61
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,330
Don't kill my husband!

62
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,970
Stop!

63
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,980
Who dares to kill in front of me?

64
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,360
Princess! Someone wants to kill my husband! Please uphold justice!

65
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,660
Princess! This person killed my father! Please let me kill him!

66
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,790
Stop talking. I know what happened between you and the General.

67
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,480
General is my friend, he is not a bad person.

68
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,790
Besides, both sides have stopped fighting. Your actions are improper.

69
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,070
Princess!

70
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,700
If you insist on doing this, I can only report it to Royal Father.

71
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,930
I do not dare!

72
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,210
The battlefield caused us to lose our family.

73
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,740
But their sacrifice, was not for allowing hatred to continue.

74
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,440
It was to allow us to have a better, more peaceful life.

75
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,810
Let them go!

General, just call me Yuan'er.

79
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,750
I'm really not used to that title.

80
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,640
You'll get used to it if you hear it a few more times!

81
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,630
Come! Prince Consort, have another cup!

82
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,220
Here.

83
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,370
Your Highness, you seduced Princess Ma Ya without a word!

84
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,190
After we found out you two were together, we were shocked to death!

85
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,270
Your Highness, when are you two going to add on more happiness?
<i>(aka pregnancy)</i>

86
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,790
Princess Ma Ya, you're not pregnant already??

87
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,810
Then congratulations, Princess. Don't drink this alcohol.

88
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,650
Don't worry! I switched this out for water a long time ago!

89
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,430
Don't tell me your cup is also water!

90
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,620
No no no. I won't drink water!

91
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,000
That's right. Princess Ma Ya, I have one more request.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,580
Please go ahead.

93
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,390
I'm looking for a medicinal ingredient from the Falcon Tribe.

94
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,420
I require the consultation services of a very experienced apothecarist.

95
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,490
That's easy enough. I'll take my tribe's apothecarist to come and visit you tomorrow.

96
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,850
Thank you Princess.

97
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,510
She's pregnant! How could you make her run around?

98
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,470
Ma Ya, you can just bring anyone. Your body is more important.

99
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,750
- Right, right.  
 - Your body is more important.

100
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,700
It's fine!

101
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,600
-Congratulations!
-Thank you Princess.

102

<i>I still owe her an apology.</i>

105
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,490
Miss Ta Rou!

106
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,570
You don't think you should say something to me?

107
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,970
I'm sorry!

108
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,330
Not that one!

109
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,260
Do you...like me or not?

110
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,790
Tell me!

111
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,400
General and Her Ladyship are very in love. General changed a lot for Her Ladyship.

112
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,940
He is willing to die for her.

113
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,050
But towards you, I do not hold such affection.

114
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,600
If I marry you, I wouldn't be very responsible towards you.

115
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,850
You really don't like me at all?

116
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,110
No.

117
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,900
Then how can you be sure you won't like me in the future?

118
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,390
Please don't force things, Miss Ta Rou.

119
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,050
I don't agree!

120
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,570
No matter where you go in the future, I'll go with you!

121
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,990
What will happen to your brother if you leave?

122
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,830
Him? He doesn't want me anyway.

123
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,830
We've only known each other for a few days.

124
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,210
But you and your brother grew up together.

125
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,790
Why are you willing to trust a stranger like me rather than a family member?

126
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,280
Miss Ta Rou. My family died when I was very young.

127
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,830
I am very jealous of those who have family members.

128
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,350
No matter how strict your brother is with you, it's a way of protecting you!

129
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,180
He's the person you can depend on in this world.

130
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,830
You just don't want me!

131
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,430
Why must you find so many excuses?

132
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,250
Fine! It's fine if you don't want me.

133
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,500
I don't want to marry you anyway!

Even though I didn't kill the first three wives as the rumours says,

159
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,130
but the me at that time, never felt anything for them.

160
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,590
I even refused them from miles away.

161
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,560
Until I met Jin'Er.

162
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,860
You let my heart warm itself once again.

163
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,890
You made me have a weak spot again.

164
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:50,140
You made me live like a human again.

165
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,510
My Lord,

166
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:14,720
I... thought of something really important.

167
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,100
My Lady, please say it.

168
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,960
Look, Yuan'er and Ma Ya.

169
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,350
Won't they soon become parents?

170
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,300
Yes.

171
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,560
Then...

172
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,320
Then what?

173
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,800
Nothing.

174
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,160
Nothing...

175
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,630
How can it be nothing?

176
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,500
♫ <i> The wind speaks like you </i> ♫

General Xiuming.

185
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,690
Princess Ma Ya.

186
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,760
This is my tribe's apothecary. If there's anything, ask him.

187
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,600
Discuss slowly. I won't bother you.

188
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,310
Thank you, princess.

189
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,420
Thanks apothecary.

190
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,340
This is an herb of the Falcon tribe.

191
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,630
It can be used in medicine, to detoxify and reduce swelling. It's called Sky lantern.

192
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,750
Sky lantern?

193
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,200
Yes.

194
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,710
<i>What is the relationship with the death of the eight king?</i>

195

196
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,980
<i>It's time to return at the imperial court.</i>

197
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,820
Thank you apothecary.

198
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,450
I'm sending you.

199
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,880
Brother.

200
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,340
Did you take away my sister?

201
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,770
Borther Hu Te, what is this?

202
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,530
Ta Rou left a letter, saying she wants to leave from here.

203
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,220
Miss Ta Rou disappeared?

204
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,460
She came to see yesterday night, asking me to take her away.

205
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,970
I refused and she left.

206
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,930
You dare refuse my sister? Come! Let's fight.

207
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,810
Brother Hu Te. It's urgent, we should find miss Ta Rou.

208
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,380
Do you where she often goes?

209
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,650
Xiuyuan, quickly go in town to search for her.

210
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,690
Brother Hu Te, send people to look for her.

211
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,080
Good. If we can't find Ta Rou, I'm taking you into custody!

212
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,400
Did you see Ta Rou?

213
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,360
A girl this tall?

214
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,470
Did you see Ta Rou?

215
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,390
Have you seen a young girl this tall with long hair?

216
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,650
- Boss, have you seen Ta Rou? 
 - No, I haven't.

217
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,880
Have you seen Ta Rou?

218
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,170
Have you a seen a girl this tall?

219
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,620
Have you seen Ta Rou?

220
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,360
-Have you seen Ta Rou? 
- Miss, have you seen Ta Rou?

221
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,200
This tall?

222
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,410
- Did you see her? 
 - No.

223
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,580
How about it?

224
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,130
No.

225
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,960
I know!

226
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,950
Ta Rou!

227
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,140
Ta Rou!

228
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,390
Not only you betrayed your clan, now you want to run away?

229
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,920
Soldiers can't desert the battlefield!

230
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,390
Why can't I become a deserter?

231
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,310
Why do you always have to yell at me?

232
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,770
None of you want me. You don't want me.

233
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,550
Xiuyuan also doesn't want me. Mom and Dad didn't want me.

234
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,160
Nobody cares about me.

235
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,330
I want to leave this place for ever.

236
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,100
Miss Ta Rou, we have a big brother as father.

237
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,950
To find you, your brother went to ask us.

238
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,400
How come would he not want you?

239
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,730
He always bullies me.

240
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,930
He always hated me.

241
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,450
I... I...

242
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,200
Ta Rou.

243
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,150
When I was younger, every time I was angry at you,

244
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,170
you ran to this wall.

245
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,580
I could find you every time.

246
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,450
But as we grew up, I forgot this place.

247
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,640
I forgot this place.

248
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,640
Father raised me like this since I was small.

249
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,330
I can only treat you like this.

250
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:17,100
I... I don't know how to show you how I care about it.

251
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,320
But don't worry, big brother will change.

252
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,010
Don't leave. You're my only family.

253
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,510
You're the most important person to me.

254
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,130
You're lying.

255
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,520
You hated me since younger age. You even hit me!

256
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,970
I never hated you.

257
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,430
You're my own sister.

258
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,190
I hit you when we were younger because I was mischievous.

259
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,910
Then promise you will never hit me again.

260
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,280
You can't yell at me either.

261
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,300
I promise. I won't hit you again.

262
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,630
I won't yell either.

263
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,940
Alors, there's still one thing you have to promise me.

264
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,430
Tell me.

265
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,060
Brother. Let's forget about our hatred.

266
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,720
Let's start anew.

267
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,670
I know that you want to scold me.

268
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,910
I want to leave alone to a place where you will never find me.

269
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,890
Ta Rou! I promised Mother I would protect you.

270
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,250
You're my only sister.

271
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,960
I'm promising you.

272
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,780
Really?

273
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,350
I am swearing on the name of Father.

274
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,380
I will give up on hatred. Start anew.

275
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,040
Good. We're sending you here.

276
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,420
After we part today, I don't know when we will meet again.

277
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,100
General, Madam, you must stay safe.

278
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,820
Greet the people from the Manor for me.

279
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,660
Don't worry, as I am here, Yuan'er won't be bullied.

280
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,090
Please come to the General's Manor when you have a chance.

281
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,670
Brother Chu. Thank you for giving up on your resentment to help me find my sister.

282
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,240
I feel ashamed.

283
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,330
What you say is true.

284
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,980
On the battlefield, no one is wrong.

285
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,340
The fault is in having a war that should have been waged.

286
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,820
Brother Hu Te, giving up on hatred,

287
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,740
isn't it a form of pardon to oneself?

288
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,670
Live well.

289
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,070
I will.

290
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,620
Hey. To be honest, I didn't really like you.

291
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,370
I just wanted you to take me away.

292
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,150
Don't think much about it.

293
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,620
Miss Ta Rou, in the future,

294
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,050
if I can help you for anything, I will.

295
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,810
If there's anything, I'll ask my brother. Why would I ask you?

296
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,860
Let's go. Let's go.

297
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,440
Okay. Then we'll bid our farewell.

298
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,180
Farewell.

299
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,730
Brother Xiuyuan, once you go back, think well about

300
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,640
if you'll marry me or if I'll marry you!

301
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,770
Once we are back, let's never talk again about this!

302
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,890
We are finally back! This travel made me very scared and on edge.

303
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,390
If you're scared, things would happen.

304
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,990
There's my husband and deputy general to protect us.

305
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,070
How could something happen?

306
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,730
Good. My Lady, rest first. I still have duty to take care of.

307
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,400
Then take care of it. Don't mind me.

308
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,340
Rou Rou, call everyone out. I want to give them their gifts.

309
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,390
- Okay. 
- Let's go!

310
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,410
I received a secret report from the imperial court saying that many officials are asking the emperor

311
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,680
to investigate on how you embezzled the army's provisions.

312
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,470
It seems, they want to find guilt in you.

313
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,640
Since it's like this, let's follow their wish.

314
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,820
Find some crime for them.

315
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,300
Xiao Su doesn't understand your meaning.

316
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,190
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

317
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,980
It's time to go back to the imperial court.

318
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,120
I still have an important matter to take care of.

319
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,190
They wait idly for an opportunity.

320
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,100
Let's trick them plot with plot.

321
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,370
From today on, make an inventory of the Chu family's past five years of provisions.

322
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,520
Then I'll give you the accounts. You'll send them to the emperor.

323
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,510
Saying that I, Chu Xiuming, am a provision embezzler.

324
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,120
A solider's crime of lying.

325
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:33,570
Then, you will be called back to the imperial court to investigate the matter.

326
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,620
How should we deal with this?

327
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,630
I have my plans.

328
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,490
Tomorrow, follow me back to the barracks.

329
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,020
Yes!

330
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,760
Jin'er.

331
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,450
Jin'er?

332
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,020
What happened, Jin'er? Why is the house so dim?

333
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,820
It's fine, it's fine. I can see clearly.

334
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,630
Why have you wrapped a quilt around yourself?

335
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,450
Are you ill?

336
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,030
Husband, do you want me to tell you the truth?

337
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,400
What have you been hiding from me?

338
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:05,040
A few days ago, I bought a bizarre outfit from the Falcon Tribe bazaar.

339
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,800
I initially wanted to wear it to show it to you.

340
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,640
So why didn't you wear it and show it to me?

341
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,530
I felt it was inappropriate after I put it on.

342
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,920
I was afraid you would regard me with disdain.

343
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,290
I won't. My wife, you are pretty, so you'll look good no matter what you wear.

344
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,430
Husband, do you really wish to see it?

345
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,970
Of course.

346
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,770
Husband... Do you dislike it?

347
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,870
I like it. I like it very much.

348
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,340
But don't you think I'm being too discourteous?

349
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,900
It's too dim here.

350
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,040
My Lady, would you please step into the light

351
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,360
and let me take a better look?

352
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,900
Husband, when did your tongue become so glib?

353
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,510
It doesn't... Correspond with your reputation as a general.

354
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,590
My position as a general already bears no significance in this house.

355
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,600
My only position here is being your husband.

356
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,970
Isn't it normal for married couples to flirt with each other?

357
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:54,390
Jin'er, you've been standing barefooted for quite some time. I'm worried you might catch a chill.

358
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,600
Husband, thank you for being so considerate.

359
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,730
I was busy with my affairs today and neglected you.

360
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,390
Let me apologise to you here and now.

361
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,980
It's a good thing you managed to catch up to me the day before yesterday, otherwise I wouldn't be here anymore.

362
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,100
Jin'er, cease your nonsense.

363
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,930
Today marks the 100th day I've known you.

364
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,070
I have a gift for you.

365
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,140
What a beautiful jade pendant.

366
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,890
Tell me, which sweetheart gave this love token to you?

367
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,300
This was given to me by my Aunt.

368
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,750
When I was little, my Aunt doted on me very much.

369
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,460
She taught me to read and write.

370
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,170
Father was very strict, and made me practice martial arts for many hours.

371
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,180
Aunt would make lots of snacks

372
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,390
and feed them to me secretly.

373
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,190
Since she's your Aunt, that automatically makes her my Aunt as well.

374
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,460
I'll make sure to show her filial respect and thank her for doting on you all those years ago

375
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,530
and turning you into such a handsome man.

376
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,670
She even let me off lightly.

377
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:25,090
Where is your Aunt now? I'd like to meet her in person and thank her properly.

378
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,380
She died with no clear reason whatsoever.

379
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,690
No clear reason?

380
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,150
I must clear the stain on her reputation.

381
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,370
Here, let me put this on for you.

382
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,680
♫ <i> The wind speaks like you  </i> ♫

383
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:12,690
My Aunt told me that if I were to meet my true love one day,

384
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,410
I should gift this to the woman I would be willing to protect for the rest of my life.

385
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,030
It will keep you free from worries till you are a hundred, and it will protect you from harm forever.

386
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,810
♫ <i> Willing to trade a lifetime of prosperity for life's highs and lows </i> ♫

387
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,070
Do not be sad, my Husband.

388
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,070
Aunt may be gone, but you have me now.

389
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,800
I will definitely look after you on Aunt's behalf...

390
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,550
I mean, I will attend to you well, Husband.

391
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:47,020
♫ <i> Naively letting the years pass for one person </i> ♫

392
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,730
♫ <i> Love is the spring to a lifeless land </i> ♫

393
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,740
♫ <i> Opening the door to my heart without sound or notice </i> ♫

394
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,500
♫ <i> Stars change positions, time passes </i> ♫

395
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,530
♫ <i> I wish to be your loyal servant </i> ♫

396
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,080
By gifting me with such a valuable jade ornament,

397
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,620
the general must have an importance place in his heart for me.

398
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,510
The general treats you very well, Miss.

399
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,230
You must treat the general even better in the future.

400
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,960
You're right. From now on, I will be more meticulous towards the general.

401
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,240
I am his family now.

402
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,790
Your Ladyship.

403
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,800
Deputy general, what are you doing here?

404
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,960
Why aren't you at the barracks with the general?

405
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,000
The general has to take care of an important military matter, so he sent me to guard Your Ladyship.

406
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,350
I'll be fine in the manor. You don't have to guard me.

407
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,960
Don't mind me, Your Ladyship. You may go about your business as per normal.

408
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,510
All right. We're going to the kitchen to do some chores.

409
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,130
You may follow us if you wish.

410
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,830
Deputy general, just come with us.

411
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,760
Most of it is physical work, anyway. Come.

412
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,120
Your Ladyship, how would you like me to help you?

413
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,130
The food the general eats at the barracks isn't good.

414
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,430
I want to make some dumplings for him, but I'm not sure where to start.

415
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,320
Your Ladyship, don't touch anything. I will help you.

416
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,510
Deputy general, I'll fetch the basin for you.

417
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,680
Be careful.

418
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,950
As expected, you are well versed in the martial arts! You have so much strength.

419
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,500
I'm lucky to have you here, deputy general.

420
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,840
Your Ladyship, you're being too polite.

421
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:20,220
It looks delicious! Let me try one.

422
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,480
- Be careful! 
 - It's scorching hot!

423
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,120
Miss, here's a pair of chopsticks and a bowl for you

424
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,750
Deputy general, you were the one who worked the hardest today. Try one.

425
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,660
- Your Ladyship, you should have it. 
 - Don't be so polite with me. Just try it.

426
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,160
Yes.

427
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,450
- How is it? 
 - It tastes really good!

428
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,090
Let me try one too.

429
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,930
It's delicious! Deputy general, you really put in a lot of effort today. You worked really hard.

430
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,090
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do so, Your Ladyship.

431
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:59,070
I'll take these to the barracks later and let the general try my cooking.

432
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,760
Your Ladyship, the carriage will bump around a lot and the sky has already darkened.

433
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,580
Why don't you let this subordinate take your place? I'll ride there quickly and be back in a jiffy.

434
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,060
The general will also be able to have them while they're still hot.

435
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,710
You're right, deputy general. I'll have to trouble you then.

436
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,320
Remember to tell him I made it!

437
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,930
I understand!

438
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,670
General!

439
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,270
Her Ladyship made dumplings and told me to bring them to you.

440
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,840
Jin'er made it herself?

441
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,400
What a surprise!

442
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,540
Xiuyuan, you've worked hard.

443
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,880
Take good care of My Lady for a few days.

444
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,080
I will definitely take good care of her! I'll go back now.

445
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,610
Go on.

446
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,630
Miss!

447
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,550
Miss?

448
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,610
<i>[Yong Ning Manor]</i>

449
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,420
Where did she go in a few seconds?

450
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,110
Rou Rou, I'm back!

451
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,190
Miss. Did you forget me when you went out today?

452
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,280
Lieutenant General wanted to go outside with me, so I went.

453
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,870
I forgot to tell you. But I bought a new roll of fabric!

454
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,340
We can make new clothes together!

455
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,420
That's not right. You completely forgot me recently!

456
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,660
Why do you say that?

457
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:49,060
Lieutenant General Xiuyuan, Lieutenant General Xiuyuan, you keep talking about Lieutenant General Xiuyuan!

458
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:53,660
Whether you're outside or doing things inside, you just need him to be with you!

459
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,130
You completely forgot me, the maid who's been with you for years!

460
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,890
Lieutenant General is taking good care of me under General's orders.

461
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,090
I completely forgot about General, much less you.

462
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,150
Please don't mind!

463
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,430
Don't blame me for talking a lot.

464
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,830
General gave orders, but there's difference between man and woman!

465
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:14,470
You two are getting too close. Be careful, or else General will get jealous.

466
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,690
Lieutenant General and I aren't rash people. Why would he get jealous?

467
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,990
Even if you say that, I still think it's strange!

468
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,730
Last time, he even dragged me to the medical officer to ask after your health!

469
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,440
He was so anxious when he heard your menstrual cycles were irregular!

470
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,940
<i>General has important matters to deal with, so he told me to come back and watch over you.</i>

471
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,150
<i>It suits you well! Let's buy it!</i>

472
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,030
<i>Your Ladyship looks good in anything!
-Try it!</i>

473
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,890
<i>-Are you following me no matter where I go?
-Yes.</i>

474
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,820
Rou Rou, you're right!

475
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,520
I really have been with Lieutenant General a lot recently.

476
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,600
This means Chu Xiuming forgot <i>me!</i>

477
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,250
It's fine Rou Rou. I'll go find General right now.

478
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,380
Prepare a horse and carriage for me.

479
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,310
I...

480
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:01,350
Hey! I'm not talking about General!

481
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,870
It's finally ready.

482
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,950
Your efforts these past few days were not in vain.

483
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,680
I'll have to trouble you with sending this evidence to the palace.

484
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,550
I understand.

485
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,330
This is an important matter.

486
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,360
It involves not only my head,

487
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,480
but also the lives of all the soldiers.

488
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,450
This must be dealt with secretly.

489
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,440
Yes sir.

490
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,390
After His Majesty finds out, he will definitely gather all the court officials.

491
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,630
There will definitely people trying to finish me off.

492
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,210
What should you do, General?

493
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,930
I will counteract with a move that will <i>"invite them kindly into the urn". 
 (Idiom - to give someone a taste of his own medicine)</i>

494
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,170
Go to the capital when the sun rises. You must not wait even one second.

495
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,280
Yes. I will definitely rush to the capital.

496
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,750
<i>I want to see General!</i>

497
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,750
<i>General ordered that no one can enter.</i>

498
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,740
<i>Then who am I?</i>

499
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,410
-Your Ladyship.
-Am I just anyone?

500
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,170
No you're not.

501
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,930
<i>Let me think about it.</i>

502
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,310
<i>Stop thinking. Hurry up! I want to see General!</i>

503
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,880
<i>This...</i>

504
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,670
<i>Please don't make things hard on me. General said no one can enter!</i>

505
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,820
<i>This person!</i>

506
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,850
Bao Zitou!

507
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,190
<i>Let her come in.</i>

508
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,740
Yes!

509
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,520
Jin'er. I have important matters to address.

510
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,910
Why did you come?

511
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,470
I also have something important to discuss with you!

512
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,080
Tell me.

513
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,120
It's a serious matter, an emergency situation!

514
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,700
Just what is it?

515
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:56,000
Chu Xiuming. Did you forget about your wife?

516
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,160
Have you also forgotten about your pledge of undying love?

517
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,310
Why do you say that? How could I forget about my Jin'er?

518
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,000
Then why haven't you returned for days?

519
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,850
I really do have important things to deal with. I don't have time to go home.

520
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,790
No time? What a great excuse!

521
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,680
You can ignore your little wife's life just because you're busy?

522
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,650
It's because there's no time, you can just push me to Lieutenant General Xiuyuan?

523
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,610
You're wrong. It's precisely because I'm afraid you'll overthink,

524
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,540
that's why I sent Lieutenant General Xiuyuan to care for you.

525
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,110
How could I ignore you?

526
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,910
But Lieutenant General is Lieutenant General. Husband is Husband.

527
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,210
How could he take your place?

528
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,100
Besides, Lieutenant General and I have no relationship.

529
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,650
Why must you leave me under his care?

530
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:44,310
Men and women are different! If we get too close, aren't you afraid people will start rumors?

531
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,700
You won't get jealous?

532
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,680
Who should I be jealous of? Lieutenant General Xiuyuan?

533
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,990
Why are you laughing?

534
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,570
I'm just saying this, but you cannot be careless!

535
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:07,030
You're in the wrong to ignore me!

536
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:10,850
I'm not jealous because Xiuyuan is my little brother.

537
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,900
He's your little Brother-in-law.

538
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,010
Brother-in-law?

539
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,910
Yes. Brother-in-law.

540
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,810
Then...why didn't you tell me earlier

541
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,870
that Lieutenant General Xiuyuan is my Brother-in-law?

542
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:35,090
The story of Xiuyuan's identity starts from over ten years ago.

543
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,220
When the previous emperor was alive, he named the 8th Prince as Crown Prince.

544
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,000
My aunt was the Crown Princess.

545
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,270
And Xiuyuan is their sole child.

546
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,740
X-

547
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,430
Then that means...

548
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:05,090
Lieutenant General Xiuyuan is a legitimate royal grandchild?

549
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:14,020
That year, 8th Prince Manor suddenly went up in flames.

550
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,580
Everyone died inside the  manor.

551
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,330
Besides 8th Prince and my aunt's only child, Xiuyuan.

552
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:29,340
Later, the current emperor took the throne.

553
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:33,910
My father secretly took Xiuyuan to the border and raised him.

554
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,910
And he never told me how it happened.

555
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,320
Then it looks like something was going on behind this!

556
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:50,160
My Chu family is the 8th Princess Consort's maternal family.

557
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,540
Ever since my parents died, I took care of Xiuyuan by myself.

558
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,160
At the same time, I investigated the 8th Prince's death.

559
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,640
I want to help Xiuyuan restore his identity.

560
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,590
I heard my Royal Father mention it before!

561
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:08,640
Back then, the Crown Prince was wise in politics and sought out men of wisdom and valour who also admonished him.

562
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,630
He would certainly be a good emperor!

563
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,870
And the Chu family has earned great merit and has been loyal for generations.

564
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,070
Jin'er.

565
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,110
This has to do with Xiuyuan's life.

566
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,850
I told you this today.

567
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,880
You must guard this secret well.

568
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,790
Since I married you, I will do my best for the Chu family.

569
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:41,500
Starting from today, my heart will be aligned with yours,

570
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,900
and guard this secretly well, protect Xiuyuan well.

571
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,190
You really are my smart and magnanimous little wife.

572
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,170
I am satisfied to have you in this life.

573
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:10,240
Jin'er. I have another big gift to give you.

574
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,780
What is it? Hurry and give it to me!

575
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,570
I'm taking you home.

576
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,470
Back to the manor?

577
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,470
Back to the capital.

578
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,020
We can return to the capital?

579
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,850
Then I can see my mother?

580
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,290
Rou Rou! We can go back to the capital!

581
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,840
We can go see Mother!

582
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,250
<i>[Bonus Scene]</i>

583
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,380
General Xiuming! We rushed here as soon as we received the letter at home.

584
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,740
Princess Ma Ya, you've come just in time.

585
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,320
I've investigated this person's identity.

586
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,370
Hu Te's father is the military commander Ba Te'er.

587
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:00,730
He died...under your sword.

588
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:03,240
Hu Te is Ba Te'er's son?
