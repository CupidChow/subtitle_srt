<i>[Episode 17]</i>

19
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,640
Father, my husband and I congratulate you on your birthday.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,680
Father, may your happiness be as boundless as the western sea and may you live long!

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,320
Great!

22
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,350
Older sister and brother-in-law beat me to it, but I must speak too.

23
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,350
I wish Father flourishing years and longevity.

24
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,600
Little brat, you're still the most obedient.

25
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,950
Come!

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,750
I came late.

27
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,870
Zi'er, sit quickly.

28
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,940
Zi'er knows that Father is very cultured and really likes calligraphy and painting.

29
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,380
So I searched North and South

30
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,250
and paid a lot of gold to find a famous painting.

31
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,660
Quickly let me see it.

32
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,650
Today, so many sisters and both brothers-in-law are here.

33
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,960
It's the perfect time to help Father evaluate this.

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,500
Brothers-in-Law, you are both very educated men who have seen a lot.

35
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,760
Please help Zi'er tell if this gift is worth it.

36
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,760
This painting, there's vigor in the strokes and they are powerful.

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,810
Is it the genuine artwork of Tong Douzi from the previous dynasty?

38
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,980
Tong Douzi?

39
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,170
Brother-in-Law has a good eye.

40
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,200
This painting indeed is the genuine artwork of Tong Douzi.

41
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,830
Big Sister, you're so lucky.

42
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,750
I didn't think that Brother-in-Law and you were both well-studied and cultured people.

43
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,350
Unlike some people who know nothing themselves,

44
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,700
and even their husband can barely read.

45
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,210
Those two idiots suit each other well.

46
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,160
Big Sister Zi, you sound so sarcastic. Who are you talking about?

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,180
I wasn't talking about anyone. What are you angry for, Little Sister Jin?

48
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,660
Great! What a beautiful painting. It's really, a really good painting.

49
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,630
This painting delayed Jin'er from eating dinner.

50
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,360
<i>- Zi'er! </i> <br> - Do you want to really get back at them?

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,980
<i>I thank you.</i>

52
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,510
<i>- Come on.</i> <br> - Do you have an idea, my husband?

53
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,280
<i>As long as Father is happy.</i>

54
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,740
<i>What are you still waiting for? Show it to everyone!</i>

55
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,650
Can we do that?

56
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,300
Your husband is here, what are you afraid of?

57
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,240
Shen Jin! What are you doing! I spent a lot of money on that!

58
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,290
Jin'er, what are you doing?

59
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,080
Why did you suddenly tear up the painting?

60
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,250
Father-in-Law, please calm down.

61
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,250
This is part of Jin'er 's gift to you, too.

62
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,510
What do you mean?

63
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,010
This drawing... is a fake.

64
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,570
A fake?

65
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,510
That's impossible!

66
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,030
Painter Tong Douzi's calligraphy technique uses oblique angles and he paints with vigorous strokes.

67
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,660
It's not a technique normal pinters can achieve.

68
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,290
This painting was a close imitation.

69
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,530
But in this part, it was painted using two (different) strokes,

70
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,110
unlike the great master who can do it with one stroke.

71
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,940
Also, the paper is obviously one used by the officials of this dynasty.

72
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,780
It's not what people would have used in the previous dynasty.

73
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,640
Fortunately, the general is experienced and knowledgeable and recognized the fake.

74
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,190
Otherwise, we would all have been known as amateurs and posers.

75
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,520
I'm ashamed.

76
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,460
Father-in-Law, please don't be angry.

77
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,740
My wife, Jin'er, got rid of the fake and saved a genuine one for you.

78
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,850
Since she tore up this painting, then she must have an authentic piece to replace it.

79
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,520
There's still an authentic one?

80
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,860
Rou Rou!

81
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,910
This... Isn't this?

82
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,220
Isn't this the "Sea of Bamboo In The Autumn Wind" that I have spent years searching for?

83
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,980
Exactly.

84
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,920
Jin'er understands my heart the best.

85
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,290
I am very happy. Let's raise our glasses.

86
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,470
<i>Father.</i>

87
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,490
Father-in-Law, I wish that we enjoy our family ties and that we will laugh often.

88
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,420
That's a great wish.

89
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,630
Let's eat.

90
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,010
Big Sister. Big Sister.

91
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:22,530
I'm so angry. That brat, Shen Jin, embarrassed me in front of everyone.

92
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,060
I didn't realize Chu Xiuming was cultured and has prowess, too.

93
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,900
We should give up.

94
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,150
Give up? I'm not taking it!

95
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,370
But... what other means do we have?

96
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,020
You're useless. I'm also useless.

97
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,050
Let's find a tough character to deal with her.

98
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,710
A tough character?

99
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,690
Second Sister, who are you talking about?

100
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,770
Do you remember who kicked our mother out from the courtyard?

101
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,050
You're talking about the new concubine Father married?

102
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,320
Exactly. She thinks she's so smart. We'll be even smarter.

103
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,080
We'll get someone else to do our dirty business!

104
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,110
Isn't Father's youngest concubine returning soon?

105
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,510
I'll make up something and get her to deal with this brat.

106
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,650
She's here!

107
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,790
You came back!

108
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,810
I came back as promised, Your Highness.

109
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,120
Your trip must have been tiring. How was it?

110
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,060
Your Highness, these days I was faithfully studying Buddhism.

111
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,810
I asked Buddha to keep Your Highness healthy.

112
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,500
For everyone to be safe and things to go smoothly in the manor.

113
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,850
It seems this Concubine Bai really knows how to please Father. He really believes her.

114
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,250
<i>- You're so thoughtful.</i> <br> - She seems to be your age.

115
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,590
Young Madam.

116
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,380
Little Sister. <br> <i>(T/N: Wives usually address each other as sisters.)</i>

117
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,520
My mother is greeting you.

118
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,210
How come you're so impolite?

119
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,220
Who is she?

120
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,030
Let me introduce you.

121
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,120
This is the wife of Lord Yongning, Chu Xiuming.

122
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,100
She's also my daughter, Shen Jin.

123
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,650
The Great General's wife.

124
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,020
So you are Big Sister's daughter, Jin'er.

125
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,980
Even though I'm grateful to be related through Big Sister,

126
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,540
I'm still an elder to Lord Yongning's wife, right?

127
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,720
Then shouldn't Jin'er, like other girls her age, also call me, Young Madam? <i>(T/N: Means "Youngest Mother" since she's the newest wife.)</i>

128
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,800
Yes, she should. She should call you, Young Madam.

129
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,160
Jin'er, you are now the wife of the Great General.

130
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,410
You must understand the etiquette. Call her, Young Madam.

131
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,650
Jin'er, say it.

132
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,850
Young Madam Bai.

133
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,680
I will accept it.

134
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,430
Your Highness, these days I have been really tired.

135
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,110
Let's go back and have a rest.

136
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,820
Good.

137
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,700
How can a woman like that have such power? What kind of world do we live in?

138
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,290
Your "Young Madam" won't be easy to deal with.

139
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,780
Let's go.

140
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,450
<i>[Rui Royal Manor]</i>

141
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,280
Now this will be interesting.

142
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,760
Aunt, I prepared pastries especially for you.

143
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,940
Young Madam, hurry and give them a try.

144
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,710
Among the ladies, only you complete tasks most thoroughly.

145
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,230
I truly like you, Young Madam.

146
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,810
I want to be close to you.

147
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,060
I saw that you and my father love each other.

148
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,000
You also have exceptional looks and are a virtuous lady.

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,390
In the future, the manor will be in your hands for sure.

150
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,730
Sooner or later, you'll be the one in charge.

151
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,150
Don't say that. Princess Consort Rui is still here.

152
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,460
There's no room for me to speak.

153
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,850
Look at what you're saying.

154
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,710
If Princess Consort Rui weren't afraid of you,

155
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,140
then why would she hide herself far away in the palace.

156
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,020
What Lady Zi said is right.

157
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,910
In this manor, everyone knows that you have the last word, Lady Bai.

158
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,300
But...

159
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,630
But what?

160
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,360
But that brat, Shen Jin, glares at you fiercely like a tiger.

161
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,700
You saw how disrespectful she was to you outside the manor today.

162
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,080
She looked so indignant.

163
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,190
What can she do?

164
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,780
She still has to obey and call me Young Madam

165
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,430
But think about it, Young Madam.

166
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,210
Because Shen Jin's husband is a general,

167
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,730
Shen Jin struts around all day showing off her military strength.

168
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,430
I fear that someday she might march all over you

169
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,400
and fight for favor for her mother in front of our Royal Father.

170
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,610
With just her?

171
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,510
I just think that you're a kind lady.

172
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,020
What if she shoots you in the back later on?

173
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,570
So I came here today to mention it to you.

174
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,130
Looks like, as her Young Madam,

175
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,140
I have to teach this Young Miss Jin a lesson.

176
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,600
<i>Shen Jin, you brat, now you'll get it.</i>

177
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,710
Then I won't disturb you anymore, Young Madam.

178
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,870
I'll take my leave.

179
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,510
Go ahead.

180
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,520
Madam, how should we take action?

181
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,520
Tonight, go to Shen Jin's place and gather some information.

182
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,620
Let's wait and see what type of person she is before doing anything.

183
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,510
Zhu'er understands.

184
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,490
As for these snacks, you may have them.

185
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,520
I thank you, My Lady.

186
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,790
Rou Rou, what are you looking at?

187
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,650
Miss, I think I see Concubine Bai's personal maid, Zhu'er, outside our room.

188
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,460
She keeps raising her head up to look into our room.

189
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,970
She's sure retaliating fast.

190
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,300
General, Rou Rou will take her leave.

191
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,660
What's going on? Acting so mysterious.

192
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,000
Back home, at the General's Manor, I am busy all day and I don't feel tired.

193
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,830
Since I am back here at the Rui Royal Manor, I find myself to be very tired.

194
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,440
What is it? What worries you?

195
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,090
I only found out today, too.

196
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,770
My father took in another new concubine.

197
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,380
I heard she used to be a singer in a brothel. Father likes her a lot.

198
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,040
But behind his back, she's so snobbishly fierce.

199
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,800
Everyone in the manor is afraid of her.

200
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,000
Wife, you're a married daughter.

201
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,260
We are only staying here temporarily.

202
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,310
It's better not to get involved.

203
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,990
If you are unhappy, we can just leave earlier.

204
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,060
I really don't care.

205
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,460
But I just can't bear to see my mother being bullied.

206
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,410
That's a frustration that I can't control.

207
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,250
Because it's about your mother,

208
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,490
is why you should control your emotions even more so.

209
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,760
Don't cause trouble for your mother for a one-time victory.

210
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,630
I naturally understand that. I won't go overboard.

211
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,620
As long she doesn't bother my mother, I won't cause trouble.

212
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,600
It's good as long as you understand.

213
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,290
About this, that's the problem with you men.

214
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,990
Jin'er, what do you mean?

215
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,130
Look, my father has already taken in three concubines.

216
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,570
Also, all of his daughters are already grown women.

217
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,980
Yet he still wants to take in another concubine.

218
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,020
He's downright greedy.

219
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,330
Don't worry too much about your father taking in concubines.

220
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,710
After all, he's your father. It's not good to criticize too much.

221
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,680
Fine. Then I won't talk about Father.

222
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,350
Let's talk about you.

223
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,730
Chu Xiuming, how many concubines are you planning to have?

224
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,200
Ah, well, I'm not sure.

225
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,240
Probably not less than your father.

226
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,740
Chu Xiuming, I just knew you were the same way!

227
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,150
There are no good guys!

228
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,910
You're angry?

229
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,720
Husband is only teasing you.

230
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,420
I, Chu Xiuming, am satisfied with having just Jin'er in this lifetime.

231
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,150
I knew you would say that.

232
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,050
You will probably also say, "My Jin'er has such a bad temper,

233
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,530
she's always making trouble."

234
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,720
Chu Xiuming, you already have a hard time handling me,

235
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,760
where would you find the time and energy to marry more concubines?

236
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,960
Wouldn't that be bringing disaster upon yourself?

237
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,930
I didn't say that!

238
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,190
But your heart is thinking like that.

239
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,820
What your husband is thinking now is...

240
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,840
Oh, I want to sleep.

241
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,990
Chu Xiuming, answer me honestly.

242
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,730
Is that what you're thinking right now?

243
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,350
What are you saying? I don't understand.

244
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,990
I'm saying if you want to marry more wives or concubines,

245
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,570
then... I will...

246
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,010
Jin'er, do you want to kill your dear husband?

247
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,120
Killing you would be letting you off easy!

248
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,420
I will let you live and then torture you,

249
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,030
making you wish you were dead.

250
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:34,220
Jin'er, I will live well and let you torture me slowly.

251
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,400
In your husband's eyes, Jin'er causing trouble is charming.

252
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,890
Jin'er restraining me represents her caring.

253
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,560
Meeting Jin'er is my luck.

254
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,170
I'm blessed for marrying Jin'er.

255
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,070
Being with Jin'er is perfect.

256
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,400
I'm fully satisfied with having Jin'er.

257
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,500
Perfectly happy?

258
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,300
Chu Xiuming, you say such sweet words every day.

259
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,590
It doesn't match your reputation of being the Devil General at all!

260
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,850
I'm the general, the devil is somebody else.

261
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,900
Who?

262
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,870
Of course, it's you.

263
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,510
You're this general's Little Devil.

264
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,680
You're so silly.

265
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,880
In the future, if someone brings up the "Devil General" nickname,

266
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,390
it's not only about me anymore,

267
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,100
it's Jin'er and me, together.

268
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,590
Then, General, how will you call Jin'er?

269
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,400
Let met think.

270
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,340
How about...

271
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,450
Little Devil Jin'er.

272
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,350
It's hurts!

273
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,520
It hurts so bad! You Little Devil!

274
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,180
Release me!

275
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,370
Yes! Yes! Yes!

276
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,530
<i>Miss, have some congee.</i>

277
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,690
Today's dishes are buns with pork filling,

278
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,120
and scallion pancakes.

279
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,930
<i>Third Miss, may I please come in?</i>

280
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,590
Who is it?

281
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,330
From the voice, it sounds like it's Concubine Bai's personal maid, Zhu'er.

282
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,370
- She's that person who was outside hanging around suspiciously last night. <br> - Her?

283
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,030
You may come in.

284
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,640
Maid Zhu'er greets Third Miss.

285
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,530
What is it?

286
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,670
Concubine Bai made some fresh pastries.

287
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,150
She's already sent some to all the other daughters in the manor.

288
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,470
I'm here to give some to Third Miss.

289
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,410
Please thank Concubine Bai for me.

290
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,500
Is there something else?

291
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,770
Concubine Bai said she wanted all the daughters of the manor to try some.

292
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,080
I understand, I'll eat some later.

293
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,860
Concubine Bai also said she wanted to see each daughter having a taste.

294
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,700
What for?

295
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,390
Concubine Bai said,

296
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,200
once each daughter has tasted it,

297
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,920
to quickly report each lady's thoughts and

298
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,860
suggestions back to Concubine Bai.

299
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,350
This way, when Concubine Bai makes some again, she can make them suit each daughter perfectly.

300
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,550
Enough. My head's about to explode listening to you.

301
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,680
I already told you that I will eat it.

302
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,590
In a bit, I'll get Rou Rou to come and tell you about it. You're dismissed.

303
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,740
Third Miss! Concubine Bai is very strict.

304
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,570
If I don't follow the orders she gives properly, I'll be punished.

305
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,940
Just think of it as taking pity on me.

306
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,510
She already said she'll eat it later.

307
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,750
Our miss has just started to eat breakfast,

308
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,510
are you trying to force her to eat it now?

309
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,900
It couldn't be that Third Miss thinks there's something wrong with these snacks?

310
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,420
Is that why she doesn't dare eat them?

311
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,960
Miss, then... how about...

312
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,140
you just try one.

313
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,870
Miss! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

314
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,410
- Rou Rou! What's wrong with you? <br> - Yes, it's my fault.

315
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,870
Um... Zhu'er, right?

316
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,170
Take a look, take a look.

317
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,420
It looks like things just don't work out when it's related to Concubine Bai.

318
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,970
Maybe this wasn't supposed to ever enter my mouth.

319
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,940
What should we do? They're everywhere.

320
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,730
In a bit, I'll beat this brat to death.

321
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,760
Don't worry, Third Miss.

322
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,440
Zhu'er still has another serving with her.

323
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,910
You--

324
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,470
Is there no end to this! I already said I don't want to eat them now!

325
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,610
You're just the small maid of a concubine by my father's side.

326
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,940
- Don't tell me you— <br> - Jin'er, are you playing a prank on someone again?

327
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,050
The people that know what's going on understand you're playing a prank.

328
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:19,100
The people that don't know might think that Lord Yongning's wife is trying to be difficult.

329
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,440
Greetings to Lord Yongning.

330
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,070
It melts in the mouth and the taste is quite good.

331
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,780
Please go back and tell Concubine Bai that we thank her for the snacks.

332
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,890
It's just that Lord Yongning's wife never has liked sweet things.

333
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,100
It's better not to send her any over next time.

334
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,020
I understand, I'll take my leave now.

335
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,630
I had better escort you out, just in case you get lost and start wandering around everywhere again.

336
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,030
Take this back, too.

337
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,240
Let's go.

338
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,350
Why did you eat the food they brought over?

339
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,110
What if they put something bad in it and your stomach gets upset?

340
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,380
Jin'er, don't worry.

341
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,340
Even if there was something bad in it, they wouldn't have sent it over here using their own name.

342
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,570
Of course, I know that.

343
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,930
But why are they doing that?

344
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,620
It's one of two reasons.

345
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,620
Maybe she wanted to start a closer relationship with you and sent the food over,

346
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,460
or maybe it's just a warning

347
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,010
to remind you who's really in charge in this manor.

348
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,160
No matter which of those is the reason, this isn't a smart person;

349
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,010
so Jin'er, you don't need to lose your temper.

350
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,640
It's just that Concubine Bai sent over a maid just to irritate me,

351
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,460
so, of course, I couldn't hold my temper.

352
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,460
These type of people who openly scheme,

353
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,990
we'll definitely be on our guard for them, so there's no need to fear.

354
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,370
Instead, those who are always smiling,

355
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:02,130
but secretly make plots behind our backs are the ones we need to wary of.

356
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,660
I miss our General's Manor.

357
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,990
If Jin'er doesn't like it here, we can just move out.

358
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,730
Better not.

359
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,900
I can't leave my mother here alone.

360
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,880
Jin'er, don't worry, as long as I'm here,

361
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,360
I'll make sure you and your mother won't be bullied by anyone.

362
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,790
No one can touch my little devil.

363
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,010
I know, General.

364
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,120
Your little devil is not afraid of anything.

365
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,500
General. Miss...

366
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,150
The royal manor has recently acquired some new fabrics that were granted by His Majesty.

367
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,510
His Majesty has also specially hired a tailor to take measurements from the ladies.

368
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,690
His Highness has requested General and Miss to go together to choose them.

369
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,270
Let's go.

370
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,990
May I ask? Are we required to pay for these fabrics?

371
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,170
No need. These were gifted by His Majesty.

372
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,040
That's good.

373
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,770
Shu'er, this piece looks quite refined.

374
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,760
I'm not used to the texture of this fabric.

375
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:43,210
Then what about this piece? We can trim a close-fitting upper garment from it. How beautiful would that be?

376
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,180
Husband, with my figure, how could I wear such a style?

377
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,340
This one isn't good, that one isn't good.

378
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,980
As the saying from the old books goes, only women and servants are hard to raise.

379
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,730
Whatever husband says is right. I'll just listen to you.

380
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,320
Then let's go with this piece.

381
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,270
That's good then. I still have some official business to handle.

382
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,630
Hurry up and go grind the inkstone, and serve the tea for me.

383
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,950
Farewell.

384
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,310
Eldest Sister, as the old saying goes, a woman makes herself beautiful for her beloved.

385
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,370
Look how good Eldest Sister has got it. She even has Brother-in-Law helping her pick out fabrics.

386
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,970
It's just Second Sister and me who are all alone.

387
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,890
Your little sister is so jealous of you.

388
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,800
There's nothing to be envious about.

389
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,260
Since Little Sister is still young, there's a lot of things you don't understand.

390
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,750
I'm more aware than anyone about the type of marriage like the one Eldest Sister has.

391
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,930
It's gold and jade on the outside, but rotten and decayed on the inside.

392
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,620
They're seemingly harmonious but divided in heart.

393
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,540
Those husbands detest the sight of their own wives.

394
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,750
Forget about tailoring clothes.

395
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,850
Even if the person sharing their bed had a different face,

396
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,350
they may not even notice.

397
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,990
A man like that, I wouldn't want him.

398
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,300
These bolts of fabric are all very pretty.

399
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,890
Take your time picking them out, Little Sister. I'll be going now.

400
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,480
Greetings to Eldest Sister.

401
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,970
Little Sister Jin is too polite.

402
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,840
Greetings to Eldest Sister.

403
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,610
Eldest Sister, has everyone already picked out the fabrics they want from the ones His Majesty granted?

404
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,830
Your brother-in-law has already picked one out for me.

405
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,720
We have other matters to attend to, so we're leaving now.

406
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Later on, I'll go into more detail with Little Sister.

407
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,730
Eldest Sister, take care.

408
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,910
Eldest Sister looked embarrassed and seemed like she had something on her mind.

409
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,540
Maybe a bit later on, I'll go and have a chat with Eldest Sister.

410
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,250
Jin'er, last spring, you bought a set of spring clothes that are crescent moon white.

411
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,810
With this light blue colored fabric, you can make a small shirt to match your spring clothing set.

412
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,020
What are your thoughts on this, Jin'er?

413
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,540
Excuse me, General Chu.

414
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,470
I've already got my eyes set on that piece of fabric.

415
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,200
The two of you should choose something else.

416
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,850
No problem. My wife has snow-white skin,

417
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,210
this bright pink fabric also suits my wife quite well.

418
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,210
As the saying goes, her face reflects the red of peach blossoms.

419
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,920
I didn't expect Brother-in-Law General to be this considerate

420
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,280
and understand a girl's heart so well.

421
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,910
Since Little Sister is the youngest of age in this manor,

422
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:08,950
not sure if Older Sister and Brother-in-Law can let Little Sister have this piece of fabric?

423
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,060
Why should we?

424
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,900
If Sister Jin'er isn't willing, then Little Sister won't dare say anything more,

425
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,340
Older Sister can just take it.

426
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,760
You're overthinking, Little Sister.

427
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,180
If Little Sister likes it, then you should take it.

428
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,150
Your Sister Jin'er isn't a selfish person like that.

429
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,650
Besides, these fabrics granted by His Majesty

430
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,060
were supposed to be for the ladies in this manor.

431
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,600
It doesn't matter who takes what as long as everyone is happy with them.

432
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,350
Then Little Sister thanks Brother-in-Law.

433
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,270
Since everyone cares for Youngest Sister,

434
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,280
then Little Sister won't regard you as an outsider.

435
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,670
Take these other fabrics and make some extra outfits based on the measurements of Sister Zhi and me.

436
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,710
Youngest Sister and Brother-in-Law, I thank you then.

437
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,420
I--

438
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,940
Why were you so courteous with them?

439
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,760
You clearly knew they were doing that deliberately and were up to no good.

440
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,160
It's just a few bolts of fabric, let's not hurt the harmony in this manor.

441
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,210
Let's not let a trivial matter like this cause other people to talk behind our backs.

442
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,420
How can this be a trivial matter?

443
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,550
All these fabrics granted by His Majesty have been picked by them,

444
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,270
what are we going to do about my new clothes?

445
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,490
Don't fret, Jin'er.

446
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:27,490
I'll take you to the market and find the best fabric shop in Jingcheng for you to choose from.

447
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,710
At the same time, I'm taking you out to ease your mind.

448
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,290
Leaving the manor to go and play is a very good idea.

449
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,650
Let's go.

450
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,800
Today, it looked like the way Chu Xiuming treated Shen Jin

451
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,050
wasn't as great as we had thought it to be.

452
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,890
That's because you were there, Sister Zhi.

453
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:52,070
How could that Shen Jin steal Sister Zhi's limelight?

454
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,620
I didn't expect this Chu Xiuming to be so well versed in both pen and the sword,

455
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,530
and still be so charming.

456
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,350
He really dotes on Little Sister.

457
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,160
Little Sister must really be satisfied.

458
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,670
It was only because I'm Sister Zhi's little sister, that's why Chu Xiuming let me have my way.

459
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,620
When Sister Zhi's not around, he's never acknowledged me before.

460
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,300
Oh, really?

461
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,200
How can it not be true?

462
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,730
Could Older Sister be misunderstanding Little Sister?

463
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,440
This Chu Xiuming was originally supposed to be Sister Zhi's husband.

464
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,100
What nonsense are you spouting?

465
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,240
This Chu Xiuming is already that weird girl Shen Jin's husband,

466
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,410
h-how can I be interested in him?

467
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,030
If you keep spouting such nonsense, other people might misunderstand!

468
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:37,390
Isn't Little Sister just grumbling about Older Sister's grievances?

469
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,710
Don't say another word about this again!

470
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,700
Husband, it's not good if others see this.

471
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,600
What's not good about holding my own wife's hand?

472
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
This is the capital city.

473
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,000
If you meet your colleagues from the Imperial Court,

474
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,800
then they'll laugh at you.

475
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:16,000
Then at the barracks, I wasn't embarrassed when I carried you on my shoulders.

476
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,600
This is only holding hands.

477
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,200
How come you were not shy back then?

478
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,000
Jin'er, did you have a lover when you were young

479
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,400
and you're afraid that I'll run into your old flames?

480
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,800
Fine. I can't beat you at that argument. You can do whatever you want.

481
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,900
Jin'er, it's rare for us to come out.

482
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,400
See if there's anything else that we need and we'll bring it back together.

483
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,200
Why don't we buy some fur for Eldest Sister?

484
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,600
Eldest Sister usually likes that.

485
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,200
She wasn't very happy when we were picking fabric today.

486
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,300
Sure, I'll listen to you then.

487
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:12,100
Jin'er, you seem closest to Eldest Sister.

488
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,600
That's right.

489
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,800
Even though we're all father's daughters,

490
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,900
I was born of a concubine,

491
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,000
so all the rewards from the palace never came to me.

492
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,800
But Eldest Sister would always share with me.

493
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,700
So that's why.

494
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,800
The next day, however, I'd have to watch out for Big Sister Zi.

495
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,100
She envies Eldest Sister, but doesn't dare provoke her.

496
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,700
So she could only pick on me.

497
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,100
It won't happen ever again.

498
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,400
I didn't stand around and just let Big Sister Zi bully me.

499
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,800
Later on, Eldest Sister got married.

500
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,000
Princess Consort took me in then.

501
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,400
So they had to think twice before they did anything.

502
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,200
Let's not mention these sad things. Let's take a look up ahead.

503
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,700
All right.

504
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
- Would you like to take a look? <br> - Do you have any white fox fur?

505
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,600
Are you preparing it for this lady next to you?

506
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,000
How many would you like?

507
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,600
How many do you have in total?

508
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,100
Take a look at the goods first.

509
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,400
This is a fox we hunted this winter beyond the Great Wall.

510
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,800
This fur is soft and good.

511
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,800
Take a look.

512
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Do you like it?

513
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:27,400
Before, the fur that was shared for our room, mother would give it to me.

514
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,500
All right, then let's buy a few more to give one to Eldest Sister and Mother-in-law.

515
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,800
How many white fox furs do you have in total?

516
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
I have three right now. Those foxes are very smart.

517
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
It's not easy to catch them right now.

518
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,000
I'll take all of them. Send them to the Rui Royal Manor.

519
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,100
All right. Thank you, customer.

520
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,900
I'll send them to the manor later. Take care.

521
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,900
You didn't even take a look at the three furs and you ordered all of them.

522
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,000
What if there are problems with those three furs?

523
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,600
I just told her to send them to the Rui Royal Manor. What else can she do?

524
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,400
Oh. <br> <i>[Tingxuan Inn]</i>

525
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,560
Yes. Go ahead.

526
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,470
<i>[Tingxuan Inn]</i>

527
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,300
What's wrong?

528
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,800
Nothing.

529
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,600
Why don't we go have a big meal?

530
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,700
Sure.

531
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,200
I know a restaurant that really suits my little devil's appetite.

532
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,400
Let's set out then.

533
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,300
Let's go.

534
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,000
<i>[Tingxuan Guesthouse]</i>

535
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,800
Wife, was the market fun?

536
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,600
It was fun.

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
but why did they go into the inn?

540
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,000
That's so weird.

541
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,200
What's weird?

542
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I don't know either. Perhaps, I'm overthinking it.

543
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,400
Let's hurry and go back inside. Perhaps, those items have been delivered.

544
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,900
Let's go.

545
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,820
Big Sister.

546
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,000
Younger Sister Jin, hurry and have a seat.

547
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,200
Sister, hurry and take a look. Do you like this?

548
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,200
This is white fox fur. It's really rare.

549
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,500
I knew that you would like it.

550
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,600
Today, Husband and I went to the street market, and we picked it for you together.

551
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,900
You're such a good younger sister. You were even thinking of me.

552
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,160
It's so soft.

553
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,100
Eldest Miss, Princess Consort has invited Royal Physician Wang.

554
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,400
- Greetings, Eldest Miss. <br> - You may rise, Royal Physician Wang.

555
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,260
Here.

556
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:08,000
Royal Physician Wang, this is my third younger sister, Shen Jin. She's also Lady Yongning.

557
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,800
She just came back to the capital city. You probably haven't seen her before.

558
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,000
Greetings, Lady Yongning.

559
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,100
You may rise, Royal Physician Wang.

560
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,600
I'll have to trouble you then, Royal Physician Wang.

561
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,200
Yes.

562
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,800
Eldest Miss, have you been feeling unwell at all?

563
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,090
Just like before. There hasn't been a big difference.

564
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,800
Eldest Miss, from now on you must pay attention.

565
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,400
Don't get angry and don't worry.

566
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,000
Your health will slowly get better.

567
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,200
You'll also have more children.

568
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,300
Children? Big Sis...

569
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,100
Physician Wang, help check my younger sister's pulse as well.

570
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,000
It's been a while since my younger sister has been married.

571
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,500
Take a look to see if she's pregnant.

572
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,800
Don't make fun of me, Big Sister.

573
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:47,210
Royal Physician Wang, is there anything wrong with me?

574
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,900
General, can I check your pulse again?

575
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,600
Me?

576
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
All right.

577
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,300
You may. Please, Royal Physician Wang.

578
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,400
Royal Physician Wang, just be frank.

579
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,000
Is there a complicated condition?

580
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,100
- This... <br> - That's not right.

581
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,600
Even if there is a difficult case, why would you take both of our pulses?

582
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,100
Is there a chronic disease to prevent us from having children?
