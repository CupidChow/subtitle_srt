91
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,610
This title is mine because my husband is Lord Yongning.

You're really something.

93
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,340
You returned home unescorted in the middle of the night.

112
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,930

Elder Sister Zi, you can't have already forgotten what happened that year, have you?

118
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,880
You were so concerned with what goes on in my manor,

119
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,210
perhaps you should concentrate on your own wedding instead.

120
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,610
Elder Sister Jin, don't be angry.

121
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,660
Elder Sister Zi only said those things because she was concerned for you.

122
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,570
After all, you are all alone in the general's manor.

123
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,970
If something were to happen, there would be no one there to support you.

124
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,160
And who has been supporting the both of you today?

125
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,010
You even dare to not know the vastness of Heaven and Earth in my own manor! <i>(T/N: to have an exaggerated opinion of one's abilities)</i>

Eldest Sister, please don't misunderstand.

128
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,670
I don't think Younger Sister Jin would mind.

129
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,070
- We're all sisters from the same fami– <br> - Lady Wife of Lord Yongning.

We're all sisters from the same family,

That's enough.

00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,650
You've already blown the whole matter up. Stop causing trouble, all right?

134
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,800
Younger Sister Zi didn't mean what she said.

135
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,460
Forget about it.

136
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,470

137
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,140
I think you've misunderstood something!

138
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,420
My concern for you only stems from curiosity!

139
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,900
Elder Sister Zi, have some tea.

140
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,850
Drink, drink, drink. Why should I drink tea?

141
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,820
Is there no tea at home for you to drink?

142
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,380
Don't drink it if you don't want to.

143
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,330
What are you getting angry at me for?

144
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,170
It will never be yours no matter how jealous you become!

145
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,130
Why are you always venting your anger on me?

146
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,880
Why are you also treating me in this way?

147
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,340

I am your biological younger sister!

151
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,850
I didn't mean it...

152
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,580
Eldest Sister...

153
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,050
You'll be fine, you'll be fine.

154
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,620
Let me take a look. It won't hurt anymore, it won't hurt anymore.

155
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,550
It's just a little bit.

156
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,520
Don't cry or it'll leave a scar.

157
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,820
You'll be all right.

158
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,300
How could something so preposterous have happened!

159
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,290
I want you to go and assist Shu'er first. I'll head over immediately once I've tidied up.

160
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,910
Yes.

161
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,900
The physician has already been summoned. Madam has also already been called upon, too.

162
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,670
Older Sister Jin, will there be a scar?

163
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,170
There won't. Don't worry.

164
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,280
Why hasn't the imperial physician arrived yet? Someone, go and check on him.

165
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,340
Fourth Miss, I've already sent someone to summon him.

166
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,500
- Please be patient for a while longer. <br> - Don't be anxious.

167
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,670
My face...

168
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,910
Look at what you've done.

169
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,760
She is your biological younger sister.

170
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,440
How could you be so heavy handed?

171
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,670
I-I didn't do it on purpose.

172
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,340
How could I have scratched my own sister?

173
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,200
I should have scratched Shen Jin, that despicable wench instead!

174
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,380
Second Miss, everyone heard you utter those words very clearly.

175
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,410
I will report those exact words you uttered back to Lord Yongning.

176
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,680
Go ahead and report back to him! I'm not afraid of you!

177
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,920
You're still so stubborn!

178
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,510
Why are you still slapping each other? Forget it, forget it. Forget it!

179
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,630
- Have you gone mad? You actually dared to slap me! <br> - I did slap you. What about it?

180
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,950
- How dare you slap me! <br> - Stop fighting!

181
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,850
- Miss... <br> - I'm going to hit you!

182
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,040
- Stop fighting! <br> - Stop it!

183
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,410
What are you hitting each other for?

184
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,540
Do you want someone else to get hurt?

185
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,160
Get out!

186
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,720
Miss...

187
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,000
This is ridiculous.

188
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,690
Go and take a look.

189
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,930
Eldest Sister, what's going to happen to me?

190
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,670
Everything's fine.

191
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,240
I heard the servant girl say that it'll leave a scar.

192
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,540
I'm sorry to have caused you so much trouble.

193
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,360
Don't say that.

194
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,080
I'm already grateful you're not blaming me for not looking after the young ladies.

195
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,050
They're both biological sisters, how did they get into such a mess?

196
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,710
Quick, let's go.

197
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,310
It's all your fault, you wicked wench!

198
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,770
- Keep talking, and I'll zip your lips! <br> - Miss!

199
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,960
- Consort Mother. <br> - Consort Mother.

200
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,410
Jin'er, are you all right?

201
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,580
I'm all right.

202
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,500
Consort Mother, I didn't do it on purpose.

203
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,030
You have to speak up for me!

204
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,450
That's enough from you. We will speak once we have returned to the manor.

205
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,000
You've had a rough day, Lady Wife of the Marquis of Yongle.

206
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,040
- Send someone to escort Zi'er back to the Rui Royal Manor first. <br> - All right.

207
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,450
Consort Mother! I–

208
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,310
Shut your mouth.

209
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
Miss! Miss!

210
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
- Jin'er! Are you all right? <br> - Miss are you all right?

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
My stomach... My stomach hurts!

212
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
Hurry! Hurry!

213
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Help Jin'er inside first! Hurry!

214
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,300
Miss!

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
Slowly.

216
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,100
Slowly, Miss.

217
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,000
Madam, please send someone to the palace to summon a imperial physician!

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,300
Hurry! Take my token and summon an imperial physician!

219
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,700
Yes!

220
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,700
What are you standing there for?

221
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,400
Go home!

222
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
The empress said to report that someone brought Duke Yongle's token to summon an imperial physician.

223
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,400
They said a lady was injured.

224
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,200
Did they say which lady?

225
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,400
I think it was... Lord Yongning's Lady.

226
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,600
Your Majesty, I would like to leave first.

227
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,500
I approve.

228
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,400
- Prince Rui. <br> - Your Majesty.

229
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,600
You should go back, too.

230
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,100
I thank you, Your Majesty.

231
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,900
What happened?

232
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,990
The imperial physician went in already.

233
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,600
Xiuming, wait outside.

234
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Jin will be all right.

235
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
I thank you, Consort Mother,

236
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,300
but what happened?

237
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,900
She just came to visit, how did she get injured?

238
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,800
Tell him the truth!

239
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,600
Tell him the truth!

240
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,200
I heard the servants report that My Lady summoned a physician,

241
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
so I rushed over here.

242
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,100
Before I even entered the doorway, I heard...

243
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,800
I heard Little Sister Zi say, that if she really wanted to leave a scar,

244
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,400
she would have scarred Little Sister Jin's face.

245
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,700
Why would she scar her Little Sister Jin's face?

246
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,500
After all this fuss, Jing was the one injured?

247
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,300
How did it turn into a wrong message about Jin?

248
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,600
Zi became bitter after the argument and pushed Jin'er.

249
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,400
How is Jin'er?

250
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,600
I can't believe you.

251
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,200
Jin'er is pregnant, why didn't you tell everyone?

252
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,700
If we knew, would today's incident have occurred?

253
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,900
Really?

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,800
Imperial Physician! How is Jin'er? Is she all right?

255
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,600
She is early in her pregnancy, the fetus is a little unstable.

256
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
She must rest in bed.

257
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
I have prescribed some medicine. Her Ladyship must drink it on a timely basis.

258
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,800
- I will come again in seven days. <br> - I'm asking about Jin'er, not the baby!

259
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,010
Her Ladyship was just at risk for a miscarriage. She's fine otherwise.

260
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,700
I thank you, Imperial Physician.

261
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
You've worked hard.

262
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,100
General!

263
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
General, I'm going to buy medicine.

264
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,800
Jin'er.

265
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,400
Jin'er, come back to the general's manor with me.

266
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,800
Let me take care of you, all right?

267
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,800
Isn't this the Great General Lord Yongning?

268
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,600
The one who wanted to divorce me?

269
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,300
What a coincidence.

270
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I was wrong, Jin'er.

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,900
Don't be angry. It'll be bad for your body.

272
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,040
Didn't you say you wouldn't ask me to go back a second time?

273
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,790
Jin'er, please come home with me. Jin'er, please come home with me.

274
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,500
I'll say it three times, four times.

275
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll say it a hundred times. All right, my Jin'er?

276
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,000
No.

277
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,300
General, you're going to let go of the person who hurt Lord Jin so easily?

278
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,200
I'm always aware of who's been good to me, and who's done me wrong.

279
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,800
Then... why did you let Princess Zi go?

280
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,100
It's because she's Lord Jin's sister and a woman?

281
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,400
I've already sent out word

282
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,000
that Princess Zi of the Rui Royal Manor can never enter my manor.

283
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,700
But then, no one but a fool will propose marriage to her.

284
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,570
No matter who hurts my Jin'er, I will repay a tooth for a tooth.

285
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,000
Mother... I'm begging you.

286
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,400
I've been lying here for three days already!

287
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,200
The imperial physician only told me to rest for two days. I've listened to him already!

288
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,100
No. Stay right there.

289
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,200
In four days the imperial physician will come to take your pulse.

290
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,100
You can't go anywhere until he says you're fine.

291
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,800
- I'm so bored, I'm so bored! <br> - Don't move around!

292
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,700
Don't be stubborn.

293
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,600
Mother., you can just have the old maids sew children's clothing.

294
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,400
Why are you doing it yourself?

295
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Outsiders aren't as careful and detailed as family members.

296
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Children have soft skin. If the sewing is done badly, it won't be comfortable.

297
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,000
But, Mother, you don't know if I'm having a boy or a girl

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
and you're making the clothes already.

299
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,300
What if it's a boy? Then he can't wear this outfit.

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,200
Then... I'll make two of each.

301
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,500
One for a boy, one for a girl.

302
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,000
Then, Mother, tell me.

303
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,500
Do you want me to have a boy or a girl?

304
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,600
Everyone is probably hoping for a boy.

305
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm asking you! What you hope it is?

306
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
I hope... it's a girl.

307
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,300
Just like my Jin'er.

308
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,800
A girl that is brave, kind, and close to my heart.

309
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,400
I'm not that great.

310
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,300
I always caused trouble for you, Mother.

311
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,400
When you were eight years old, you broke Zi'er's mother's door.

312
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,600
That was because Zi'er's mother

313
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,500
used that same door to pin my arm and injure it.

314
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,900
When you were thirteen, you were brought to the imperial consort's side.

315
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,800
You always saved the delicious foods she gave you for me.

316
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,180
You'd always say you were too full.

317
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,700
But I knew, my Jin'er didn't even take a bite.

318
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,400
Mother!

319
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,600
In the blink of an eye, my Jin'er is already this big.

320
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,200
And... you're going to be a mother soon.

321
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,400
Mother. I really can't go out to play?

322
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,600
You can't.

323
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,500
I... I'll just take a trip to the fabric store.

324
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,000
You can't.

325
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,580
Madam, the imperial consort is inviting you to the main hall.

326
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,000
She says there's something important to discuss.

327
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,300
You stay right there.

328
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,600
Watch her well. Don't let her run around.

329
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
I got it, Madam.

330
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,000
Rou Rou!

331
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You definitely can't!

332
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
My Lord!

333
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,000
Zi'er has been locked up for so many days!

334
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,200
Jin'er and Shu'er are your children.

335
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Are Jing'er and Zi'er not?

336
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,500
Zi'er just said a couple of words and got slapped by Shu'er!

337
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,400
Then she got framed for hurting Jin!

338
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,500
And my pitiful Jing'er!

339
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,400
Her face was injured before she's even gotten married!

340
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,400
I don't even know if there will be a scar!

341
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,600
My Lord! If you're really tired of us, just tell me!

342
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,800
I'll go and commit suicide with my children!

343
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,000
I won't get in another's way!

344
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Little Sister, talk clearly! Don't throw it all together and talk nonsense!

345
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,200
Zi'er was the one who hurt Jing'er.

346
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
If Zi'er hadn't talked nonsense to Jin'er,

347
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,000
would my Shu'er have hit her?

348
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,200
This... This Lord Yongning is so powerful!

349
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,800
Now Jin is his wife.

350
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,400
She's clearly disrespecting us!

351
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,200
Even the Marquis's Heir Apparent and Eldest Princess are siding with her.

352
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
My Zi'er just said a few words!

353
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,200
Are sisters not allowed to have petty arguments?

354
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Petty arguments? Jin almost lost her child!

355
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,700
If Lord Yongning had lost his child, do you think he would spare us?

356
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,200
My Lord! Are you not going to say a single word?

357
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,660
My Lord!

358
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,600
Th-Th-This time...

359
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,800
It should be... Zi'er.

360
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,200
My Lord! You are so cruel!

361
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,200
I know! Jin has always hated me.

362
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Yes, I am a low-class person.

363
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,000
But my children aren't!

364
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,600
They are all children of His Highness!

365
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,700
They are all Jin's family!

366
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,830
Consort Chen, I'm begging you.

367
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,820
I was the one who offended you in the past.

368
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,290
Tell your daughter, the Lady Wife of Lord Yongning,

369
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,320
to take whatever hatred she has and put it all on me!

370
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,590
Don't go and plot against my children!

371
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,730
Sister Xu, have you gone crazy?

372
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,130
In terms of plotting, how did this marriage first fall to Jin'er?

373
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,800
Everyone knows that very well!

374
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,310
What was Jin'er's life like at the border?

375
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,730
Do you not know?

376
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,470
But now, Jin'er is living a good life.

377
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,040
So you're jealous, envious, and making things hard on her!

378
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,130
My daughter's good life was obtained by exchanging her own life!

379
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,270
My Lord! In the past, Jin'er always gave in to Shen Zi and Shen Jing.

380
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,130
You know that!

381
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,320
Now, Jin'er is the Lady Wife of Lord Yongning.

382
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,910
- Has she been disrespectful to anyone in the manor? <br> - No.

383
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,690
My Lord!

384
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,820
I can swear here! If Jin holds even a little disrespect for you,

385
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,000
then I will be struck by lightning and die a terrible death!

386
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,810
Little Sister, what are you saying?

387
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,460
My Lord isn't a fool!

388
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,450
Sit down!

389
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,640
I have been married to My Lord for over twenty years.

390
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,280
I never treated anyone poorly.

391
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,260
As long as it's something my Shu'er has, every child in the manor has it.

392
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,890
This time, Zi'er was clearly the one who hurt Jing'er.

393
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,870
And almost caused my Jin'er to miscarry!

394
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,390
Why have things been completely switched around in your words?

395
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,970
Then when Jin'er almost lost her child, she was asking for it. Right?

396
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,590
Do you really think Lord Yongning is a mere decoration in court?

397
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,340
You! You, you, you, you! Go away!

398
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,720
My Lord!

399
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,570
You get up!

400
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,020
Princess Consort.

401
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,240
See, did I not take good care of this matter?

402
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,940
Where are we going?

403
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,730
Isn't climbing the wall faster? Why are we going out the back door?

404
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,020
What if someone finds out? Then our efforts will be in vain!

405
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,670
Climb the wall! Miss, I still want to live a little longer!

406
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,050
Oh... I forgot about the baby!

407
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,700
Hurry, hurry.

408
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,410
Let's go.

409
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,180
The taste of freedom is so nice!

410
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,130
Then... where will we go next?

411
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,110
Where will we go?

412
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,670
Of course, we're going to eat and play. I'll go wherever I want!

413
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,210
Let's go!

414
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:03,160
<i>[Tea]</i>

415
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:09,010
Let's drink the most fragrant tea, and enjoy the most delicious snacks! Let's go!

416
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,280
Rou Rou, why?

417
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,440
What do you mean?

418
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,440
For the Little General in your stomach, you can only drink plain water.

419
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,800
What place doesn't have plain water? We have run to a teahouse to drink plain water?

420
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,280
We... came to the teahouse

421
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,380
to let me eat and let me drink!

422
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,730
Rou Rou, looks like you don't want to see your Su Su anymore.

423
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,010
I'm not afraid of you, Miss! Su Su is coming!

424
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,100
- Rou Rou! <br> - See!

425
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,100
-<i> Lord Jin! </i> <br> - Isn't he here?

426
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,020
Why are you here? How did you know we were here?

427
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,670
Ever since you and General fought last time,

428
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,790
General told me to keep watch when you go out.

429
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,600
So, of course, I knew you went outside.

430
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,620
You are using your public position for personal gain. You're only here because of Rou Rou.

431
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,860
That's not true. Our Su Su is not the kind of person to abuse his authority.

432
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,670
- You checked– <br> - But I am.

433
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,040
Come, Su Su!

434
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,640
- Does it taste good? <br> - It tastes good!

435
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,590
Are you tired? Come, drink some water.

436
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,680
There's no tea, please make do.

437
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,870
Drink slowly, I'm leaving.

438
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,580
Miss!

439
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,810
Chu Xiuming, you--

440
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,270
What are you doing? We're in public! Aren't you embarrassed?

441
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,630
I'm hugging my own wife. Why should I be embarrassed?

442
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,590
I'm not your wife anymore!

443
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,380
I miss you.

00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:18,210
My Lady, don't make things hard on us. Please go elsewhere.

471
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,290
Tell the boss to sell me a piece.

472
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,530
Jin'er, this will be too cold. It's not good for your body. <i> <br>(T/N: Traditional medicine: Some fruits disrupt a healthy balance)</i>

473
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,370
And you're still saying you didn't come to find me because of the baby?

474
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,210
You only know how to deceive me!

475
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,990
You're not allowed to follow me anymore!

476
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,510
I'll go wherever you go.

477
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,470
You really think I can't deal with you?

478
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,410
Chu Xiuming, I'm going deal with you, for sure!

479
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,020
I don't know about other places, but this is my shop! I'm in charge!

480
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,480
You are forbidden from stepping behind the cash counter! Why can't you observe rules properly?

481
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,850
All right, don't believe that I can't—

482
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,690
If you keep being like this, I'm going to call for someone!

483
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,830
We're in public, there's a lot of... fabric!

484
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,790
It doesn't look good like this!

485
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,160
You're afraid of letting the fabric see this?

486
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,970
This way, it can't see us. Right?

487
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,850
<i>How embarrassing!</i>

488
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,760
Openly displaying affection in public.

489
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,990
Don't you two know what "shame" means?

490
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:28,180
Then, how are you going to teach us?

491
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,550
Today... I've come to speak with you... as an elder.

492
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,740
Today, you should listen carefully to my words.

493
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:43,230
In the future, if anyone dares to hurt my wife even a little, I'll break their arms.

494
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,820
Go back and count how many chances your daughter had.

495
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,050
This is the emperor's world. It's not a place where you can do as you'd like.

496
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,200
Is that so?

497
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,160
My husband has his limits. He wouldn't count wrong.

498
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,840
When he has limits, he breaks my daughter's arms and legs.

499
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,120
Then if he doesn't, what will happen?

500
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:10,730
Shen Jin, you are from a royal manor. Don't forget your origins!

501
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:14,050
If I hear you say another bad word about my wife

502
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:18,290
or make my wife angry, the same result will happen.

503
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,640
Husband, I'm thirsty. I want to drink water.

504
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,290
All right. Let's go get you some water.

505
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,550
Husband, should we lock the door?

506
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,610
What if we lose something?

507
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,940
I think we should do that, too.

508
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,790
Don't touch me!

509
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,720
You throw me away right after using me!

510
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,140
Who was using you? You did that voluntarily!

511
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,540
All right, all right. For my wife, I am willing to do anything.

512
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,690
Didn't you say you were thirsty? I'll get some water for you.

513
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,710
I'm not thirsty. No need.

514
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,310
You can go.

515
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,090
I've thought about it. We haven't eaten skewers in a long time.

516
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,970
Why don't you come back to the general's manor and I'll grill some for you.

517
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,000
It's broad daylight. Why would I be eating skewers?

518
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,600
Moreover, my shop is so busy. Do I have time to eat skewers?

519
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,970
You just want to trick me into going back to your manor.

520
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,730
Don't think I'm falling for it.

521
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,830
I told you that I could step on you! I finally stepped on you today!

522
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,320
My foot is broken. I can't walk anymore.

523
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,920
I can only stay here.

524
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,910
Wife, it really hurts.

525
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,720
Chu Xiuming, your acting is so awful. Just go back and eat your skewers.

526
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,450
Wife.

527
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,660
<i> - Take a rest. <br> - Be careful.</i>

528
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,190
They're back. Here they are.

529
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,770
Didn't I teach you some characters yesterday?

530
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,330
- Yes. <br> - Write one.

531
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,630
<i>Lend a hand.</i>

532
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,520
<i>Come on.</i>

533
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,180
<i>You've worked hard.</i>

534
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,760
<i>Come on. Be careful.</i>

535
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,560
Ruonan, you're here.

536
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,830
The items have arrived. Take the items to the warehouse.

537
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,860
Yes.

538
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,950
- Hurry and go. <br> - Come on.

539
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,210
- Wrap them up. <br> - Let's go help.

540
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,360
Sister Ruonan!

541
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,400
- Sister Ruonan! <br> - Come here.

542
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,810
- Hurry and come. <br> <i> - How have you all been doing lately?</i>

543
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,790
Sister Ruonan, why haven't you come to visit us recently?

544
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:37,820
I went on a trip to escort some goods. Aren't I here to see you now?

545
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,040
<i>Sister Ruonan, how is your business going?</i>

546
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,390
<i>My business is very good.</i>

547
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,060
<i>How about you all? How are you doing?</i>

548
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,150
Are you being obedient?

549
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,920
Of course, we're obedient.

550
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,060
But Huzi is always being naughty. He isn't learning how to read properly.

551
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,150
Not so! Teacher said I've been doing a lot better.

552
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:56,590
I also had a huge leap forward recently.

553
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,790
Sister Ruonan, what are you looking for?

554
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,730
- Are you looking for Teacher? <br> - Teacher will still come back tomorrow.

555
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,440
Teacher comes to teach us characters and reading every day.

556
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,040
All right then. Let's get back to reading and writing.

557
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,460
Let's go. Go ahead.

558
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,810
Good, let me see what Teacher has taught you all.

559
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,130
- What did you write? <br> - I wrote a three...

560
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,190
- You're so good. <br> - People...

561
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,150
I made five.

562
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,590
I wrote 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

563
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,680
<i>11, 12...</i>

564
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,460
<i>You should write it this way instead.</i>

565
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,860
I'll teach you how to recite today.

566
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,050
"When will spring flowers and the autumn moon come to an end?"

567
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,700
"When will spring flowers and the autumn moon come to an end?"

568
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,850
"How many past events were known then?"

569
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,890
"How many past events were known then?"

570
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,190
<i>"The small attic was swept by the east wind last night again."</i>

571
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,960
<i>"The small attic was swept by the east wind last night again."</i>

572
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,010
<i>[Rui Royal Manor]</i>

573
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,740
So you remembered to come back?

574
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,170
Mother, I was wrong.

575
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,840
I know my position is low and my words don't mean much.

576
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,730
It's fine if Lord Yongning's wife doesn't listen.

577
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,180
Mother, I was really wrong.

578
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,660
Spare me this time. I definitely won't go outside anymore.

579
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,630
Mother...

580
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,710
Really?

581
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:28,370
Really, Mother, trust me. This really was the last time.

582
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,460
I saved dinner for you. I'll go get it.

583
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,220
Mother, is Rou Rou back?

584
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,680
Her? Would she dare to come back?

585
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,400
Stay here.

586
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,680
Rou Rou... It's every woman for herself now.

587
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,730
How come you're so fast—

588
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,640
Who let you in?

589
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,500
I came to visit my own wife. Do I need anyone's approval?

590
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,550
Of course!

591
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:39,970
Well then, Wife, tell me who I should report to. I'll go immediately.

592
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,810
Me.

593
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,740
- What are you doing? <br> - Reporting.

594
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,390
Don't act recklessly. My mother is about to come back.

595
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,170
I'm going to act very recklessly today.

596
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,800
What can you do?

597
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,040
Y-You...

598
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,250
Let me see what you have in there first.

599
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,780
I've brought you some roasted meat and treats preserved in honey. Eat it quickly.

600
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,660
You really brought honey preserved treats? Not bad.

601
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Rou Rou, is it fine if you're gone like this?

602
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,810
Of course, it's fine. The general is there.

603
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,830
Am I supposed to stand there and watch them being lovey-dovey?

604
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:26,240
- That must be hard for our Rou Rou. <br> - That's right.

605
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:32,170
Su Su, I have a question for you,

606
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:38,480
but I also think... I shouldn't... be asking you this.

607
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,090
Rou Rou, you may speak without reserve when you're with me.

608
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,570
But if you took the initiative to ask,

609
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,370
that may be better.

610
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,440
Me? But I have no idea.

611
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,850
Why don't you tell me?

612
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,810
Think about it.

613
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,850
I... Let me think about it.

614
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,710
I don't know.

615
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,510
Think about it thoroughly.

616
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,250
I... I really don't know.

617
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:14,290
Think about it thoroughly. Think about it again.

<i>- Give me a hint. <br> - Think.</i>
