<i>[Episode 3]</i>

18
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,710
Not going from the main gate? Where is this going?

19
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,890
That means...he won't be back for now?

20
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,020
<i>Where did he hide my jade pendant?</i>

21
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,880
<i>Maybe it's not here?</i>

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,460
General!

23
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,360
Lady.

24
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,770
-You-
-Do you know where General went?

25
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,730
General just left. Do you need something?

26
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,710
Falcon Tribe soldiers have attacked the city gates.

27
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,970
A Falcon Tribe ambush? How is the situation now?

28
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,780
Bao Zitou is fighting back now. I suspect that other tribe members have entered the city.

29
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,190
Whether to protect the city or drive out the Falcon Tribe...if General isn't here, there is no one to decide.

30
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,500
Can't you make the decision?

31
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,030
If General isn't here, that is his dereliction of duty.

32
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,210
If the royal court hears of this, he'll be punished!

33
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,050
You all take care of protecting the city. Leave the ones that snuck in to me.

34
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,180
Let's drag out time together and wait for General to return.

35
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,980
All our problems will be solved!

36
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,800
Lady, you are a noble.

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,300
If you are injured, what will I say to General?

38
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,720
If something happens to General, we'll all die!

39
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,950
Stop nagging, do as I say!

40
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,500
Hurry and go!

41
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,260
Yes!

42
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,290
<i>It looks like she really isn't a spy.</i>

43
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,880
<i>She was sent by the person secretly helping me.</i>

44
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,640
Search!

45
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,230
<i>They really fell for my trap!</i>

46
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,760
Our people clearly saw Chu Xiuming leave the city. Why is he at home?

47
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,750
I'm afraid it's a trap!

48
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,960
Go and take a look!

49
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,730
No matter if it's him or not, we must fight to the death today!

50
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,470
Killing Chu Xiuming will earn us great merit! Attack!

51
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,920
<i>This sword is too heavy, I can't lift it!</i>

52
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,020
<i>My dagger is much more convenient!</i>

53
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,100
He dares to insult us?

54
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,270
Whoever kills Chu Xiuming will earn great merit! Attack!

55
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,220
Put down your weapons! Perhaps I can spare your life!

56
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,650
This person isn't Chu Xiuming!

57
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,250
<i>Oh no! I shouldn't have said anything!</i>

58
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,520
Attack and kill her!

Put your leg down!

75
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,320
It was my first time to see a woman so brave!

-Well said!

Lady, you were so handsome today!

79
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,140
If you were a man, that would be nice. I'd marry you!

80
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,570
I like you too!

81
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,070
I would also like to marry you!

00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,310
I'll marry you all!

00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,470
Wait your turn, there's still General!

84
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,830
That's right! There's still General!

85
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,580
Let me tell you.

86
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,310
I could successfully protect the manor today because of all of your help!

87
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,010
It's not just my merit!

88
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,980
Pour me a cup!

89
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,960
Come! Thank you Lady, thank you Lady.

90
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,530
Thank you Lady, thank you Lady.

91
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,990
You are too kind!

92
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,700
I will thank you all here!

93
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,240
We are willing to follow Lady!

94
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,660
-Follow Lady!
-Follow Lady!

95
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,870
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

96
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,470
Sit, sit! Everyone sit!

97
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,630
Let me tell you! Using the General's sword to counter that Falcon tribe was way too easy!

98
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,400
That's why I pulled out my dagger!

99
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,780
I never imagined they'd even fear a dagger! Don't you think they're cowards?

100
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,150
Let me tell you. I was so scared!

101
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,440
<i>- You didn't see how dangerous it was!
- It really was like this!</i>

102
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,080
<i>Fortunately our Lady turned danger in to safety.</i>

103
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,440
Xiuyan.

104
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,360
Thank you for guarding the city and fighting back the Falcon Tribe today.

105
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,980
Thank you.

106
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,550
General, that is my duty.

107
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,860
That's right. I must also thank you for hiding that I wasn't in the city.

108
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,160
I avoided punishment from the court.

109
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,550
That's not my merit.

110
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,000
We were in a crisis then. Lady proposed that I protect the city and she'd protect the manor.

111
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,580
She came up with this idea so you wouldn't have failed your duties.

112
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,730
I didn't know about the idea of wearing your armor either.

113
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,680
You're all my soldiers!

114
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,580
General, let's join them?

115
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,030
Really? Is it that simple?

116
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm going back to my room to rest.

117
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,580
Come on. Miss

118
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,160
- Let me fill your cup. 
 - Okay, fill it up.

119
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,360
- Come on, fill it up. 
 - Cheers! Cheers!

120
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,260
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

121
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,130
Lieutenant General! You earned a lot of merit today too.

122
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,740
Why don't you drink with us?

123
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,620
Guarding the manor was all Lady's merit.

124
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,340
You should celebrate with her.

125
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,710
You earned merit too!

126
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,740
Then, I will thank you for protecting the city on behalf of the people.

127
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,250
Guarding the manor is not my merit alone.

128
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,160
Hurry and celebrate with them. I have to go back to the barracks.

129
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,700
Wait! This is the dessert that I personally made.

130
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,330
If you eat it, all your wishes will definitely come true!

131
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,420
Thank you.

132
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,470
Little Miss Xiao Cong made this?

133
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,170
-I must have a good taste!
-I made it for Lieutenant General!

134
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,530
I'm going back to the barracks.

135
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,810
- Lieutenant General!  
 - How delicious!

136
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,350
Lieutenant General!

137
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,300
Little Miss Xiao Cong.

138
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,440
Little Miss Xiao Cong!

139
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,540
Do you like the hairpin I had someone give you a few days ago?

140
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,240
I don't like it! Don't give me anything else in the future.

141
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,170
She doesn't like it?

142
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,410
I must have been tricked by that black hearted merchant!

143
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,580
<i>Where's the General? General!</i>

144
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,190
General.

145
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,300
It's so late already.

146
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,190
Is there something you need from me, My Lady?

147
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,960
You're going through such a difficult time.

148
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,980
Everyday, you have to put on such heavy armour.

149
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,600
You have to carry such a heavy sword.

150
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,570
You have to put on that heavy mask and then you still go out and fight your battles with such confidence and ease.

151
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,820
You've got such a heavy burden to bear!

152
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,070
No one would believe you even if you told the truth.

153
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,550
I'm the only who understands as I've experienced it firsthand.

154
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,320
Your armour is so heavy!

155
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,910
Your mask is so heavy and your sword is so heavy...

156
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:23,860
I truly admire you from the bottom of my heart. You have my deepest sympathies...

157
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,400
My Lady...

158
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,730
Are you listening?

159
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,070
If you need my help, tell me.

160
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,790
It is my duty for the sake of your armor.

161
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,140
I'm <i>blushing with shame</i>

162
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
at the fact that My Lady understands me so well.

163
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,060
You deserve to be praised, you deserve to be praised.

164
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,750
The meritorious service I, Shen Jin have rendered must be recognised.

165
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,010
This time when I was guarding the town...

166
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,870
the experience I've had guarding the manor.

167
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,850
I've rendered such a great service to you, you should give me a reward!

168
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,230
You have to agree even if you don't want to!

169
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,100
My Lady, this time you've kept the manor safe on my behalf

170
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,930
and took such a great risk. It must not have been an easy feat for you.

171
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,130
All right. I shall record the service you rendered with reluctance.

172
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,650
What do you mean "with reluctance"?

173
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,300
You should bear in mind that I rendered a <i>great</i> service.

174
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,720
All right, all right. I'll remember that you rendered a great service.

175
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,770
Then you... You should reward me for my service.

176
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,800
Haven't I already granted you your freedom?

177
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,850
What other reward do you seek?

178
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,220
Your bed is so soft!

179
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,240
Even your quilt feels much better than mine.

180
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,400
My room is too small.

181
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,450
Your room is so much nicer.

182
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,820
I don't care anymore. I want to stay in your room.

183
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,710
I don't care even if you disagree to it.

184
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,580
I'm so pitiful! I am!

185
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:54,080
I've been living in that haunted house for so many days...

186
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,120
All right. I agree to your demands.

187
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,050
Seeing as you've become so drunk, you may sleep here tonight.

188
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,800
<i>Your Majesty, news has arrived from the border.</i>

189
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,750
The Falcon Tribe planned a surprise attack today.

190
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,170
General Chu managed to repel them successfully. However...

191
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,790
What are you trying to say, Lord Liu?

192
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,170
I heard that General Chu was not in the city today

193
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,720
and his wife was the one who kept watch and subdued the Falcon Tribe.

194
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,740
Your Majesty, it is the General's responsibility to protect the city.

195
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,410
How was a mere woman able to keep watch over the manor?

196
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,910
And besides, the border is thousands of miles away.

197
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,850
Not one piece of news reached my ears throughout the entire day,

198
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,600
so how did you come to know of this, Lord Liu?

199
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,870
<i>This humble official</i> merely heard it through the grapevine.

200
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,550
General Chu is one of Your Majesty's favourite subjects,

201
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,380
and the General's wife is the young mistress of the Rui Royal Manor.

202
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,340
Even if his actions are inappropriate,

203
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,390
the ministers wouldn't be able to speak out against them.

204
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,400
<i>This humble official</i> has been so bold as to request an audience with Your Majesty.

205
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,730
Lord Liu, you're overanalysing things.

206
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,770
If Yongning Bo were to make a mistake, 
 <i>(Yongning Bo (永宁伯) - Count of Everlasting Peace)</i>

207
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,090
I have my own methods of punishing him.

208
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:15,220
Your Majesty, General Chu is the best candidate when it comes to defending the border.

209
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,700
He's the one in the Imperial Court who wields military authority.

210
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,880
And he's the only other person besides Your Majesty who is capable of dispatching the troops.

211
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,170
<i>This humble official</i> is afraid he will become power-hungry.

212
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,760
<i>He's right, Your Majesty.</i>

213
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,580
If the General's wife is being exploited by the General,

214
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,990
the aftermath will be too horrible to contemplate.

215
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,880
So what do you suggest?

216
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,230
Your Majesty, why don't we send someone to investigate this matter thoroughly?

217
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,590
<i>This humble official</i> will arrange everything.

218
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,260
It isn't appropriate to send someone to investigate them.

219
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,240
I have not seen <i>Yongning Bo</i> for quite some time already.

220
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,210
Send the Court Painter over.

221
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,880
Let the Court Painter observe how our prosperous General

222
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,620
and his wife are living.

223
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,490
Your Majesty, <i>a general planning in the seclusion of his tent</i>

224
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,670
<i>is able to determine the outcome of the distant battle.</i>

225
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,040
- Miss? 
 - My Lady? 
 - My Lady?

226
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,300
- My Lady? 
 - My Lady?

227
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,910
Miss?

228
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,950
My Lady, why are you sleeping on the floor?

229
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,930
It's all right, it's all right. Our Young Miss has never been one to sleep properly.

230
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,040
What are all of you doing?

231
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,190
The General has ordered us to move your luggage and your belongings into this room.

232
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,170
My Lady will be staying here from now on.

233
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,750
He... Did he really say that?

234
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,190
That's correct.

235
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,890
I'm very sure of it.

236
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,970
This is much more comfortable than the other room.

237
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,680
The General's bed is fine and soft.

238
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,880
This is totally a fairyland.

239
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,530
Let's move on to another subject.

240
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,920
Before you married into this household,

241
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,110
the manor was so quiet.

242
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,980
Life had lost all its attractions.

243
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,020
But now that My Lady has arrived,

244
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,680
the manor is full of cheerful talk and laughter. It feels more like a home now.

245
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,530
- Don't say that. 
 - That's not true.

246
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,920
Our Young Miss always attracts people's favour no matter where she goes. She is loved by all.

247
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,410
My Lady is the new mistress of the General's manor,

248
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,020
so everything in the manor should be managed by My Lady.

249
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,470
That sounds good to me.

250
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,200
My Lady, only one matter has not been carried out yet.

251
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,980
My Lady and the General should quickly pick a date so you can consummate your marriage.

252
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,660
Consummate our marriage?

253
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,780
<i>This subordinate</i> has already sent my report to the Imperial Court regarding the surprise attack by the Falcon Tribe.

254
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,780
Thank you for your trouble, Deputy General.

255
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,210
General, an announcement has just arrived from the Imperial Court.

256
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,100
They've sent a Court Painter to your manor

257
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,490
to record your blissful marriage with your Lady.

258
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,630
This cannot be stopped.

259
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,890
Don't worry, My Lady.

260
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,750
We'll be here to take care of things. Isn't that right, Rou Rou?

261
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,140
Stop moving about and just rest here already.

262
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,470
Leave everything to us.

263
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,560
My Lady, please have some of this.

264
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,430
Thank you.

265
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,050
It's delicious! What is it?

266
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,510
Why have I never had this before?

267
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,330
This was specially boiled for you, My Lady.

268
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,130
This "Noble Lady's Soup" is made of red dates, peanuts and lotus seeds.

269
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,270
It is to symbolise that My Lady will <i>give birth to a son soon. 
 (Usually a propitiatory compliment said to newlyweds.)</i>

270
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,190
That's not it...

271
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,200
Since the General has told My Lady to move into this room,

272
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,570
that just proves the General has set his heart on My Lady.

273
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,750
I'm afraid that your consummation will take place tonight.

274
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,140
We've never...

275
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,730
Well, you'll have your chance tonight.

276
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,920
You're the first Lady to ever stay in this room.

277
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,640
Enjoy your soup.

278
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,630
The first Lady?

279
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,620
- General. 
 - General.

280
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,810
Look, look! Speak of the devil and he doth appear!

281
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,170
<i>No one is to disturb them tonight.</i>

282
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,600
Let's go.

283
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,710
My Lady, you are mistaken.

284
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,040
I didn't agree for you to move in to share the bed with you.

285
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,100
What do you mean?

286
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,680
We are spouses only in name, but no spouses duty.

287
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,910
Then that's just how I was thinking!

288
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,580
This acting is all for them, it has nothing to do with me!

289
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,870
Then it's good.

290
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:03,480
Then, as you said, between the two of, we are only married in name.

291
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,340
General, please look for somewhere else to sleep.

292
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,860
Impossible!

293
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,040
Why not?

294
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,360
Is it that you have improper thoughts about me?

295
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,560
Then I won't agree.

296
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,320
First, moving in this room,

297
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,280
was my Lady's request last night when you forcefully claimed it.

298
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,880
I claimed it?

299
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:29,570
<i>This bed is so soft.</i>

300
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,040
<i>I don't care! I want to stay in this room!</i>

301
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,450
<i>I don't care if you agree or not.</i>

302
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,790
It seems there's really something like that.

303
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,970
But it doesn't mean that General, you can share the room with me.

304
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,950
I am not done speaking.

305
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:49,630
Second, even though we don't have the duty of spouses, we are spouses in name.

306
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,350
What would people think if I moved out?

307
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,910
If this is reported to the capital, we would both receive death penalty.

308
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,480
What you're saying makes a lot of sense.

309
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,510
Then, what should we do next?

310
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,530
We still can't sit face to face everyday until the sun rises.

311
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,700
It's really simple. From now on, we will share this room.

312
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,050
I'll sleep on the bed, you'll sleep on the long chair. We won't bother each other.

313
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,010
Why isn't it I sleep on the bed, you sleep on the long chair. We won't bother each other?

314
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,450
My Lady, I have slept on this bed for many years.

315
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,110
How could I let someone else sleep on it?

316
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,550
Good. I'm going to change.

317
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,500
Sort this mess right away! Otherwise I'll throw them away!

318
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,190
What is wrong? It's always like this when looking for clothes.

319
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,870
Moreover, these are life necessities, I can't miss any of them.

320
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,430
You don't want to clean it up, neither throw is away?

321
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,280
Okay, I'll help you.

322
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,120
Give it back to me!

323
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,770
I'm sorry.

324
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,020
Don't ask next time.

325
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,760
My Lady, it would be best if you put those away.

326
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,870
It's more convenient for everyone to come in and out.

327
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,870
You're talking about convenience. I need to discuss with you.

328
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,680
Since you said you want to sleep on the bed,

329
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,430
then all the remaining space belongs to me.

330
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,690
- You can't go behind that line.
- Then I—

331
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,250
Don't worry about the main door, we can both use it.

332
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,300
Alright, alright. As my Lady says.

333
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,430
Then, great General, you must keep your word!

334
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,350
<i>What kind of husband is that, letting me, a young girl, sleep on the long chair.</i>

335
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,910
<i>He's really not Devil General only in name.</i>

336
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,070
<i>Qing Qiu also said that I'm the first wife to enter this room.</i>

337
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,430
<i>Was he even worst to his previous wives?</i>

338
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,910
Good morning miss!

339
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,830
- My Lady, good morning!
- My Lady good morning!

340
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,910
- My Lady! 
 - Good morning.

341
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,670
This is the Birth a Boy Soon soup. 
<i>[Dattes, peanuts, longan and lotus seeds is pronounced as birth a precious son</i>

342
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,930
Aunt Qing Qiu, please arrange for someone to get rid of this.

343
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,970
My Lady, do you not like it?

344
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,170
First take it down.

345
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:24,160
Right, Aunt Qing Qiu, I heard the General's previous three wives all died.

346
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,610
What happened?

347
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,490
This is all nonsense and rumours.

348
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,390
The General never even saw those women.

349
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,170
Really?

350
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,930
General has been in the library since morning, my Lady.

351
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,490
I will help you to freshen up and have this Birth a Son Soon soup.

352
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,450
- Then we'll serve some tea to the General. 
- Okay.

353
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,970
Miss, later bring the tea in yourself.

354
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,270
The General will be happier to see you bringing the tea yourself.

355
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,810
I already asked Xiao Cong.

356
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:02,240
You are the first wife of the General.

357
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,230
Are you sure?

358
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,770
I knew you would ask this.

359
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,980
I already asked everyone, it's absolutely true.

360
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,760
Go rest first, I'll serve the tea.

361
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,500
General.

362
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,010
This is tea specially brewed for you. It's cool and refreshing.

363
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,330
Put it down.

364
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,030
My Lady, is there anything else?

365
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,780
Nothing, nothing, please keep on reading.

366
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,630
General, the imperial court sent a painter.

367
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,530
General Yong Ningbo.

368
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,130
I have been ordered by the emperor,

369
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,470
to come and draw the portrait of General and his wife.

370
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,000
The emperor is magnanimous. Thank you for your trouble.

371
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,060
This is my wife.

372
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,790
<i>Greeting, my Lady.</i>

373
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,020
Please get some rest. I will arrange for the painting in a while.

374
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,220
Yes.

375
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,020
Painter, this way.

376
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,860
Miss, don't complain.

377
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,730
The General let you get in the general's room is already great.

378
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,790
What are you still complaining about?

379
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,230
I'm not complaining!

380
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,720
- This demon king suddenly changed his expression.
- Let me see.

381
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,480
Looking at that painter saying: "This is my wife."

382
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,400
He has no idea how to have soft spot for the weaker sex.

383
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,720
One bed...

384
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,330
What?

385
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,940
Nothing.

386
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,960
Rou Rou, go and help me get something.

387
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,460
What?

388
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,080
- Why do you want this?
- Just go!

389
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,870
Who told you to be arrogant and despotic in bullying others.

390
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,030
I'll teach you a lesson!

391
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,200
Great Demon King.

392
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,790
Please, General et my Lady  pur order to your clothes.

393
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,160
Did you catch a cold?

394
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,050
General, please don't move.

395
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,080
Our General is very busy, he caught a cold.

396
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,240
Look, your nose is even runny.

397
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,620
It's nothing.

398
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,700
It seems that General's constitution makes him catch easily a cold.

399
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,340
You must have grown up pampered and spoiled, and lived like a prince.

400
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,480
You've lost your mascunility.

401
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:22,730
Then, according to my Lady, what should I do?

402
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,430
General is man that needs to protect our homes and defend our country.

403
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,800
It's only natural to endure this life's hardships and only then can you temper yourself to a firm determination.

404
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,940
Then, does My Lady have a good plan?

405
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,740
You can start learning from daily life.

406
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,400
Look, this big soft bed of yours is way too extravagant!

407
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,690
How about...

408
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,050
Come!

409
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,460
Look, this long chair is really good.

410
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,300
It's hard and narrow, it would help!

411
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,990
When meditating, it harden one's emotions.

412
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,020
No need to. The General I am already has a well spread bad reputation.

413
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,580
Just let me sink deeper in the decadent life.

414
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,010
He really doesn't know to give in.

415
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,550
Who authorized you to cross the line? Get out!

416
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,570
Okay.

417
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,660
General.

418
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,940
Rourou, this way! Don't cross the line!

419
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,200
Is General not going to eat?

420
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,580
He can't eat it!

421
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:02,920
It's so fragrant! It's too fragrant!

422
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,060
Hey! Do you want a bite?

423
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,470
What's with that expression? You're looking down on me?

424
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:16,390
Let me tell you! You can insult me, but not my sweet potatoes!

425
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,750
I might have given you a bite! You're insulting the heaven's creation!

426
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,720
The hour has come. It's time to eat dinner.

427
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,550
I'm full.

428
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,620
We are holding a feast for the court painter.

429
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,540
As the female owner of the general's mansion, you must go.

430
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,300
What! Why didn't you tell me about the feast?

431
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,570
I ate the entire sweet potato!

432
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,790
Didn't you say I couldn't insult your sweet potatoes? I just acted out of respect.

433
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,220
I cannot step into your territory.

434
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,560
I... I...

435
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,170
I can probably still eat.

436
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,010
Since you like to act so much,

437
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,450
in a bit, don't forget to play the part of the general's wife.

438
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,270
<i>You didn't tell me there was tasty food earlier, prevented me from exhibiting myself.</i>

439
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:57,270
<i>Now he wants to give me a mission? How cruel!</i>

440
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:04,140
Yes, General. I will definitely play the part of the general's wife well.

441
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,260
General, the painter has arrived.

442
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,900
General.

443
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,580
Please sit.

444
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,230
You have suffered on your long travel here.

445
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,600
I will drink a cup to you.

446
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,310
Thank you, General.

447
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,190
Wait, General.

448
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,760
You caught a cold today.

449
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,690
He had terrible symptoms on the day the painting was made!

450
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,420
The doctor ordered him to eat light foods.

451
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,160
These dishes are good, but General cannot eat them!

452
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,550
I personally made this congee for General.

453
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,300
I put a lot of medicinal herbs inside.

454
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,400
It is perfect for you. Please eat, General.

455
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,100
<i>Not letting me eating good stuff?</i>

456
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,030
<i>Let me make this Devil General experience the taste of being anxious and helpless.</i>

457
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,990
My wife is virtuous and demure. I am alright now.

458
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:33,210
We are holding a feast for the royal painter today. How could I not eat?

459
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,820
I will eat this congee for a midnight snack.

460
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,920
Your body has to do with the entire city's people!

461
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,200
We must not be rash. It is better to be careful.

462
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,580
Royal Painter, don't you think so?

463
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,950
Lady, you are correct.

464
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,640
General, please keep the big picture in mind and stay healthy.

465
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:02,070
General. Even the royal painter is saying that.

466
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,080
Drink some congee, General.

467
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,010
You want me to feed you?

468
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,060
You-!

469
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,350
You want some more?

470
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,580
General. How is my cooking?

471
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,190
Very good, very good.

472
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,710
I am too happy!

473
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:19,360
General and Lady are a good match, and very much in love.

474
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,560
I will drink a cup to you both.

475
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,010
Please. Come.

476
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,240
I am indeed feeling unwell today.

477
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,810
I cannot eat any of these delicious dishes today.

478
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,860
I am not a wasteful person.

479
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,680
My wife worked hard to make congee for me.

480
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:57,210
Then Wife, please eat all of these dishes for me.

481
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,510
You must not waste any of it.

482
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,920
Qing Qiu!

483
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,910
-General.
-We are holding a feast for the royal painter today.

484
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,970
My wife is also so kind to me. Order the kitchen to make more dishes.

485
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,730
-You want to add even more?
-Yes!

486
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,700
Add more dishes. Chicken, duck, fish, bring them all. Oh right,

487
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:30,530
Oh right, and two plates of Lady's favorite sweet potatoes.

488
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,320
Yes.

489
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:48,350
Lady. Please enjoy.

490
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:24,210
Hurry and eat. There's more to come.

491

<i>[Easter Egg]</i>

492
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,450
Miss!

493
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,520
Miss! It's dangerous! Hurry and come down!

494
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,620
The Falcon Tribe soldiers are about to break through the city gates!

495
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,240
Lady, lady, there are Falcon Tribe soldiers outside!

496
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,620
- They're about to reach the entrance! 
 - What should we do?

497
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,650
Don't panic. Listen to me. General will be back soon.

498
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,300
But before he returns, we must drag out time!

499
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,010
Listen to me!

500
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,520
No, that's too dangerous!

501
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,170
Get down here!

502
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,440
Lady, that is too dangerous!

503
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,390
Listen to me! We share the same hatred for the same enemy. We can defeat him!
