00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,260
Your Majesty, Xiao Su has returned.

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,020
Summon him!

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,800
You may all leave.

22
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,740
Summon Xiao Su!

23
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,700
How did it go?

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,310
I observed General Chu for many days.

26
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,760
I discovered he is loyal to the country and has no intention of rebelling.

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,170
This couple is also deeply in love.

28
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,730
But I did find a spy in the military camp.

29
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,120
He told me that in the past,

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,100
many spies have appeared beside General Chu.

31
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,490
Spies?

32
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,650
What clues do you have?

33
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,960
That spy wouldn't reveal who sent him.

34
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,130
Since he won't admit it, just kill him.

35
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,910
Secretly investigate who's behind it.

36
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,050
I want to see who in this court is involved in this.

37
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

38
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,100
General Chu has guarded an important border for me for years. He's made great contributions.

39
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,240
Stay by his side this time and protect him properly.

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,220
Your Majesty, someone would've definitely discovered my actions this time.

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,850
I'm afraid I cannot be too obvious.

42
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,890
I will hide your identity for you.

43
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,500
General, there's a message for you.

45
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,950
<i>[Success]</i>

46
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,440
Speak. Who sent you here?

47
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,920
Speak!

48
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,790
Good! Good!

49
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,620
Your Majesty, the Falcon Tribe has attacked our borders for years. Today, they finally want to agree to a truce!

50
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,960
This is such a happy thing!

51
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,690
Your Majesty, the Falcon Tribe suddenly wanting to agree to a truce,

52
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,360
could this be a trap?

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,440
Then, what thoughts do you have?

54
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,120
Your Majesty, General Yongning has fought with the Falcon Tribe for years.

55
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,860
I never heard him mention any intention of theirs to come to a truce.

56
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,350
But mere days after the new military inspector assumes her place,

57
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,000
the Falcon Tribe surrenders!

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,850
This sounds very strange.

59
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,250
I think we should investigate this clearly.

60
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,670
Then we will do as you say.

61
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

62
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,200
General, focus on your reading.

63
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,020
General! There's news from a spy!

64
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,660
What is it?

65
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,410
General, if you have official matters to deal with, I'll take my leave.

66
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,970
Go on.

67
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,850
<i>Xiao Su has been executed by the Emperor.</i>

68
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,560
<i>[Everything is going according to plan. Don't worry.]</i>

69
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,490
So that's what happened!

70
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,030
Then that corpse...

71
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,150
- That corpse should be dealt with. 
 - I understand.

72
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,470
<i>I will pick up Xiao Su tonight.</i>

73
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,060
Then I'll go with you!

74
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,490
There's no need. I will go alone.

75
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,880
<i>Chu Xiuming didn't want to say that Xiao Su was executed to my face.</i>

76
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,160
<i>Was he afraid I'd be sad?</i>

77
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,000
<i>I can't let him worry about me either.</i>

78
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,150
Let me tell you!

79
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,030
He was so shy!

80
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,710
That day, I saw him completely naked!

81
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,930
- He was naked? 
 - How embarrassing!

82
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,520
You didn't see it! He has a great figure!

83
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,970
Why are you laughing?

84
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,720
- Do you think I got younger by a few years? 
 - You got a lot younger!

85
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,160
Auntie Qing Qiu!

86
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,210
Looks like when you were young, you were a big beauty too!

87
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,130
- Of course! 
 - Tell me more!

88
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,320
When I was young, I was very pretty!

89
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,050
<i>Xiao Su's death...</i>

90
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,020
<i>should I tell Rou Rou or not?</i>

91
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,560
Miss!

92
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,100
My Lady!

93
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,410
Miss,  what's wrong?

94
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,650
You don't look so good. Did you fight with the general again?

95
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,970
- Yes, My Lady. 
 - Yes.

96
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,730
You were fine just now.

97
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,210
It's fine. I was doing some sewing

98
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,530
and accidentally messed up my embroidery.

99
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,940
That's not a big deal!

100
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,160
Leave it to me, I'll help you.

101
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,350
That won't do! Our Miss is making that for the general!

102
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,660
How could others do it for her?

103
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,760
That's right!

104
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,930
Rou Rou, what will you sew for your Su Su?

105
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,860
I...

106
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,000
I haven't decided yet!

107
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,200
I will go back first.

108
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,770
Miss!

109
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,610
What's wrong with Her Ladyship?

110
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,490
It's fine!

111
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,230
This is between her and the general. There's nothing we can do anyway.

112
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,260
What were we talking about just now?

113
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,990
<i>[Yongning Manor]</i>

114
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,890
Lieutenant General!

115
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,010
Lieutenant General, I have not seen you for a long time. Have you been well?

116
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,270
Thank you for your care. I am fine in the military camp.

117
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,770
It is getting cold. I'm sure it's even colder in the military camp.

118
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,290
I... made this robe just for you.

119
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,350
You made it just for me?

120
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,760
Miss Xiao Cong, I didn't ask you to make anything.

121
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,830
My Lady made one for the general!

122
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,000
- So I... 
 - Thank My Lady for me.

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,380
Please tell her there was no need to trouble herself for me.

124
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,690
That's not it! It was me...

125
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,560
<i>My Lieutenant General, this is the first time you are really looking at me.</i>

126
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,050
<i>My heart... is about to stop!</i>

127
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,740
Miss Xiao Cong?

128
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,180
Miss Xiao Cong?

129
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,470
Lieutenant General, why don't you give it a try?

130
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,770
I've sewn three layers into it.

131
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,170
I also added cotton to keep you warm.

132
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,660
I took my time and sewed every stitch.

133
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,090
I hope that you, in that cold military camp,

134
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,800
will still feel warm.

135
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,380
This robe... is a little big.

136
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,710
Miss Xiao Cong!

137
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,760
Bao Zitou, you give this a try.

138
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,250
My Lady had one made for everyone. It doesn't fit me well.

139
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,740
This is what I—

140
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,070
Miss Xiao Cong sewed this herself! You must treasure it.

141
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,040
Miss Xiao Cong personally made this?

142
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,200
Then I must wear it every day!

143
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,450
Miss Xiao Cong, I'll give you a big gift one day!

144
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:04,530
There's no need. Lady gave this to everyone. Everyone gets one.

145
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,080
I just added a couple of stitches.

146
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,710
I never imagined in my lifetime,

147
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,150
I'd be able to wear clothes made personally by Miss Xiao Cong!

148
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,330
Even if I die on the battlefield,

149
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,150
I will have no regrets!

150
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,550
- Let's go. 
 - Sure!

151
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,040
Miss Xiao Cong! I'll take my leave!

152
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,580
I spent over ten days making that robe...

153
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,980
Miss, why aren't you eating?

154
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,310
I don't have an appetite.

155
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,730
Are you still sad over your embroidery?

156
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,030
No.

157
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,930
Rou Rou, you sit down and eat too.

158
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,050
Sure!

159
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,690
I'll eat with you!

160
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,720
You'll have an appetite if you watch me eat!

161
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,360
You eat some, too! It's delicious!

162
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,290
There's no need. Rou Rou, you're always so happy when you eat.

163
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,850
You really like to eat!

164
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,070
Do you want to hear the truth?

165
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,570
Of course!

166
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,700
Then let me tell you!

167
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,020
When I was little, you took me off the street and back to Rui Royal Manor.

168
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,710
Then I swore I'd follow you for life!

169
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,600
In the past, in Rui Royal Manor,

170
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,750
they always gave you leftover dishes, so, of course, I wouldn't accept that!

171
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,050
So I ate up all of those leftovers!

172
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,310
Then I went to the small kitchen and made you new dishes!

173
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,210
Because of that, Auntie Rong beat me many times.

174
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,050
Rou Rou, you're too good to me!

175
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,310
But why didn't you ever gain weight?

176
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,040
You don't know this,

177
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,000
but a big half of those leftover dishes,

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,840
I took out of the manor to give to Su Su.

179
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,550
Look!  He's so tall and handsome now!

180
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,490
He became a palace guard, too! It's all thanks to me!

181
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,280
W-What's wrong?

182
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,460
Nothing, nothing. You're so good to Xiao Su.

183
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,480
Su Su and I...

184
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,930
We are childhood lovers.

185
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,040
When we were little on the streets, he always protected me.

186
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,960
He didn't let others bully me.

187
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,970
I even secretly thought

188
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,740
I'd get to marry him!

189
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,040
Rou Rou, you... you might not be able to marry Su Su.

190
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,210
Why not? You don't approve?

191
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,630
You can't bear to let me go?

192
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,010
Or you think he'll treat me poorly?

193
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,830
- No! 
 - Then why not?

194
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,420
Xiao Su, he...

195
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,170
he...

196
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,730
he...

197
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,270
T-Tell me!

198
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,320
General, I'm back!

199
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,960
- Everything went smoothly? 
 - Yes.

200
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,180
I've dealt with the spy.

201
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,680
The emperor couldn't possibly have guessed our counterintelligence plan.

202
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,940
Hurry and go back. Or else, your Rou Rou will miss you even more.

203
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,500
Yes!

204
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,140
How could that be? The emperor executed Xiao Su?

205
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,440
That's impossible!

206
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,540
I heard Lieutenant General tell the general.

207
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,450
General should be bringing back his body about now.

208
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,390
Miss, don't play jokes on me!

209
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,460
How could Su Su die?

210
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,840
He was just fine when he left!

211
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,280
He also told me, he'd propose when he got back!

212
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,630
Also, he is the emperor's palace guard.

213
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,690
How could he be executed just like that?

214
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,050
I didn't dare to believe it either.

215
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,190
You've known for a while?

216
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,380
Why did you wait until now to tell me?

217
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,400
Rou Rou, I was afraid you'd be sad.

218
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,760
Miss, you're not going to eat this, right?

219

Right! Let's drink to Su Su!

Why to me?

226
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,300
I want to thank you for keeping me by your side.

227

And thank you for taking care of me and Su Su.

228

Let's drink! Here!

229
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,890
Rou Rou, I must also thank you and Su Su for staying next to me,

230
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,080
going through everything with me.

231
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,000
Miss, let me tell you.

232
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,960
When I'm not by your side,

233
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,630
you must remember not to fight with the general anymore.

234
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,410
You must appreciate those in front of you!

235
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,070
Don't be like me.

236
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,410
Now, I have a lot of regrets!

237
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,660
What nonsense are you talking about, Rou Rou?

238
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,550
I'm not talking nonsense! I'm not talking nonsense!

239
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,440
- Hey! Be careful! 
 - Let me tell you! I'm being serious!

240
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,680

 - I'm being serious!

241
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,980
Miss, I want to go with Su Su,

242
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,020
but I'm worried about you!

243
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,880
However! It's good now. You have the general to care for you.

244
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,870
I'm very much at ease!

245
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,470
Miss, remember to think of me, all right?

Bury me and Su Su together, all right?

253

We couldn't be together in life, but if we can share a grave in death,

254
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,760
I will be very satisfied!

00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,050
My Lady, enough is enough.

322
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,650
Rou Rou, is your mouth all right?

323
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,620
It's nothing. All good.

324
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,460
I'm sorry about yesterday.

325
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,010
I didn't have the whole picture and made you sad. I almost caused serious trouble.

326
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,020
No. Miss, it was not your fault.

327
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,630
I know you care about me.

328
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:26,550
Besides,

329
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,520
after what happened last night, my relationship with Su Su is now stronger.

330
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,360
We'll never be separated again.

331
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,230
That's good! I wish you both the best.

332
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,960
When are you planning to marry him?

333
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,310
Just say it. Don't worry about me.

334
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,110
Miss, stop joking around.

335
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,170
It's still too early for us.

336
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,040
But you... you should marry yourself off quickly.

337
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,030
Marry?

338
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,670
I am already legally married to Chu Xiuming.

339
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,490
Stop dreaming.

340
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,200
You divorced him!

341
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,440
<i> Chu Xiuming, you're not divorcing me. I'm divorcing you! </i>

342
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,300
Why are you laughing?

343
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,420
I was angry that day.

344
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,250
So I just threw that at him after I finished writing the words, "divorce letter."

345
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,740
Except for those two words on the envelope, there was nothing inside.

346
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,430
- Not even a piece of paper? 
 - No.

347
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,720
- So that divorce letter didn't count? 
 - Of course not.

348
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,100
General Chu.

349
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,340
General Chu.

350
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,830
The soldiers trained by you are all strong and mighty.

351
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,170
My tribe and your Imperial Court have already negotiated a peace treaty.

352
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,220
So we'll never have to fight each other again.

353
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,890
When two armies go to war, it is devastating.

354
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,520
The innocent common folks suffer.

355
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,210
Now, our two sides have exchanged weapons of war for gifts of jade and silk, returning peace and happiness to our people.

356
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,670
This is the right thing to do that will benefit both our countries.

357
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,490
I am very pleased.

358
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,100
You really do understand righteousness.

359
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,990
We have also prepared a performance for you.

360
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,540
This is a misunderstanding! It's all a misunderstanding!

361
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,970
What do you mean? Why did you try to kill our general?

362
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,520
I heard the Devil General is a good fighter.

363
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:21,330
Now that I've sparred with you, I can see that you're just like the warriors in our tribe. You're certainly a great hero.

364
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,660
Please don't misunderstand her.

365
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,360
She's my daughter, Ma Ya. She's a naughty child.

366
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,150
I didn't expect she would joke around with the general like this.

367
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:34,270
I brought her here also to show her the heroes in the Chu Army.

368
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Apologize to General Chu now!

369
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,350
No need.

370
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,290
I'm really sorry for hurting the princess.

371
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,330
Bao Zitou! Quickly summon the military physician.

372
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,760
Yes.

373
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,390
There's no need. It's a small wound. Don't worry about it.

374
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,930
Right, she was raised like a boy.

375
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,800
She always gets hurt, so this was nothing to her.

376
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,920
General, we have already fought.

377
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,060
If one doesn't fight, then one won't make friends. That makes us friends now. <i>(An exchange of blows can lead to friendship.)</i>

378
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,660
The princess is quite straightforward.

379
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,660
But... if you're really sorry,

380
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,340
you can let me stay here for a few days.

381
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,790
I heard there's a busy market here.

382
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,240
I never had the chance to come here.

383
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,600
Of course, it's not a problem.

384
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,970
If that's the case, many thanks for letting my daughter stay here for a few days. Please excuse her rude behavior.

385
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,990
Ma Ya, never do this again.

386
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,340
Don't worry. I will treat the princess with all hospitality.

387
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,980
Did I catch a cold?

388
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,190
Miss, what's wrong? Let's go.

389
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,110
General, why is your manor...

390
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,970
Are you all right?

391
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,600
I'm really sorry.

392
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,510
It will cause a lot of trouble if you stay in the camp.

393
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,350
So please stay in my manor for now.

394
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,150
There are women here who can take care of you.

395
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,960
You're really thoughtful.

396
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,710
General, you're back?

397
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,360
Where's My Lady?

398
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,020
Lady and Rou Rou went out.

399
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,340
They'll be back soon.

400
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,930
Find an outfit from Lady's wardrobe and help the princess change into it.

401
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,200
Yes. Princess, please come with me.

402
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,410
You promised to teach me how to use a sword. Don't break your promise.

403
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,180
General.

404
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,560
This must be Big Sister.

405
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,900
Big Sister?

406
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,530
I wonder why I'm Big Sister? 
 <i>(T/N: Younger wives referring to the first wife)</i>

407
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,800
General, who is this?

408
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,470
My Lady, this is the Falcon Tribe's Princess Ma Ya.

409
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,020
Falcon Tribe's Princess?

410
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,560
Why are you here and wearing my clothes?

411
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,970
It's my fault.

412
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,320
What did you do?

413
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,400
Princess and I had a fight. I hurt her by accident.

414
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,170
Hurt?

415
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,780
Where did you get hurt?

416
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,070
It's nothing. It's normal to get hurt in a fight.

417
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,990
Besides, if one doesn't fight, then one won't make friends.

418
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,000
We're friends now. Don't be too polite to me.

419
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,630
You...

420
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:02,240
Princess, I'm afraid you must be unfamiliar with our sense of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor.

421
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,330
Or know that there are boundaries between a man and a woman?

422
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,500
Why are you doing this, Big Sister?

423
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,630
Don't call me Big Sister! You're no Little Sister of mine!

424
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,620
My Lady, how can you speak like this? Apologize to the princess.

425
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,640
You want me to apologize to her!

426
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,520
General, don't blame her. I must've done something wrong.

427
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,090
No.

428
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,670
Stop being the nice person.

429
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,490
- All right, My Lady. 
 - Go back to wherever you came from.

430
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,480
- All right.  
 - Isn't the Falcon Tribe busy?

431
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,230
- You have nothing to do? 
 - My Lady wants to speak with me. Make yourself comfortable.

432
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,300
- What's wrong with you? Why did you stop me? 
 - Enough, My Lady.

433
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,950
You care about her?

434
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,780
- Is it because she's beautiful? 
 - Enough!

435
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,620
- When did she come? Why didn't I know? 
 - Stop it.

436
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,980
Tell her to get out! Let her go!

437
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,850
- Put me down! 
 - General, don't blame her.

438
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,010
<i>Let me down! Hurry!</i>

439
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,790
<i>Chu Xiuming, explain yourself! Chu Xiuming, put me down!</i>

440
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,540
Chu Xiuming, put me down! Why are you stopping me?

441
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,700
Put me down!

442
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,200
Hurry! Put me down!

443
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,750
Why are you angry?

444
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,030
I'm just angry. I'm very angry.

445
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,680
Even if you're angry, you shouldn't be mad at the princess.

446
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,200
You're worried about her, aren't you!

447
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,660
Why would I worry about a stranger? I'm worried about you.

448
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,530
I'm afraid My Lady will provoke anger in that Falcon Tribe Princess for no reason and increase My Lady's vexations.

449
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,100
Are you telling the truth?

450
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,680
I don't lie.

451
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,680
All right then, tell her to move out. She can't live in our manor.

452
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,640
We can't do that.

453
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,430
She's the princess of the Falcon Tribe after all. It's not worth it to offend her over these small things.

454
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:35,990
Small things? These are small things?

455
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,270
My Lady, are you jealous?

456
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,460
You're right. I am jealous.

457
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,820
You're cute this way. I'm happy about it.

458
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,300
Chu Xiuming, I'm being serious. Don't change the topic.

♫ <i> The wind speaks like you </i> ♫

460

461
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,950
<i>General!</i>

462
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,990
How dare her to come again? Isn't she afraid that I'll kill her?

463
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,990
No, what do you mean? Why are you stopping me?

464
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,700
- My Lady. 
 - Why can't you kick her out?

465
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,800
Don't pull me!

466
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,600
General, what good swordplay!

467
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,000
Don't be angry! Don't be angry!

468
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,800
Miss, if you are rash and get angry now,

469
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,600
then others will just think you're being bossy and arrogant!

470
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,200
You must not fall into others' traps!

471
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,100
"Heroes may be killed but cannot be insulted."

472
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,900
They dare to be so intimate right in front of me?

473
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,200
How can I hold back?

474
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,000
Don't be angry! Don't be angry, don't be angry.

475
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,900
Stop!

476
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,800
- Miss! Miss, don't be rash!

Princess, you should call me, "General's Lady."

Besides, you cannot master this swordplay in a matter of minutes.
