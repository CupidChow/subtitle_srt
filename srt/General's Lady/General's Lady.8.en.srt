General, it is such a beautiful night, let's have a drink!

38
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,630
Lord Military Inspector, a toast must have words of blessings.

39
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,320
I wonder what you would like to say.

40
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,570
I see that you're drinking alone.

41
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,490
I am here to accompany you. Could it be that you are unwilling to drink with me?

42
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,040
Then I'll apologize for what happened today. Will that make it all right?

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,880
You gave me that pardoning decree to protect a life.

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,930
But today, I did it to save my Xiao Su!

45
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,330
You must have misunderstood him!

46
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,030
General, I salute you with a drink.

47
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,590
I salute you for the pardoning decree.

48
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,220
There's no need.

49
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,900
You should salute your Lord Military Inspector for being able to sit here today.

50
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,380
Then I will follow your orders.

51
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,390
Lord Jin, I haven't even thanked you properly yet. Cheers.

52
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,060
You are too courteous.

53

Don't just focus on drinking with the general. It is a full moon tonight.

54
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,030
We should drink and eat with the soldiers. Let's go. Let's go salute them with drinks.

<i> Such good wine! </i>

In a bit, don't drink so much. I know your alcohol tolerance.

62
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,040
If you get drunk, no one can drink.

- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

66
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,330
Come on, one cup won't do! You must drink three!

67
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,810
- That's right! 
 - All right, three cups it is! I'll drink them for her!

68
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,870
- Good! Good! 
 - Slow down!

69
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,960
<i>- Here. 
 - Fill the cup to the brim! Fill the cup to the brim.</i>

70
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,300
- Why are you drinking so fast? You'll choke! 
 <i>- Fill it up!</i>

71
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,130
<i>Such good alcohol tolerance!</i>

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,160
<i>- Are you okay?

73
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,680
<i>Fill it up!</i>

From today on, no one is allowed to drink in the military camp!

78
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,920
If anyone mentions the full moon to me, they will be punished according to martial laws!

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,510
Go sleep or patrol as you are supposed to! Move!

80
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,220
General, are you okay?

81
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,340
I don't need you to care!

82
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,000
General, drink this soup.

83
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,450
Why are you here keeping watch?

84
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,070
Do you remember what happened last night?

85
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,530
Last night?

86
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,080
What happened?

87
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,590
<i> General! General! </i>

88
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,550
<i> She is your wife! Don't mistake her for someone else! </i>

89
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,710
<i>She isn't my wife! She is Lord Military Inspector! </i>

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,970
<i> If anyone dares to call her "Lady" from now on, he will be punished according to martial laws! </i>

91
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,040
<i> Fine! </i>

92
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,700
<i> Everyone listen clearly! </i>

93
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,690
<i> If anyone dares to call me "Lady" from now on, </i>

94
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,500
<i> I, the Lord Military Inspector, will also punish him according to martial laws! </i>

95
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,090
<i> Miss! Miss! </i>

96
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,670
<i> Lord Jin! </i>

97
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,980
I've already explained it to the soldiers.

98
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,610
As for Her Ladyship...

99
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,220
I think you did go overboard.

100
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,430
You probably broke her heart.

101
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,840
<i>Lord Military Inspector.</i>

102
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,430

103
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,160
Retract!

104
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,490
General, are you feeling better?

105
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,500
I was in the wrong in yesterday's situation.

106
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,800
We all understand. You don't need to feel guilty.

107
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,480
Have you seen Lord Military Inspector?

108
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,120
Her Ladyship? Oh! Oh...

109
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,620
I haven't seen her.

110
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,810
After the drinking festivities yesterday, she was in a bad mood so I didn't come to bother her.

111
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,460
This morning when I came to make the bed, I realized that she didn't return all night.

112
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,690
Have you seen Xiao Su?

113
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,340
I haven't seen him.

114
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,590
Who is it?

115
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,770
Where is Shen Jin?

116
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,630
How would I know? She is your Lord Military Inspector. She's also your wife!

117
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,960
<i>- Isn't it hilarious that you're asking me?
- Cut the crap.</i>

118
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,690
She is the closest to you. She tells you everything.

119
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,970
Why wouldn't you know where she is?

120
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,550
Chu Xiuming! You should be satisfied!

121
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,470
I've never seen our Lord Jin care so much about a man before!

122
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,290
<i> Not only do you make things hard for her but you also divorced her! You really have a heart of steel! </i>

123
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,040
Xiao Cong! Have you seen My Lady?

124
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
Isn't Her Ladyship at the military camp?

125
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,040
<i> Our Lord Jin may not be the most beautiful woman in the world, </i>

126
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,640
<i> but she is a well-rounded talented woman. </i>

127
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,540
<i> She is more than enough for you! </i>

128
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,860
Have you seen My Lady?

129
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,830
- Replying to you, General. I have not. 
 - <i> She specifically asked me to teach her military affairs in order to help you wholeheartedly. </i>

130
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,310
You are the only one in her heart and her eyes! What else aren't you satisfied with?

131
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,080
<i> Why are you all drinking?</i>

132
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,030
<i>Whoever dares to call her "Lady" from now on, he will be punished according to martial laws!</i>

133
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,880
<i>- General! 
 - I don't need you to care!</i>

134
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,870
<i>Fine. Everyone listen carefully!</i>

135
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,790
<i>Whoever dares to call me "Lady" from now on, I, Lord Military Inspector, will also punish him according to martial laws!</i>

136
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,350
Shen Jin! Come out!

137
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,420
I'm telling you!  Come out right now!

138
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,480
Shen Jin! Come out!

139
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,130
Shen Jin! Come out!

140
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,140
Shen Jin!

141
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,220
Shen Jin! Come out!

142
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,360
I, as the general, order you to come out here!

143
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,700
You are the Military Inspector sent by His Majesty! You should be staying in the military camp!

144
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,460
Instead, you abandoned your post and defied royal order!

145
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,390
Shen Jin! As long as you are willing to return with me,

146
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,000
I won't pursue this matter!

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,190
If you feel bored in the military camp,

148
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,270
I can give you as much freedom as possible! Okay?

149
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,550
My Lady! I am a general who kills on the battlefield!

150
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,230
You're younger with a bright future, yet you're worried and afraid for me every day.

151
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,940
You said that your heart aches for me!

152
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,950
If I get another scar in the future, how would I be worthy of your deep affection?

153
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,740
If I cannot give you an eternity,

154
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,920
I'd rather give up!

155
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,190
I don't want you to be sad!

156
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,820
That's why I had no choice but to write that divorce letter!

157
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,190
I shouldn't have done that! I shouldn't have done that!

158
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,890
Ever since you came to my manor,

159
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,340
I've noticed everything that you have done.

160
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,730
All the good things you did for me and every page of the note you made at the military camp; they are all forever in my heart.

161
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,200
You asked me why I abandoned you in the wilderness.

162
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,620
Every time we are victorious, I will take the soldiers back to celebrate.

163
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,090
I didn't abandon you there on purpose!

164
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,300
You asked me why I want to divorce you.

165
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:48,720
I've been on the battlefield for over ten years. I've never been afraid of the Falcon Tribe, reputations, or death.

166
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,270
However, when we're at the ancient tomb, when you questioned me and when we became intimate,

167
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,880
my heart started becoming confused.

168
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,810
After you came to the barracks, everything you did

169
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,850
made me unable to concentrate on the army.

170
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,550
Especially your relationship with Xiao Su!

171
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,820
I... I can't stand it.

172
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,660
I can't stand a man,

173
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,720
any man except me to be intimate with you.

174
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,910
Everything you have done makes me confused.

175
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,230
But I must complete my mission.

176
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,290
Not just for the Imperial Court, but also for my family!

177
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,930
All of these things leave me with no choice.

178
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,360
I slowly started to discover,

179
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,220
that I have something to fear.

180
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,550
I've discovered, that I have started to have weaknesses.

181
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,830
I started to realize, what I couldn't bear the most

182
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,110
is losing you.

183
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,840
Be my wife.

184
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,180
Continue to stay by my side. Okay?

185
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,730
♫ <i> Love is the spring to a lifeless land </i> ♫

186
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,660
♫ <i> Opening the door to my heart without sound or notice </i> ♫

187
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,480
♫ <i> Stars change positions, time passes </i> ♫

188
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,750
♫ <i> I wish to be your loyal servant </i> ♫

189
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,580
♫ <i> Love is just the spare warmth from this mortal world </i> ♫

190
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,160
♫ <i> Flowers bloom and fall, leaving an impression </i> ♫

191
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:56,670
♫ <i> Naively letting the years pass for one person </i> ♫

192
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,270
♫ <i> Love is the spring to a lifeless land </i> ♫

193
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,110
♫ <i> Opening the door to my heart without sound or notice </i> ♫

194
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,070
♫ <i> Stars change positions, time passes </i> ♫

195
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,600
♫ <i> I wish to be your loyal servant </i> ♫

196
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,620
Then... Then you and Xiao Su... What is your relationship with him?

197
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,140
Rou Rou and Su Su once wandered the land as children.

198
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,420
That's when I met them.

199
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,410
The three of us frequently played together as kids.

200
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,530
But it is very hard to survive wandering the land.

201
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,270
Rou Rou is a girl so her status is easier to deal with.

202
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,810
I could only take her back to the manor.

203
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,100
However, Su Su could only wander alone out there.

204
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,790
Because of this,

205
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,060
Su Su has always been very grateful to me.

206
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,180
So that's how it is.

207
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,150
Then that means you can be considered their savior.

208
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,800
We are all friends. We are supposed to help each other.

209
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,010
Then I'll tell you another secret.

210
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,710
What secret?

211
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:14,920
Actually... Xiao Su...

212
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,600
and Rou Rou!

213
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,990
They have liked each other for a very long time now.

214
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,870
I've always wanted to get them to be together.

215
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,280
However, because of me,

216
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,910
they haven't been able to be together.

217
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,130
So the one Xiao Su likes is Rou Rou?

218
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,250
I thought you were as the rumors said;

219
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,200
violent, bloodthirsty, and merciless.

220
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,270
I never imagined that I would realize now, after meeting you, that you are a loyal person.

221
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,290
I apologize to you here.

222
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,840
I also apologize to you here, Brother Xiao Su.

223
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,460
General, did you know? Just like this chess game,

224
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,820
people have placed spies around you for a long time now.

225
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,140
That's expected.

226
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,810
There are many people in the Imperial Court who see you as a threat.

227
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,570
They have fed many lies to His Majesty, reasoning that your merits are surpassing his.

228
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,020
I came this time to investigate this matter.

229
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,420
Then Brother Xiao Su, do you know who those people are?

230
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,240
These people of the Imperial Court are very crafty.

231
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,140
It is hard to uncover their true purpose.

232
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,460
However, news from the military camp

233
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,430
reaches the capital very quickly.

234
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,980
There are definitely spies by your side.

235
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,590
I am away from the capital for most of the year.

236
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,270
I know nothing in regard to the affairs of the Imperial Court.

237
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,720
From now on, I must trouble you, Brother Xiao Su.

238
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,110
If you do not mind, General,

239
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,000
I am willing to be your trusted aide!

240
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,760
Thank you for your trust.

241
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:16,220
Brother Xiao Su, did you know that the Imperial Court has not given out military funds in the past two years?

242
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,810
As far as I know, His Majesty places great importance on your protection at the border.

243
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,050
He grants military funds on time every year.

244
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,660
If this is really the case, I will surely report it to the emperor.

245
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,330
Someone must be behind this.

246
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,200
Don't report this to the emperor yet, or else it will alert the enemy.

247
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,990
The priority right now is to set a good trap

248
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,050
and draw out the spies in the military camp.

249
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,200
You want me to leave?

250
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,980
You always think that life in the barracks is boring.

251
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,340
Ten miles from here is a small village.

252
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,560
There'll be a market every five days.

253
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,790
It just so happens that the market will happen today. Let Bao Zitou accompany you two there so that you can go relax.

254
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,180
Not bad, not bad. Our great devil is considerate of others now.

255
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,970
Ruo Ruo, let's go.

256
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,270
Su Su, wait for me then.

257
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:12,410
I will be back with my innocence and in one piece.

258
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,360
Ruo Ruo, don't speak too early.

259
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,920
There are many things that will make you lose control in the market!

260
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,870
Did you forget about those roast ducks and roast geese?

261
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,770
Let's go then, My Lady.

262
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,110
Is everything ready?

263
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,600
Yes.

264
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,840
They can't know about any of the dangerous things.

265
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,670
They are our weaknesses, but also our armor.

266
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,190
We must do everything we can to protect them.

267
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,610
Yes.

268
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,260
Lord Military Inspector, we've arrived.

269
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,250
When we're out, we have to be more down to earth. Call me "Lord Jin."

270
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,720
Yes.

271
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,090
Lord Jin!

272
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,410
Be clever. In a bit, there'll be many things you'll have to carry!

273
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,960
Yes.

274
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,360
One, two!

275
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,640
Three! Four!

276
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,890
Use all your strength to strike forward!

277
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,550
Buns? Let's come back and eat them later!

278
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,270
Smells so good.

279
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,840
<i> Take a look! </i>

280
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,990
How fragrant!

281
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,160
Yup, smells good!

282
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,720
<i>Take a look.</i>

283
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,190
<i> Take a look! </i>

284
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,830
Why are you looking at a belt hook?

285
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,740
I'm looking at it for my Su Su!

286
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,810
Look, My Lady. The design of this belt hook is unique and stylish.

287
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,550
It suits my Su Su so well!

288
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,650
You can casually choose anything for Su Su.

289
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,170
Unlike for My General, I have to pick something using the highest standard!

290
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,900
This jade's color is clear and cold on the surface,

291
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,480
but it's very transparent on the inside.

292
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,920
Cold on the outside, warm on the inside. It suits My General so well.

293
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,040
Miss, one look at you and I can tell you know what quality is.

294
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,910
You have a good eye!

295
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,650
This jade is a guardian jade!

296
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,060
It can ensure someone's safety!

297
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,130
Miss, you can lift it to the light and see

298
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,780
the unique nature of this jade.

299
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,200
Okay! Then I'll take this!

300
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,000
- Miss, you have a good eye! Here, give it to me. 
 -Thank you!

301
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,970
- I also want one, too. 
 - That's fine. I'll wrap them both up.

302
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,960
- Thank you. 
 - All right.

303
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,980
This cloth is quite nice.

304
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,860
- Let me take a look. 
 - Miss, take a look.

305
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,660
What is this selling?

306
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,910
This place sells medicine. I don't take any medicine.

307
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,640
It's you?

308
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,080
Did you find it?

309
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,060
Not yet.

310
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,670
How many of our people are around Chu Xiuming?

311
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,090
I am the only fortunate survivor now.

312
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,990
When it comes closer to my return to the capital, you must make more inquiries.

313
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,300
Hurry and find evidence of Chu Xiuming's betrayal.

314
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,080
You and I will split up.

315
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,340
You are in charge of inquiring within the military camp.

316
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,270
I will go to the manor to investigate.

317
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,520
Yes.

318
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,760
By the way, Chu Xiuming is a very careful person.

319
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,070
You must be extra careful.

320
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,940
Use qinggong to leave. There're traps everywhere here.

321
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,550
Much thanks.

322
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,530
General, I got it out of him.

323
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,420
At the moment, it is just him.

324
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,740
Take him away.

325
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,600
I will leave the rest to you.

326
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,620
General, rest assured. I will act according to the plan.

327
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,610
Your and Rou Rou's feelings for each other have just grown,

328
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,530
yet now you have to return to the capital to complete your mission. It must be hard for you.

329
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,800
I cannot bear to leave, but I have no choice.

330
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,780
Sacrificing small things for the bigger picture is what a man should do.

331
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,600
However, General, I have a request.

332
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,130
Go ahead.

333
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,490
If I do not make it back, I will leave Rou Rou to you.

334
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,240
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

335
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,480
General, they're back!

336
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,560
General.

337
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,540
General, how come you two are here?

338
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,680
I did a great thing today!

339
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,760
What?

340
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,490
I won't tell you.

341
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,190
I have many methods to make you confess.

342
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,060
You can give it a try if you don't believe me.

343
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,020
Fine, I'll give it a try then. It's not as if I'll be frightened.

344
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,770
Ruo Ruo,

345
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,160
I... have something to tell you.

346
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,180
What?

347
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,930
Nevermind, it's nothing. I'll tell you when we get back.

348
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,500
Hey! It's rare for us to ride horses.

349
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,660
How about we have a race. Whoever reaches the military camp first wins.

350
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,700
- Okay! 
 - Okay!

351
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,520
One. Two. Three!

352
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,610
- You guys cheated! 
 - You guys!

353
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,980
General! Your Ladyship! Wait for me!

354
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,370
General!

355
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,710
By the way, I have a present for you.

356
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,040
What is this?

357
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,390
This is a guardian jade.

358
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,570
If you keep it on, it will keep you safe.

359
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,910
Look at it in the candlelight.

360
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,260
There's another sight to see in it.

361
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,380
Do you see anything?

362
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,170
I see it.

363
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,780
I see your sincerity.

364
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,120
Ruo Ruo? Who bullied our Ruo Ruo?

365
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,970
My Lady!

366
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,240
Okay, Ruo Ruo.

367
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,620
Don't cry first. Tell me what happened.

368
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:45,390
Su Su... Su-Su Su doesn't want me anymore!

369
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,900
- Why? 
 - He's going back to the capital!

370
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,920
Why? How come I don't know?

371
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,080
It's just time to see the emperor. He's going back to report to His Majesty.

372
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,470
Okay, okay!  Let's not cry. Don't cry.

373
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,940
Don't be sad. If you are so sad, I'll be sad too.

374
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,620
- My Lady! 
 - Okay, don't cry.

375
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,010
- Don't cry. 
 - I want Su Su.

376
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,610
Don't cry.

377
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,500
Have you packed everything?

378
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,570
Don't worry.

379
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,700
I'll go take a look.

380
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,950
It's been hard on you.

381
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,610
It's my job.

382
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,040
Take care of yourself. Come back soon.

383
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,780
Okay. I'm leaving then.

384
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:53,840
Don't worry. Once I'm done, I'll come back right away.

385
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,900
What is this?

386
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,530
This is the gift I bought for you.

387
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,720
It's a belt hook.

388
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,180
It's to remind you

389
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:14,120
that you're not allowed to undress in front of others when I'm not around.

390
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,760
Okay.

391
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,470
Not seeing you for one day is like being separated for three years.

392
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,070
How many years are we going to be separated for?

393
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,190
If it were you, what would you do?

394
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,980
How should I say it? I'm not parting with you.

395
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,660
You should say that this type of situation will not happen.

396
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,330
Okay. This type of situation will not happen.

397
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:50,170
Hey! Are you just saying whatever I tell you to say?

398
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,340
There's no sincerity at all!

399
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,580
- Hey, I—! 
 - Look and learn from him!

400
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,870
Su Su, I can't bear to see you go.

401
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,960
I want to send you off.

402
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,570
Okay.

403
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,590
Let's go.

404
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:26,630
At that speed when will they ever get to the capital?

405
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,960
Let me calculate.

406
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,550
It'll be roughly around... The year of the monkey in the month of the horse. 
 <i>(T/N: Idiom - a long time off.)</i>

407
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,490
Let's go back.

408
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,860
Don't touch me!

409
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,580
What is this?

410
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,660
These are some medicines I prepared.

411
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,980
It'll be a rough journey.

412
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,440
I'm scared that you will get hurt.

413
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,750
- You have to take care of yourself. 
 - Okay.

414
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,140
"Your body, hair and skin all come from me, Rou Rou." 
 <i>(T/N: Original text is from the "Xiao Jing."  "The Classic of Piety" replaces "me" with "parents." Means that everything of him belongs to her.)</i>

415
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,330
If you get hurt,

416
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,900
my heart will ache so much!

417
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,220
I know.

418
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,190
It's pretty late now.

419
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,820
You should hurry and go.

420
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,440
Okay.

421
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,060
Wait!

422
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,090
Hug.

423
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:36,860
♫ <i> In the dream, I don't sense the worries of tomorrow</i> ♫

424
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,940
Be safe and come back quickly.

425
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,310
I promise you. I will immediately come back once I finish.

426
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,650
Then go.

427
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:57,990
♫ <i> Death separates us </i> ♫

428

429
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,580
I'm leaving.

430
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,600
Be careful.

431
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,220
I'm leaving.

432
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,830
Have a safe trip!

433
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,140
You must eat well!

434
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,690
I will sleep well and wait for your return!

00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,420
Oh right!

437
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:35,150
I've thought about it. Let's not see each other for the next few days.

438
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,030
Why?

439
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,670
I'm afraid Rou Rou will be sad when she sees us together.

440
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,300
Your logic doesn't make sense.

441
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,150
Because Xiao Su left,

442
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,930
the entire world can't be in love?

443
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,950
Besides, Xiao Su is just going back to report to His Majesty.

444
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,760
Once the time is right, he'll definitely return.

445
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,060
I am Ruo Ruo's closest friend.

446
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,840
How can I aggravate her when she's most vulnerable?

447
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,310
So, let's separate for a while.

448
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,280
There are many ways to keep Rou Rou from being sad from seeing us together.

449
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,250
We don't have to be apart.

450
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,370
You can come to my tent.

451
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,580
It's fine as long as she doesn't see it.

452
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,050
I got it then.

453
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,810
She's clearly only a few feet away, yet she's still late by 15 minutes.

454
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,310
Forget it, forget it.

455
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,290
After all, her legs are short.

456
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,550
Reporting, Her Ladyship is here.

457
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,160
Enter.

458
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,540
What is this attitude of yours?

459
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,530
You're the one who's late first, yet your arrogance is still so unbridled.

460
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,350
There are thousands of people in the camp, but you're the only one who doesn't respect me!

461
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,820
General, can we sit down and talk?

462
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,680
Now you dare to speak of conditions with me.

463
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,530
Please! Have you read too many military strategy books?

464
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,880
Now you're assuming everyone is hatching sinister plots.

465
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,360
I came late because I have a stiff neck, okay? I have to sit.

466
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,550
Don't go.

467
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,930
Chu Xiuming, what are you doing?

468
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:38,200
I'm warning you, don't take advantage when my body isn't well—

469
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,050
I already told you, yet you still dare to ambush me!

470
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,920
Try moving it. It doesn't hurt, right?

471
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,390
It really is better.

472
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:55,360
You went in with such a heavy hand. You don't know how to be gentle with women at all!

473
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:05,550
I never imagined that the great devil king who leads thousands of soldiers,

474
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,260
in the end, still had to disregard his status

475
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,420
to knead my shoulders and massage my lower back.

476
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,880
Not long ago, you clearly wanted to divorce me.

477
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,180
Now you know how to be kind and caring?

478
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,000
Didn't I tell you?

479
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,570
While Rou Rou and Su Su are separated, we can't touch each other!

480
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,560
Or else, Rou Rou will become sad and heartbroken!

481
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,610
Where is Ruo Ruo? I didn't see her when I woke up this morning.

482
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,120
I told Bao Zitou to take her away.

483
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,220
To where?

484
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:47,280
Don't worry. Of course, she is being treated well with good food.

485
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,290
You scared me to death! You should have told me earlier!

486
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,230

487
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,250
- Ruo Ruo? 
 - My Lady!

488
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,240
- What's wrong? 
 - Why is my life so bitter? It's more bitter than bitter melon!

489
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,840
What's wrong?

490
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,900
Don't cry. Don't cry.

491
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,100
Bao Zitou! What's going on?

492
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,030
- Who bullied our Ruo Ruo? 
 - Him!

493
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,490
Didn't I tell you to treat her well with good food and drinks? What's going on?

494
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,960
I did exactly as you ordered! I didn't dare to treat her poorly.

495
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,720
At first, she was eating happily, her mouth covered in oil.

496
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,010
Until a dish came out... Salted Flaky Pastry.

500

Nothing tastes good anymore!

501
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,250
It's fine, Ruo Ruo. I'm here. I'll keep you company.

502
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,380
- My Lady, you're here! 
 - Don't cry, don't cry.

503
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,450
I'm still here. Don't cry.

504

Miss! Why are you here?

505

No.

507

Su Su! Now that you're not here, no one will take me on dates!

508
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,150
Okay. We aren't on a date. We aren't

509
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,290
- We aren't. 
 - You aren't?

Then promise me.

511
