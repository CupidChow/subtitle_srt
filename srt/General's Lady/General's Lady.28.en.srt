30
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:00,130
Your Majesty, Rui Royal Manor's Shen Jin's disappearance is suspicious!

31
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,360
Did you find any clues?

32
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,340
I have already sent someone to investigate the general's manor but they did not find anything suspicious.

33
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,860
But for the past few days, General Chu has been acting strangely.

34
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,430
Your Majesty, I suspect that General Chu is the one who saved Shen Jin.

35
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,970
I heard the general's manor has been training soldiers.

36
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,380
I'm afraid he may have intentions of rebelling.

37
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,100
Chu Xiuming dares to train soldiers at his manor?

38
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,950
Your Majesty, during the past few years, the Falcon Tribe has been at peace with our empire.

39
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,570
Thanks to the Chu family army's courage and skills, we have never lost.

40
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,310
How could this General Chu have intentions of rebelling?

41
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,520
Your Majesty, General Chu returned to the capital without permission.

42
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,030
He did not come to court, nor did he return to the border.

43
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,920
He does not listen to even your words!

44
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,750
You have already shown great grace in not detaining him.

45
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:03,120
I have not touched Chu Xiuming because I recognize that he has earned great merit by guarding the border.

46
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,540
Now, he dares to be so arrogant!

47
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,500
Your Majesty, please prioritize our empire

48
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,440
as well as the safety of its people

49
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,870
and capture Chu Xiuming immediately.

50
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,730
Pass on my order. Capture Lord Yongning, Chu Xiuming immediately!

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,360
<i> Your Majesty is wise! </i>

52
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
His Majesty has already sent someone to arrest you. At most, you have an hour.

53
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,610
Hurry and leave!

54
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,780
I got it. Please go back.

55
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,840
General! Have you already made plans?

56
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,510
Do you really intend to rebel?

57
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,580
Yes.

58
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,290
Xiao Su, there is one thing that only you can help me do.

59
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,970
My Lord, General Chu sent a message saying that he will take action today.

60
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,160
Good!

61
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,970
General Zuo, quickly make arrangements.

62
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,600
Yes.

63
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,610
We will all listen to General Chu's orders.

64
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,010
I have been fully devoted to my country!

65
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:48,330
However, today, His Majesty twisted the truth and ordered for my arrest.

66
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,630
You all are willing to go to the palace with me to seek justice.

67
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,020
I, Chu Xiuming, will always remember this!

68
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,530
Set out!

69
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,370
Older Brother! What is the meaning of this?

70
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,680
My Lord.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,570
After this matter is over, Chu Xiuming will be killed on the spot.

72
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,950
We will not leave a single person from the Rui Royal Manor alive.

73
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,900
My Lord, rest assured.

74
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,700
I will follow alone and personally watch over the operation.

75
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,850
If this fails, I will bear all the responsibilities alone.

76
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,310
I will surely not implicate you.

77
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,260
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

78
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,870
Your Majesty! Something has happened!

79
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,340
What are you panicking about?

80
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,500
General Chu brought soldiers to surround the palace.

81
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,150
He is about to enter the door!

82
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,540
Why is the palace so strange today?

83
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,060
There is no sign of the Imperial Army.

84
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,070
General Chu, how are things on your side?

85
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,090
When we entered the palace, we were met with no resistance either.

86
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,480
That is not right.

87
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,170
It is a trap! Hurry and retreat!

88
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,390
So you were waiting for us here.

89
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,840
General Chu, it is your turn to take action now.

90
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,520
You—!

91
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,560
Imperial Army, listen to my order! Capture the rebels!

92
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,940
What is the meaning of this?

93
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,690
Liu Qi!

94
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,590
These are the falsified treasury and military funding records found in your manor!

95
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,950
You have embezzled money from the treasury and taken money from the soldiers at the border for years now!

96
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,520
You secretly colluded with the general of the Right Guard,

97
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,030
the Imperial Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel and the Assistant to the Imperial Censor.

98
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,460
You have lied to the monarch and ignored royal law! Do you admit to your crimes?

99
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,440
Your Majesty! I was framed!

100
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,180
Chu Xiuming forced me to do all that!

101
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,890
Chu Xiuming has long desired to rebel and has been planning for years!

102
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,040
General Zuo and the others all know about this!

103
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,140
Serious crimes mean severe punishment.

104
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,940
If you are mere co-conspirators, I can give you lighter sentences.

105
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,340
However! If you dare to lie to me again, your entire family will be killed for nine generations!

106
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,770
Who among you is the main culprit?

107
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,340
Your Majesty! Chu Xiuming is the main culprit!

108
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,070
He is using us!

109
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,830
Drag them all out to be beheaded!

110
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,160
<i> Your Majesty, please spare us! </i>

111
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,670
- Your Majesty please spare us! <br> - Your Majesty, this was all Lord Liu's plan! He is the main culprit!

112
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,970
Your Majesty, Lord Liu is the main culprit, this was all his plan!

113
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,010
- Your Majesty! That is not the truth! <br> - Your Majesty! Spare us!

114
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,380
If you give us some time to capture Chu Xiuming, the truth will be unveiled!

115
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,590
Did you do all this yourself?

116
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,340
Or is there someone else behind you?

117
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,860
Your Majesty! I was framed!

118
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,010
Your Majesty!

119
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,940
Left Deputy Director of the Imperial Secretariat Liu Qi has embezzled from the State Treasury

120
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,750
as well as betrayed his empire for power and wealth. There is concrete evidence!

121
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,360
I... feel very pained.

122
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,760
According to law, his entire family shall be beheaded

123
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,880
and nine generations of his family shall be exterminated!

124
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,140
<i>- Your Majesty, spare us! <br> - Your Majesty, spare us!</i> <br> - Yes!

125
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,700
<i>Your Majesty, spare us! Your Majesty!</i>

126
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,010
<i>Your Majesty, spare us!</i>

127
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,560
Wait for me here.

128
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,400
Do not be angry. It's bad for your body.

129
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,090
I have come back safely now. You don't have to worry anymore.

130
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:20,280
If you are tired, go rest. I will not bother you.

131
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,270
That year, when you came to the Chu army,

132
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,750
you did not like to talk.

133
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,540
However, you liked to stay by my side.

134
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,090
I thought we were brothers.

135
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,920
That is why I never thought you would keep anything from me.

136
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,880
What exactly is the matter that are you unwilling to tell me?

137
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,620
I never thought of rebelling.

138
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,070
His Majesty treated Jin'er and I like this because we were in the wrong first.

139
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,340
So, I never hated the emperor.

140
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,760
Then, why did you act alone without telling us?

141
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,170
If you all didn't have a falling out with me, who would believe that I really wanted to rebel?

142
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,690
So that is how it is. Please forgive me, Older Brother!

143
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,490
I thought about a lot of things recently.

144
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,240
Including what happened sixteen years ago.

145
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,340
Yes.

146
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,920
Sixteen years have already passed.

147
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,680
Back then, Auntie was met with a great crisis.

148
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,870
It has been so many years

149
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,570
and we have been investigating

150
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,140
all the suspicious points.

151
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,200
In the end, everything points to His Majesty.

152
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,040
After all, he benefitted the most from what happened back then.

153
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,980
I did have thoughts of rebelling before.

154
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,790
It's just... we do not have hard evidence.

155
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,170
I will not give up. I will definitely persist to the end!

156
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,950
Xiuyuan.

157
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,400
Do you think he is a good Emperor?

158
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,440
What do you mean, Brother?

159
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,220
If I tell you to let go of what happened back then,

160
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,250
are you willing to do so?

161
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,600
Why?

162
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,460
Why do you want to give up after being committed to it for so long?

163
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,370
It has been so many years.

164
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,110
We have been fiercely watching him and his actions.

165
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:15,630
However, we cannot deny that he is a good emperor loved by the people.

166
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,210
That year, your father's tragic death

167
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,920
- led to fights over the throne and battles throughout the world. <br> - An'er...

168
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,530
It is because of his appearance,

169
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:32,120
that the people were able to escape warfare and live in peace.

170
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,480
The people cannot be dragged into war again.

171
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,670
Xiuyuan.

172
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,200
For the sake of the people,

173
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,330
are you willing to let go of your hatred

174
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,540
and let go of... the position that should have been yours?

175
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,480
I never wanted that position!

176
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,160
I also do not think I will be a good emperor!

177
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,630
However, as a son,

178
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,180
I only want to know the truth of what happened!

179
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,820
I just want to know who killed my parents, and why!

180
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,130
An'er...

181
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,350
Who are you?

182
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,920
How do you know this name of mine?

183
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,100
I not only know this name of yours...

184
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,970
I also know you love to laugh.

185
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,030
Every time you fell, your eyes were clearly full of tears,

186
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,020
but you would still laugh.

187
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,260
I also know... you always grabbed onto the corner of your father's clothes,

188
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,960
and went everywhere with him.

189
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,410
Who are you?

190
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,820
That's right.

191
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,100
It would be that corner of the clothes.

192
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,840
Who exactly are you?

193
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,760
An'er, do not be nervous.

194
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:56,670
When you are nervous, you will clutch your palm.

195
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,180
Didn't your mother tell you?

196
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,060
If you want to say something, just say it.

197
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,880
Don't suppress it in your heart.

198
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,910
Can you take off your mask?

199
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,770
An'er!

200
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,010
Father?

201
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,570
My An'er!

202
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,050
Father!

203
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,050
My child!

204
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,430
Father!

205
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,470
Father!

206
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,440
I thought you had died a long time ago!

207
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,500
<i>My An'er!</i>

208
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,070
<i>I missed you so much!</i>

209
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,600
<i>An'er!</i>

210
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,900
Father, sit.

211
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,950
You sit as well.

212
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,510
You look exactly the same as your mother.

213
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,340
Good. Good.

214
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,960
Eighth Prince.

215
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,460
Do not mention that title anymore.

216
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,340
How can the me right now

217
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:46,580
go back to being high-spirited and full of zeal?

218
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,260
Right now, I just want to find the real culprit from back then.

219
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,040
But... back then, everyone clearly said that you died already.

220
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,850
And that your corpse had been split apart.

221
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,510
Back then, I wasn't the one who died.

222
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,460
It was a gardener from my manor.

223
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,280
Gardener?

224
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,100
That day, I received a rare object.

225
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,110
It was a gold object.

226
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,630
<i> It was placed in a glass orb. </i>

227
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,830
<i> If you push on it, it will move within the glass orb like water. </i>

228
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,600
<i> If you leave it alone for a while, </i>

229
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,370
<i> it will go back to its original shape. </i>

230
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,710
<i> - Old Qi! <br> - Yes?</i>

231
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,150
<i>Come here.</i>

232
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,140
<i>I received a rare object.</i>

233
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,500
<i>I do not know what use there is for it. Here, I will give it to you.</i>

234
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,850
<i> Thank you for your gift, Your Highness. </i>

235
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,750
After waking up from being unconscious for many days,

236
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,520
it seemed like the entire world had changed.

237
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,550
A mysterious fire destroyed the entire Eighth Royal Manor.

238
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,530
Over thirty people died in the fire.

239
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:22,040
And I... became like this.

240
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,140
What dynasty's or era's crown prince would look like me?

241
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,270
So, I hid my identity

242
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,070
and secretly swore that I would find the real culprit.

243
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:48,480
The person who sent messages to me through Jin'er was Eighth Prince.

244
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,550
It was you, Uncle, right?

245
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,200
I had Princess Consort Rui give you those clues.

246
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,530
I wanted to see if you were willing to find the truth.

247
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,610
Whether you were willing to investigate this matter until the end.

248
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,670
After all, that was your aunt.

249
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,450
She was a member of your Chu family.

250
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,320
So it was Princess Consort Rui.

251
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,070
Princess Consort Rui had a good relationship with your aunt.

252
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,450
They were very close.

253
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,830
After I came here, why didn't you use your original face to see me?

254
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,690
When you arrived, you were suffering and needed help.

255
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,180
What is the point of me bring up these old matters again?

256
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,540
If I did not see An'er today,

257
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,070
I would have never revealed myself.

258
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,350
Father, why haven't you come to find me during all these years?

259
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,780
I did not know you were still alive, child.

260
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:00,340
If I knew, I would have gone to see you at the border a long time ago!

261
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,930
The news that came out back then was

262
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:07,820
that all thirty-one people in Eighth Royal Manor were dead. No survivors.

263
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,610
It was Mother who hid me away.

264
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,080
<i>- That way! <br> - An'er! Hurry! Hurry!</i>

265
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,320
<i>Hurry, hurry!</i>

266
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,710
<i>Hurry up!</i>

267
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,390
<i>An'er, you must not come out!</i>

268
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,260
<i>Do you hear me? You must not come out!</i>

269
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,120
<i> - All right? <br> - Mother, come inside with me! I will be afraid alone!</i>

270
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,750
<i>An'er, the person plotting against us have not found me yet,</i>

271
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,570
<i> so they will continue to search. </i>

272
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,520
<i>I will go lead them away.</i>

273
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,370
<i>You must not come out. I will definitely come to get you, all right?</i>

274
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,740
<i>Mother, you cannot lie to me!</i>

275
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,160
<i>I will definitely come back to get you.</i>

276
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,000
<i>- Mother! Mother! <br> - Go in. Hurry and go in!</i>

277
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,980
<i>Mother! Mother!</i>

278
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,930
Mother lied to me.

279
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,600
She said she would come back to get me.

280
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,650
But the one who opened the secret passageway was not her!

281
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,190
Who was it?

282
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,300
<i>Mother!</i>

283
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,030
<i>Mother...</i>

284
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,590
Later on, His Majesty took me to the Chu army.

285
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:41,660
My name was changed to Chu Xiuyuan and I grew up as a member of the Chu family.

286
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,810
Why would he arrange that?

287
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,940
He said it was to protect me.

288
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,420
Because they could never find the person who plotted against the Eighth Royal Manor.

289
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,420
He was afraid I'd be killed if that person found me.

290
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:04,570
This is why we have always wondered whether His Majesty was the real culprit or not.

291
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,790
His Majesty has also been investigating what happened back then.

292
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,590
He suspects it might have to do with

293
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,330
the case involving embezzlement of funds and abuse of power within the army that you were investigating.

294
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,440
Is he really investigating this matter?

295
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:23,370
Could it be that the culprit is not His Majesty?

296
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,480
Draft a decree.

297
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,110
Lord Yongning Chu Xiuming has always been heavily favored.

298
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,090
However, for his own personal reasons,

299
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,140
he secretly broke the criminal Shen Jin out of prison.

300
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,310
I, originally, did not want to kill him.

301
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,080
However, he refuses to repent.

302
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:58,920
He conspired with the corrupt official Liu Qi to raise an army and rebel.

303
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,880
If I continue to forgive him, Heaven and Earth will not tolerate it.

304
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,040
Order all the soldiers to arrest him.

305
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,450
If Chu Xiuming resists... kill him.

306
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,110
Yes.

307
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,330
Jin'er,

308
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,790
if I did not hear it with my own ears today,

309
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:25,090
I'm afraid you would have never told me, right?

310
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:32,460
I never imagined that in your heart, I am not worthy of your trust.

311
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,580
Jin'er, I just did not want you to be dragged into this.

312
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,610
If you did not tell me, did you think I would not be dragged into this?

313
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,020
My entire family is in prison.

314
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,210
I, myself, became a fugitive.

315
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,210
My unborn child

316
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:07,220
will face every day hiding and running for his life once he is born.

Do you dare to say

319
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:21,310
that has nothing to do with the matter that you do not want me dragged into?

320
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:33,250
Jin'er, all of that was not my original intention.

321
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,130
I just want you to be happy. I did not want you to worry.

That's right.

None of these were your original intentions, it is not your fault.

It is all my fault.

325
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,700
If I did not marry you back then,

326
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,710
perhaps all of this would not have happened.

327
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,970
I do not want to argue with you.

328

Do not think too much about it either, Wife.

I will arrange for you to see Jin'er.

All right! But it must be soon! Or else, I am afraid it will be too late.

N-Nothing. It's just... a small matter.

Well, I suppose it is not a small matter.

368

Now, the entire city is covered in your wanted posters.

His Majesty ordered to kill with no mercy.

375
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,950
Older Brother, you were the one helping His Majesty uncover the rebels,

376
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,420
yet this no longer makes sense.

377
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,330
You and Sister-in-Law cannot stay here for long either.

378
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,560
You should hurry and leave with Sister-in-Law.

379
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,950
Go back to the border first. After all, that is the Chu family's territory.

380
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,920
If that really doesn't work, then go to the Falcon Tribe.

00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,130
After all, Princess Ma Ya and Yuan'er can definitely keep you both safe.

382
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,190
It should not be like this.

383
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,070
What shouldn't be like this?

384
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,590
Because... taking Jin'er from prison

385
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,290
was a deal between His Majesty and I.

<i>Your Majesty, I have guarded the border for over ten years.</i>

<i>I gave it my all to resist the Falcon Tribe.</i>

<i>But you must promise me one thing.</i>

<i>Do you know that something major happened sixteen years ago?</i>

394
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,490
<i>Sixteen years ago, I was still a child.</i>

395
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,540
<i>How could I know about anything major that happened?</i>

396
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,100
<i>Chu Xiuming, stop acting like you are clueless!</i>

397
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,560
<i>Your wife, do you want to save her or not?</i>

398
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,360
<i>I do!</i>

399
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,530
<i>All right.</i>

00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,880
<i>Please be frank with me.</i>

<i>Sixteen years ago, the Eighth Royal Manor was destroyed by a fire.</i>

<i>No one knows what injured Eighth Prince.</i>

403
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:50,000
<i>His face was completely destroyed and his body ripped apart.</i>

404
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,450
<i>I have been continuously investigating this matter.</i>

405
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,750
<i>Now, I have some evidence.</i>

406
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,440
<i>What evidence?</i>

407
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,380
<i>Back then, Eighth Prince was investigating the embezzlement of military funds.</i>

408
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,200
<i>He mysteriously died before he found out who was behind it.</i>

409
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,320
<i> During these years, I have been investigating the matter according to Eighth Prince's clues. </i>

410
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,050
<i>The person behind it might already be aware.</i>

411
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,600
<i>In order to keep this secret, he might wait for an opportunity to strike at me.</i>

412
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,320
<i>Right now, I want you to lure him out.</i>

413
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,400
<i>How?</i>

414
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,770
<i> - By rebelling. <br> - Rebelling?!</i>

415
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:37,780
<i>If you commit treason, then the mastermind is bound to pander to you and respond.</i>

416
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,570
<i>- I... <br> - Do not worry!</i>

417
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,250
<i>The entire Rui Royal Manor will be safe.</i>

418
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:01,930
<i>Who do you think placed Xiuyuan into your family?</i>

419
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,790
Then this does not make sense!

420
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,310
Since this was an agreement between you and His Majesty

421
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,470
and you already lured out the rebels,

422
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,720
why does His Majesty still want to arrest you?

423
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,090
That Liu Qi does not have that great of abilities

424
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,300
to have harmed your entire family back then.

425
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,090
Someone must be behind him.

426
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,910
Now, no matter if it is for Jin'er's sake or mine,

427
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,930
or for what happened back then,

428
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,350
I must find that person behind all this.

429
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,140
Right now, Liu Qi is dead so we have nothing to go off of.

430
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,500
How are we going to investigate? From where should we start?

431
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,340
Uncle, you mentioned that rare object before.

432
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,360
The gold orb that can change shape?

433
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,670
Yes.

434
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,430
Uncle, where did you get that item from?

435
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:20,410
My ninth brother, who is the current emperor, gave it to me.

436
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,170
He said that someone gave it to him.

437
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,210
Let's stop guessing.

438
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,470
If we find the original owner of that rare object,

439
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,580
then perhaps the truth will be revealed.

440
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,780
But... it was so long ago, how do we investigate this?

441
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,060
Perhaps we can ask that elderly person.

If I captured you, how would I face my younger sister?

Are you just putting me in a difficult position?

456
