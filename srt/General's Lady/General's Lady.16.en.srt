I heard my royal father mention this before.

He said that back then, the crown prince was politically wise, recruit talented men, and listened to advice.

He certainly would've become a great emperor.

Also, your Chu family had accomplished many feats and had been loyal for many generations.

Everything I've told you today is a secret that you must guard well.

He'd better not implicate the rest of us!

76

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,750
The general's lady?

156
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,500
How amusing.

157
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,290
The whole capital knows

158
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,630
that your husband, Chu Xiuming, has committed a huge crime and thus was escorted back here to the capital.

159
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,750
Perhaps the "dragon" will be angered and he will lose his head. <br> <i>(T/N: dragon represents the emperor)</i>

160
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,260
Your little life is about to be taken away yet you're still here bluffing and blustering.

161
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,700
She thinks she flew up the branch and became a phoenix.

162
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,340
In the end, her true colors will show.

163
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,140
It seems that you have already forgotten what happened, Elder Sister Zi

164
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,570
Back then, if you didn't force me to get married, then perhaps the person who would die is you.

165
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,390
- You—! <br> - Elder Sister Zi.

166
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,640
If she insists on staying here at the Rui Royal Manor,

167
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,580
then seeing that we are sisters, we could reluctantly agree to it.

168
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,670
It's just... with your aptitude, you can only be a maidservant who does some

169
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,480
brainless errands.

170
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,720
That's right. Lately, it's been quite busy here at the manor.

171
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,630
I think our front yard hasn't been cleaned yet.

172
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,590
I wonder if Young Sister Jin... No!

173
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,500
...the general's lady has the time or not. <br> - You—

174
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,290
Since you want me to sweep the floor, then I'll just do it, Elder Sister Zi.

175
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,550
Good. Hurry up.

176
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,490
We're leaving.

177
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,780
These two people are such bullies.

178
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,450
Why should we listen to them?

179
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,570
They just want to boast in their temporary happiness, that's all. Don't mind them.

180
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,650
"Once a tiger comes down from the mountain, it's bullied by dogs." <br> <i>(T/N: when someone loses their power/influence, his subordinates insult him)</i>

181
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,700
Once the general returns, we'll teach them a lesson!

182
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,840
Keep watch here. I'm going to see Mother first.

183
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,340
Okay.

184
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,180
- Mother! <br> - Jin'er. <br> - Mother!

185
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,930
My Jin'er is back!

186
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,380
Let me take a look at you.

187
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,500
I heard that beyond the city walls, there are many hardships. <br> <i>(T/N: literal translation "the wind blows and the rain hits")</i>

188
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,960
I think my Jin'er has gotten thinner.

189
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,830
The general dotes on me just like you, Mother.

190
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,090
I am restricted in no way at the general's manor.

191
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,040
Everyone at the manor treats me very well. I have been very well.

192
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,890
That's good then. Seeing you and the general so in love with each other,

193
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,820
I am very happy.

194
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,130
My Jin'er finally doesn't have to suffer anymore.

195
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,230
Mother, has Royal Father kept his promise?

196
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,950
Did anyone mistreat you while I was gone?

197
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,300
I am very well. I am very well.

198
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,850
You don't need to worry about me.

199
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,500
Mother, there's no need to lie to me.

200
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,470
I just came in through the door and I saw Shen Zi and Sheng Jing those two brats moving things out from this room.

201
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,690
If Royal Father didn't keep his promise, I will ask for justice.

202
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,070
I am doing very well. You really do not need to worry about me.

203
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,760
But the general's situation,

204
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,590
what is going on?

205
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,040
Mother, I believe that the general will surely be fine.

206
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,040
He already went to go report back to the imperial court. He'll return very soon.

207
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,280
That's good then. That's good then.

208
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:22,430
I have been here praying for blessings for you and the general every day.

209
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,840
I hope you two can successfully get through these difficulties.

210
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,470
<i> - Has the courtyard been cleaned yet? <br> - What's the hurry?! </i>

211
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,080
Mother, wait for me for a moment.

212
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,020
I'll go for a bit and return.

213
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,740
<i>The criminal officer, Chu Xiuming, made false reports about the soldiers</i>

214
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,910
<i>and embezzled from military funds.</i>

215
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,790
The accounts of the Chu Family Army are right here.

216
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,080
The evidence is irrefutable!

217
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,870
Your Majesty, the general strictly and impartially enforces military discipline.

218
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,550
He treats soldiers as his brothers.

219
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:07,390
There is no way he would secretly take from the military funds.

220
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,550
I know that you old subordinates of Chu Xiuming, who followed him into battles for many years,

221
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,980
won't believe this.

222
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,760
I also am not willing to believe it.

223
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,480
I have always cherished your great general.

224
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,300
I appreciated him very much

225
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,150
and promoted him in terms of official position as well as social status. I rewarded him with a manor.

226
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,950
I have never mistreated you!

227
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,240
Unfortunately, it's hard to fathom human nature.

228
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,990
Chu Xiuming. Your "heart of a tiger and wolf" has been exposed. <br> <i>(T/N: heart of greed and cruelty)</i>

229
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,800
It makes me... feel great pain.

230
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,950
Your Majesty, every nation has its own laws and every household has its own rules.

231
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,110
As for Lord Yongning, you knew the laws yet violated them.

232
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,850
You're even more guilty.

233
00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:00,210
Chu Xiuming, right now, in front of His Majesty and hundreds of ministers,

234
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,530
what excuses do you possibly have?

235
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,320
These accounts were hidden by your Chu Family Army.

236
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,170
Does this general's seal belong to you, Chu Xiuming?

237
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,320
That's right.

238
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,130
The accounts are real. The seal is also real.

239
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,070
Since Chu Xiuming has admitted to his crimes, please deal with this impartially, Your Majesty.

240
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,150
All right. I'm going to remove your noble title

241
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,360
and take your military power.

242
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,530
You shall learn from this and be punished according to the laws of the imperial court.

243
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,610
What else do you have to say?

244
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,470
I have something to say.

245
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,940
Back then, when Shen Jin, that little bitch, married that Devil General,

246
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,100
I didn't think she would live to come back.

247
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,600
That's right. I don't even know where Shen Jin gets this luck.

248
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,670
Not only did she become the general's lady, she also caused you to still be unmarried.

249
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,030
We still haven't found you a great husband.

250
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,770
It is she who ruined my marriage fate.

251
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,420
Look at her poise today.

252
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,670
She even wanted to use the title of "general's lady" to rule over us

253
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,220
and step on us.

254
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,970
Her? As long as I, Shen Zi, am at Rui Royal Manor,

255
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,010
there's no place for Shen Jin!

256
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,450
Elder Sister. Royal Father is out today and hasn't seen that brat yet.

257
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,680
How about we put her in charge of tonight's feast?

258
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,270
What do you mean?

259
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,730
I grant you all special permission to rest for today.

260
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,650
But, Second Miss, who will prepare tonight's dinner for His Highness?

261
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,730
You don't need to worry about it. Naturally, someone will take care of it.

262
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,480
General always lectured us

263
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,640
saying that we must charge onto the battlefields and fight dauntlessly

264
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,800
in order to repay Your Majesty's grace.

265
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,530
The general always leads the charge on the battlefield.

266
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,420
At the end of the battle, he would be severely injured.

267
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,070
The Falcon Tribe's land is extremely hot.

268
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,520
His wound got infected, making it harder for it to heal.

269
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,270
He kept fighting in spite of his wound,

270
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,170
blood drenched his armor for seven days and seven nights.

271
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,380
Your Majesty! During the battle of Huangtugang.

272
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,290
my regiment was ambushed by the Falcon Tribe.

273
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,810
In order to not delay the battle and regain the lost lands,

274
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,000
the general, with an arrow pierced to his bone,

275
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,480
still led the Chu Family Army straight to Huanglong overnight and turned defeat into victory.

276
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,600
We recovered the lost lands.

277
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,130
As a general, defending my nation is what I should do.

278
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,280
However, the soldiers are like this

279
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,730
just like the generals.

280
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,660
They left their hometowns and shed their blood.

281
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,070
They devote their whole life to the nation and its people.

282
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,980
Your Majesty is benevolent. You are surely willing to treat the soldiers kindly.

283
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,900
Manifesting your great grace, you send military funds to my borders every year.

284
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,520
A soldier gets a few silver coins a year.

285
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,220
It's not even enough to repair their armor and to replenish the weapons.

286
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,750
Not to mention providing for their families.

287
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,370
I truly believe Your Majesty didn't know about this.

288
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,550
Is what you're saying true?

289
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,810
It's absolutely true.

290
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,340
Stand up and speak.

291
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

292
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,980
Royal father has gone out to take care of business and will return tonight.

293
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,690
Since you were married off, this is your first time coming home.

294
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,630
Then I'll give you an opportunity to show off.

295
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,800
You'll be in charge of tonight's dinner.

296
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,510
If something goes wrong

297
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,270
and you slight Royal Father,

298
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:45,440
then you shall bear all the responsibilities for any mistakes.

299
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,240
Don't blame us two for being ruthless.

300
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,750
Miss, you must not agree to it. This is definitely a trap.

301
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,260
Thanks for the opportunity, Elder Sister Zi.

302
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,430
You must treasure an opportunity like this.

303
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,100
You must do everything yourself.

304
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,570
Rou Rou, go sweep the backyard.

305
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,990
I can't leave My Lady alone here.

306
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,920
She can do it herself. There won't be any problems.

307
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,950
Rou Rou, it's fine. Go on.

308
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,540
- Miss— <br> - Since your Miss even said that, why don't you hurry along?

309
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,900
You guys–

310
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,040
I can walk by myself. Leave me alone!

311
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,530
Your Majesty not knowing about this must be because someone has been concealing this.

312
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,010
I beg you to investigate the military funds, Your Majesty.

313
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,100
Find the conspirators and punish them.

314
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,720
General Chu, right now, we are condemning you for false reports about the soldiers and taking from the military funds.

315
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,200
What connection does this have to what you've just said?

316
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,390
Of course, there's a connection.

317
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,940
In order to protect Your Majesty's intentions to love your generals, soldiers, and people,

318
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,040
I purposely falsely reported the number of soldiers so that military funds would double.

319
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,470
In the name of Your Majesty, I distributed the funds to all soldiers.

320
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,990
It exemplified Your Majesty's benevolence,

321
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:08,570
and inspired the soldiers to unite to protect Your Majesty's great rivers and land.

322
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,180
I express my gratitude for Your Majesty's imperial graciousness and benevolent integrity that extends across the whole country!

323
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,490
<i>I express my gratitude for Your Majesty's imperial graciousness and benevolent integrity that extends across the whole country!</i>

324
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:25,340
<i>I express my gratitude for Your Majesty's imperial graciousness and benevolent integrity that extends across the whole country!</i>

325
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Your actions are just what I want.

326
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,370
I have always governed the country with benevolent integrity.

327
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,010
The soldiers are more like the copper walls and iron bastions <i>(impregnable defense)</i> that protects our home,

328
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,990
they're supposed to be commended and rewarded.

329
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,920
General Chu has done very well on behalf of me.

330
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,950
You've done very well!

331
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,090
However, falsely reporting accounts was not appropriate.

332
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,330
From now on, everything that happens in the army

333
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,370
must all be reported back to the imperial court so I am aware

334
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,540
and to prevent people from saying that I'm incompetent.

335
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,040
No one dares to.

336
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,360
Your Majesty is a wise emperor, loved by all his people.

337
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,000
Since this matter has already been cleared up in the presence of everyone,

338
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,980
you must never bring this up again.

339
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,610
As for the issue regarding the military funds, I will personally attend to it.

340
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,750
<i>Your Majesty is wise!</i>

341
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,560
I implore Your Majesty to reward the general.

342
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,540
It will show Your Majesty's imperial graciousness,

343
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,990
and will also invigorate the passion of the soldiers at the border.

344
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,450
For the sake of upholding justice,

345
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,490
Lord Yongning, General Chu, has shown compassion towards the soldiers on my behalf.

346
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,850
He has done a meritorious service. I confer upon him the title of Great General of the Flying Cavalry.

347
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,560
However, as for the crime of falsely reporting about the soldiers,

348
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,880
he has shown inappropriateness and is wrong.

349
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,980
His military services will make up for this wrongdoing thus he shall not be rewarded nor punished.

350
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,350
I, Chu Xiuming, thank Your Majesty!

351
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,610
Today is the day Jing'er and General Chu Xiuming come to the manor,

352
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:04,080
why haven't I seen them yet at this late hour?

353
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,730
The general went to report to the imperial court and Jin'er has already arrived here at the manor.

354
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,320
Royal Father, this is the first time Younger Sister Jin has come back to the manor after being married off.

355
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,020
Today, she prepared dinner especially for us.

356
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,100
Prepared dinner? What time is it now?

357
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,750
How come she still hasn't set up dinner? She knows no rules.

358
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:24,060
Your Highness, don't be angry. She'll be here soon. She'll be here soon.

359
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,800
<i> - How is this acceptable behavior? <br> </i> - That brat, Jin, has messed up tonight.

360
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,030
Royal Father will definitely be mad.

361
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,110
Right now, Shen Jin's Devil General is in a critical situation at the imperial court.

362
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:38,280
Royal Father is even more evasive than before. We can use this chance to kick her out the door.

363
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,060
All of you have waited for a long time.

364
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,290
Royal Father, this is my first time coming home after getting married.

365
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,580
This is the Falcon Tribe's regional meal that I've prepared especially for you.

366
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,660
Younger Sister Jin, what's the meaning of this?

367
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,830
You brought a tray of raw meat. You also brought the stove.

368
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,650
Could it be that you want our Royal Father to look bad?

369
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,730
Royal Father, it wasn't my intention to cause trouble.

370
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,150
This is a special Falcon Tribe meal. You'll know once I cook it.

371
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:20,520
All right. Then, Jin'er, let us see you cook it.

372
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,530
<i>Royal Father, I have cut the beef, lamb, and chicken into small pieces</i>

373
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,690
<i>and skewered them onto red willow sticks. After that, they are roasted over charcoal.</i>

374
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,720
Then continuously flip. Continuously flip.

375
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,440
After the meat has been roasted evenly,

376
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,820
the color of the meat will let one know it's been cooked well and the oils and juices will drip.

377
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,690
That is when it's ready to be eaten.

378
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,510
Here.

379
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,180
This indeed smells very aromatic.

380
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,490
Jin'er, the thing you are sprinkling...

381
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:12,610
Royal Father, this is a special spice that I brought home from the Falcon Tribe.

382
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,520
This capital city surely doesn't have it.

383
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,410
It's done. It's done. Royal Father, hurry and give it a try.

384
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,500
It's done?

385
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,380
Be careful. It's hot, Royal Father.

386
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,820
This is the first time I've ever tasted a flavor like this.

387
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,310
It's delicious. There is such a delicacy in this world.

388
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,800
It's delicious, delicious.

389
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,710
Reporting to Your Highness. It's been some days since My Lady has been married.

390
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,410
She wasn't familiar with the people or places at the border.

391
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:10,080
She often missed her family at the manor especially you and Madam.

392
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,730
She was always on the lookout for fine goods

393
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,370
wanting to bring it home for everyone in the manor.

394
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,210
Good, good! Jin'er, you're so thoughtful. Hurry, hurry.

395
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,370
Make a few more for me to eat.

396
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,930
If Royal Father wants to eat it then I'll make it.

397
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,940
- Grill a skewer for your Mother, too. <br> - Okay.

398
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,830
Royal Father, I came back to the manor today

399
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,600
and saw that my mother has been living well.

400
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,260
I finally feel as if a great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

401
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,800
Thank you, Royal Father, for keeping the promise you made when I was being married off,

402
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,990
allowing Mother to be at ease at the manor.

403
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,780
Jin'er, I will definitely take good care of your mother.

404
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,930
Thank you, Your Highness.

405
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,250
I heard that General Chu Xiuming

406
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,750
was transferred back to the capital because he embezzled from the military funds.

407
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,010
I wonder what the implications are.

408
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,550
Royal Father, my husband has always been a straightforward and upright person.

409
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,320
There is definitely a misunderstanding. Royal Father, don't worry.

410
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,310
Good! That's good then.

411
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:19,360
Then let us all wait for our son-in-law to return to the manor then.

412
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,270
Hurry and let your mother try it.

413
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,120
This time, she luckily overcame this,

414
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,360
but I won't let her be so lucky next time.

415
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,840
- Here. <br> <i> - What do you plan to do, Elder Sister?</i>

416
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,000
It's so aromatic. It's so tasty.

417
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,720
- <i>I can't believe you could cook it this way. </i> <br> - Just wait and see.

418
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,540
Let's see how I humiliate her later on.

419
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,640
- Royal Father, do you want to learn? <br> - Your Highness, slow down.

420
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,810
Okay!

421
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,340
From now on, our Rui Royal Manor should make this often.

422
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,440
It's tasty and fun.

423
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,880
Royal Father, if you want to eat it then we can make it at any time.

424
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,430
Okay.

425
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,030
Su Su!

426
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,840
Rou Rou!

427
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,430
Su Su.

428
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,780
Rou Rou, I haven't seen you in a long time.

429
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,100
You've gotten more chubby again.

430
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,740
Miss said that this is fat from exhaustion.

431
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,930
It really makes my heart ache.

432
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,710
Su Su, when can we be stuck together all the time

433
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,470
and stay together while relying on each other?

434
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,710
Rou Rou, be patient. Once I've accomplished the general's secret task then I'll return to keep you company.

435
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,320
We'll listen to the wind, admire the rain, and moon gaze together.

436
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,290
Okay, I'll wait for you then.

437
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,210
Wait for me.

438
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,340
When is the next time that we'll meet then?

439
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,090
Rou Rou, I'm on a mission right now,

440
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,130
so I have to make adjustments according to the situation.

441
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,160
The time, date, and identity for our next meeting are all pending.

442
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,150
Identity?

443
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,240
Rou Rou, be careful and stay hidden. I have to leave now.

444
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,090
Take care!

445
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,760
Mother, you're always inside. You should come outside to walk more.

446
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,780
I especially instructed the kitchen to make some nourishing soup for you.

447
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,160
With you here by my side, I'm satisfied.

448
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,690
Elder Sister Jin, after eating your roasted meat, we both felt ill all night.

449
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,060
We were vomiting and had diarrhea.

450
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:56,090
There must have been a problem with your meat. Give us an explanation.

451
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
We all ate together last night.

452
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,520
Royal Father and my mother are both fine. Why was it only you two who fell ill?

453
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,470
Or did you two eat something else once you went back to your rooms?

454
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,130
Shen Jin! Don't make false accusations!

455
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,630
There's clearly a problem with your meat!

456
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,810
You must apologize to me right now!

457
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:20,670
Elder Sister Zi, don't be so worked up. If it was something I did wrong, I will admit it.

458
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,240
Why don't you two go see if Royal Father is all right?

459
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,410
Since you said there's nothing wrong with the meat, then why don't you let your mother try a bite?

460
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,310
Then you'll know.

461
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,150
This is rotten meat! If you don't get sick from eating this, then that would be strange!

462
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:47,900
It seems like there's a problem with your sense of smell, Elder Sister. How is this rotten meat?

463
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,300
Miss, there is no need to be worked up.

464
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,170
I'll just eat it.

465
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,040
Mother, you cannot eat it!

466
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,720
Shen Zi, what exactly are you trying to do?

467
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,930
You made me look bad yesterday. I must get some face back today.

468
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:12,710
You don't have to eat it but you must apologize to me right now!

469
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,240
You just want to see me eat this spoiled food, right?

470
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,160
I'll let you see me eat it then.

471
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,370
Jin'er! You can't! You cannot eat it!

472
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,300
Jin'er!

473
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,080
Jin'er!

474
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,020
Who are you? How dare you shout in my manor.

475
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:41,930
Lord Yongning, Chu Xiuming. Shen Jin's husband.

476
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,900
You are... Chu Xiuming?

477
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,340
Isn't Lord Yongning a devil general?

478
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,630
How is it that he looks like this?

479
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,610
He is my husband, Chu Xiuming, that is the absolute truth!

480
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:24,070
Who forced My Lady to eat this rotten meat?

481
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,480
She made that! And she was the one who wanted to eat it.

482
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,690
It has nothing to do with us.

483
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,500
If my wife becomes ill because she ate this rotten meat,

484
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,730
then I will definitely make you two pay!

485
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:45,080
General, why get so worked up? This isn't even our fault.

486
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,580
I will make my position clear today.

487
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,870
You are my wife's sisters. I can give you a little bit of face.

488
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:59,490
However, if My Lady is hurt, then don't blame me for being heartless.

489
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,810
Stop!

490
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,250
Take it away.

491
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,930
I, Chu Xiuming, greet you, Mother.

492
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,510
General, please quickly rise.

493
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,070
Your Highness.

494
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:14,180
Your Highness? Say something.

495
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:22,570
Virtuous son-in-law. This is my virtuous son-in-law?

496
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:29,950
Son-in-Law, you are the first to be conferred as "Great General of the Flying Cavalry" in this court.

497
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,100
This is a great matter that brings honor to the entire family.

498
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,890
What's more, my humble Rui Royal Manor is greatly honored by your presence.

499
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,480
Father-in-Law, you have over-praised me.

500
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,710
Look at this manner.

501
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,630
He is "a dragon and phoenix" among men. <br> <i>(T/N: Idiom - outstanding person)</i>

502
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,910
He's exactly like me when I was young!

503
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:57,920
You are right, Your Highness. Back then, you were also handsome and charismatic like this.

504
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,440
Listen to her!

505
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,270
Father-in-Law, you are exaggerating.

506
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:07,920
Actually, it's all thanks to My Lady's help in our daily life.

507
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,960
Jin'er, my precious daughter. I'm proud of you.

508
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,850
I am a fool. To have Jin'er is like three lifetimes worth of fortune.

509
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,470
Here, I thank Mother-in-Law.

510
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,900
There's no need for the formalities, General.

511
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,240
I would like to gift these to you two, Mother-in-Law and Father-in-Law.

512
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,740
You are very considerate, Son-in-Law.

513
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:43,250
I heard that His Majesty has started to build you a manor in the capital.

514
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,240
Since it is not finished yet,

515
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,910
why don't you stay here at the Rui Royal Manor for now?

516
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,630
This... I do not dare to decide on my own.

517
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,350
I should... I should ask for My Lady's opinion.

518
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,580
Then, what do you think, Jin'er?

519
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,320
I was originally from Rui Royal Manor. I can live here.

520
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,720
My precious daughter, you are indeed "the pearl in the palm of my hand!" <br> <i>(T/N: the apple of my eye or my beloved daughter)</i>

521
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,120
It's settled then!

522
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,390
Take a good look at my son-in-law!

523
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,430
Elder-Elder-Elder-Elder...

524
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,620
- Elder Sister, don't be angry! <br> - I'm so angry!

525
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,860
Shen Jin, that brat, is such a bully!

526
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,950
She actually made me look bad in public!

527
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:40,710
Relying on that Devil General, she is about to "ride on my shoulder!" <br> <i>(T/N: rule over me)</i>

528
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,400
This Chu Xiuming is a bit overbearing.

529
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,630
He's just a boorish idiot!

530
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,210
He fights and kills all day long. What's so great about him?

531
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:54,910
That's true. After all, he's a soldier.

532
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,040
It just so happens to be Royal Father's birthday in a few days. Eldest Sister and Eldest Brother-in-Law will come back.

533
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,240
At that time, I'll embarrass her properly!

534
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,960
I'll make that idiot general look bad!

535
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,500
Elder Sister, he's is a general after all.

536
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,350
If I can't physically beat him, then we'll use literature!

537
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,670
That idiot general probably doesn't recognize more than a few words.

538
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,860
What's so great about brute force?

539
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,770
Intelligence and education make a real gentleman!

540
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,890
When that time comes, I'll embarrass him properly!

541
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,030
Let's see what that brat, Shen Jin, can be pleased about then!

542

<i> Who got promoted at the Rui Royal Manor? <br> [Rui Royal Manor]</i>

543
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,960

544
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,420
<i>This time, he's being promoted to "Great General of Flying Cavalry."</i>

545

549
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,120
You're finally back!

550
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,990
Eldest Sister. Eldest Brother-in-law. I've continuously missed you and mother while I was at the border.

551
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,690
We're all doing well, you don't need to worry.

552
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,130
I just really missed you.

553
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,060
This must be your husband, Lord Yongning, General Chu.

554
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,920
Hello, Eldest Sister and Eldest Brother-in-Law.

555
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,190
We are all family. There's no need for formalities.

556
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,650
Let's hurry and go over there. Royal Father should be back.

557
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,560
- Let's go. <br> - Let's go.

558
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,630
It seems that this Chu Xiuming is not as easy to deal with as we thought.

559
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,080
He's averted these crises effortlessly and now he's become the Great General of the Flying Cavalry.

560
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,460
His Majesty wants to continue investigating the military funds.

561
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,030
My Lord, what should we do next?

562
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,550
Watch for an opportunity.
