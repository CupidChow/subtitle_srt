00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,160
Wake up.

20
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,910
Wake up, wake up!

21
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,590
What are you doing, Chu Xiuming?!

22
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,100
Are you taking advantage of me since I'm drunk?

23
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,890
What did you do to me? Tell me!

24
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,120
Don't misunderstand. You were drowning just now.

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,260
I was forced by the situation to do whatever it took to save you.

26
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,110
Who would know anyways?

27
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,040
No one else knows about the divorce letter you wrote me.

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,440
So what if you did anything to me?

29
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,950
Chu Xiuming, believe me when I say

30
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,580
that I am going to telling everyone everything once I get back to the barracks.

31
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,610
I want all the soldiers to know just what sort of person you are.

32
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,110
You–!

33
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,920
Can't you be like all the other ladies from respectable families

34
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,870
and be a little more reserved?

35
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,360
How am I not reserved?

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,740
I indeed don't behave like a lady from a respectable family. Sorry to disappoint.

37
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,650
Aren't you the one who forced me to be like this?

38
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,010
You're the one who caused me to be homeless.

39
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,490
I can't stay at the manor anymore, and now I can't stay at the barracks either.

40
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,260
Did you think I could just return to my parents' home once you wrote the divorce letter?

41
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,620
If my mother were to find out...

42
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,270
That's right.

43
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,850
How heartbroken would my mother be if she found out?

44
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,080
Then if my royal father found out, he would probably be very disappointed in me.

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,540
If my sisters knew about this,

46
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,360
they would just mock and bully me even more.

47
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,480
What would everyone in the manor think of me if they knew?

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,910
I've come such a long way to marry you.

49
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,990
You're the only person I can rely on,

50
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,120
but why are you always bullying me?

51
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,830
You said you would divorce me and then you did.

52
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,840
You should at least give me a reason.

53
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,780
Why?

54
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,070
The divorce letter is written, I won't take it back.

55
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,510
If you're afraid to return home,

56
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,170
I can accompany you there and personally explain the situation to your parents.

57
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,130
and personally explain the situation to your parents.

58
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,840
This entire matter was my fault.

59
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,780
It has nothing to do with you.

60
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,920
You're only saying this to pacify me.

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,070
Did you think I would believe you?

62
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,520
I, Chu Xiuming promise to accede to any request you make,

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,910
as long as I am able to fulfill it.

64
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,110
Are you serious?

65
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,650
Yes. I promise you.

66
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,750
It'll be dark soon.

67
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,660
We must return back to camp.

68
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,940
I can't move. I need you to piggyback me down the mountain.

69
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,000
All right.

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,040
General.

90
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,400
Even though Miss has been persistent this whole time and hasn't been able to adjust,

91
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
she isn't one to concede easily when she's bullied.

92
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,100
But then again, I'm not at her side this time around.

93
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,220
I wonder if she's doing all right.

94
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,370
How do I solve this worry? The only way is by eating my fill.

95
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,270
I should fill up my stomach before taking any action.

96
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,970
I just can't look after her anymore.

97
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,060
Aunt Qing Qiu. Are you making steamed buns?

98
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,350
Please hurry, please hurry.

99
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,020
How does this look like dough for making steamed buns?

100
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,330
I'm making longevity noodles for the General. 
 <i>(Longevity noodles (寿面) symbolise longevity and can always be found on the banquet table during important celebrations.)</i>

101
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,730
Longevity noodles? It's the General's birthday?

102
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,010
Of course. His birthday is on the 8th of this month.

103
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,460
The General isn't returning to the manor this year.

104
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,570
All the staff in the manor have to do their best,

105
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,690
so I decided to make some longevity noodles for him to bring back to the barracks.

106
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,660
The noodles will be brought back to the barracks?

107
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,760
Aunt Qing Qiu, I'll bring it to the barracks for you.

108
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,560
The way to the barracks is very bumpy. You're only a young lass, I'd feel sorry towards you.

109
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,040
What's there to be sorry for?

110
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,070
I'm quite thick-skinned and I'm not afraid. I'll go.

111
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,580
If that's the case...

112
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,840
Then let me thank you first.

113
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,110
Were you looking for me? What's the matter?

114
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,490
I'm... Hungry.

115
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,270
- I'll make whatever you wish to eat after I'm done with these longevity noodles. 
 - All right!

116
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,410
Aunt Qing Qiu, I'll go ahead and prepare the fire first.

117
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,340
Wonderful!

118
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,370
I'll finally be able to visit Miss!

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,470
Isn't this Chu Xiuming's tent?

120
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,870
I actually fell asleep here?

121
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,770
I'm... Sorry about yesterday. I'd had too much to drink.

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,410
It's hangover soup. Drink it up quickly.

123
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,010
It'll soothe your stomach.

124
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,140
Doesn't that mean everyone already knows that I'd gotten drunk last night?

125
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,610
Wouldn't they also find out that you'd covered up for me even though I'd violated martial law?

126
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,080
Don't worry. I especially boiled this for you myself.

127
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,850
No one found out.

128
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,910
Drink it. I'll be leaving now.

129
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,200
Where... Are you going?

130
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,060
The soldiers are going to do some farming on the fields today.

131
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,260
You should remain here and have a good rest.

132
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,980
Chu Xiuming...

133
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,400
-Rou Rou.
-Auntie Qing Qiu!

134
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,270
Here. There are forty mantou inside, take it.

135
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,770
Our Lady gets hungry easily.

136
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,750
During crucial times, it can help save her life!

137
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,090
You might choke our Miss to death!

138
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,030
Alright, Auntie Qing Qiu, fine. Choking to death is better than starving to death.

139
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,260
That's right, that's right.

140
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,960
Rou Rou. This is the cape I personally made.

141
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,780
The military camps are in a bad environment. I'm afraid Lady will get cold.

142
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,220
She can use this to fight the cold. To make she won't freeze to lose an arm or a leg.

143
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,600
Wearing a fur cape in this weather...?

144
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,750
A....alright.

145
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,660
Rou Rou. If Lady gets sick, she must take medicine!

146
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,880
Can she take medicine at will like this?

147
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
F-f-fine.

148
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,970
Having it is better than not.

149
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,270
The moon wax and wane, people faces disaster and good fortune.

150
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,340
My pitiful Lady!

151
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,540
Shut up! Miss isn't dead yet!

152
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,000
Having to go to war, I'm afraid she will...!

153
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,960
Auntie Qing Qiu!

154
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,700
-Good luck to her, good luck to her!
-Good luck!

155
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,200
- Rou Rou! 
 - What is it?

156
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,630
Rou Rou!

157
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,110
Look, you have so much stuff. Take me with you!

158
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,160
I can help you carry things and take care of Lady. Okay?

159
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,890
This wouldn't be very proper, Xiao Cong.

160
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,330
If we both leave, Auntie Qing Qiu can't keep up with the manor.

161
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,480
It won't be good if General finds out.

162
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,800
Take me with you! I just want to see him...

163
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
See who?

164
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,230
Her Ladyship! Of course, it's Her Ladyship.

165
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,920
Don't worry! I will take good care of our Miss!

166
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,260
- I. 
 - Let's go!

167
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,980
Hurry and go back! Go on!

168
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,010
My Lieutenant General... this is the 17th day since you left the manor!

169
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,100
I miss you so much!

170
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,140
My heart feels awful!

171
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,070
I would turn into the Amah Rock, no matter the blowing wind or the burning sun,

172
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,230
I would always wait for you to come back here.

173
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,900
Lieutenant General! When will you come back?

174
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,380
Miss! Miss!

175
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,740
-Miss!
-Rou Rou!

176
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,140
I miss you so much! I'm so glad you're still alive!

177
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,690
I came to join the army, not to die! Don't curse me!

178
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,140
Look! Aren't I doing just fine?

179
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,100
Rou Rou, why did you come here?

180
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,300
I used the excuse of bringing longevity noodles to the General to bring you supplies!

181
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,080
Longevity noodles? It's the General's birthday?

182
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,140
It's today. You didn't know?

183
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,040
Rou Rou. You came just in time!

184
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,130
It's the General's birthday! We must celebrate it properly!

185
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,980
Miss. You've only been here for a few days.

186
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,410
Why has your mood completely changed? That's not what you said when you came here.

187
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:16,340
This, suddenly becoming a lackey! And even preparing a birthday gift for the general.

188
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,430
Rou Rou! You weren't here.

189
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,880
You really don't know.

190
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,170
This devil... is already deeply in love with me!

191
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,970
It's just, he has to keep face and won't tell me directly!

192
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,620
Really?

193
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,300
Since he loves me so much, I can only help him out and give him a chance!

194
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,240
At the same time, I will let him know how good I am to him!

195
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,900
But...in the  military camp,

196
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,570
I can't make a very proper birthday gift.

197
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,290
Hey, Bao Zitou!

198
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,370
Bao Zitou!

199
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,250
This person...!

200
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,090
Bao Zitou! Is this just to scare people?

201
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,450
Your blade is much lighter than the General's sword! Even I can pick it up!

202
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,190
Bao Zitou!

203
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,180
L-l-lady!

204
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,960
Let me ask you. Everyone is working outside.

205
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,160
Why are you sleeping here?

206
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,780
I-i-i-i-i didn't fall asleep, Lady. General told me to watch the camp.

207
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,660
Fine. I need something from you.

208
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,070
Today, I need to prepare for the General's birthday. I need your help for something.

209
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,170
Go ahead, Lady.

210
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,040
Can you let me borrow some military explosives?

211
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,630
In Rui Royal Manor, I once saw a method of making fireworks with explosives.

212
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,300
I want to make beautiful fireworks for the General's birthday!

213
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,290
You must not, you must not, Lady!

214
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,120
Military explosives are given by the royal court! It is a terrible crime to use it for personal reasons!

215
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,340
Even if the General asked me for it, I wouldn't give it to him.

216
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,760
Not just the General, even if my own father came over, I wouldn't agree.

217
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,070
It's fine, why are you bringing up your father?

218
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,530
- I... 
 -Go back to sleep!

219
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,250
I didn't fall asleep. I'm watching the camp.

220
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,170
Oh. Go ahead.

221
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,040
Hey! No! I...

222
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,290
Here.

223
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,120
Thank you Lady.

224
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,000
Is this just to scare people?

225
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,490
Lieutenant General!

226
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,240
Please go ahead, Lady.

227
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,160
I have a request for you. Today is the General's birthday.

228
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,830
I want to prepare a fancy banquet for him, and give him a surprise!

229
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,200
Lady, I already heard from Bao Zitou you want to borrow some military explosives.

230
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,700
I cannot help you. Besides, a banquet is too wasteful.

231
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,910
Given the current military supplies, I'm afraid it can't be done.

232
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,530
Alright then.

233
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,100
Then is there anything else that can surprise the General?

234
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,390
General usually doesn't like to celebrate his birthday.

235
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,750
Lady, I think your presence here this year is his best birthday surprise.

236
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,640
Then I will leave now.

237
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,850
Miss...it seems like Lieutenant General won't help us either.

238
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,770
What do we do?

239
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,820
Just now, Lieutenant General said

240
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,010
my presence here this year is the General's best surprise.

241
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,240
Why didn't I think of that? <i>I</i> am the General's surprise!

242
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,070
What do you mean?

243
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,360
Miss, here, take it in yourself.

244
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,930
Jiayou!

245
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,870
General, please eat some noodles.

246
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,770
These are the longevity noodles I made just for you.

247
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,540
Thank you.

248
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,670
Why aren't you eating?

249
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,090
I'm not hungry yet. I'll eat it when I'm hungry.

250
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,460
It won't taste good if it gets cold.

251
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,450
You must eat it while it's hot. Hurry and eat!

252
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,580
Today is your birthday. I originally prepared a gift for you.

253
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,240
But I wasn't successful.

254
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,080
There's only this bowl of noodles now. Please be understanding.

255
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,940
You should go back to the manor.

256
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,640
General, why do you say that?

257
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,070
You're only adding to our troubles in the military camp.

258
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,810
You're making things difficult for everyone.

259
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,940
You dare cause anger, but don't dare speaking.

260
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,860
Just what did I do?

261
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,390
To who did I add troubles?

262
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,000
The military camp is full of men.

263
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,500
Your arrival created inconveniences for everyone here!

264
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,730
It's impossible to treat everyone without discrimination in training because of you!

265
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,260
Your acts in the lake yesterday were ridiculous enough!

266
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,850
But today!

267
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,970
You wanted to use military explosives for personal use, and almost committed a grave crime!

268
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:31,390
If I let you continue like this, the soldiers' hearts will be led astray, and I-!

269
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,790
My reputation amongst the troops will be completely destroyed.

270
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,100
Did I do something to offend the heavens?

271
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,750
To make you say such things about me.

272
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,730
After I came here, I never used my identity as your wife.

273
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,890
Just like the rest of them, I fought at the head of my troops.

274
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,170
Yes, they did help me, but

275
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,840
Why must you push all faults onto me?

276
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,280
Besides, borrowing a little bit of explosives from Bao Zitou

277
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,220
was just for celebrating your birthday!

278
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,420
Fine, even if I was ridiculous, I wasn't successful!

279
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,760
Thankfully Bao Zitou didn't let you succeed!

280
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,440
If he really let you take explosives, that would be a crime that offended the heavens!

281
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,340
Not only you! Everyone would be punished because of you!

282
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,690
You've thrown the military camp into chaos.

283
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,720
You've broken military rules, not caring about what's important, and up until now!

284
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,110
You still don't know you have to change?

285
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,120
You say that I threw the camp into chaos.

286
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,560
Alright.

287
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,780
I will take responsibility for everything. It has nothing to do with anyone else.

288
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,820
You don't need to look for any other reasons.

289
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,680
Ever since I entered the manor, you've always hated me!

290
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,700
I am worth nothing in your heart!

291
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,370
In the military camp, there are no family relations.

292
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,670
It's useless even if you cry and sob!

293
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,080
I thought I could touch you, this immovable rock.

294
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,430
But I never imagined that your heart is as hard as steel.

295
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,990
I was wrong about you!

296

Chu Xiuming. The biggest mistake I made,

299
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,560
was getting to know you, this cold and heartless devil!

303
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,300
Starting from today,

304
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,850

Chu Xiuming, I am the one divorcing you, not the other way around!

404
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,670
Still he made the second miss of the Rui Royal Manor run away.

Even if it's hard to reconcile them,

417
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,770
This is only an excuse to use authority and look out for my negligence.

418
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,650
This means they don't trust us.

419
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,560
