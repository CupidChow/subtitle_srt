<i>[Episode 25]</i>

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,950
My Lady, please don't be like this.

20
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,280
Otherwise, I'll feel even more terrible.

21
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,640
But I've never left your side before.

22
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,770
I will definitely return safely and soundly.

23
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,650
Think about it. The journey to the border's pass will be very long.

24
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,720
You won't be able to handle the difficult trip in your current condition.

25
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,830
But I'll really miss Xiao Cong, Qing Qiu, and the others.

26
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,990
And all those delicious foods from the border's pass.

27
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,400
I don't know what's wrong with me lately.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,060
I'm always feeling so melancholy.

29
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,800
It might be because you're pregnant.

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,580
Your moods are fluctuating constantly.

31
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,460
You're soon to be a mother, after all.

32
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,570
I really should be feeling more jubilant about your trip.

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,340
Is it because no one will nag at you about what you can't do anymore?

34
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,890
But I feel really upset right now!

35
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,100
Husband, don't come back too soon.

36
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,880
What?

37
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,390
I still want to take a bite out of you.

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,830
Husband...

39
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,960
Husband... Husband!

40
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,340
- What's the matter? <br> - Mother! Where's my husband?

41
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,300
Son-in-Law has entered the palace already.

42
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,450
I thought he'd left without saying goodbye.

43
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,260
- How could he have done that? Silly child. <br> - He scared me to death.

44
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,270
Go and get cleaned up. Let's go.

45
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,600
Lord Yongning is returning to the border's pass once again.

46
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,070
May you obtain instant success.

47
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,860
Yes.

48
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,380
Your Majesty, the State Treasury is empty.

49
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,550
After resolving the previous conflict at the frontier fortress,

50
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,920
we'd already done our best by sending the military supply wagons over.

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,690
We really cannot afford to fork out much anymore.

52
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,640
Then, how much more can we withdraw?

53
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,170
There isn't much left after we sent the disaster relief fund to Shu. <i>(T/N Shu area is today's Sichuan province)</i>

54
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,620
Are you saying our men should starve while they go to battle?

55
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,390
Those are merely the soldiers who are left from the previous battle.

56
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,540
And besides, Deputy General will still be there defending the frontier fortress.

57
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,520
This subject feels there is no need for Lord Yongning to journey there.

58
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,790
If the palace sends someone to specifically battle them,

59
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,960
then it would appear as if the court attaches too much importance to this matter.

60
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,430
It'll seem like we're making a big deal out of a minor situation.

61
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,550
Besides, the funds from the State Treasury have all been used up. We really can't afford it.

62
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,030
Lord Yongning, what are your thoughts on this?

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,170
This subject will obey all of Your Majesty's commands.

<i>General!</i>

90
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,160
General, are you the only one who returned?

91
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,730
What's the matter?

92
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,830
Did you expect that I would bring soldiers with me from the capital to suppress the Falcon Tribe?

93
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:57,420
Or are you trying to say that the Chu Army is not as good as it was before my absence?

94
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,160
Of course, that is not the case.

95
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,830
Then quickly update me on the military matters so I can formulate a strategy for the battle.

96
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,380
Yes.

97
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,030
In the beginning, there was only a small rebel army emerging from the Falcon Tribe.

98
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,830
They used to be small in strength, but recently, a few factions have banded together

99
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,700
and various stragglers have been joining that army in rapid succession.

100
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,950
Their military power has increased greatly.

101
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,500
What about the chief of the Falcon Tribe?

102
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,690
Princess Ma Ya was the one who requested our aid this time.

103
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,420
She says the goal of the rebel army is to wrest control of the political power within the Falcon Tribe.

104
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,550
Oh, by the way!

105
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,160
Princess Ma Ya has sent someone to inquire if Her Ladyship has returned?

106
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,470
Is it you or the princess who wishes to know?

107
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,960
Of course, it's the princess who wishes to know.

108
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,760
Actually, we really miss Her Ladyship as well.

109
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,290
Her Ladyship is with child, so it's inconvenient for her to travel far.

110
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,950
She will return once she has given birth.

111
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,470
Is that true?

112
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,780
Congratulations, General!

113
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,130
I can finally give Xiao Cong an explanation now.

114
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,060
Xiao Cong?

115
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,970
I will tell everyone the good news regarding Her Ladyship's pregnancy first,

116
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,680
so that they all can be in a cheerful mood. So they can all be in a cheerful mood...

117
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,030
Ever since the news of your pregnancy has been announced, everyone in the Rui Royal Manor,

118
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,170
the high-ranking officials, and members of the aristocracy,

119
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,070
and the very distant relatives have almost broken down the doors trying to congratulate you.

120
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,270
Our general really does have a good amount of prestige.

121
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,070
Look at all these snobs.

122
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,790
They're only behaving in this manner because I'm the Great General Lord Yongning's Lady Wife.

123
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,290
They're all trying to seek profit by family ties and benefit at the expense of others.

124
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,400
We didn't even receive a single needle from them

125
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,130
back when my mother and I were in dire straits.

126
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,150
That's true.

127
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,820
How's business at the fabric store these days?

128
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,710
I've sent someone to keep an eye on it. If you're still uneasy about it, then I'll go there myself.

129
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,800
Let's both go and take a look.

130
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,050
You're thinking too much.

131
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,090
The general has already said His Lady has to be well taken care of inside the manor.

132
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,860
Nothing will happen to you if you secretly escape, but I will be the one who will suffer a calamity.

133
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,620
The general is not even here. You should be listening to me instead.

134
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,490
Whose servant girl are you, anyway?

135
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,650
Why are you starting to sound more and more like the Great Demon King?

136
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,550
Whoever spares my life will be my master.

137
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,260
<i>Jin'er!</i>

138
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,360
Elder Sister Ruonan!

139
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,160
Slowly.

140
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,480
- How have you been lately? <br> - Ruonan!

141
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,650
I've been bored out of my mind for the past two weeks!

142
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,670
I have nothing to do all day! All I've been doing is eating, eating, and more eating.

143
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,280
Look! Haven't I gained weight?

144
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,170
You're pregnant. It's only natural for you to gain a little weight.

145
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,250
- Is that so? <br> - Of course.

146
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,350
Rou Rou, why are you just standing there?

147
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,580
Quickly go and brew a good pot of tea for Elder Sister Ruonan to drink.

148
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,190
You really have no tact at all.

149
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,870
Did you have some free time today to visit me?

150
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,770
I'd just received the armed escort and tidied all the new fabrics away

151
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,290
when I thought of you and decided to come and visit you.

152
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,750
I knew you must be bored, so I brought this girl with me to dispel your boredom.

153
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,970
Lady Wife of the General, I wish you propitious good health.

154
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,500
Little girl, you're so well-behaved.

155
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,110
This thing is adorable.

156
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,440
What is it called?

157
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,430
I should plant some in my garden soon.

158
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,510
I'm not very familiar with things related to flora.

159
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,620
The child probably picked them at random along the mountain path.

160
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,070
We have lots of these plants in my village.

161
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,060
Is that so? Then I'll have to go there and take a look.

162
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,490
Ruonan, take me there.

163
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,950
How am I going to explain myself to the general if I take you out of the manor?

164
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,580
The general isn't here! No one's here except for me.

165
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,090
All right. Let's go, then.

166
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,340
- This is great! Quickly, let's go, let's go, let's go. <br> - Not so fast.

167
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,410
- Hurry up! <br> - Let's go.

168
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,530
Miss!

169
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,290
Be careful.

170
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,850
It's here. There are flowers here.

171
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,590
It looks like the flower season is over. I came too late.

172
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,600
Then next time, I'll tell you earlier so you can come and see them.

173
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,570
That is...

174
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,790
He is Uncle Hua. He planted all of these flowers.

175
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,640
Sister Ruonan, why don't you take me to the textile store?

176
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,780
I haven't gone there for a while. I keep thinking about it!

177
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,630
Let's go.

178
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,840
<i>[Jin'er Textile Shop]</i>

179
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,560
Let me tell you! To every lady who came to visit the child in my belly,

180
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,120
I mentioned my shop!

181
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,520
I never imagined they'd all come to buy fabric!

182
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,470
I was wondering why you had so many customers! So that's what you did!

183
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:08,240
Your business in the capital is lively and flourishing.

184
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,270
My business is doing well, but I'm always at home.

185
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,790
How would I have time to manage it?

186
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,480
Ruonan, why don't you watch it for me? I'll share the profits with you!

187
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,240
What are you saying? It's your money. I can't take it.

188
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,750
What are you saying? We're going to be one family soon!

189
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,550
You and Xiuyuan can become one, so our shops can also do the same!

190
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,990
Let us obtain the palace's order together!

191
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,630
We'll have lots of businesses in the future!

192
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,850
Besides, aren't you preparing to open a second shop?

193
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,320
Your explanation does make some sense.

194
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,660
Sister-in-Law. Miss Ruonan.

195
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,300
Xiuyuan?

196
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,440
You don't focus on your own work.

197
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,100
Instead, you came over to the textile shop.

198
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,940
Be careful, I might report you to the general when he gets back.

199
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,510
Sister-in-Law, spare me! I'll leave after I have a cup of tea.

200
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,360
Didn't Brother forbid you from going outside? What are you doing here?

201
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,650
Hey! I have official matters!

202
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,450
General told me to be good and stay at home.

203
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,080
There's no one to care for the shop's business!

204
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,660
So, I decided

205
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,100
that Jin'er Textile Shop and Ruonan Textile shop will merge into one.

206
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,840
This way, it can solve my worries about the shop.

207
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,170
And my shop can also be expanded under Ruonan's watch!

208
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,110
Sister-in-Law, you mean you want to merge the shops?

209
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,780
- Ruonan will look after both? <br> - Right.

210
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,800
Sister-in-Law, you worked so hard for the textile shop.

211
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,530
Is it really okay to hand it over to another person?

212
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,310
How can Ruonan count as "another"?

213
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,040
She's your future wife!

214
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,970
Then, won't that make Ruonan even busier?

215
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,460
No one is asking for your opinion!

216
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,730
Ruonan, what do you think?

217
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,640
How could I refuse Little Sister Jin'er's request?

218
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,580
Then once things are settled, I'll come let you know!

219
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,740
This is great!

220
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,930
You only stopped by for some tea, right?

221
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,250
You're done drinking, you can go now.

222
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,150
Sister-in-Law, I'm not done yet.

223
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,960
I'll stay with Miss Ruonan for a little while longer.

224
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,570
Miss Ruonan.

225
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,470
Mother! Don't! Don't! Mother, I was wrong!

226
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,410
I won't do it again, I'll be good from now on!

227
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,000
Enough, enough. I'll deal with you once I get back.

228
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Come with me to Rui Royal Manor.

229
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,690
- Is it that serious? <br> - Come on.

230
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,730
A girl came here with this letter in hand. <br> <i>[To my wife, Jin'er...]</i>

231
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,090
She said it was arranged by a court official.

232
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,480
She also said Lord Yongning has already taken her in. <br> <i>(T/N: Meaning he's slept with her and has taken her as a concubine.)</i>

233
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,590
And he told her Lady Yongning will take care of her if she came with his letter.

234
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:01,770
This girl says she is pregnant with Lord Yongning's child.

235
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,360
Where is that girl?

236
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,550
Bring her in!

237
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,970
Jin'er.

238
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,110
It's all right, Mother.

239
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,490
If my daughter is not happy about this, we can find a place for her in the village.

240
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,570
I believe Son-in-Law will not argue with you over this girl.

241
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,520
Don't worry, Royal Father.

242
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,100
You're pregnant, too?

243
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,400
Greetings, Lady Yongning.

244
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,570
Since you are pregnant, don't kneel.

245
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,680
Thank you, My Lady.

246
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,130
I'll ask you a few questions.

247
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,860
If you dare lie, I'll have someone flog you!

248
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,700
My Royal Father and Consort Mother are both here.

249
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,690
My husband is not here,

250
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,090
but I have plenty of backing.

251
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:11,220
Jin'er, don't worry. I will definitely get justice for you.

252
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,650
I do not dare to keep any secrets.

253
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,860
You're really pregnant?

254
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,130
If you do not believe me, you can summon a physician.

255
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,980
Then it looks like it's true. Then you cannot be flogged.

256
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,870
So what if she's pregnant?

257
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,890
Royal Father, the child is innocent.

258
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,040
My Jin'er's heart is too kind.

259
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,830
That's why these nobodies all dare to come here.

260
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,060
Look at her.

261
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,460
She's clearly not a proper girl.

262
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,310
If I had a choice,

263
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,310
no one would be willing to be like this!

264
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,520
Originally, I was from a good family, too!

265
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,020
My father was a scholar, too!

266
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,660
But who would have imagined, with one natural disaster...!

267
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,350
Do you want to drink some water before you continue?

268
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,070
There's no need, My Lady.

269
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,090
I was too emotional. Please be understanding.

270
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,310
The letter told you to find Lady Yongning.

271
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,520
- Right? <br> - Yes.

272
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,180
Then you are from the capital?

273
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:39,890
I am not from the capital. This is my first time here.

274
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,660
Then, to find Lady Yongning...

275
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,740
why did you come to Rui Royal Manor?

276
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,020
Why didn't you go to Lord Yongning's manor?

277
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,860
I heard Lady Yongning was at Rui Royal Manor,

278
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,670
- so that's why I came here. <br> - Oh?

279
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,630
I don't understand what you were thinking.

280
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,980
But because you knew I was at my maternal home

281
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,680
that's why you came to Rui Royal Manor, right?

282
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,550
Yes.

283
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,310
My Lady,

284
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,530
- then you sure are stupid! <br> - Why is Jin'er saying that?

285
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,020
If you really are carrying my husband's child,

286
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,580
did you come here hoping my parents would get justice for you?

287
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,090
Since my husband slept with you,

288
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,910
then do you remember

289
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,430
that there's a birthmark on my husband's left hip?

290
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:48,130
The light was off then, I couldn't see clearly.

291
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,150
I could only see part of him.

292
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,610
Who told you to come here? Tell me.

293
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

294
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,070
My husband doesn't have a birthmark, I was lying to you!

295
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,890
How dare you! Do you think my Rui Royal Manor is nothing?

296
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,840
Royal Father, please be calm. Let her explain.

297
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,700
Miss, if you tell me,

298
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,830
I will capture the person who ordered you and send that person to be flogged at the magistrate's office.

299
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,530
If you don't tell me, I won't flog you.

300
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:32,270
I'll send you to the magistrate and tell him you stole things in the Royal Manor!

301
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,980
I really don't know who it is!

302
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,420
Looks like she won't tell us who is behind this.

303
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,130
Why don't we send her straight to the magistrate?

304
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,360
Perhaps the people there will have a way to make her speak the truth?

305
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,470
I really don't know!

306
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,160
I originally became pregnant with a customer's child and was about to abort it!

307
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,730
But someone bought me from the brothel at the last minute!

308
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,280
That person had the deed to my body, I had to listen to him!

309
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,270
My Lady!

310
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,600
How cruel!

311
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,860
Thankfully, our Jin has a good temper.

312
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,880
She could've been emotionally distraught, and it would've affected her baby!

313
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,570
Servants! Bring the painter here!

314
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,300
Draw the person she is talking about!

315
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,780
Hurry and leave. After all, you are still pregnant.

316
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,480
Did His Lordship have any other things to say?

317
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,480
It looks like it is time to make a move.

318
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,960
Who hates my Jin'er so much?

319
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,900
These are tough tactics,

320
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,960
but to a person who just became pregnant and doesn't have a husband by her side,

321
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,150
it is very useful.

322
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,820
Mother, don't worry. Didn't I tell you?

323
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,570
My husband wouldn't fall for people like that.

324
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,220
That's right! General wouldn't like those low-class girls.

325
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,130
Seeing how good your relationship is, I'm at ease.

326
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,590
That's right, Jin'er.

327
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,850
Who do you think was behind today's incident?

328
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,930
Jing'er, look. Do you know her?

329
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,230
It's... not very clear.

330
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,070
Tell the truth!

331
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,460
It looks like... Auntie Liu from Sister Zi's room.

332
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,150
I think it looks like Auntie Liu, too.

333
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,700
Because Auntie Liu has a mole by her eyebrow.

334
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,060
It's a bit lower, near her brow.

335
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,380
How ridiculous!

336
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,440
Such an embarrassing thing happened in Rui Royal Manor!

337
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,560
If anything had really happened to Jin'er,

338
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,950
would Chu Xiuming have spared us all?

339
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,240
As the royal consort, this is your fault! <br> <i>(T/N: Consort is responsible for domestic matters.)</i>

340
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,360
Jing'er!

341
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,350
Is this just because of that one slap from Zi'er? Is it worth it?

342
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,600
Besides, there's no scar on your face.

343
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,970
If this incident really brings shame to the royal manor,

344
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,560
do not blame me for being cruel.

345
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,090
I know.

346
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,080
You may leave.

347
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,060
<i>Good!</i>

348
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,880

349
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,600

350
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,780

<i>[Jǐnxiù Huázhāng Textile Shop]</i>

352
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,440
<i>Good!</i>

353
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,950
From today on, Jin'er Textile Shop and Ruonan Textile Shop

354
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,720
will become Jǐnxiù Huázhāng Textile Shop.

355
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,360
There will be a ten percent discount on the new fabrics today.

356
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,520
I hope everyone can come and support us!

357
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,090
Please come and support us!

00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,860
Sister Jin!

361
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,870
Congratulations on your new shop!

362
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,520
Royal Father told us to bring congratulatory gifts!

363
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,100
If you two create more trouble today,

364
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,430
when General comes back, you will both lose an arm!

365
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,580
Little Sister Jin, I haven't said a single word.

366
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,060
I didn't offend you.

367
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,410
What counts as offending?

368
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,490
I accept your goodwill.

369
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,470
Forget about these gifts.

370
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,940
If anything happens to the general's child in my belly,

371
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,930
other people, not knowing better, might think there was a problem with the gifts!

372
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,090
You Shen Jin! You don't have to accept them!

373
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,190
I only came out of respect for Father!

374
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,850
Let's go!

375
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,020
That brat! She became more capable in a few days! <br> <i>[Yi Huan Bridge]</i>

376
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,170
I haven't even gotten back at her for what happened last time!

377
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,960
I came here to make peace with her and she even dares to mock me.

378
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,050
Sister Zi!

379
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,990
I never imagined Shen Jin would really become a phoenix. <br><i> (T/N: become someone of great importance)</i>

380
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,530
Every official in the capital thinks highly of her now.

381
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:05,460
All of the noble first ladies are rushing to invite her to their homes for a visit! <i> (T/N: "official first wives" with authority)</i>

382
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,250
Say, Chu Xiuming really is capable.

383
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,960
He not only has earned great merit in war, but in a short period of time,

384
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,290
he has obtained all the scholarly officials' approval, too!

385
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,960
He really has become the most famous person in the capital!

386
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,190
What's so great about that?

387
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,260
Let's see how long he can be arrogant for!

388
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,550
Older Sister, I heard that Shen Jin's store is making a fortune, too.

389
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,960
Last time, her fabrics sold out by noon.

390
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,630
There's also a continuous flow of people from outside the city who want to buy them.

391
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,560
Even though we are all from the Rui Royal Manor,

392
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,470
she married into the general's manor and earns money on her own.

393
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,950
I really do envy her a little.

394
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,450
What's there to envy?

395
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,340
Sister, we are still unmarried.

396
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,820
But who knows?

397
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,540
If we get married and merely sit at home, eating away at our resources,

398
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,690
only living off of our dowries,

399
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,490
and needing our husband's permission for everything...

400
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,850
That must feel awful.

401
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,090
What? Even you are laughing at me that I can't get married?

402
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,060
Sister, what are you saying?

403
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,680
I think this is unfair to you!

404
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,890
This marriage was originally yours, right?

405
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,700
Due to a freak accident, Shen Jin took your place instead.

406
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,050
She got the greatest advantage!

407
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,560
Chu Xiuming should be your husband.

408
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,350
The lady of the general's manor should be you.

409
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:39,530
If you were the lady of the general's manor today,

410
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,730
where would Shen Jin even be?

411
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,640
I think even General would have to show you some respect.

412
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:52,720
That's right. I should have been the general's lady!

413
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,030
<i>[Yi Huan Bridge]</i>

414
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,850
Even the wife this Great General married is quite shrewd.

415
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,060
These two lovers.

416
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:08,670
One holds military power and one holds monetary power.

417
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,670
Could they be

418
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,550
preparing to take the empire from Your Majesty?

419
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,490
You are worrying too much.

420
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,920
How much money can a textile shop earn?

421
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,400
Your Majesty, a textile shop is not a small business.

422
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,720
All of the royal palace's textiles are from this shop.

423
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,920
All the fabric comes from the general's lady.

424
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,040
Oh? Is that so?

425
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:45,410
Lord Yongning's little wife has done a great job with her business.

426
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,690
All the money has entered the general's manor.

427
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:56,300
One day, won't it become easier to buy horses and soldiers?

428
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,120
Your Majesty,

429
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,570
I believe this woman is also problematic.

430
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,480
Shen Jin is the second daughter of Rui Royal Manor.

431
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,470
I was the one who arranged this marriage.

432
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,860
I have not seen Prince Rui for a while.

433
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,330
- Eunuch Li. <br> - Here.

434
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,440
I will invite Prince Rui and his family for a feast tomorrow

435
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,920
to congratulate the general's lady on her pregnancy.

436
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,420
Yes.

437
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,860
<i>Fight! Fight!</i>

438
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,760
Even His Majesty is going to celebrate Shen Jin, too.

439
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,840
He told our family to attend the banquet, too.

440
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,020
How amazing.

441
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,080
It's because she's the general's lady.

442
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,870
If she was just a little daughter from the family, who would care?

443
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,040
That's true.

444
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,110
But if the emperor threw a feast just for you today,

445
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,510
who in court wouldn't come to make connections with you?

446
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,460
The thing that went wrong was Shen Jin entering the marriage palanquin instead.

447
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,630
I should have been the general's lady.

448
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,390
If everyone didn't call him "Devil General, Devil General,"

449
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,850
would she have had a chance?

450
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,150
Sister, it's not too late now.

451
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:22,020
If His Majesty knows Shen Jin took your place on purpose,

452
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,740
that would be the crime of lying to the emperor!

453
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,640
He would strip her skin off!

454
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,810
Shen Jin took my place on purpose?

455
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,080
Think about it. Besides the entire Rui Royal Manor,

456
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,880
who knows how Shen Jin ended up in the marriage palanquin?

457
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,390
Also, Royal Father favors you. Of course, he'd protect you.

458
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,040
When that happens, you'll become the general's lady.

459
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,640
That's right!

460
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,900
Yesterday, I heard Mother talking about Danqiao.

461
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,900
I really didn't expect Shen Zi to do something so dirty.

462
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,910
I'm furious, too.

463
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,800
We are sisters,

464
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,500
but we keep fighting.

465
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,700
It's really such an embarrassment to the Rui Royal Manor.

466
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,000
Talking about embarrassment,

467
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,800
naturally, it's the daughter of a woman who washes feet who is the most shameless.

468
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,700
You are going overboard.

469
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,200
I went overboard?

470
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,400
Because of you, I was scolded by Royal Father for no good reason!

471
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,500
I took the initiative to make peace with you and you even insulted me.

472
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,000
You are such a calculating woman.

473
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,400
Younger Sister, can we not embarrass the family in public?

474
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,600
You can say whatever you want but don't involve my mother.

475
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,400
Before you got married, you were just a pug by my side.

476
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,100
Now that you are the general's wife, you are even wagging your tail. <i>(T/N: hinting that she's proud)</i>

477
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,600
You are the same level as that foot wash--

478
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,800
You slapped me?

479
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,500
Stop messing around, all right? Can't you see where we are now?

480
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,400
You...

481
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,200
Younger Sister, don't be angry.

482
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,800
You are now a pregnant woman.

483
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,900
Older Sister, don't worry. I know.

484
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,000
For our future children, if they're a boy and a girl,

485
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,800
should we arrange for them to get married?

486
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,800
This way, we will be even closer.

487
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,100
Older Sister, I think that

488
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,800
when a person is most powerless,

489
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,100
is when they don't have a choice.

490
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,600
Although my child is unable to choose whether to be born or not,

491
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,100
but as a mother, the only thing I can do,

492
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,500
except for protecting him,

493
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,600
is that I want to let my child make his own choices in life.

494
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,270
After all, not everyone can be like us

495
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,400
who are so blessed in marriage.

496
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,400
You are right.

497
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,670
Let's do this.

498
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,600
If there's mutual consent between them, we will let them be together.

499
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,300
If they don't, we won't force them.

500
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,300
I think it's like how among so many sisters, you dote on me the most.

501
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,500
This is fate.

502
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,400
The children have their own fates, too.

503
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,100
You're just a sweet talker.

504
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

505
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,000
You may rise.

506
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

507
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,100
There's good news from the border today.

508
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,400
Lord Yongning wiped out the rebels from the Hawk Clan.

509
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,000
There's an old saying that if the family lives in harmony, all affairs will prosper. Only when the family is in harmony,

510
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,800
when the soldiers fight to serve the Imperial Court,

511
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,300
they will do it with all of their might.

512
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,000
To show the Imperial Court's kindness and favor,

513
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,500
I confer the second daughter of Prince of Rui,

514
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,600
the wife of Chu Xiuming, Lord Yongning as a court lady.

515
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,600
Looks like my family has another court lady.

516
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,100
I thank you, Your Majesty.

517
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
I thank you, Your Majesty.

518

Your Majesty, you can't do this!

519
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,300
His Majesty's here. Don't be presumptuous.

520
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,500
Shen Jin is the replacement for a marriage. She's not fit to be a court lady.

521
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,100
Shut up. Leave now.

522
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,500
She isn't the one who was appointed to be married.

523
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,100
- Your Majesty, I didn't discipline her properly... <br> - Let her speak!

524
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Your Majesty, let me speak.

525
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,700
Your Majesty, when you bestowed the marriage, it was for the second daughter.

526
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm the second daughter of Prince of Rui.

527
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
In order to obtain the position as the general's wife, Shen Jin

528
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,600
replaced me in this marriage.

529

Your Majesty, please investigate wisely.

530
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,800
Punish this girl who's a thief.

531
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,200
The sin of deceiving the emperor.

532
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,500
How bold!

533
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,820
I will investigate this in detail.

534
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,100
"By His Majesty's decree, regarding any replacement in marriage, it's hard to escape from the sin of deceiving the emperor.

535
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,000
Taking into account that they are relatives from the same clan,

536
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,300
they are exempted from the death penalty, but not from punishment.

defied the Imperial Decree, replaced someone in marriage to marry into the general's manor.

She deceived His Majesty and will be interrogated and imprisoned."

542
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,500
End of the decree.
