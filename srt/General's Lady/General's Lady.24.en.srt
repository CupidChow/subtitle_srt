Well, it wasn't me who asked you to deliver this.

Yes, she should have been back long ago.

48
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,630
It must have been you who didn't allow my mother to come back!

but I don't know why she seems to be avoiding me.

How is it acceptable for a Great General to be living here?

96
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,770
For your sake, he doesn't care about that.

But isn't this a bit too urgent?

99

The carriage is already waiting outside.

109

However, General, don't let her run back here in such a sad state again.

110
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,220
Don't worry, Mother. I will surely not make the mistake again.

That's good then.

Whenever you want to come back here, I will accompany you back at any time.

115
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,310
Aren't you going to help me up into the carriage?

116

Older Sister Jin.

117
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,660
Older Sister Jin, why didn't you tell me you were leaving?

118
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,470
General, can I be a guest at Yongning Manor?

119
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,280
My wife decides everything regarding home affairs.

120
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,710
Older Sister, I have never been to the Yongning Manor before.

121
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,000
Can I be your guest on another day?

122
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,190
It's not very convenient. There are not many servants at the manor.

123
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,660
Besides, many of the courtyards are sealed off. Even if you were to come, there is nothing fun.

124
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,060
I merely just want to get close to you.

125
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,820
I know that when you were originally here at the manor,

126
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,350
you had some disputes with my mother.

127
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,760
However, at the end of the day, we are both daughters of Royal Father.

128
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,560
Royal Father also certainly hopes that we would get along with and love each other.

129
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,180
I'm not even close to your mother, where would the disputes come from?

130
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,010
Jin'er, speak calmly. Don't be anxious.

131
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,830
My mother raised me when I was young.

132
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,780
After growing up, it was Mother Consort who raised me.

133
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,530
However, Concubine Xu was constantly weak and sick.

134
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,030
She never went to Mother Consort's court.

135
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,840
I rarely saw her.

136
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,530
Younger Sister Jing, is there some kind of misunderstanding?

137
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,210
Older Sister, don't be angry. I was being rude.

138
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:11,680
Younger Sister Jing, did I say anything harsh that offended you?

139
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,980
I merely want to get close to you.

140
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,810
Is there a need to be so aggressive?

141
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:22,250
For you to say that, it seems like you still have lots of animosities with my wife.

142
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,700
Wife, as an older sister, you should concede to your younger sister.

143
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,010
Thank you, General.

144
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,230
In the future, wherever you are, please forgive us but my wife and I will not be there.

145
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,710
Even if we are in my father-in-law's manor, please avoid us or we shall avoid you.

146
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,290
We shall not be in the same room.

147
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,680
I get it now. I will listen to you from now on, Husband.

148
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,540
Younger Sister Jing, in the future, remember to tell us where you are married off to.

149
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,040
Come on. Let's go home.

150
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,900
What a relief.

151
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,680
Wife, as long as you are happy.

152
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,670
You did well this time.

153
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,570
Wife, you taught me well.

154
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,710
- Where's Rou Rou? <br> - She has already gone back to our manor.

155
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,810
You will be able to see her when we are home.

156
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,200
By the way, I don't want to see Xiao Su for the time being.

157
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,620
Tell him to stop coming to the manor.

158
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,220
I shall obey you.

159
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,260
But don't say that it's my idea!

160
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,470
Okay, Wife.

161
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,270
Lord Liu, Chu Xiuming has already been in the capital for more than a month.

162
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,140
Why haven't we taken any actions?

163
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,740
That's right. We should seize this opportunity to take him down.

164
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,040
He holds military power.

165
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,950
With his presence at the Imperial Court, our plan will never succeed.

166
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,030
Do not panic.

167
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,050
The time isn't right yet.

168
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,110
Wait a little longer.

169
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,580
Your Majesty, regarding the embezzlement of the military funds,

170
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,640
I haven't been able to find any further evidence.

171
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,060
I'm afraid the person behind it is hidden very deeply. Please give me a little more time, Your Majesty.

172
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,640
Just keep investigating, Prime Minister.

173
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,120
You must find out who is behind this.

174
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,000
Lord Yongning has been in the capital for some time now, right?

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,170
Send him back to guard the border.

176
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,390
I will arrange for it right away.

177

Everyone, read it with me!

00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,570
Thank you.

209
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,380
I didn't know you would come today.

210
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,620
- If you knew, you wouldn't come? <br> - Yes.

211
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,040
Why?

212
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,770
I promised I wouldn't bother you.

213
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,500
You also said you'd keep waiting for me.

214
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,860
I just need to remember that you are willing to bear everything with me.

215
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,390
That's right. That will never change.

216
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,510
Chu Xiuyuan, are you a fool?

217
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm not a smart person, in any case.

218
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,630
- I always thought I was a smart person. <br> - <i>Listen to me! Listen to me!</i>

219
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:56,460
I always knew I was someone who knew what I wanted.

220
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,640
However, I didn't know... and can't say clearly when

221
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,610
my insistence started to waver.

222
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,290
Chu Xiuyuan.

223
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,180
When you are by my side,

224
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,660
I feel very at ease.

225
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,410
If it is possible,

226
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,540
I want to be the one who speaks up first.

227
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,700
I want you to know

228
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,100
that I care a lot about you, too.

229
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,860
You fool.

233
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,430
Madam, your pulse is very steady.

234
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,750
You just need to control your diet a little.

235
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,350
You should eat a little but have more meals.

236
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,750
I've... had a great appetite recently.

237
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,600
I haven't had morning sickness either, so I ate a little more.

238
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,110
Older Sister, why don't you have your pulse taken, too?

239
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,360
I came to visit you. Why would I have my pulse taken?

240
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,600
You have nothing else to do anyway. Come on!

241
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,530
- Then I will have to trouble you, doctor. <br> - All right.

242
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,150
These past few days, my loss of appetite has been much better.

243
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,260
My appetite has been pretty good.

244
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,860
My Lady, please give me your other hand.

245
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,990
Is there really something wrong?

246
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,910
Don't talk nonsense!

247
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:08,310
Congratulations, My Lady, you are more than a month pregnant.

248
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,050
- Congratulations, Older Sister! <br> - Congratulations, Eldest Miss!

249
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,250
Would that mean that your child

250
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,880
will have to call my child "Older Brother" or "Older Sister"?

251
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,870
But I-I—

252
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,000
Doctor, is My Lady's body all right?

253
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,550
She had a miscarriage before.

254
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,670
She is rather weak.

255
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,160
The pulse is a little unstable.

256
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,660
But she is fine.

257
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,300
She just needs to take more medicine and rest for a while.

258
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,830
Thank you, Doctor!

259
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,050
Then I will take my leave first.

260
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,660
Rou Rou! Quickly go tell Mother Consort and Heir Apparent!

261
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,920
- They'll be delighted! <br> - Yes!

262
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,710
Wait!

263
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,200
Just tell Mother Consort.

264
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,680
All right!

265
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,550
Older Sister, do you want to return to the Marquis's manor?

266
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,960
I won't. I will find a way to tell the Heir Apparent.

267
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,710
This time... I definitely will not lose this child.

268
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,010
Little brat, once you are born,

269
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,760
you must call my child "Older Sister" or "Older Brother!"

270
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,080
Come, come, come! Sit down.

271
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,670
You are pregnant. Did you send someone to notify the Marquis's manor?

272
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,390
Not yet.

273
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,800
Send someone to inform the Marquis's manor of the good news.

274
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,490
Yes.

275
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,750
Don't wander about for the next few days.

276
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,600
Rest in your room, all right?

277
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,310
Yes.

278
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,900
It's so early, can you hear anything?

279
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,720
I think I should be able to.

280
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,550
Or else, when would I be able to hear him?

281
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,940
How would I know? I don't have any experience with this!

282
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,420
This is my first time, too!

283
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,170
Next time! We'll have experience next time!

284
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,430
How shameless!

285
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,300
Let me listen again.

286
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,860
Shu'er, why are you crying?

287
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,210
Young Master, My Lady is worried about the child.

288
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,910
Is something wrong with it?

289
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,650
Young Master, think about the last child who was aborted.

290
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,950
It was already a fully formed male child.

291
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,020
And this time, Miss...

292
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,680
The doctor told her to rest quietly.

293
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,090
Don't talk nonsense! The last time was last time.

294
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,010
How can those incidents be a common occurrence?

295
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,270
Young Master, please think about it more for Her Ladyship's sake.

296
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,630
The matter back then was very strange.

297
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,030
My Lady completely trusts you.

298
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,060
But how was the child aborted?

299
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,020
Just that Yun Niang, how could she do so much?

300
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,050
How could she trick you?

301
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,510
It's because the real person behind it all

302
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,560
is a person you never guarded against!

303
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,080
What is the meaning of all this that you're saying?

304
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't say any more.

305
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,640
Young Master, do you still not understand?

306
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,070
If Madam didn't destroy the evidence,

307
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,260
then when My Lady sent someone to investigate immediately after she woke up,

308
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,870
how could there be nothing found?

309
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,540
To be able to do all this,

310
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,600
in the entire manor, who else could it be?

311
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,100
Shu'er, don't worry.

312
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,550
Stay here.

313
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,990
I will go and tell Father.

314
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,800
It's all my fault.

315
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,910
If I had taken over the home affairs at the manor earlier,

316
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,330
I wouldn't have made things so hard on you now, Husband.

317
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,000
It's fine. Don't think so much.

318
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,480
I will go back right now and come back to accompany you later.

319
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,420
Take good care of her!

320
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,180
Miss, he really believed it.

321
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,730
Why wouldn't he?

322
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,840
It's better than admitting he was tricked by a woman,

323
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,210
in addition to bearing the guilt of causing his own child's death.

324
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,920
Isn't that right?

325
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,380
Prepare the water.

326
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,560
Help me wash up.

327
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,010
I want to sleep.

328
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,680
<i>[Yongning Manor]</i>

329
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,850
<i>Jin'er, let me take another look once we get back.</i>

330
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,530
- You still want to look? <br> - I really think I heard some movement just now!

331
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,880
You can't hear anything, it's too early!

332
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,390
- I really heard something! <br> - I don't even feel much right now.

333
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,520
How could you hear anything?

334
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,210
You two really came at the right time.

335
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,790
Older Brother, we didn't come here to beg for your approval.

336
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,960
It's just that Ruonan feels that we should let you know.

337
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,820
I got it. You two can leave now.

338
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,040
- All right. <br> - Don't! Don't!

339
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,320
Husband!

340
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,710
Jin'er, I said "I got it." Is there something wrong with that?

341
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,740
General, can you really not give us your blessing?

342
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,980
I believe I already made things clear.

343
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,930
You also told me you had no romantic feelings for Xiuyuan.

344
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,300
Why did you come here right now?

345
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,540
I want to say that he is very good, but I'm not that bad either.

346
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,260
That's just about what I mean.

347
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,530
My Lady, there's no need to say that much to my older brother.

348
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:00,700
Xiuyuan, I don't want you to lack your family's blessing.

349
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:08,480
Husband, they've known each other since they were young.

350
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,390
That means it's been at least seven or eight years!

351
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,890
But Xiuyuan has never forgotten Sister Ruonan.

352
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,250
Are you not touched by this affection?

353
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,310
Jin'er, you know why I'm against them.

354
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,610
Are those reasons important?

355
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,370
Could they possibly be more worthy than this affection?

356
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,520
Then if someone came here with those reasons,

357
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,880
- would you give me up, too? <br> - Never!

358
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,500
That's right! Then, why must they give up?

359
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:47,760
Jin'er, Xiuyuan definitely cannot marry a regular commoner!

360
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,220
But, General, didn't you also marry a regular commoner?

361
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,670
- How could that be the same? <br> - It is different.

362
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,050
How could I be the same as Sister Ruonan?

363
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,100
How could I possibly be compared to her?

364
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,840
In this world, it is difficult for a man to live,

365
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,770
much less a woman!

366
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,870
And this woman also bears the burden of supporting old and young lives!

367
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,220
This is a great love.

368
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,680
It is an unconditional sacrifice!

369
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,460
Tell me. How could I possibly be compared to Sister Ruonan?

370
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,720
Chu Xiuming, have ever you fought this hard for someone before?

371
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,470
My little wife is really growing up,

372
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,960
yet I have become increasingly foolish as I live.

373
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,860
Then... do you agree?

374
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,500
I will listen to you about everything, Jin'er.

375
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,550
Thank you, Older Brother!

376
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,770
You should thank your sister-in-law!

377
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:24,250
Sister Ruonan, it looks like our shops can finally become one!

378
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,990
We can finally work hard together!

379
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,760
Starting from tomorrow, I shall work hard for our shops!

380
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,670
- You cannot! <br> - I cannot what?

381
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,260
You cannot go out.

382
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,500
Chu Xiuming, you—!

383
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,620
I'm so bored!

384
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,040
I'm so bored!

385
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,470
Stop! Where are you going?

386
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,230
I... came to find you!

387
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,390
Find me?

388
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:18,650
Find me... For what reason?

389
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,340
You... Don't misunderstand!

390
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,970
I didn't come to take you out!

391
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,470
This isn't the Rui Royal Manor.

392
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,150
If I take you out, then the general will kill me!

393
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,170
I didn't say I wanted you to take me out!

394
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,060
As long as you don't want me to take you out, you can order me to do anything!

395
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,380
I will not refuse!

396
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,830
Just leave!

397
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,830
I came to find you for something!

398
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,270
What is it?

399
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,320
Two more came.

400
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,690
Two what?

401
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,550
It is said they are your 7th Aunt and 8th Aunt. <br> <i>(Her 7th Aunt is from her paternal side, and her 8th Aunt is from her maternal side)</i>

402
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,030
Do I have... two relatives like that?

403
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,110
Do you want to see them?

404
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,870
I'm bored anyway. Let's go see them!

405
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,840
Slow down! Slow down!

406
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,880
Slow down, Miss!

407
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,190
Listen to me.

408
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,220
I haven't seen our Jin'er in so long!

409
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,320
You really have become more beautiful!

410
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,630
You are indeed in a position of authority,

411
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:21,240
the primary lady who's cherished, and is successful.

412
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,410
You cannot say that.

413
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:28,650
Our Jin'er's textile business in the capital is very prosperous.

414
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,150
She didn't claim any of our nephew-in-law's glory.

415
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,400
Alone in the business world,

416
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,500
Jin'er is the Zhuge of the industry! <br> <i>(T/N: Zhuge Liang, an famous and brilliant, ancient military strategist)</i>

417
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,020
Of course, she would have vast riches.

418
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,520
Primary Lady, you are a heroine amongst women.

419
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,970
You are being too courteous, too courteous.

420
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,750
That... 7th Aunt. 8th Aunt.

421
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,010
You must be aware that my husband is usually busy.

422
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,780
I take care of this manor myself.

423
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,990
Besides, my business

424
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,750
is very busy!

425
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,620
So I won't be drinking tea with you two.

426
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,670
7th Aunt! 8th Aunt! The general has already given orders.

427
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,940
My Lady is pregnant, thus people cannot come too close.

428
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,700
What a coincidence! What a coincidence!

429
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,180
I came precisely to help share her burdens!

430
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,850
That's right, I also have official matters to discuss with you!

431
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,470
What is it?

432
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,900
The thing is—

433
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,330
Primary Lady, look!

434
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,460
I know you are busy.

435
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,250
The general's manor is such a large place

436
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,240
- and all of its affairs rely on you, Primary Lady. <br> - Precisely! Precisely!

437
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,990
On that topic, it is said that "two heads are better than one."

438
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,230
Even if you have exceptional capabilities,

439
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,300
you still need a good helper. Isn't that right?

440
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,770
- That's right. <br> - Besides, you are pregnant now, too.

441
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,780
If you really are tired out, then the general will blame us!

442
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,900
That's right, that's right.

443
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:56,420
Now is the best time to get concubines for the general!

444
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,010
On the one hand, she can help you

445
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,200
take care of your business and the manor.

446
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,970
On the other hand, she can give the general more children!

447
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,830
This is the best merit you could possibly do for the general as his primary lady.

448
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:15,080
The general will also praise you for being kind and demure!

449
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,690
Those two old women are trying to butter sister-in-law up right now. <br> <i>(T/N: bewitch by means of flattery)</i>

450
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,970
They said they want to give you concubines!

451
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,820
Oh? What did they say?

452
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,020
They said she is a fine lady who is as "delicate as a flower and refined like precious jade." <br> (T/N: Idiom – exquisite)

453
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,600
I'm asking what did your sister-in-law say.

454
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,150
Did she become furious and drive them out?

455
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,910
She didn't.

456
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,150
Sister-in-law was very calm and peaceful.

457
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,450
Then that means someone is about to be in huge trouble.

458
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,080
Since ancient times, men have always—

459
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,690
Since ancient times, men have—

460
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,740
Since ancient times, men have always had multiple wives or concubines!

461
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,940
Not to mention, your husband is a top-ranked general!

462
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,860
Rather than benefitting those outsider women with ulterior motives,

463
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,790
why not become even closer as a family and marry our own people into this manor?

464
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,720
This is your younger paternal cousin, Xiao Qing!

465
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,440
Primary Lady, why don't you take her in?

466
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,110
How about letting her be the general's second wife?

467
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,660
Greetings, Older Sister.

468
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,540
Primary Lady.

469
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,800
- Primary Lady. <br> - 8th Aunt! 8th Aunt!

470
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,900
You must "hold a bowl of water evenly." <br> <i>(T/N: Idiom – be impartial and just in handling matters)</i>

471
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,930
You shouldn't treat your younger sister from your own family unfairly.

472
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,430
Look! This is your younger maternal cousin, Xiao Bai.

473
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,930
Just take her in as well, all right?

474
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,450
She's so obedient!

475
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,270
How about this?

476
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,580
I will give five taels of silver to each person. Take the money and leave.

477
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,190
This...

478
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,600
This...!

479
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,660
Older Sister, I will definitely take good care of you and the general!

480
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,880
You don't need to thank me!

481
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,140
Then... how about we give a little more money to each person?

482
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,230
We'll treat it as part of your dowry from General's Manor!

483
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,100
You two are so beautiful and lovely.

484
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,240
Don't worry about not being married off.

485
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,080
I only want to serve by your side!

486
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,900
- I definitely will not bother you— <br> - You don't need to serve me.

487
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,070
I have people serving me.

488
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,600
Primary Lady, just take it as pitying Xiao Qing.

489
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,630
Her father died early—

490
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,840
How pitiful!

491
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,510
Then... how about... we send Xiao Qing to learn some craftwork?

492
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,840
If the family isn't dependable, then she must depend on herself!

493
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,370
Rou Rou, there's no need to get money for Xiao Qing.

494
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:06,080
She's not worried about marrying anyways, why does she need a dowry?

495
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,620
Miss, you are right!

496
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,320
Younger Cousin, do you also want to learn craftwork?

497
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,200
Then I will not be walking you all out.

498
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,640
Please come this way, everyone.

499
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,640
- Older Sister—! <br> - This way, please!

500
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,250
<i>I'm so angry!</i>

501
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,060
Let's go!

502
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,240
How is it? Are you still bored?

503
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,100
Why don't I go walk them out?

504
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,660
Come back!

505
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,560
Miss!

506
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,890
Where are you going?

507
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,490
Slow down!

508
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,360
You! You're not...?

509
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,120
Yes, my old tricks!

510
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,980
That won't do.

511
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,870
I climbed this wall myself, it has nothing to do with you. Just pretend you saw nothing.

512
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,420
You can't, Miss!

513
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,200
Your body is heavy right now, if—

514
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,520
- Turn around! <br> - No.

515
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,270
Turn around! Turn around!

516
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,380
Miss.

517
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,500
You—! If you go out,

518
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,260
then the person in trouble is me.

519
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,690
No matter if I participated or not in your climbing over the wall to go out,

520
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,390
as long as you go out, the general is surely going to blame me!

521
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,610
If he says "kill Rou Rou,"

522
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,830
what will I do?

523
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,270
Rou Rou, are you waiting for the general to come back and kill you,

524
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:33,020
- or should I kill you now? <br> - Then just kill me now!

525
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,130
All right. Once the general returns,

526
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:39,030
and if anything happens to the child in my belly,

527
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,530
I will tell him you didn't take good care of me.

528
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,820
How could you do that?!

529
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:51,570
Be careful! My little life is below your feet!

530
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,640
Cut the crap!

531
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,560
You've gotten much heavier recently.

532
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,480
Are you just spouting nonsense? There's another person in my belly!

533
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,130
Come on!

534
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,880
Great wide world, here I come!

535
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,570
Rou Rou, a little higher!

536
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,860
Still higher?

537
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,520
What are you two doing?

538
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,360
General.

539
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,600
Miss! I didn't to do that on purpose!

540
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,960
General, she threatened me! I don't know anything!

541
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,200
How could you be so careless?! What if something happened?

542
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,040
It's fine! I frequently climbed over walls in the past. I have great martial arts skills!

543
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,280
Things are different now.

544
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,300
You have to be careful with everything, got it?

545
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,810
I just... wanted to go out for a walk.

546
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,720
I'm so bored!

547
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,560
Then once you have given birth,

548
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,860
I will take you out to travel and play,

549
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,830
and walk around the entire world. Does that sound good?

550
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,650
Really?

551
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,710
When have I ever lied to you?

552
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,670
Husband has never lied to me before!

553
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,450
Then I have never lied to you either!

554
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:25,960
All right. Then I will send my wife back to her room first.

555
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,440
Servants!

556
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,920
From now on, nothing can exist in the manor that could cause Her Ladyship any harm.

557
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,850
Also, this bed should be layered to be softer.

558
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,270
- Yes. <br> - Yes.

559
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,390
Also, have you prepared the nourishing tonic I asked for?

560
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,650
We have prepared it according to your orders.

561
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,180
Go on.

562
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,650
Yes.

563
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:15,650
Husband, I'm not that fragile!

564
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,920
Jin'er, you have to treasure your body well.

565
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,220
I can't even finish eating all of the gifts in the manor!

566
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,810
You don't need to prepare any more for me, all right?

567
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,300
Jin'er, you have put aside the textile shop business,

568
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,860
but if you need anything,

569
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,890
you must obediently tell me.

570
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:41,060
You have to believe in me. I will take good care of you.

571
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,440
Yes, Husband!

572
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,930
Be good.

573
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,970
I will have to trouble you, Mother.

574
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:04,700
You are too courteous, General. I have to thank you.

575
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,740
From now on, just call me Xiuming.

- Jin'er. <br> - Mother!

579
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,620
You're going to be a mother, why are you still so childish?

580
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,870
Wife, if you act like this, people are going to think

581
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,870
that I have been treating you poorly!

582
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,330
I said I wanted to go pick you up, Mother!

583
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,390
This person! He insisted that I wait here!

584
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,540
You're pregnant right now.

585
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,550
Your body is heavy so you cannot be reckless.

586
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:49,390
It's fine, Mother!

587
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,050
Mother, I have no elders at home.

588
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,860
Please stay a few more days.

589
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,690
Thank you, General. Then I will shamelessly bother you for a little while longer.

590
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:02,270
- Take Mother to her room to rest. <br> - Yes.

591
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,290
Then I'll go first. I'll come and see you later.

592
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,330
- Be good. <br> - Don't worry, Mother!

593
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:19,440
Thank you, Husband! You treat me so well!

594

As long as you are happy.

595
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,450
That's right, Jin'er.

596
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,820
I might have to make a long-distance trip.

597
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,020
Then you must come back safely!

598
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,610
Of course!

599
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,700
Then... can you not go?

600
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,450
That's obviously not possible.

601
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,970
Then, can I go with you?

602
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,120
Then...

603
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,160
Mother! Mother!

604
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,530
Wife, don't be like this.

605
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,980
I'll feel even worse if you're like this.

606
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,180
But I've never been apart from you before!

607
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,310
I definitely will come back safely.

608
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,150
Think about it. The border is very far away.

609
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:50,120
Your body cannot take the hardship.

610
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,450
But I really miss Xiao Cong, Qing Qiu, and the others.

611

Also, all the delicious foods by the border!

612
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,070
I don't know what's wrong with me recently.

613

I always feel so sad!

Perhaps because you are pregnant,

615
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:20,160
your emotions will fluctuate.

After all, you're going to be a mother.

617

I should be happy that you are going out.

618
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,860
Because no one will order you around?

619
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:42,180
But right now I'm so sad!

620
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,660
Husband, don't come back too quickly!

621
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,570
What?
