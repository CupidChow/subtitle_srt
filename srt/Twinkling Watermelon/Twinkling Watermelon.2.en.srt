(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, KOCCA)

00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,939
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,979
(in this drama are fictitious.)

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,980
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

11
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,319
What if he doesn't show up again?

12
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:52,248
We haven't seen him for two weeks.

13
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:54,389
Today, he'll show up. I know it.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,529
- How can you be so sure? - He has a pattern, you see.

15
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:59,288
At a particular time of the year,

16
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:01,029
he says goodbye and disappears.

17
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,959
After that, he always returns.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,130
And today's the day.

19
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:07,029
What is he, a werewolf?

20
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:09,369
Does he turn into a wolf at every full moon?

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,740
- The national trial exam. - What?

22
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:13,270
You mean, he's still in high school?

23
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:16,679
Hey, it's been 30 minutes already. Let's just go.

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,179
- Oh, look! - My gosh.

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,118
- Look! - Oh, my.

26
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,179
He's here.

27
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,448
- Finally! - We've been waiting for you.

28
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:27,890
Sorry to keep you waiting.

29
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,889
- It's okay! - Don't worry!

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,058
We missed you.

31
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:35,600
Sadly, I think this will be my last performance.

32
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,729
- No! - Whatever. You're just saying that.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,698
You always say it'll be the last performance...

34
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:40,769
but always come back.

35
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,799
Thank you for all your support.

36
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,669
I'll remember all of you for a long time.

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,308
No!

38
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:49,139
He's an attention-seeker who does this...

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,209
to get a reaction out of people.

40
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:52,179
Those who try hard to look cool are never competent.

41
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:55,080
Let's not waste our time here. Let's go. Come on.

42
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,310
We've found a diamond in the mud.

43
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,189
Make sure you pick up the gifts another day.

44
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,289
Thank you for everything.

45
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,130
Hey, you. Masked man!

46
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,319
We're here to make you an offer you can't refuse.

47
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,459
The Coldplay of Hongdae's indie scene, SPINE9.

48
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,219
The band is looking for a new guitarist,

49
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,289
and we'll give you a chance to participate in the audition.

50
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,130
What do you say? Aren't you excited?

51
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,798
I bet you can't turn it down...

52
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,329
I'm sorry, but I must decline.

53
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,239
Hey, wait.

54
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,008
Come on, kid. Don't make such a hasty decision.

55
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,369
We're the Coldplay of Hongdae.

56
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,539
- I must decline. - No.

57
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,739
We won't take no for an answer. You can pay your way out of it.

58
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,579
Take this.

59
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,889
The third track is the song we'll use in the audition.

60
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,219
Take a listen, and come up...

61
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,959
with a guitar riff and a sub vocal melody line.

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,419
If you pass the audition, you can join SPINE9.

63
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,969
The audition will begin at 6pm on Friday.

64
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,970
In the practice room at Club Spark, where all bands gather. Okay?

65
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:56,628
All of a sudden, I was reminded of the saying...

66
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,299
with the end-of-the-century vibe that made me cringe.

67
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:03,340
"Music is the only drug allowed by the government."

68
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,929
Will I manage to quit it this time?

69
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,549
Can I...

70
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,650
really quit music?

71
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,390
Can I?

72
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:32,460
I bet that jerk, Hyun Chul, left because he got a good offer.

73
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,728
They must've made an enticing offer.

74
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:35,729
So he got all excited...

75
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,998
and ditched us, using me as an excuse.

76
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,600
Don't be ridiculous. You're always like this.

77
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:41,738
Darn. Anyway,

78
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:43,899
if we want to get the team back in order and reclaim the prime slot,

79
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,069
we must hurry up and find a talented new member who's already popular.

80
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,340
I told you. That guy is no good.

81
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:48,839
Why do you think he always wears a mask?

82
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,839
He's not confident about the lower half of his face.

83
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,909
Clearly, you do not have a good eye.

84
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,048
You saw his eyes.

85
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:55,949
Even with the mask on, you can tell that he's handsome.

86
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,020
I'm sure he's handsome. I bet 50 dollars. Are you in?

87
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:02,489
Is the offer still on the table?

88
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,368
I have some conditions, though.

89
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:13,769
First, I can never take the mask off due to personal reasons.

90
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,199
Second, I'll be a high school senior next year,

91
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,899
so I must focus on my studies at exam time.

92
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,139
Third, I have a unique family situation,

93
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,209
so I must put school before music,

94
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,909
and my family will always be my top priority.

95
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,039
Despite that...

96
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,450
can I still join the band?

97
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:34,089
What did you just say?

98
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,119
- You'll become what? - Choi Se Gyeong's boyfriend.

99
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,929
You're not serious right now, are you?

100
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:43,830
At first, I thought I was seeing things while daydreaming.

101
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:55,809
I was like, "Or, am I dead?"

102
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,640
"Did I just see an angel?"

103
00:07:58,549 --> 00:07:59,710
I thought that for a moment.

104
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,918
But no. I was wrong.

105
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,219
She's real.

106
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,720
Such a beauty actually exists!

107
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,760
Hey, brother! I need her info.

108
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:10,188
You can help me, right?

109
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,428
You're like Sherlock Holmes.

110
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:13,188
You're better than the FBI when it comes to gathering Intel.

111
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,129
Right, I don't even need to look into it. Just give up.

112
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,859
Darn you! Why should I?

113
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,270
"Why?"

114
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:24,140
Do you want to hear the truth?

115
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,438
Choi Se Gyeong in 11th grade at Seowon Arts High School.

116
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,280
- She plays the cello. - Choi Se Gyeong is here!

117
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,678
In front of her school, you always see a crowd...

118
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,449
of students from all-boys high schools in the area...

119
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,949
who want to see her and people...

120
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,219
from entertainment agencies who want to make her a superstar.

121
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,589
I can't get you out of my mind. You, my angel...

122
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,118
Don't you want to be like Ko So Young?

123
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,888
It's more competitive than getting into a good college.

124
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,289
Sorry, she doesn't have time for you.

125
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,759
She never even shows any interest in them.

126
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,560
She always keeps to herself.

127
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:53,700
She's disciplined and extremely talented.

128
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,170
Her schedule?

129
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,769
She's busier than most celebrities.

130
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,569
From school and her lessons and practice...

131
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,768
to recitals and various social events.

132
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:02,340
She has no time to spare.

133
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,709
And her family?

134
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,879
Gosh, she comes from a very good family.

135
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,279
You know what a prestigious family means, right?

136
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,219
- I know. A family of good writers? - Wrong.

137
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,950
Do you want to get your front teeth knocked out?

138
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:14,889
Someone's not in the mood for jokes.

139
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,330
- Fine, continue. - Her family is very wealthy.

140
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,028
Hey, why do you think an angel like her...

141
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,060
descended to the human world?

142
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,069
Even if she had to take off her wings...

143
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,329
to descend into this realm,

144
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,998
she could go ahead and open dozens of factories...

145
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:29,899
on the land her family owns to manufacture wings.

146
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,710
My dear daughter, are you ready for your recital today?

147
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:37,978
I picked out a few dresses for you.

148
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:40,409
Just for your reference, I like the pink one the best.

149
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,430
And most importantly,

150
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,529
she already has a boyfriend.

151
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,239
They've already met each other's families.

152
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,969
They're practically engaged.

153
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,069
But I want to marry her.

154
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,309
Goodness. I know you're smitten, but get a grip.

155
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,408
Hey, look. He's handsome.

156
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:12,509
And he's rich.

157
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:14,879
On top of that, he goes to med school and is in a band.

158
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,019
Do you seriously think you can beat a doctor-to-be?

159
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,329
Do you think they saw us?

160
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,529
I have no idea.

161
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,070
Anyway, give up already.

162
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,100
To Choi Se Gyeong, you're just a peasant.

163
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,040
You can't dare to...

164
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:43,779
Gosh, that idiot actually climbed over the wall.

165
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,600
It is you.

166
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,600
The part-timer at the ice cream shop.

167
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,810
How did you get in?

168
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:22,340
Well, you know. I got invited.

169
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,440
Is that so? Who invited you?

170
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,979
The one who organized this party?

171
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,249
Oh! Hello.

172
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,219
The chairman of Seowon Arts High School...

173
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,450
organized this party,

174
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,590
and I'm the chairman's daughter.

175
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:40,859
If I remember correctly, neither of us invited you.

176
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,229
Who are you?

177
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,470
- Are you a thief? - What?

178
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,599
What do you take me for?

179
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,940
I invited him.

180
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:53,470
Se Gyeong, you invited him?

181
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Why?

182
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,940
I didn't pay for my ice cream that day.

183
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,979
Follow me. I don't have my wallet on me right now.

184
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:11,320
Thanks a lot for your help.

185
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:14,359
I didn't think you'd remember meeting me that day.

186
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,529
How about we get on a first-name basis?

187
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,039
I'm in 11th grade too.

188
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,570
Don't waste your life away. You should use your time wisely.

189
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,809
- What? - If you keep being clingy,

190
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,070
you'll be seen as a stalker.

191
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,609
Stalkers are ones who failed in life.

192
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,509
Take my sincere advice instead of the money for the ice cream.

193
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,550
I am not a stalker.

194
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,619
Oh, sorry.

195
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,859
You barely know me.

196
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,329
It takes time to become friends with...

197
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,628
You see, I'm wearing this dress...

198
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:50,430
to deliver a perfect performance in front of professors...

199
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,128
who may teach me later on.

200
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,300
How much time, effort, and money do you think that went into this?

201
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:55,940
Is this a quiz?

202
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,139
A day? Two days?

203
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,869
Think about it.

204
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,879
Do you think I've even had a moment to be distracted?

205
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,540
And it won't be any different going forward.

206
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,050
But you're human, not a machine.

207
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:08,148
You should also play and let loose...

208
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,920
You see, we live in different worlds.

209
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:12,420
Didn't you see the people at the party?

210
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:14,189
When you're busy playing,

211
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,518
I'm busy networking.

212
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,619
When you're building sandcastles, I'm building connections.

213
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,229
Your life is FAH.

214
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:22,629
What?

215
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,369
Your life is frustrating as heck.

216
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,739
You can never get back your youth.

217
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,508
You need to let loose and have some fun here and there...

218
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,210
- Do you like stripes? - You mean, the soft drink?

219
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,539
Of course, I do. Shall we go have some now?

220
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,749
No, not that. I meant stripes.

221
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:40,978
Stripes? Why do you ask?

222
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,220
Your fly is open.

223
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,720
My gosh.

224
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,690
Oh, no.

225
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,710
I'm not scared tonight

226
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,220
No obstacles can stand in our way

227
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,619
Anymore

228
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,248
All right

229
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:21,960
I'll tell you no matter what

230
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,189
My heart is starting to beat

231
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,998
- Louder now - Let's go

232
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:31,599
Step one, even if I fall down

233
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,070
Step two, I will get up twice

234
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,099
Yes, don't stop

235
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,340
I can fly away

236
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,710
Keep on knocking, and when the door opens

237
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,908
Then the story about the two of us

238
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:50,579
Will unfold on this vast sea

239
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,320
Reach out your hands, higher

240
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:58,559
You can almost touch it

241
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,200
Let's follow our dreams

242
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,248
- As for the Yoon Dong Jin Band, - Yes.

243
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:27,090
did you confirm the changes in their overseas tour schedule?

244
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,758
The talk with the organizer for their tour in Europe went well.

245
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,190
And we're holding off on starting ticket sales for North America.

246
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:35,929
And we still haven't decided on the band...

247
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,358
for the opening performance?

248
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,669
I followed your suggestion and submitted a list...

249
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,898
that mainly consisted of rookie indie bands,

250
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,769
but Yoon Dong Jin said no to every single one of them.

251
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:47,239
In 30 minutes, I'll be meeting...

252
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,479
- with the AR and MR teams. - Got it.

253
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:52,749
Where is Yoon Dong Jin now?

254
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,590
When the path you're on

255
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,790
Is too exhausting

256
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:08,189
And challenging

257
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,128
Please tell me

258
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:13,898
Don't hide it

259
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:19,469
You're not alone

260
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,279
Eventually

261
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,209
Just like the blue whales

262
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,350
We'll swim too

263
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,289
- Without fear - That was during...

264
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,448
- the PC communications craze. - Right.

265
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:37,359
People would freely criticize songs on online forums...

266
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,090
and also used them to look for band members.

267
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,859
I also joined a school band through that route.

268
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,429
The name of the band was...

269
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:49,669
First Love Memory Manipulators?

270
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,638
Am I remembering this correctly?

271
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,439
I'm not too sure,

272
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,280
but people called us "The Manipulators" in short.

273
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,049
And they weren't wrong...

274
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,020
because we were awful.

275
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,889
Then tell me about the time when you first met the band members.

276
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,520
It was embarrassing.

277
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,358
Back then, we had to tell each other to stand somewhere in Hongdae...

278
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,089
holding a school magazine in the right hand...

279
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,490
in order to recognize each other when we met.

280
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,029
So that was when you met...

281
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,859
Mr. Oh Ma Joo for the first time, right?

282
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:20,929
That's right. I can't believe it's been 29 years already.

283
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,099
Then are any of the other co-members still working...

284
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,799
in the music industry?

285
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,669
- No one. I'm the only one. - My gosh.

286
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,839
Unfortunately, we had to disband after a short while...

287
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,709
because one of the members caused big trouble.

288
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,079
Sir, I think I've discovered a hidden gem.

289
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,379
You need to see this.

290
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:40,520
Here, this guy with the mask.

291
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,060
Isn't he such an amazing guitarist?

292
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:46,689
He's a sub-vocalist, so he doesn't have many parts.

293
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:48,428
But he has a unique voice.

294
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:50,529
And as you can see, he's tall and fit.

295
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,129
I think he's got a nice face too.

296
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,330
What do you think?

297
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,369
Is this mask his styling concept?

298
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:57,499
Well, don't you think it's a cool marketing tactic?

299
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,439
It makes you want to take it off.

300
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,378
My gosh. They're already here.

301
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,280
- Can I get your autograph? - Let us through.

302
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:10,279
- Sorry. Coming through. - Over here!

303
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,648
- Sorry. - Can I get your autograph?

304
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,948
- Hey, let's go. - Come on, quick.

305
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:15,219
Hey, go.

306
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Thank you.

307
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,429
- Gosh. - Oh, boy.

308
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,889
My gosh. I'm so frazzled.

309
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,429
I nearly died.

310
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,059
I could barely breathe, wearing the mask.

311
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,530
You're our lucky charm!

312
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:29,539
Gosh. If people see his face, they'll go wild.

313
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,069
Gosh, it's such a shame.

314
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,109
Hey, leave him be.

315
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,009
When the masked singer takes off his mask, it's game over.

316
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,510
It's time you took it off.

317
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,709
We have a truckload of masks from your fans.

318
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,378
Why don't you just wear gold grills like rappers do?

319
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:42,649
Then we'll get some gold bars at least.

320
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,520
I have good news and bad news.

321
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,590
Which one do you want to hear first?

322
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:49,389
Gosh, I really hate it when you say that.

323
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,719
You make me feel like...

324
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,990
I'm the most indecisive person in the world.

325
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:55,428
Well, they say bad things happen before good things.

326
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:56,629
Let's just get it over with.

327
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:57,959
Tell us the bad news first.

328
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,570
I think it's about time...

329
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:02,239
we parted ways.

330
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,800
What? What are you talking about?

331
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,010
Are you ditching us?

332
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,369
You were all excited when you said your sales soared thanks to us.

333
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,509
Then what's the good news?

334
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,878
I just got a call from MJ Entertainment.

335
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,580
They're looking for a band that could tag along...

336
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,118
on Yoon Dong Jin's concert tour overseas.

337
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,179
Okay, and?

338
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,090
SPINE9 is on the list!

339
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,790
Next week, Mr. Oh Ma Joo...

340
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,059
will come here...

341
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,899
to watch you guys perform in person!

342
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,129
- My gosh! - Yes!

343
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,638
Keep on knocking, and when the door opens

344
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:44,139
Wait. But who's Oh Ma Joo?

345
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:47,509
- Cheers! - Cheers!

346
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,780
- Yes! - Yes!

347
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:55,489
Hey, you're in a band.

348
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,689
How could you not know who Oh Ma Joo is?

349
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,729
You know who Yoon Dong Jin is, right?

350
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,759
Of course, I do.

351
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,389
He's the godfather of Korean band music.

352
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,799
Oh Ma Joo is the one who helped Yoon Dong Jin...

353
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,628
become the number one artist in the country.

354
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:08,868
Oh Ma Joo has been his manager since he was a nobody.

355
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:11,069
And he's known to have the Midas touch.

356
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,708
Whatever he works on becomes a huge hit,

357
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,168
be it a song, an album, or an artist.

358
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:18,780
That's right. If Oh Ma Joo picks us,

359
00:21:18,949 --> 00:21:21,049
we'll join Yoon Dong Jin on his concert tour overseas,

360
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,378
and we can work with the best of the best...

361
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:24,749
in a top-of-the-line facility.

362
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,149
In other words, we can release a real album.

363
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,188
Hey, kiddo.

364
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,290
Do you now understand what an amazing opportunity this is?

365
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,458
My gosh. This is so cool!

366
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:36,858
Let's celebrate, guys. Cheers!

367
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,129
- Cheers! - Cheers.

368
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,199
I got into an accident.

369
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,009
Come to the Seogyo Police Station as soon as you can.

370
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,869
Sorry, something's come up. I have to go.

371
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,909
- Hey. - He's doing this again.

372
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:53,648
Why does he have so many secrets?

373
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:54,810
(Seogyo Police Station)

374
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,419
I told you. I was the one who drove!

375
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:04,888
My heart was pounding like crazy,

376
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:07,688
so I got out of the car and left the scene for a bit.

377
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:10,159
But as you can see, I voluntarily came here.

378
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,168
Ma'am, please don't lie.

379
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:14,799
You did not come here voluntarily.

380
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,070
We ran your plate and called you here.

381
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,138
This is clearly a hit-and-run case.

382
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:21,208
Right, I told you that I'd pay for what I did.

383
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:23,009
The damaged goods and the medical expenses.

384
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,678
I'll compensate him for everything.

385
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:26,750
So what is the problem?

386
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,819
He said the driver was someone else.

387
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,320
It's my car. Who'd drive it if not me?

388
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,218
I swear, she wasn't the driver.

389
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:36,889
It was someone else. I'm sure of it.

390
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,730
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

391
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,928
I'm fine. I tripped and fell...

392
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:49,570
while trying to avoid getting hit by the car. Look, here.

393
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,339
I heard it was a car accident.

394
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,079
What exactly happened?

395
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,638
Is my dad the victim, or did he cause the accident?

396
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,080
Have you checked the security footage?

397
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,879
This lady's car crashed into your father's warehouse.

398
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,849
But the security cameras at the scene were broken,

399
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,219
so we have yet to confirm who the hit-and-run driver is.

400
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,658
This lady is saying it was her,

401
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,159
but I think your father keeps saying it wasn't her.

402
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,429
- Could you ask him for me? - Sure.

403
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,030
Did you see the driver?

404
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,500
My father clearly saw the driver with his own two eyes.

405
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:27,810
The driver who ran away wasn't her. It was a guy.

406
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:35,409
Why? What did he say?

407
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,820
Are you sure?

408
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,520
I clearly saw him with my own two eyes.

409
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,359
He's sure the driver who ran away...

410
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:56,300
- was this lady's son. - Hey!

411
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,208
How dare you try to dump this on my son?

412
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:00,840
Please be quiet!

413
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,280
It's not true. I swear I was the one who drove.

414
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:06,979
It was a dark alleyway without a single street light.

415
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,780
How could he have seen the driver's face?

416
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,020
He's doing this to mess with me!

417
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,060
- Thank you. - No problem.

418
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,899
Thanks for being your father's interpreter.

419
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,530
We'll be in touch once we find solid evidence.

420
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,169
- You said you were in 11th grade. - Yes.

421
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,938
For your father's sake,

422
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:34,669
you should study hard and try not to be distracted. Okay?

423
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,250
Eun Gyeol!

424
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,279
What on earth is your dad saying?

425
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,050
(Hardworking Seogyo Police, Safe City for Happy Citizens)

426
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:51,159
He won't let me leave. What is this?

427
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,389
My gosh.

428
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:56,299
He says you must be worried about Byung Ho.

429
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,500
Is he trying to provoke me?

430
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:07,540
"Ma'am, you haven't changed at all."

431
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,639
What's with the pause?

432
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,149
What is it?

433
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,149
What's he saying?

434
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,299
Tell me. What did your dad say?

435
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,330
Tell me everything. Don't leave a single word out!

436
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,500
"Ma'am, you haven't changed at all."

437
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,609
"Even the day..."

438
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,980
"when the fire broke out at my house six years ago,"

439
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:47,250
"you pretended not to know the truth."

440
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,718
Go ahead and sue me...

441
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:51,549
for violating the Housing Lease Protection Act...

442
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,049
or stage a one-man protest if you want to. I don't care.

443
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,549
I want you to move out at once.

444
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,919
"You held us accountable for everything when we did nothing."

445
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,689
"It's your own fault..."

446
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,699
"that Byung Ho turned out like this."

447
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,270
That's what he said.

448
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,800
What?

449
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,869
What did my son do?

450
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,340
There's nothing wrong with my son!

451
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,490
(To Die For Chicken)

452
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,060
Sorry for calling you out of the blue today.

453
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,069
The interpreter was running late because something had come up,

454
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,230
so I had no choice but to call you.

455
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:18,869
Couldn't you just let it go and let them off quietly?

456
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:24,280
It's not like you suffered serious damage.

457
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,980
She said she'd compensate you for all the goods and medical expenses.

458
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,560
Then what? Should I not have said anything like six years ago?

459
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:45,300
Because I can't speak,

460
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,898
and people wouldn't care to listen to what I have to say?

461
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,138
Because no one would listen...

462
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:51,198
to those with no power and people with disabilities,

463
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:53,270
should I have just stayed quiet, like I did back then?

464
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,480
Did Byung Ho become happy because we kept it to ourselves?

465
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,749
Were we happy that we chose to suffer without speaking out?

466
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,149
It didn't make me happy.

467
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:09,659
I felt like I owed you and Eun Ho an apology.

468
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,918
"I should've fought."

469
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,729
"I should have yelled and said my boys didn't cause the fire."

470
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,060
"I shouldn't have stayed quiet." I regretted it over and over.

471
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,899
From now on, I won't do anything I'll regret later.

472
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,340
For the family's sake and for Byung Ho too.

473
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:44,658
"I'm out. You guys go for it?"

474
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:47,089
Hey, Eun Gyeol never worded it like that.

475
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,060
He said he couldn't do it with us due to personal reasons.

476
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,128
What are you, an AI bot?

477
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,899
He sounded so arrogant.

478
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,070
Let me ask you this.

479
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,569
What are the so-called personal reasons?

480
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,070
Like I said in the past,

481
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:02,709
I must put school before music,

482
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,979
and my family will always be my top priority.

483
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,379
So? You've decided to choose your family over us?

484
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:08,679
Yes.

485
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,020
Why?

486
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:12,419
Is your dad giving you some assets on the day of the performance?

487
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:14,219
You have to be there, or he'll take it back?

488
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:16,918
Then you'll be okay with me not performing?

489
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,458
You little...

490
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,059
Hey! Have you lost your mind?

491
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,928
Do you think no one's above you because you're popular?

492
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:23,929
I told you guys that I never liked him from the get-go!

493
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,760
He's serious about doing music? As if.

494
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,469
He played us and used us.

495
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,668
To become popular with girls...

496
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,169
and relieve stress from studying.

497
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:34,368
He used us.

498
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:35,469
Stop, that's enough.

499
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,010
Who are you to play us?

500
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,279
Oh. "See if you guys can pull it off without me."

501
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,379
Are you messing with us?

502
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,049
Were you waiting for the perfect moment to ruin things?

503
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,050
Drop it.

504
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:46,148
Who are you to ruin everything for us?

505
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:48,289
- Who do you think you are? - Hey, that's enough!

506
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,359
- Drop it! - Guys!

507
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,359
I nearly got my family killed in the past.

508
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,260
I was so preoccupied with music...

509
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:03,199
that I neglected my brother who couldn't hear or shout for help.

510
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,010
I was having a great time and cared about nothing else.

511
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:09,340
My family never talked about it,

512
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,240
so I thought they'd forgotten all about it,

513
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,080
which was why I was starting to feel like I could finally breathe now,

514
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,449
but I was wrong.

515
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,619
It's become a deep scar.

516
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,260
It wasn't forgotten. It's become a forbidden topic.

517
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:39,669
So I must return to where I belong before it gets too late.

518
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:42,469
I'll endanger my family if I start enjoying this more.

519
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:44,909
Thanks for everything.

520
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:01,189
Do you have to ditch us now, of all times?

521
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,468
Before you ruin our livelihood,

522
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,469
shouldn't you consider distancing your family first?

523
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,969
You're 18. You're old enough now.

524
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:20,050
I'm sorry.

525
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,949
We're going to do it.

526
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,750
Even without you, we must do it. However...

527
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,419
We'll wait for you, just this once.

Your homeroom teacher called me.

532
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,399
I heard your grades had dropped significantly.

533
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,769
Did you go through my room?

534
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,740
Why? You never did this before.

535
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,280
To be honest, this wasn't my first time visiting the study room.

536
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:29,419
I've visited a few times to bring you snacks.

537
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,179
But you weren't at your desk.

538
00:32:34,689 --> 00:32:35,919
I won't ask you...

539
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:38,689
why you're keeping secrets from me...

540
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,659
and how you got that scar.

541
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,000
I want to know, but I won't ask.

542
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:46,669
I'll just wait until you tell me.

543
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,510
But I don't want your dad to find out.

544
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:59,510
I want your dad to become much happier than he is now.

545
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,349
The thing is, you're his joy.

546
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,350
You are his pride.

547
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:12,189
You'll come back, right?

548
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:14,530
Very soon, you'll stop being confused...

549
00:33:14,689 --> 00:33:16,459
and return to being the Eun Gyeol I used to know, right?

550
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:11,449
(Viva Music)

551
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,460
(Viva Music)

552
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:02,869
(Viva Music)

553
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:39,400
- Do you like my daughter too? - Pardon me?

554
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,069
No, that's not why I'm here.

555
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:47,279
There was a musical instrument shop called Viva Music right here.

556
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,080
- Viva Music? - Yes.

557
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,819
The owner and I were close, so I used to visit often.

558
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,589
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

559
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,259
I suddenly thought of the shop, so I wanted to stop by.

560
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,360
- I'll be off, then. - Are you...

561
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:03,759
Ha Eun Gyeol, by any chance?

562
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,699
How do you know my name?

563
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,650
(Viva Music)

564
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,989
You've grown up to be a fine young man.

565
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:37,460
Do you want to come in for a moment?

566
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,929
I have something to give you.

567
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,159
She's good, isn't she?

568
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,960
She's my daughter. She wants to be a cellist.

569
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,560
She's 18 too, just like you.

570
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,659
I see.

571
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,969
And she's rebellious like most 18-year-olds.

572
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:20,869
Her poor cello has to put up with that.

573
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:29,080
If you don't mind me asking,

574
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,380
how did you know Mr. Viva?

575
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:34,449
I'm his daughter.

576
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,290
I didn't know he had a daughter.

577
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,759
Of course, you didn't know.

578
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,388
I moved to the US in 11th grade to study abroad...

579
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:44,000
and stayed there...

580
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,060
until I heard he'd passed away.

581
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:51,900
Open it.

582
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:54,069
He left it behind for you.

583
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,130
If I think it sounds good enough,

584
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:17,659
I'll give you that guitar. I know you want it.

585
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,029
Really?

586
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:21,000
Are you really going to give me that guitar?

587
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,999
I said, "If I think it sounds good enough."

588
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,239
I clearly said that.

589
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:29,310
I waited six years to give you this.

590
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:33,080
I've been taking good care of it,

591
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,949
so you can play it right away without having to tune it.

592
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:38,719
I don't know how the two of you met...

593
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:41,389
and how you became close,

594
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,758
but what he said about you...

595
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:46,060
to his lawyer was pretty cool.

596
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:49,690
Are you ready to hear it?

597
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,929
Yes.

598
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,298
"That kid..."

599
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:59,839
That kid knows how to talk to the guitar...

600
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,040
and how to talk to the world through his guitar.

601
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:05,580
He is...

602
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:08,210
the most talented guitarist I've ever met.

603
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,839
Do you like it?

604
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,429
You said you would check my homework before giving it to me.

605
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,130
I was going to give it to you anyway.

606
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:01,830
You act like you're harsh.

607
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:04,540
But you always prepare carrots first before whipping the horse.

608
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,838
You received a carrot.

609
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,610
Why do you look like you were whipped?

610
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,139
Because I think I got homework that is more difficult.

611
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,710
Homework?

612
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:16,009
I gave up performing, which I was crazy for.

613
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,920
It was such a tough decision.

614
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,319
And now you're making me contemplate again.

615
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:23,488
Why do you make things so complicated?

616
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,159
Because my life is at stake.

617
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,360
What's the right answer?

618
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:34,799
Living a life that makes my heart beat.

619
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,000
Living a life as a trophy for my father.

620
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:40,969
Whichever I choose,

621
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,880
my heart aches because of the other option I didn't choose.

622
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,380
I'm not happy.

623
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,649
You could flip a coin.

624
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,080
How can you decide on your life with a coin?

625
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,520
You're an artist. You should know what a metaphor is.

626
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,759
Think of the stage as your coin and flip it.

627
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,729
You wanted to break down the beats and raise the tempo.

628
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,698
Why are you making me put out a fire?

629
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:37,899
You're too fast.

630
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,460
Do you put out a fire when you're not even ready?

631
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:44,000
Hey, kiddo, increase the output drive.

632
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,730
- Do you want to amp it up? - What?

633
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,540
Yes.

634
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
Shall we start from the verse?

635
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,238
I'm not scared tonight

636
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:56,709
No obstacles can stand in our way

637
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,909
Anymore

638
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,509
All right

639
00:42:59,779 --> 00:43:02,179
I'll tell you no matter what

640
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,230
Your fly is open.

641
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:18,830
Your fly is open.

642
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:24,899
How embarrassing.

643
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,969
I'm done for.

644
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,909
My goodness.

645
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:34,710
Seriously.

646
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,020
Bring it on. Let's fight.

647
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:40,750
My gosh.

648
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:49,489
I cried so much

649
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:55,029
In the rain

650
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,670
In the snow

651
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:06,139
You were in the rain

652
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,580
Hey.

653
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:11,250
I faintly remember

654
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:13,048
Bal San.

655
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:16,520
Our last words

656
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:18,020
Hey.

657
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,589
Your last word

658
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,429
Bal San.

659
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,659
What's the name of this song?

660
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,529
Oh, you're Yi Chan.

661
00:44:28,029 --> 00:44:30,500
Can you put my hair back down?

662
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,279
This song is called...

663
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:42,380
"The Story of You and the Rain" by Boohwal.

664
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:49,389
You who looked sad that day

665
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,290
I couldn't dare see you

666
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,969
I cried so much

667
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:06,299
In the rain

668
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,279
In the snow

669
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:14,909
It goes like this.

670
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,380
Yi Chan, you must be in love.

671
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
But I...

672
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:27,460
have...

673
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:30,829
nothing.

674
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,400
You should be in a band then.

675
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:35,600
They worship guys in a band.

676
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:39,540
Kurt Cobain proved it himself.

677
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,738
Who is that?

678
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,210
Just know that he exists.

679
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,980
The only way...

680
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:47,979
for the poor and the powerless...

681
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,819
can conquer the world and win fair ladies...

682
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,020
is to join a band.

683
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,548
A band?

684
00:45:55,549 --> 00:45:56,889
Do you like bands?

685
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:59,319
Not a bit. They make noise pollution.

686
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,028
And you're going to a band concert?

687
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:03,259
It's Ji Hwan's regular concert with his band club members.

688
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:04,699
He needs flowers.

689
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,528
Can I join you?

690
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:08,599
I love bands.

691
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,639
No, you love medical students.

692
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,798
Don't be like that. Let's go together, Se Gyeong.

693
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:13,908
If you get me an invitation,

694
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:15,810
I'll prepare the flowers. How about that?

695
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:33,630
I'll prepare a bouquet as big as this.

696
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:35,859
Just get a bouquet then.

697
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,299
No, I can't. I need to make it straight.

698
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,909
Are you okay? Your uniform is ruined.

699
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,920
Hey, are you out of your mind?

700
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:05,790
Are you all right?

701
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:20,139
I'm fine. I'm going home anyway.

702
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,540
Hey, you should apologize properly.

703
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:32,380
She thinks she's better than us.

704
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:44,529
It's all wet.

705
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:55,239
Thank you.

706
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:58,480
I'll wash it before returning it to you.

707
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:00,409
You're Yoon Chung Ah who studies art, aren't you?

708
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,679
Wait...

709
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,460
- Se Gyeong. - It's Se Gyeong.

710
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:18,698
- It's Se Gyeong. - It's Se Gyeong.

711
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:20,028
- Se Gyeong. - Se Gyeong.

712
00:48:20,029 --> 00:48:21,699
- It's Se Gyeong. - What's going on?

713
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,769
My gosh. Why is he not here?

714
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:25,899
It's really Se Gyeong.

715
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,540
- Yes. - What is she wearing?

716
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,149
- Is it really... - What is it?

717
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,908
- What's going on? - Who is that guy?

718
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:37,650
- What are they doing? - What's going on?

719
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,980
I guess you like bands as well.

720
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,449
You should've told me.

721
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:44,190
Actually,

722
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:47,790
I'm in a band too.

723
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:49,258
They're a thing, right?

724
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,258
- Right? - Are they dating?

725
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:52,299
Se Gyeong.

726
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:55,529
Do you want to come to our concert later?

727
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,080
Where did you say we were going?

728
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:11,719
Where did you say we were going today?

729
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,819
To get the dashcam footage.

730
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:21,460
He found a car that was at the scene on the day of the accident.

731
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,770
I'm going to ask the owner to show us the dashcam footage.

732
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:31,969
Having you there to interpret for me will be very helpful.

733
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,610
I...

734
00:49:40,279 --> 00:49:41,279
have...

735
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:46,480
Actually, I have an important...

736
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,330
No! Eun Gyeol has an important meeting today.

737
00:49:56,029 --> 00:49:58,000
He and I are meeting my coach today...

738
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:00,670
to sort out the schedule for my off-season training.

739
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:03,298
Eun Gyeol has to study.

740
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:04,539
I'll go instead of him.

741
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,599
No.

742
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,770
Coach needs to interact with someone who can hear too.

743
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:09,770
Besides, he loves Eun Gyeol.

744
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,480
So you can go there with your interpreter.

745
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,060
Did you know?

746
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,630
Of course.

747
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,159

I have over 2,000 followers now.

752

Do you want to come too?

753

Bring your girlfriend.

754
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:00,759
I'll give you invitation tickets.

755
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:04,159
It's fine. I can't hear anything anyway.

You little...

757
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,049
Hello.

758
00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:26,850
Are you sick?

759
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,549
I'm all right.

760
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,589
It's just...

761
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:35,060
It's just a simple cold.

Hey, do you think you can perform tonight?

764
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,900
Darn it.

765
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,839
Hey, kiddo. Go and get some medicine.

766
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:48,209
We still have time.

767
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,310

If you had snuck into the house,

770
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,020
you should have just stolen some money from me quietly.

771
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:05,060
Why did you have to steal my car? Look at the mess you created!

772
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,889
I'm near the karaoke bar in Hongdae you used to work at.

773
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,730
Okay. I got it.

774
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,299
Hide in there until the dust settles.

775
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,170
I'll call you back.

776
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,338
You should take some medicine first.

778
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,949
you could get your voice back with some luck.

- Is that so? - Yes.

780
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,880

00:52:36,449 --> 00:52:38,190

784
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:51,339
Give me a few more. Come on.

785
00:52:51,699 --> 00:52:52,739
Hey.

786
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:55,139
- I need the pills. - The pills?

787
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,639
What? Gosh.

788
00:52:57,139 --> 00:52:58,338
- Hey. - Darn it.

789
00:52:58,339 --> 00:53:00,580
- Come on. Just go back inside. - Give them to me.

801
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,480
Does that hit the spot?

802
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:18,359

what your so-called perfect son is doing right now?

Eun Gyeol would have done that if he respected you as his father?

You've been backing me up.

834
00:56:07,299 --> 00:56:08,770
You can do it. No.

835
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:10,869
You must do it.

Step one, even if I fall down,

845
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,859
Step two, I will get up twice

846
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,559
Yes, don't stop

847
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,928

848
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:17,329

849
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,338
Then the story about the two of us

850
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:23,068

Knocking

852
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,440
You lied to me.

853
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,139
I can explain everything.

854
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,678
You deceived me.

855
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:05,250
You looked down on me and made a fool out of me.

856
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,319
It's not that.

857
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:09,089
I was going to tell you.

858
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,719
But I never had a chance.

859
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,190
I was going to tell you everything...

860
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:15,489
after tonight's show.

861
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:16,860
Tell me what?

862
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:20,259
I...

863
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:24,900
want to do music.

864
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,600
I like music.

865
00:58:29,569 --> 00:58:30,670
I like performing on stage.

866
00:58:35,009 --> 00:58:36,110
You're wrong about that.

867
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,250
You're just lost.

868
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:44,019
You're distracted momentarily because school work is hard.

869
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,588
This isn't the real you.

870
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:48,589
No. This is the real me.

871
00:58:49,489 --> 00:58:51,299
You might not like who I am.

872
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,060
But the guy on stage tonight was the real me.

873
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:56,229
You're still in high school. But you go clubbing,

874
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,698
drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, do drugs, and act like a rebel.

875
00:58:58,699 --> 00:59:00,499
- So that's the real you? - Who said...

876
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,270
I drank alcohol and smoked cigarettes?

877
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:09,949
Let's go home. We'll talk about this at home.

878
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:12,580
You don't belong here!

879
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,249
No. I'm not leaving.

880
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,190
I don't want to live as your trophy anymore.

881
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:20,289
I'm not your interpreter.

882
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,588
I'm not a fire alarm or an angel.

883
00:59:22,589 --> 00:59:24,960
I'm just me.

884
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:35,069
Then why didn't you tell me sooner about how you felt?

885
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:37,739
I knew you'd behave this way.

886
00:59:38,279 --> 00:59:39,838
Just like now, you're set in your ways.

887
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,179
You still should have told me!

888
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:43,980
If you had respected me as a parent,

889
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:45,449
you should have done...

890
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,150
whatever you could to persuade me.

891
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,718
That's what a family does!

892
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:52,158
How could I have persuaded you?

893
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:53,889
You can't even hear my music anyway!

894
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:24,319
I suppose the Almighty truly exists, after all.

895
01:00:25,259 --> 01:00:27,988
In exchange for my deafness,

896
01:00:27,989 --> 01:00:30,589
the Almighty gave me my two sons, you and Eun Ho,

897
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:35,100
Dad!

898
01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:41,270
Dad!

899
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:36,580
Welcome.

900
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:39,679
I'm the master of this store.

901
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:42,189
I'm sure it wasn't easy to find my store.

902
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,449
What brings you here?

903
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:47,118
Well, it looked just like a music store, Viva Music,

904
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,388
I knew from a long time ago.

905
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:50,329
I see. Viva Music.

906
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,299
But this place is called La Vida Music.

907
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:55,298
If you put the names together, it makes, "Viva la Vida."

908
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:57,270
It interprets as... "Hooray, life!"

909
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,339
What an interesting connection.

910
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:04,239
So how can I help you?

911
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,738
I see. Are you here to sell that guitar?

912
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:09,480
- What? - The one you're holding.

913
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:12,949
Oh, this? Okay. Here you go.

914
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:14,279
Let me take a look.

915
01:04:17,549 --> 01:04:20,589
Gosh, this is a rare guitar.

916
01:04:20,889 --> 01:04:22,560
Are you sure you won't regret it?

917
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,060
Yes.

918
01:04:24,929 --> 01:04:26,299
How much can I get for this?

919
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,610
I'll give you the rest later.

920
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,879
If you need a different guitar,

921
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,048
may I interest you in an electric guitar...

923
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,219
recently launched for a fraction of the price?

924
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:55,789
Sure. I'll think about it.

925
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:56,790
Okay.

926
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:02,469
Come back if you have a change of heart.

927
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:04,469
It won't be easy to find my store, though.

928
01:05:07,339 --> 01:05:10,170
No. I won't be back here again.

929
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,408
You never know what the future holds.

930
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,880
So take it for now.

931
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:15,880
Sure.

932
01:05:18,819 --> 01:05:21,819
Do not lose this transaction slip. Never. Okay?

933
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:24,420
You'll be in a tight spot if you do. Okay?

934
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,290
Okay.

935
01:05:34,259 --> 01:05:35,330
I'm just goofing around.

936
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,639
Bye.

937
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:41,298
Be careful on your way out.

938
01:05:41,299 --> 01:05:43,839
- You might get lost. - Okay.

939
01:05:44,509 --> 01:05:46,238
Viva la Vida!

940
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,310

970
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,069
We'll need someone like Yoon Dong Jin to make this work.

971
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:24,428
I'll bring him then!
