17
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:11,668
Hello?

18
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,207
Hello, there.

19
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,939
So are you having a pleasant trip?

20
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:18,779
Come on. It was you?

21
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,349
You scared me!

22
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,478
You should have called me first if you were going to do this.

23
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,379
- No, listen. I was... - Whatever.

24
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:26,147
I'm doing very well.

25
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:28,118
Don't ever call me again. Got it?

26
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,088
You must be having fun,

28
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:41,367
Hello?

29
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:44,807
Are you there? Can you hear me?

30
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:46,108
Anybody there?

31
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:47,968
What's this? Did she hang up on me?

32
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,208
Darn it.

33
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:50,338
That's right.

34
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,779
I'm living someone else's life.

35
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,779
My name is On Eun Yu.

36
00:02:56,648 --> 00:02:58,147
You have probably guessed it.

37
00:02:58,148 --> 00:03:00,719
I'm Choi Se Gyeong's daughter from the 21st century.

38
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:04,159
(New York, 2013)

39
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:10,729
That's me.

40
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:12,629
That's my mom.

41
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,298
I know that we're very alike.

42
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:19,009
Apparently, I resembled her even more as I grew up.

43
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:23,479
I took after her so much that I was practically her clone.

44
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:24,678
Anyway...

45
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:35,419
Excellent. The girl is a genius.

46
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,599
That's how I became my mother's precious gem.

47
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,229
Was I happy?

48
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,199
Not in the slightest.

49
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,768
- Bravo! - Bravo!

50
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:55,838
As you know, a gem must shine all the time.

51
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,488
The moment it loses its sparkle, its value will plummet.

52
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:34,177
I was loved only briefly...

53
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:35,378
when she needed to show off or put on a show.

54
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,519
I was mostly locked up in my jewelry box.

55
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:54,469
Hey.

56
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:02,778
If my dad hadn't taken me...

57
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:05,178
out of my mother's jewelry box from time to time,

58
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,649
I would have died already.

59
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:09,678
But...

(Application on the Confirmation of Divorce by Consent)

61
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,448
Eun Yu...

62
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:15,889
is my daughter, so I'll raise her.

63
00:05:16,188 --> 00:05:17,519
I'm her father.

64
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:19,988
If you want to raise her, you must stop drinking then.

65
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,898
I already filled it out.

66
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:25,198
I prayed to anyone who would listen.

67
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:27,399
"Please make them stop fighting because of me."

68
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:36,008
"Help me not regret that I was born." That's what I prayed.

69
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,447

71
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,248
Whose house is this?

72
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:43,448
This was my father's house.

73
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:45,548
But Grandpa lives in the US.

74
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:47,589
Not him.

75
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:49,419
He was your real grandpa.

76
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,628
Grandpa in the US isn't my grandpa?

77
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,358
No.

78
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:58,229
I have two fathers. Jealous, are you?

79
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:01,798
No. I only need one dad.

80
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:05,839
You know,

81
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,738
ever since I was a kid, I wanted my own family.

82
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,448
A family that wasn't complicated to explain.

83
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:17,048
A family I didn't have to worry about or be scared...

84
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,889
of being abandoned by. A real family like that.

85
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:24,159
You're my only family now.

86
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,029
Dad isn't your real family?

87
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:30,959
You'll stay by my side, right?

88
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,568
You won't abandon me or leave me, right?

89
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:41,409
I regretted it.

90
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:45,108
I shouldn't have made that promise to her that day.

91
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:51,047
(Viva Music)

92
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:52,789
Like the change of the seasons,

93
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:54,818
the relationship between my dad and my mother...

94
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:56,318
cycled through hot and cold.

95
00:06:57,558 --> 00:06:59,127
They went through the cycle...

96
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,688
of living together and getting separated like an annual event.

97
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,728
In the end, the year I turned 18,

98
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:05,928
they got a divorce.

99
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,738
(6 years later)

100
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,079
This is our home now. We'll live here, just the two of us.

101
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,519
Just focus on studying music.

102
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:25,818
You understand what I'm saying, right?

103
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,878
Did she gain weight? She looks like she gained weight.

104
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:54,948
Girls lose weight in college.

105
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,047
It's normal for girls to gain weight until they finish high school.

106
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:59,849
Ma'am, can you loosen up the waist a bit more?

107
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:01,317
It will be uncomfortable when I perform.

108
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:02,519
No. Leave it as it is.

109
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:04,789
She'll lose weight pretty soon.

110
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:09,899
Choi Se Gyeong?

111
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,729
It's me.

112
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:16,599
Yoon Sang A from Seowon Arts High School.

113
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,669
The daughter of Jinsung Musical Instruments' chairman.

114
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:23,238
I did hear that you were back in Korea.

115
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:25,108
So it was true.

116
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:30,219
No way. Is she your daughter?

117
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:31,849
Hello.

118
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:35,759
She's a carbon copy of you in high school.

119
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,558
It's nice to see you.

120
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:41,328
But what a pity. I have an appointment coming up soon.

121
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:43,928
I heard about your news.

122
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,598
You got divorced.

123
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,198
I was a bit shocked.

124
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,239
Darn it.

125
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,808
The timer on the time bomb started to tick away.

126
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:53,168
You and Ji Hwan...

127
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:56,139
were the last couple I expected to see getting a divorce.

128
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,977
- Three. - I get it, though.

129
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:00,149
It was even more shocking when you got married.

130
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,879
I thought you would continue your career as a cellist.

131
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:05,288
- Two. - You were notably impressive...

132
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:06,748
when you were in high school. You know?

133
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:09,557
You were talented, beautiful,

134
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:10,989
and popular too.

135
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:14,988
Boys from other high schools worshipped you like some deity.

136
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,999
They called you the Queen of Cello.

137
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:19,769
One.

138
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:34,677
I'm serious.

139
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:37,478
A boy formed a band just for me.

140
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,848
He said he would put on a show at the festival just for me.

141
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,288
Right. Talking about bands brings back this memory.

142
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:46,629
Did I tell you my first love was in a band?

143
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,428
You see, my first love...

144
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:52,999
was nothing like your father.

145
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,609
He was bright like sunshine, cheerful, and manly.

146
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:02,707
He seemed indifferent and cold from time to time,

147
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,078
but he was kind.

148
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:07,408
He was sometimes sensitive and meticulous.

149
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:08,409
But he had a positive attitude.

150
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,779
You should have married your first love.

151
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,649
I wouldn't have been born then.

152
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:15,688
What?

153
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,389
Why don't I finish Part Two of your story?

154
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,958
"If only I didn't marry your father..."

155
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,399
"If only you weren't born, I would have had..."

156
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:25,927
"a fantastic career as a cellist..."

157
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:27,499
"and explored the world."

158
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:30,138
"I wouldn't have lived as a boring woman..."

159
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:32,369
"who clung on to her husband and obsessed over her daughter."

160
00:10:34,338 --> 00:10:36,378
Eun Yu. What I said...

161
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:37,708
It was the liquor talking?

162
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,848
You're never going to drink again?

163
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:42,249
Do you expect me to fall for that promise again?

164
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:45,047
Did you think I had a choice about being born?

165
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:46,088
I...

166
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:48,958
didn't get to choose to have you as my mother when I was born.

167
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,159
Come on.

168
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,669
What do you think you're doing?

169
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:04,999
I'm going to live with Dad.

170
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:06,768
I'm scared that...

171
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,368
I might turn into you if I keep living with you.

172
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:10,408
That's why I told you to focus only on music.

173
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:11,437
So you won't turn into me!

174
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,009
Stop giving me these excuses!

175
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,177
Don't use me.

176
00:11:15,178 --> 00:11:17,749
Why must I be a tool for redeeming your failed life?

177
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,119
I can't talk to you when you're like this.

178
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:21,489
Talking was the last thing we ever did.

179
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:23,358
You were always busy telling me what was on your mind.

180
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,988
Whenever I talked, you treated me like some dog barking.

181
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:27,129
Is that why you put on an act that you lost your hearing?

182
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,628
Is that why you gave up that easily?

183
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,197
Just to rebel against me?

184
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:32,828
This is why I hate you.

185
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,769
It's so easy for you to spit out these hurtful words.

186
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,869
Sometimes, you act like a sociopath.

187
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,769
Dad left because he was sick of this side of you. You know?

188
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,308
How awful you are.

189
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,249
You're just like your dad.

190
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,948
You're right.

191
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:54,119
I always got along with Dad much better than with you.

192
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:09,869
That was the last day I spent with my mom,

193
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,109
and it was the beginning of a long trip.

194
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:28,119
(Incheon to JFK)

195
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:39,828
Hello.

196
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,399
Who are you?

197
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:44,538
I'm sorry. But isn't this Dr. On's house?

198
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:45,938
Yes. But who...

199
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,909
I see. You're Dr. On's daughter.

200
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,738
- Honey. - "Honey?"

201
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:53,749
Honey, come quick. Your daughter's here.

202
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,419
He's on the second floor, so he can't hear us.

203
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,649
Come in, sweetie.

204
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:00,588
Honey.

205
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:10,259
(Dad)

206
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,068
(Dad)

207
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,067
Darn it.

208
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:21,068
(Mom)

209
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:30,379
Dang, mama.

210
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:32,148
- Where are you going? - Sorry.

211
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,588
- Do you want to hang out with us? - Sorry.

212
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:39,289
Oh, shoot.

213
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,129
They should've married other people if they were going to do this.

214
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:50,499
They shouldn't have had me then.

215
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,338
They didn't even ask me what I wanted.

216
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,539
I had no choice in my birth.

217
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:00,177
It's not like they're going to live my life for me.

218
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:02,119
What is this?

219
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,578
- Welcome. - Gosh, you startled me!

220
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,718
I'm the master of this store.

221
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:48,289
It must not have been easy to find this store.

222
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,619
How did you find this place?

223
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:53,828
No, you turned on the light for the sign just now.

224
00:15:55,058 --> 00:15:56,328
Yes. I did that, didn't I?

225
00:15:58,298 --> 00:16:00,328
Would you like a warm cup of tea?

226
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:02,337
No, I'm good with tea.

227
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,739
Do you buy used cellos?

228
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:05,938
I want to sell it.

229
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:13,448
Are you sure you want to sell this?

230
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:16,318
I can tell you treated this cello with a lot of care.

231
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:18,919
I don't need it anymore.

232
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,249
I'm going to die soon.

233
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:22,518
Oh, no.

234
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,989
You're still very young. What made you become suicidal?

235
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:30,558
Carrying that huge cello on my back...

236
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,529
is way too heavy.

237
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,097
But the cello doesn't seem...

238
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:37,968
heavy enough to make someone suicidal.

239
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,739
You can't probably see her,

240
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:44,678
- but my mom is on that cello. - Oh, my.

241
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:48,148
Dad used to bring her down from the cello once in a while.

242
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:49,649
But he's not interested in doing that anymore.

243
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,149
So I think I'm ready to end my life.

244
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:54,688
Your parents will be very sad.

245
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:56,187
People say children fulfill a lifetime of duty...

246
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:57,758
when they hit the age of three.

247
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,389
It's not a bad deal for everyone.

248
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:02,557
I'll have fun with the money from selling the cello.

249
00:17:02,558 --> 00:17:03,629
Then I'll die.

250
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:07,599
Great!

251
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:11,738
I will give you a very good price just for you.

252
00:17:15,238 --> 00:17:16,278
Gosh.

253
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:20,708
Are you sure you're giving me a good price?

254
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,349
I only see one-dollar bills.

255
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:25,618
This will come in handy more than you think.

256
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,718
Did you know?

257
00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:28,848
The design of one-dollar bills...

258
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,488
has never changed unlike other bills.

259
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:38,329
Here. Take this...

260
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:41,668
in case you want to get your cello back.

261
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,198
That will never happen.

262
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:47,738
Take it just in case.

263
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:49,278
Okay.

264
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:55,008
Why don't you go on a trip before you die?

265
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:58,948
I mean, it will be a special trip.

266
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:03,788
Sounds good.

267
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:06,829
It'll give me time to think about my suicidal plan. I'll do that.

268
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,428
Thank you for the tea.

269
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:15,428
Watch your way out.

270
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:17,768
Okay.

271
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:21,508
I hope you have a pleasant trip.

272
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:42,129
What?

273
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:44,898
(Entrance)

274
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:45,998
What's this?

275
00:18:46,198 --> 00:18:47,527
This is an airport.

276
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,038
(International Arrivals)

277
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:50,369
An airport in Korea at that.

278
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:55,639
(Who paged me?)

279
00:18:58,678 --> 00:18:59,678
What?

280
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:07,349
"Year 1995?"

281
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:11,258
Why don't you go on a trip before you die?

282
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,889
I mean, it will be a special trip.

283
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,129
And it was time travel?

284
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:18,758
My gosh.

285
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:20,928
Se Gyeong.

286
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,839
Aren't you Se Gyeong?

287
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:25,869
You are, right? I'm Kim Min Ji.

288
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,538
We were classmates in sixth grade at Lala Elementary School.

289
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:32,139
- Oh, yes. Min Ji. - Yes, that's me.

290
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,379
I heard you had left Korea to study abroad a few days ago.

291
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,549
Did you not?

292
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:38,348
- Abroad? - Yes.

293
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:39,349
Wait.

294
00:19:39,448 --> 00:19:41,849
So it's around when Mom just left Korea to study abroad.

295
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:43,389
If so...

296
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,038
It means this house will be empty for a while.

297
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:03,237
So did you give up on dying now?

298
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:04,507
(Daehan Telecommunication)

299
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:06,278
Of course, I didn't.

300
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:10,379
You just said you were doing well, didn't you?

301
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:12,218
I am doing well.

302
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:16,188
Because I found the most peaceful and fun way to take my own life.

303
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,758
Gosh, can I ask what it is?

304
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:22,187
It's not scary or painful.

305
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,158
I won't have to bother anyone.

306
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,899
And I will go out of existence very naturally.

307
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,998
The suspense is killing me. Can you tell me more?

308
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:32,369
I'm going to find my mom's first love so that they can stay together.

309
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:35,237
Then she won't marry my dad.

310
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:37,207
And I won't be born,

311
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,609
which means I won't have to try hard to kill myself.

312
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:41,909
Oh, my gosh.

313
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:43,849
That's very creative.

314
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:46,217
And my mom will be happier than she is now.

315
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:48,349
Because she'll be with her first love as she wished.

316
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:52,218
It's the most reasonable and elegant way to take my own life.

317
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,889
Gosh, she's smart.

318
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:56,358
That's very true.

319
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,558
But how are you going to find her first love?

320
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,428
- I already did. - Oh, my gosh.

321
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,299
Gosh, you're fast.

322
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,738
But are you sure that it's him?

323
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,109
Well... Are you saying that he isn't?

324
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:15,819
I'm not sure.

325
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:17,649
What do you think?

326
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:19,419
Then...

327
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:22,288
I'll get back to you in good time.

328
00:21:23,258 --> 00:21:25,118
Viva la vida.

329
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,889
Hold on. Mister.

330
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:28,458
Darn it. Hello?

331
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:30,099
Hello?

332
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:40,669
Does it mean that Mom's first love...

333
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:43,538
might not be Yi Chan?

334
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,079
Then who on earth is it?

335
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:10,737
He's a patient with an electric shock.

336
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:12,399
He was in a semi-coma on the way.

337
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:13,937
His blood pressure has been decreasing.

338
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:15,568
His pulse rate is less than 30 beats per minute,

339
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:16,609
developing bradycardia.

340
00:22:17,008 --> 00:22:19,507
- Give him epinephrine right now. - Yes, sir.

341
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:21,277
And prepare the intubation set immediately.

342
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:22,309
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

343
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:25,177
He's in cardiac arrest.

344
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,287
Do CPR. Hurry up and get the defibrillator.

345
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:28,318
- Hurry up. - Coming, sir.

346
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,488
Charge 200 joules.

347
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:31,359
Charge 200 joules. It's on.

348
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,128
Please step back, everyone.

349
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:34,589
Ready. Shoot.

350
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,559
Mom. Dad.

351
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:41,428
I want to go home.

352
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:45,839
Please come and take me.

353
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:48,139
Please.

354
00:22:54,178 --> 00:22:55,208
Are you okay?

355
00:22:59,518 --> 00:23:00,589
Oh, gosh.

356
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:02,248
You're in a hospital.

357
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:04,089
Hold on.

358
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:18,438
You're in a hospital. You collapsed.

359
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:20,139
Do you remember?

360
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:26,208
What's the matter? Are you all right?

361
00:23:30,748 --> 00:23:31,919
It seems you remember.

362
00:23:32,448 --> 00:23:33,518
It's a relief.

363
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:35,389
Just a second.

364
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:51,069
I'm sorry I got mad at you last time.

365
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,938
I'm sorry for the harsh words.

366
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:55,809
I didn't know that you couldn't hear.

367
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,477
I'm sorry.

368
00:23:59,478 --> 00:24:01,008
Don't be mistaken, Yoon Chung Ah.

369
00:24:01,478 --> 00:24:03,579
He's not being kind. He's pitying me.

370
00:24:04,218 --> 00:24:06,419
Do you think he would've been this kind...

371
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:08,218
if I hadn't lost hearing?

372
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:10,488
No, you can't.

373
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:12,218
Don't move.

374
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:14,659
You should lie down. That's what they said.

375
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:18,028
They said you needed a rest.

376
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,767
Excuse me. Can you come for a moment?

377
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:21,829
Sure.

378
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:24,268
I'll be back soon.

379

(Friend)

382
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:46,788
Here it is.

383
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:50,528
Go to the reception to get a prescription for the patient.

384
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:52,868
Make sure to stop by the pharmacy in the basement...

385
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:53,997
to get the medication before leaving the hospital.

386
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:56,339
All right. Thank you. Have a good day.

387
00:24:58,169 --> 00:24:59,198
My gosh.

388
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:12,419
The invitation I gave you at that time.

389
00:25:13,288 --> 00:25:15,018
It was what Se Gyeong had given to me.

390
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,188
I didn't know that she had put a letter in it.

391
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:23,758
I'm asking why you screwed me up with this fake letter.

392
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:29,399
I might not see you ever again,

393
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,198
but I wanted to clarify the misunderstanding.

394
00:25:31,968 --> 00:25:33,609
Thank you for taking me to the hospital.

395

396
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,349
(Please give me a chance to apologize.)

397
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:49,049
Please give me a chance to apologize.

398
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,288
Don't.

399
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:54,889
I'm sorry that I misunderstood you.

400
00:25:57,899 --> 00:25:58,958
I'm really sorry.

401
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:01,428
Don't keep apologizing like that.

402
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:03,399
Aren't you hungry?

403
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,639
Do you want to grab something?

404
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:07,809
You need to eat to take your medication.

405
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:09,538
Don't be so kind.

406
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:11,738
You don't know.

407
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:14,678
That too much kindness can hurt someone.

408
00:26:16,718 --> 00:26:18,748
Why? You can't forgive me?

409
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:20,349
Do you think you'll never forgive me?

410
00:26:20,748 --> 00:26:23,859
How about you think about it while eating first?

411
00:26:24,218 --> 00:26:25,258
Aren't you hungry?

412
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,268
I'm not hungry.

413
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:44,008
You are hungry.

414
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,208
No. I'm sorry. It's because I'm hungry.

415
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:50,678
It's because I'm hungry.

416
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:54,549
I paid the hospital bills.

417
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:56,819
You pay for the meal.

(On-the-spot Tteokbokki)

419
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,498
Did you come to see me that day?

420
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:46,839
Did you need my help?

421
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:48,909
Help?

422
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:53,478
Give me an SOS when you need help.

423
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:56,248
I'll go with the guys who study sports in college.

424
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:03,389
I'm relieved if it wasn't the case.

425
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,669
(Did you come to see me that day?)

426
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:15,369
Right.

427
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,698
This is my fax number.

428
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:22,268
If something happens, fax me at this number.

429
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:26,879
If it's an emergency,

430
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:30,247
page me first.

431
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:32,379
Send "8282" or "505."

432
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:34,389
Then I'll check right away.

433
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,188
Okay?

434
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:45,698
My heart...

435
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:49,099
is fluttering again.

436
00:29:03,248 --> 00:29:06,389
Oh, do you want to part ways here?

437
00:29:07,718 --> 00:29:09,619
Will you be all right though?

438
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:12,559
I mean, can you...

439
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:16,089
go home by yourself?

440
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,099
Right.

441
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:24,038
I shouldn't insist on going to your place just because you aren't well.

442
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:26,138
All right, then.

443
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,639
Make sure you eat a lot.

444
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,438
And don't forget...

445
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:36,079
to take your medicine after each meal.

446
00:29:36,178 --> 00:29:38,119
I hope you recover soon...

447
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:42,518
and become super healthy again.

448
00:29:46,928 --> 00:29:48,028
You smiled for the first time.

449
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:53,768
Oh, it's nothing. Get home safely, then.

450
00:29:59,738 --> 00:30:02,139
Dad, you're supposed to be in love with Yoon Chung Ah!

451
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:04,038
Wait, hold on.

452
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:05,738
Do you know Ha Eun Gyeol?

453
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:08,309
Oh, sorry. One moment.

454
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:17,758
I see.

455
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,228
That's right.

456
00:30:21,758 --> 00:30:23,599
We had a meal together,

457
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:25,359
so we're friends now.

458
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:28,768

459
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,109

461
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,678
He called my name.

462
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:10,839
He called...

463
00:31:12,008 --> 00:31:13,178
my name.

You mentioned someone named Yoon Chung Ah.

468

Why am I supposed to be in love with...

469
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,698
He didn't come home again? What's with this guy?

470
00:32:20,978 --> 00:32:22,049

Gosh, I need some clues.

475
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:43,698
Some telltale clues.

476
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:46,908
My first love was...

477
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:49,808
bright like sunshine and cheerful.

478
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:51,378
He seemed like a tough guy,

479
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:53,138
but he always liked me and no one else.

481
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:56,079
He seemed indifferent and cold from time to time,

482
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:58,548
but he was kind.

(A hopeless slacker)

484
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,818
He was sometimes sensitive,

485
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:03,458
but he had a positive attitude.

486
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:05,957
Darn it.

487
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:08,187

Oh, that's right. He was very good at eating spicy food.

490
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:19,438
I couldn't handle spicy food at all.

491
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:23,839
Once, I saw him eat something as if it wasn't spicy at all,

492
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:25,839
so I stole a bite.

493
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:30,717
My mouth and throat were on fire.

494
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,119

498
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:46,299
I'll use this information to check.

00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,929
"However, we couldn't be together at the time."

548
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:08,928
"I was immature."

549
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:11,138
"I left to study abroad because I loved piano so much."

550
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,009
"I could only look at her from afar like a fool."

551
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:18,779
"Now, I'm on my way to meet her."

552
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:20,149
"Hearing..."

553
00:37:20,348 --> 00:37:24,348
"'100m Before Meeting Her' by Lee Sang Woo..."

554
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:25,819
"will cheer me up."

555
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,018
Barf. What a lame story.

556
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:31,018
This story is from Table Seven.

557
00:37:32,658 --> 00:37:33,658
Where is it?

558
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:40,998
I guess...

559
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:43,498
you don't remember me.

560
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:45,538
No.

561
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,609
Do you like spicy tteokbokki?

562
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:06,118
(Coolis)

563
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:10,399
Do you want to use this to blot your face?

564
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:11,828
Yes, thanks.

565
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:18,637
- Here, thanks. - It's okay. Just keep it.

566
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:19,969
Really? Thanks.

567
00:38:27,578 --> 00:38:29,078
(No Se Bum, the cheesy one with glasses)

568
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:40,859
Oh, this isn't too bad.

569
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:42,687
Don't be so touched.

570
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,957
I found it on the street on my way here.

571
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:45,259
That's the lamest thing I've heard.

572
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,628
Gosh, I already can't stand him.

573
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:49,568
So they call you the Queen of Cello.

574
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:51,368
I thought you got that nickname because of your face,

575
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:53,938
but you're quite clever too.

576
00:38:54,009 --> 00:38:55,009
What's he saying?

577
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:58,408
You said you wanted to see me to give me the photos in person.

578
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:02,308
That was a good one. You have good taste in men.

579
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:06,078
I guess I had been looking at you through colored glasses.

580
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:08,888
You mean, like you're doing now?

581
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:10,887
Hyun Yul.

582
00:39:10,888 --> 00:39:13,657
I heard the spicy chicken feet dish here was very good.

583
00:39:13,658 --> 00:39:14,658
Try it.

584
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:18,727
All right. Since you're practically begging me, I shall try it.

585
00:39:18,728 --> 00:39:20,098
But just know this.

586
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,129
I'm not that easy.

587
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,469
Okay. Try it.

588
00:39:35,348 --> 00:39:38,248
Oh, this one has potential.

589
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:43,419
What's wrong? Is it too spicy?

590
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:45,489
You can't eat it?

591
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,188
Let me warn you.

592
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:51,058
If you have a hidden agenda, give up already.

593
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:52,859
I like older women.

594
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,129
Besides,

595
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:56,767
I have no interest in stealing my friend's girlfriend.

596
00:39:56,768 --> 00:39:58,199
If I could,

597
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:01,568
I'd serve in the military for them. That's how much I love them.

598
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:04,137
My gosh. You mean, you love Yi Chan that much?

599
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:05,679
No, my older lady friends.

600
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:07,279
(Bluffer, Kang Hyun Yul)

601
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:10,578
Are these two the only ones left?

602
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:14,149
One of them likes men.

603
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:18,419
So I'm 99 percent sure that it's Ha Yi Chan.

604
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:20,828
But if it's not him...

605
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,799
Then it means I got this whole thing wrong.

606
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:26,799
Gosh, that wouldn't be good.

607
00:40:29,129 --> 00:40:30,498
Ha Yi Chan, you got this.

608
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:33,598
- Here's your soft tofu stew. - Thank you.

609
00:40:34,368 --> 00:40:35,368
Thank you.

610
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,867
Ladies first.

611
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,808
- Thanks. - My gosh. Thank you.

612
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:41,878
Excuse me. Could I get extra chili powder and chili peppers?

613
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:43,077
- Sure. - Thank you!

614
00:40:43,078 --> 00:40:44,348
I knew it. It's you.

615
00:40:45,518 --> 00:40:46,578
Here.

616
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:47,949
Oh, thank you!

617
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:50,118
- Have a nice day! - Thank you. Enjoy.

618
00:40:50,888 --> 00:40:52,518
- You'll put the whole thing in? - Yes.

619
00:40:53,688 --> 00:40:55,228
About this much? That will do.

620
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:05,469
Oh, my.

621
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:08,839
My gosh. I don't even see a single drop of sweat.

622
00:41:14,748 --> 00:41:15,949
Se Gyeong, aren't you eating too?

623
00:41:16,149 --> 00:41:18,148
What? Oh, yes. I should eat too.

624
00:41:18,149 --> 00:41:19,419
- Eat up. - Okay.

625
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:22,248
Hold on.

626
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:24,788
Shall I check, just to be sure?

627
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:28,288
By the way, what happened to your sidekick?

628
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:29,989
My sidekick?

629
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:31,728
Your live-in tutor.

630
00:41:32,029 --> 00:41:33,868
He wasn't annoying you today, telling you what to do?

631
00:41:34,998 --> 00:41:36,268
He left.

632
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,998
What? He left?

633
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:39,868
That do-gooder packed up and left? Why?

634
00:41:39,938 --> 00:41:41,208
I have no idea.

635
00:41:41,308 --> 00:41:43,808
I really can't figure out what upset him.

636
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:47,009
He lashed out at me and left.

637
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:49,279
But he has no place to go.

638
00:41:52,049 --> 00:41:53,348
You're worried about him, aren't you?

639
00:41:54,518 --> 00:41:55,549
"Worried?"

640
00:41:56,149 --> 00:41:57,359
Who? Me?

641
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:58,658
I'm worried about Ha Eun Gyeol?

642
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:00,958
Why would I worry about him?

643
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:03,899
I feel like I finally removed something stuck between my teeth.

644
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:06,098
Try scratching your head.

645
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:09,498
- My head? Why? - Just do it. Scratch it.

646
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:13,908
Oh, I guess he'll be back soon. You're scratching your forehead.

647
00:42:14,308 --> 00:42:15,868
Why? What does this mean?

648
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:17,408
It's like a biometric navigator.

649
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:20,338
When you're waiting for someone, your body knows.

650
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:23,378
Scratching the back of your head means he won't be back for a while.

651
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:25,649
Scratching the forehead means he'll be back very soon.

652
00:42:29,018 --> 00:42:30,719
Don't worry. He'll be back soon.

653
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:35,658
Thanks for trying to comfort me.

654
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,558
- Let's eat before it gets cold. - Okay.

655
00:42:49,638 --> 00:42:51,878
- Gosh, it's so spicy. - Is it too spicy for you?

656
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:53,977
- Drink this. This helps. - It's so spicy.

657
00:42:53,978 --> 00:42:55,149
Drink up.

658
00:42:56,149 --> 00:42:57,748
Hey, you drank from this earlier.

659
00:42:58,549 --> 00:43:00,347
Spit it out. Here.

660
00:43:00,348 --> 00:43:01,919
- Here are some tissues. - Stop it.

661
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:03,719
(Ha Eun Gyeol)

662
00:43:11,998 --> 00:43:14,169
I didn't double-check, and it bothers me.

663
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:18,038
That's right.

664
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:25,279
(A hopeless slacker)

665
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:27,308
Here it is.

666
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,618
Oh, here's another one.

667
00:43:33,649 --> 00:43:34,848
(Ha Yi Chan)

668
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,859
(Ha Yi Chan)

669
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:43,529
Oh, my.

670
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:48,799
He loves him more than I thought.

671
00:43:49,899 --> 00:43:52,137
I knew it. So it's not you.

672
00:43:52,138 --> 00:43:53,339
(Ha Eun Gyeol)

673
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:55,609
Do you like me?

674
00:43:56,268 --> 00:43:57,279
Hey.

675
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,049
Be honest with me.

676
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,318
Is it me?

677
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:07,719
Or is it Yi Chan?

678
00:44:14,328 --> 00:44:15,388
Hey, you.

679
00:44:16,058 --> 00:44:17,228
You're dangerous.

680
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:19,929
You have a way of making my heart flutter.

681
00:44:24,268 --> 00:44:26,199
My gosh. You're challenging me.

682
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:28,368
Shall I take this off or not?

683
00:44:31,808 --> 00:44:33,038
Shall I take it off?

684
00:44:34,078 --> 00:44:35,078
Or not?

685
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:46,157
(Snail Guesthouse)

686
00:44:46,158 --> 00:44:47,158
I'm home.

687
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:58,868
Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol! Eun Gyeol!

688
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:00,268
Hey, you.

689
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:09,649
Hey! You brat.

690
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:12,048
What about Eun Gyeol? He's not coming back?

691
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:13,118
Whatever.

692
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:15,218
If you want him, you go and look for him.

693
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:17,218
You can't reach him? You don't know where he is?

694
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:18,518
Will he be back today?

695
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,458
Shoot. I have to do the fitting today.

696
00:45:21,629 --> 00:45:24,128
"Fitting?" What do you mean?

697
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:25,498
Eun Gyeol didn't tell you?

698
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,827
I agreed to be the judge for his battle...

699
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:29,129
because he said he'd be my model.

700
00:45:29,368 --> 00:45:31,268
- "Judge for his battle?" - Yes.

701
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:34,509
They told me to bring a judge if I wanted a battle with them.

702
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:38,537
Okay, but why are you asking me?

703
00:45:38,538 --> 00:45:40,808
You said Yi Chan got into music because of you.

704
00:45:42,078 --> 00:45:43,707
Well, that's right.

705
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:46,149
And Yoon Dong Jin became a guitarist thanks to you.

706
00:45:47,288 --> 00:45:50,348
Right. That is true,

707
00:45:51,558 --> 00:45:52,759
but I'm a little busy these days.

708
00:45:53,058 --> 00:45:55,728
As you can see, my presentation is right around the corner,

709
00:45:55,888 --> 00:45:57,658
so I have to finish up my design...

710
00:45:57,699 --> 00:45:59,428
and submit my assignment too.

711
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:00,768
I'll take care of it for you.

712
00:46:01,129 --> 00:46:02,328
- What? - Well...

713
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:04,597
If you have an assignment or need to do research,

714
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:05,698
or if you need an assistant,

715
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:06,799
just tell me.

716
00:46:06,938 --> 00:46:10,108
Goodness. Hey. It may seem easy,

717
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:12,438
but you can't do it unless you're a fashion design major.

718
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:15,808
This battle has to happen no matter what, Bal San.

719
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:18,218
I promised Yi Chan that his band...

720
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:20,078
would be ready to rock and roll before the festival.

721
00:46:20,618 --> 00:46:21,649
So please.

722
00:46:22,618 --> 00:46:24,888
Please help me out.

723
00:46:25,788 --> 00:46:26,788
So?

724
00:46:27,558 --> 00:46:29,827
You said you'd be a judge, and he did your assignment for you?

725
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,598
Hey, get this.

726
00:46:31,828 --> 00:46:33,158
I got an A plus on the assignment...

727
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:35,598
even though my professor is extremely fussy.

728
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:37,739
So?

729
00:46:39,268 --> 00:46:41,268
You're going to make him wear this?

730
00:46:41,408 --> 00:46:43,238
- Yes. - To make people laugh?

731
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:46,279
No. I want him to be my model at my presentation.

732
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:47,378
What is this, a penalty?

733
00:46:47,379 --> 00:46:49,048
Have you got a death wish?

734
00:46:49,049 --> 00:46:50,948
Darn you. He's a good-looking guy.

735
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:53,617
Must you make him wear this hideous outfit? He'll be embarrassed.

736
00:46:53,618 --> 00:46:55,247
Hey, it's a fair deal!

737
00:46:55,248 --> 00:46:56,718
Fair, my foot.

738
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:58,057
The battle is over now.

739
00:46:58,058 --> 00:46:59,388
So is your deal.

740
00:46:59,658 --> 00:47:01,328
Why do you keep making him do things for free?

741
00:47:01,788 --> 00:47:03,928
Hey, what do you mean he's doing this for free?

742
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:05,727
I paid him fairly...

743
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:08,768
for his labor. This is like his part-time job!

744
00:47:09,228 --> 00:47:11,669
"Part-time job?" You paid him fairly?

745
00:47:11,868 --> 00:47:13,239
Hey, didn't you know?

746
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:15,609
Eun Gyeol took on a side gig at the guesthouse.

747
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,038
What? When?

748
00:47:22,779 --> 00:47:24,618
You know, I heard you helped Bal San...

749
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:26,649
get an A plus.

750
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:29,688
Can you help me too?

751
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:33,358
Oh, that. I had to help him because I had a bit of a situation.

752
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,258
It's just a short essay.

753
00:47:35,259 --> 00:47:36,988
About 8 to 10 pages.

754
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:39,227
It's part of the course too. I suggest you write it yourself.

755
00:47:39,228 --> 00:47:40,399
You sure know how to negotiate.

756
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:43,629
Okay. How about a dollar per page?

757
00:47:44,098 --> 00:47:45,098
Deal?

758
00:47:46,768 --> 00:47:48,937
Then I'll write ten pages. Deal?

759
00:47:48,938 --> 00:47:49,969
We have a deal.

760
00:47:52,638 --> 00:47:54,778
Department of Mathematics...

761
00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:56,379
(Essay on Popular Culture)

762
00:48:02,919 --> 00:48:03,949
One moment.

763
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,359
- Jung Young Woo. - Yes.

764
00:48:09,688 --> 00:48:10,688
Kim Se Young.

765
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:13,558
- Hong Chang Soo. - Yes.

766
00:48:18,498 --> 00:48:19,498
Count them and check.

767
00:48:38,658 --> 00:48:40,588
He's that greedy for money?

768
00:48:40,589 --> 00:48:42,628
Hey, who doesn't like money?

769
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:44,089
I wouldn't call him greedy.

770
00:48:45,058 --> 00:48:46,929
He had his reason.

771
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:48,228
What was his reason?

772
00:48:48,328 --> 00:48:50,368
I want to buy Yi Chan a guitar.

773
00:48:50,598 --> 00:48:51,638
What?

774
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:54,738
I already gave him a guitar.

775
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:57,937
Oh, that. It soaked up moisture, so it doesn't sound so good.

776
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:01,307
Hey, it's good enough for a mediocre guitarist like him.

777
00:49:01,308 --> 00:49:04,247
Come on, Bal San. A band has to look cool.

778
00:49:04,248 --> 00:49:05,879
We may be broke, but we're cool.

779
00:49:05,978 --> 00:49:08,319
Yi Chan is so lucky.

780
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:11,518
You're like his lucky charm that suddenly landed in his lap.

781
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:12,719
You're tutoring him.

782
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:14,228
You started the band for him...

783
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:15,629
and want to buy him a guitar.

784
00:49:15,728 --> 00:49:17,998
Why are you so good to him?

785
00:49:18,299 --> 00:49:19,429
Tell me. I want to know.

786
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:21,399
He said he wanted to twinkle.

787
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:22,998
What?

788
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:25,868
He said this could be the last chapter of his youth.

789
00:49:26,638 --> 00:49:28,208
He'll start making money upon graduation.

790
00:49:28,938 --> 00:49:31,308
So before that, he wants to do everything he's ever wanted to do,

791
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:32,679
which is why...

792
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,848
I want him to shine.

793
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:42,788
First, on stage.

794
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:47,188
I nearly burst into tears because I was so touched by his words.

795
00:49:48,429 --> 00:49:50,129
Hey, be good to him.

796
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,699
He's a nice guy.

797
00:49:52,828 --> 00:49:54,029
On top of being multitalented,

798
00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:56,598
he's such a nice, caring person.

799
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:58,438
Even if he gets home very late, let me know.

800
00:50:01,438 --> 00:50:03,368
Oh, boy.

801
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:12,319
(Snail Guesthouse)

802
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,799
I want him to shine.

803
00:50:59,899 --> 00:51:01,598
First, on stage.

804
00:51:02,728 --> 00:51:04,228
Then in life.

805
00:51:11,138 --> 00:51:13,339
(Baekwang High School)

806
00:51:13,808 --> 00:51:16,248
First, I want the five-drum set and a large drum right here.

807
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,919
I want Se Gyeong to experience a magnificent performance.

808
00:51:19,049 --> 00:51:20,148
What are you selling?

809
00:51:20,149 --> 00:51:21,518
Don't you need a snake and a pipe too?

810
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:23,948
Percussion instruments are the only kind of musical instrument...

811
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:25,759
that can prove that the heart isn't a vestigial organ.

812
00:51:26,089 --> 00:51:27,118
Forget it.

813
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:29,758
We need two pianos. Here and this spot here.

814
00:51:29,759 --> 00:51:31,828
And we'll use a synth, so pay attention to the sound quality.

815
00:51:32,129 --> 00:51:34,398
Who is Cindy? Why is she performing with us?

816
00:51:34,399 --> 00:51:36,998
A synthesizer, you idiot!

817
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:38,767
It's a musical instrument, not a person.

818
00:51:38,768 --> 00:51:40,568
It's very expensive.

819
00:51:40,569 --> 00:51:42,238
Gosh, you know nothing about music.

820
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:44,068
Hyun Yul, is there anything you need to prepare?

821
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:45,339
What? No, I'm good.

822
00:51:46,038 --> 00:51:48,208
I don't need to impress Se Gyeong.

823
00:51:48,449 --> 00:51:49,879
I'll just flaunt my skills.

824
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:54,648
Hyun Yul, you're my last hope.

825
00:51:54,649 --> 00:51:57,858
Oh, I have a small wish though.

826
00:51:57,859 --> 00:51:58,859
Okay, what is it?

827
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,418
A solo part with a pin spotlight...

828
00:52:00,419 --> 00:52:02,728
shining down on me and no one else.

829
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:05,098
That's it. It's about eight minutes long.

830
00:52:05,429 --> 00:52:07,668
- So you want to impress her too! - So you want to impress her too!

831
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:08,727
Calm down.

832
00:52:08,728 --> 00:52:09,868
What are you guys doing?

833
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:12,239
Hey, you're here.

834
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:15,669
How come you came alone? Where is Eun Gyeol?

835
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:18,109
Eun Gyeol has gone AWOL.

836
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:20,908
I can't reach him. He's gone.

837
00:52:21,248 --> 00:52:22,308
- What? - What?

838
00:52:22,578 --> 00:52:24,078
Eun Gyeol has gone AWOL?

839
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:25,748
And you haven't heard from him at all?

840
00:52:26,478 --> 00:52:28,248
Does it mean we can't practice today?

841
00:52:28,518 --> 00:52:29,887
That's not important now.

842
00:52:29,888 --> 00:52:32,187
It means we don't even know when and if he'll come back.

843
00:52:32,188 --> 00:52:33,489
He'll come back soon.

844
00:52:34,058 --> 00:52:36,028
Let's practice without him and wait...

845
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:37,157
Until when?

846
00:52:37,158 --> 00:52:38,798
Until our hair turns gray?

847
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:41,298
Hey, what if he never comes back? What if he's gone for good?

848
00:52:41,299 --> 00:52:44,228
Darn it. Are you saying we should give up on the performance?

849
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:46,699
Darn.

850
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:51,779
Se Gyeong might come.

851
00:52:55,949 --> 00:52:58,379
I wanted to impress Se Gyeong.

852
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:02,549
Let's swap him out.

853
00:53:03,788 --> 00:53:05,658
- What do you mean? - Let's get a new guitarist.

854
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:08,287
What?

855
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:10,228
I'll bring the guitarist from my choir.

856
00:53:10,828 --> 00:53:12,899
If he starts practicing with us today, he'll catch up in no time.

857
00:53:13,498 --> 00:53:15,028
Yes, let's do that.

858
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:16,327
That's a very realistic solution.

859
00:53:16,328 --> 00:53:18,038
- Hey! - You scared me.

860
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,839
You guys are so mean.

861
00:53:22,368 --> 00:53:24,908
Hey, how could you be so heartless?

862
00:53:25,408 --> 00:53:27,908
We pledged to stay together, but our comember has disappeared.

863
00:53:28,348 --> 00:53:29,678
How could you say you'd replace him...

864
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:31,348
instead of worrying about him first?

865
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:33,848
Is the band a joke to you guys?

866
00:53:34,649 --> 00:53:37,088
Is it just bait to hook up with girls...

867
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:38,558
Is the band a joke to you?

868
00:53:39,058 --> 00:53:40,589
Is it just bait to hook up with a girl?

869
00:53:42,558 --> 00:53:44,498
Do you think you have the right to say that to us?

870
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:47,557
After all, you were the one who kicked out Eun Gyeol!

871
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:48,928
And you completely ignored him...

872
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,498
to impress Se Gyeong.

873
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:53,569
Hey, front man.

874
00:53:54,368 --> 00:53:56,669
So what do you want to do?

875
00:53:58,078 --> 00:53:59,109
What?

876
00:53:59,478 --> 00:54:01,248
What's your solution?

877
00:54:01,848 --> 00:54:03,049
Do you even have an alternative?

878
00:54:03,248 --> 00:54:05,179
Have you ever come up with a plan for anything?

879
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,988
If you're our front man,

880
00:54:07,989 --> 00:54:10,488
pick a direction and start paddling already.

881
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,589
We're all about to drown because of you!

882
00:54:14,759 --> 00:54:15,958
We do need to decide.

883
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:17,859
What should we do?

884
00:54:18,199 --> 00:54:19,698
Shall we find a new member or...

885
00:54:19,699 --> 00:54:20,699
Shut it.

886
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:23,629
Only Ha Eun Gyeol can be the main guitarist of our band.

887
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:26,339
I will find him no matter what.

888
00:54:26,998 --> 00:54:28,637
I will find Eun Gyeol at all costs...

889
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:30,637
and bring him back!

890
00:54:30,638 --> 00:54:32,109

Hold on. Come to think of it,

899
00:55:22,328 --> 00:55:24,828
it was because of him that I started pretending...

900
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:26,699
that I was Mom.

901
00:55:27,098 --> 00:55:28,098

902

- You are Choi Se Gyeong. - No, I'm not.

903
00:55:35,569 --> 00:55:36,638
My gosh.

904
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:39,978
It is you. Don't you know who I am?

00:55:40,078 --> 00:55:43,549
Had he not called me by that name that day,

906
00:55:44,078 --> 00:55:46,319
I wouldn't have fallen for...

907
00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:48,418
No, that came out wrong.

908
00:55:48,419 --> 00:55:51,918
Anyway, I wouldn't even have thought to look for Mom's first love.

909
00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:52,957
Also...

910
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:54,117
You moved to the US without saying goodbye.

911
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:55,327
You're not supposed to come back,

912
00:55:55,328 --> 00:55:56,988
but you came back, and you're here now.

913
00:55:56,989 --> 00:55:58,958
What is going on?

914
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:03,497
I got a sense that he knew a lot about Mom.

915
00:56:03,498 --> 00:56:06,998
Something told me that they probably had a very special relationship.

916
00:56:07,938 --> 00:56:09,038
There's only one way.

917
00:56:09,308 --> 00:56:11,978
I must find Ha Eun Gyeol and check it myself.

918
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,279
Please leave a message after the tone.

919
00:56:17,279 --> 00:56:19,248
Hi, Yi Chan! What are you up to?

920
00:56:19,518 --> 00:56:21,449
Can we meet at that cafe at around 7pm?

921
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:23,148
I'll wait to hear from you.

922
00:56:23,149 --> 00:56:24,919
Page me as soon as you get this message.

923
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:28,227
Okay.

924

932
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:47,808

Hello, did you just page me at 0130?

936
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:11,838
I saw the poster.

937
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,069
You're looking for Ha Eun Gyeol, right?

938
00:57:13,899 --> 00:57:15,009
Yes, that's right.

939
00:57:15,408 --> 00:57:16,609
Do you know where he is now?

940
00:57:17,038 --> 00:57:19,708
Gosh, he'll flip out if he finds out that I told you.

941
00:57:20,578 --> 00:57:22,707
There is a reward though, right?

942
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,279
Yes, for sure.

943
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:26,549

00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:37,018
Nice to meet you.

953

954

How would I know?

956
00:58:57,609 --> 00:59:00,109
Are you naive or dumb?

957
00:59:00,438 --> 00:59:01,949
You're just after money, aren't you?

958
00:59:02,109 --> 00:59:04,379
Bingo.

959
00:59:05,549 --> 00:59:08,148
Now that it's all out in the open,

960
00:59:08,149 --> 00:59:09,489
let's get down to business, okay?

961
00:59:09,688 --> 00:59:11,557
Hand over all the money you have,

962

and we'll let you go in one piece.

963

I don't have any money.

964
00:59:15,228 --> 00:59:16,429
Even if I did, I wouldn't give you a penny.

This is the problem with high school kids in this country.

966

When you're nice to them, they just assume that you're actually nice.

Oh, you're glaring at me.

968
00:59:30,438 --> 00:59:33,138
Guys, what are you waiting for? We don't have time.

969
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:40,319
- Come on. - Get up.

970
00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:55,969
Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you all right?

971
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:01,267
Wait, hold on.

972
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:02,768
You can't leave like that!

973
01:00:05,438 --> 01:00:06,438
Shoot.

I will give you the best band as a present.

I will make your youth twinkle just like your wish.

981

Do what I say just this once. Please?

982
01:01:41,808 --> 01:01:43,268
You just need to be careful this year. Okay?

983
01:01:45,438 --> 01:01:47,708
I'll keep you safe no matter what.

984
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:48,949
Just for a year.

985
01:01:49,879 --> 01:01:51,748
Just for one year, not your whole life.

986
01:01:52,348 --> 01:01:54,748
Can't you even stay by my side just for one year?

987
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:18,879
Good job.

988
01:02:20,478 --> 01:02:22,248
I got it. I'll help you then.

989
01:02:22,408 --> 01:02:23,778
I'll do a band with you.

990
01:02:23,779 --> 01:02:25,919
I'll teach you how to play guitar. I'll do everything for you.

Today is our first day together.

992
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:37,529
You said you'd keep me safe.

993
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:42,929
You said you'd help me get into college...

994
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,138
and that we should start a band together.

995
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:53,578

It's 2023. Why?

1002

Did you say 2023?

1003
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,268
Not 1995?

1004

No, not that I know of.
