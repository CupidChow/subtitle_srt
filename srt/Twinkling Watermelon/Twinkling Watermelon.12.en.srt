So, that...

13
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:04,994
was true?

Don't worry.

21
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:00,743

Hey, can you handle the consequences?

23
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,154
Once Do Jin finds out that you lied, you're dead meat.

24
00:02:05,314 --> 00:02:07,213
If that happens, I should really call the police.

Then you should've called it in...

28
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:15,124
- way before this happened... - Shouldn't you clean up the mess?

See you guys back at school at noon.

47
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:40,214
Hey. Are you saying we should go home now, looking like this?

48
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:42,913
Hey, what a way to worry our parents.

49
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:46,784
That's true.

51
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:50,983
Yes.

52
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:53,922
So you guys extorted money from other kids, engaged in fistfights,

53
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:56,263
broke into empty cars together back in middle school.

54
00:03:56,663 --> 00:04:00,133
But you quit all that once you started the band.

55
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:02,362
And he thinks he went to juvie...

56
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:04,034
because you reported him to the police?

57
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,233
Correct.

58
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,603
But you never reported him to the police?

59
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:10,442
That's right. But Do Jin probably knows too.

60
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:11,873
That I wasn't the one who called it in.

61
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:13,874
Then why haven't you cleared up the misunderstanding?

62
00:04:15,244 --> 00:04:17,814
He needs someone to take his anger out on. That's why.

63
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:21,453
To him, I'm a traitor anyway.

64
00:04:21,454 --> 00:04:23,483
Not breaking into empty cars with him doesn't make you a traitor.

65
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:27,292
Shoot. What if he shows up at our performance and causes a scene?

66
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:28,363
Don't worry.

67
00:04:28,663 --> 00:04:31,024
He may be reckless, but he's not stupid.

68
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:33,834
He absolutely can't cause trouble while he's still on probation.

69
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:35,163
He, of all people, knows that.

70
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:36,733
You won't go back...

71
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:39,373
- to your old ways, right? - What?

72
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:43,474
No.

73
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:46,872
You don't have a Jindo dog tattoo, do you?

74
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,742
- No. - Are you sure?

75
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:50,714
Hey! I really don't have such a tattoo.

76
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:52,784
Why don't you search my body if you don't believe me?

77
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:56,729
What? What is this now?

78
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,025
- Hey! - Come here!

79
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,124
- Looking nice. - What do you think?

80
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,995
- Doesn't it look nice? - Yes.

81
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:11,065
- Let me see. - Here.

82
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:14,936
- Just press it once. - Oh, this is cool.

83
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:39,556
- Am I really your dad? - What?

84
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:43,596
You said I was your dad, and you were my son.

85
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:47,435
You said you knew my future...

86
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:49,666
and that you found out how to change my life.

87
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,575
That's why you wanted to cancel the rehearsal.

88
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:54,575
How did you know?

89
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:57,306
How did you show up, knowing I'd get hurt?

90
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:01,686
The truth is...

91
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:05,486
My father doesn't like that I'm in a band.

92
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:10,786
So I ran away from home in the heat of the moment.

93
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:12,796
But the thing is,

94
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:16,296
he found out the date of our rehearsal.

95
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:20,065
If I get caught, he'll send me to a school abroad.

96
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,004
So I had no choice but to lie to you.

97
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:25,705
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,075
- Are you telling me the truth? - Yes, it's true.

99
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:29,806
- For real? - Yes, for real.

100
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:35,085
I knew it. Gosh, you almost had me fooled.

101
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:36,845
My gosh.

102
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,585
I can't believe I almost fell for such a lie.

103
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:42,725
Hold on. You're so dead.

104
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:45,496
How dare you rope Se Gyeong into something like that?

105
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:46,655
You promised me...

106
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,595
you wouldn't see her until the day of the festival!

107
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:50,025
Hey! You little...

108
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:53,894
What?

109
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:56,135
Hey, the movie is about to start. Where are you going?

110
00:06:56,635 --> 00:06:57,866
Hey, Eun Gyeol!

111
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:04,046
Hey! Where are you going, naked?

112
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:23,064
Se Gyeong! I know you're inside.

113
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:24,996
Come out for a moment. I need to talk to you!

114
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:28,365
Se Gyeong! One moment would do.

115
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,635
- Choi Se Gyeong! - Be quiet, or I'll call the police!

116
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:40,915
I'm sorry.

00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,314
(Woori Mart)

118
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:43,846
I wronged you, big time.

119
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:47,285
The truth is, there's something I can't tell you...

120
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:50,585
No, I'll tell you. I'm just going to tell you everything.

121
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:53,596
To tell you the truth, I was worried Yi Chan would get into an accident.

122
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:54,965
So I... No.

123
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:57,394
I scrambled to get the rehearsal canceled,

124
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:58,866
but they got together again to rehearse.

125
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:00,765
I mean...

126
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,083
Anyway, I'm sorry.

127
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:10,574
Go ahead and beat me up if you want to.

128
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:12,374
Cuss me out all you want.

129
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,246
I don't care what you do if it can make you feel better.

130
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:16,815
Just don't avoid me, please.

131
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:18,986
Give me a chance to apologize to you in person...

132
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,255
(Who is the bandsman Mom loved?)

133
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,166
There's something you don't know.

134
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:33,565
There's nothing I hate more...

135
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:37,006
than being abandoned.

136
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:50,646
I was so preoccupied with Dad's accident...

137
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:53,615
that I let my other missions slip my mind.

138
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,955
I must make Mom smile...

139
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,526
and make sure Mom and Dad can end up together.

140
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:06,896
And to do that, I must make sure Se Gyeong stays away from Dad.

141
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:10,166
- And... - Talk about a cat thief.

142
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:16,046
I thought I'd successfully kicked you out. Was I wrong?

143
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,546
I must free Mom from that witch too.

144
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:20,475
Since you're here anyway, empty the guest room.

145
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,485
Get your things and leave.

146
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:27,455
I never said I'd move out.

147
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:35,825
You didn't go to school and didn't come home without a word.

148
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:37,994
Do I need another reason to kick you out?

149
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:41,065
I faxed the details to Chairman Yoon and got his permission in advance.

150
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:43,906
I told you.

151
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:46,436
Chairman Yoon is my employer.

152
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:48,105
Move out.

153
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,545
Leave quietly while I'm still treating you like a human being.

154
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:52,615
I told you that Chung Ah was the only person in this household...

155
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:55,015
that I cared about.

156
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:56,444
Shall I get you dragged out?

157
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:58,556
Who are you to tell him to move out?

158
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:04,386
Welcome home, Mr. Chairman.

159
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:06,926
Did you have a good business trip?

160
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:09,824
You should wait in the study.

161
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,296
I'd like to talk to you in private.

162
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:12,636
Yes, sir.

163
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:17,965
Since when...

164
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:20,536
did you start acting like you were the one calling the shots?

165
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:23,376
- Mr. Chairman. - Who gave you such authority?

166
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:27,845
I'm sure you've already looked into it,

167
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:30,386
but he's a nobody from goodness knows where.

168
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:32,155
Because he thinks you've got his back,

169
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:34,416
he's being incredibly arrogant.

170
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:38,796
More importantly, your two grown daughters live here too.

171
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:41,964
You're always very cautious when it comes to hiring new people.

172
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:43,165
I can't believe you hired that boy.

173
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,135
I clearly told you not to try to change my mind...

174
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:46,864
about him staying with us.

175
00:10:46,865 --> 00:10:48,865
- Mr. Chairman. - End of discussion!

176
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:53,176
Mr. Chairman.

177
00:10:58,105 --> 00:10:59,146
They say...

178
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:04,245
blood is thicker than water. I hope that's not why you're fond of him.

179
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:11,656
With that remark,

180
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:15,095
you flat out insulted Ju Yeop and Sang A...

181
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,426
while making me look like a despicable scumbag.

182
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:19,796
Are you satisfied?

183
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:30,376
- Pardon me? - I'm terminating our agreement.

184
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:34,516
But there are still five days left in the agreement.

185
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:38,085
It's too slow. When investing, timing is everything.

186
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:43,085
Sir, you probably don't know this,

187
00:11:43,256 --> 00:11:45,725
but Chung Ah has changed a lot.

188
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:47,425
Her sign language has improved a lot,

189
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:48,795
and she has many friends now.

190
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:50,324
She has learned to open up to others,

191
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:51,465
and most importantly,

192
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:53,865
she smiles often now.

193
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:56,365
I suppose you've forgotten the terms of our agreement.

194
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,474
You promised to show me her smile.

195
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:02,375
You're away so often because of your work trips.

196
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:05,046
Shall I forget about the company and stay home every day, then?

197
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,016
In any case, this is not fair.

198
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:10,484
The head of a conglomerate...

199
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:12,114
wrongfully dismissing a young employee like this...

200
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:14,084
So I'd like to extend it by one month.

201
00:12:14,085 --> 00:12:15,756
Then I'll have to report you to the Labor Board...

202
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:19,125
Pardon me? You'd like to extend it?

203
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:21,926
We'll cancel the original agreement and extend it by one month.

204
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:25,636
However, I'll be tweaking the terms and conditions.

205
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:26,965
The terms and conditions?

206
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:28,965
How?

207
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,776
She has to smile at me.

208
00:12:33,276 --> 00:12:34,306
Who?

209
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:36,506
Chung Ah?

210
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:38,546
Why? You don't think you can do it?

211
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:44,146
I'll try.

212
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,756
All right, that's it. You can go.

213
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:54,525
- Sir. - I won't help you.

214
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:55,725
Figure things out on your own.

215
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:57,626
I really want you to see it.

216
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,735
See what?

217
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:01,195
Chung Ah's smile.

218
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:04,605
She has such a pretty smile.

219
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:29,695
Which one did I like more before I left to go study abroad?

220
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:30,965
Ha Eun Gyeol.

221
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:34,166
I have no doubt that Eun Gyeol is the one she likes.

222
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:38,065
(Ha Eun Gyeol)

223
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:40,376
Ha Eun Gyeol.

224
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:42,645
I'm certain...

225
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:45,215
that Se Gyeong will choose Eun Gyeol today, not Yi Chan.

226
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:56,686
You'll come to the festival today, right?

227
00:13:58,056 --> 00:13:59,656
Yes, I'll be there.

228
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:08,735
I won't let Mom cry, no matter what.

229
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:10,906
I must do whatever it takes...

230
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:13,835
to win Se Gyeong's heart before the festival begins.

231
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:17,776
Se Gyeong!

232
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:20,416
Are you going to the festival at Baekwang High later today?

233
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:23,185
Well, I guess you're going.

234
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:26,214
What? Why would I go there?

235
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:27,585
Clearly, you're going.

236
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,055
Well, if you say you're going,

237
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:33,155
I should probably go with you.

238
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:35,526
I mean, I can't let you walk into the wolves' den all by yourself.

239
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,165
You don't really look like you care whether or not I'll be there.

240
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,166
What do you mean? What do I look like, then?

241
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:43,335
You look like an outcast trying so hard...

242
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,735
to fit in.

243
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:49,176
What does that mean? Is that supposed to be a compliment?

244
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:52,315
What does it mean? Se Gyeong.

245
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:55,815
Se Gyeong. Answer me, will you?

246
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:05,026
Se Gyeong, can we talk?

247
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:07,955
Hi, good morning.

248
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,865
What was that? Did she use sign language just now?

249
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:16,006
Is she out of her mind? What if people think she's deaf?

250
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:19,835
Sorry. Get going.

251
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:24,006
Something's going on between those two, right?

252
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:25,445
You must know something.

253
00:15:26,345 --> 00:15:29,085
Those little... Hey!

254
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:32,686
Se Gyeong, let's talk.

255
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:36,056
I'll tell you everything.

256
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:40,725
I said I'd tell you my secret when the time was right.

257
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:43,065
I'll tell you all about it now.

258
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:48,136
I don't know if you'll believe me,

259
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:51,835
- but I'm actually... - My parents got a divorce.

260
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:53,275
What?

261
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:55,806
And they fought over me for a whole year.

262
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,475
I thought they loved me,

263
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:00,215
but I was wrong.

264
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:02,416
They both had their own goals and agendas.

265
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:05,915
My dad didn't want to look like a bad person who abandoned his child,

266
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,926
and my mom needed a fancy accessory that could make her life shine.

267
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:10,725
I'm done being the girl...

268
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:14,396
who is only loved when she is needed or useful.

269
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:17,926
I don't want to be anyone's trophy, war booty, or accessory.

270
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:19,396
That's not what I'm doing.

271
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:21,396
- I'm... - This is like a hunting game.

272
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:23,364
What?

273
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,575
All men like to trophy-hunt.

274
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:28,136
Don't say you're different.

275
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:30,245
You're not any different.

276
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:32,145
You'd stuff the animals you caught,

277
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:34,175
hang them on your wall, and boast about how you hunted them.

278
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,385
When you get tired of it, you won't care...

279
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:36,585
whether they collect dust or disappear.

280
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,916
You'll just neglect them.

281
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:41,016
- Se Gyeong. - Give up already.

282
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:43,355
I will not let you catch me.

283
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:46,095
I do not want to get stuffed and hung on someone's wall.

284
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:50,626
So?

285
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,495
Will you choose Yi Chan?

286
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,536
Why do you care?

287
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:01,876
Then don't come to the festival.

288
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:07,115
If you're coming, you have to choose me.

289
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:09,146
Get lost.

290
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:11,245
Don't you dare tell me what to do.

291
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:27,735
Hey.

292
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:30,235
Were you waiting for me?

293
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:32,376
Why? Do you need to talk to me about something?

294
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:35,505
You know, today...

295
00:17:36,176 --> 00:17:38,045
You'll choose Eun Gyeol, right?

296
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:42,816
No, bet your money on Yi Chan.

297
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,686
It's just between you and me.

298
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:53,295
From now on, I'm only going to focus on my mission.

299
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:55,566
I'll only think about the mission.

300
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:03,964
- Watermelons are here! - Watermelons!

301
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:07,704
- Sweet, fresh watermelons! - Watermelons!

302
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:10,004
- Watermelons that can sing well... - We can sing well!

303
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,044
- and play great music! - We can play music!

304
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:14,014
Delicious watermelons are here!

305
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:15,484
- We're here! - We're here!

306
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:18,085
This evening at 5pm.

307
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:19,214
What time?

308
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:20,514
- At 5pm! - At 5pm!

309
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:21,885
One more time. What time?

310
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:23,224
- At 5pm! - At 5pm!

311
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:24,984
All right. Where?

312
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:26,855
- The gymnasium! - The gymnasium!

313
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,366
Come and watch us perform at the festival.

314
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,366
All right, We are...

315
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:34,264
Come and watch us perform!

316
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:35,905
Who are we?

317
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,936
- Watermelon Sugar! - Watermelon Sugar!

318
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,175
- Viva! - La vida!

319
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:42,475
- Watermelon! - Sugar!

320
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,044
We are...

321
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:45,714
- Superstar Watermelon... - Superstar Watermelon...

322
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:48,146
- Sugar! - Sugar!

323
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:52,356
- Yes! Hello! - Hi!

324
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:53,755
Yes, you should all come!

325
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:55,785
Everyone, come and watch us perform.

326
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:01,155
- Can I get one too? - Here.

327
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,964
- So who's coming? - Me!

328
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:05,534
Wait, hold on. Excuse me.

329
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,095
- Here you go. - I want one too.

330
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:09,735
(Baekwang High School's 25th Anniversary, Sparkling Festival)

331
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:14,176
Surprise.

332
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:17,275
You came really early.

333
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:22,116
Shall I give you a tour of my school?

334
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:29,156
I have to go back to school.

335
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:31,455
They suddenly decided to hold a supplementary class.

336
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:34,896
"School?" "Class?"

337
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:38,465
Oh, I see. You have to go back to school?

338
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,765
What? Then...

339
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:47,975
Why did you come here so early?

340
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:01,316
My gosh.

341
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:08,326
Gosh, this is so cool!

342
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,166
Is this for me?

343
00:20:14,535 --> 00:20:15,565
It's my gift to you.

344
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,936
"Gift?" That's what it means, right?

345
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:22,245
Did you make these for me?

346
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:26,515
Thank you. Seriously, thanks a lot.

347
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:29,285
I'll definitely use this when I perform later.

348
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,686
Like this.

349
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:35,086
Oh, right. You'll come and see us perform later, right?

350
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:39,955
You'll come to my performance, right?

351
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:43,965
No, I won't be there.

352
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:49,406
You have to come.

353
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:53,176
Come and clap along like this... No.

354
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:55,576
Do this.

355
00:20:58,205 --> 00:20:59,245
No.

356
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:03,886
Today, I can't twinkle like you.

357
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:07,886
See you later.

358
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:19,765
It was great knowing you, Yi Chan.

359
00:21:20,795 --> 00:21:22,235
Good luck with your performance.

360
00:21:23,336 --> 00:21:24,366
And...

361
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:43,686
I hope you win.

362
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:58,534
(Buy Watermelon Sugar souvenirs.)

363
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:00,775
(Selling souvenirs chosen by Choi Se Gyeong)

364
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:06,575
Hey, I told you to put Eun Gyeol's photo at the front.

365
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:07,815
Do you not know how to sell things?

366
00:22:07,816 --> 00:22:09,346
It's like a bait item, you dummy.

367
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:11,885
- To make girls open their wallets. - Hello.

368
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:13,655
He's like the epitome of freshness.

369
00:22:13,656 --> 00:22:14,784
Whatever. Put these away.

370
00:22:14,785 --> 00:22:16,485
I'll donate these to the spirit photography club.

371
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:18,586
- Hey, you're here. - Yes.

372
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:20,596
Sorry. Cleaning took longer than I thought.

373
00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:21,826
Where's Yi Chan?

374
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:23,765
Gosh, I'm so popular.

375
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:25,994
Everyone's looking for me, wherever I go.

376
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:28,635
Hey, we're so busy. Where have you been?

377
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:30,504
I had to stop by the woodworking room to make something.

378
00:22:30,505 --> 00:22:32,906
- What did you make? - Try and find it.

379
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,936
Gosh, this is so cool. Where did you get this?

380
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:36,705
Hey, I don't know.

381
00:22:36,805 --> 00:22:38,275
Chung Ah gave it to me and left.

382
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:40,815
Mom... I mean, Chung Ah was here?

383
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:43,944
Yes. She's very professional.

384
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,955
See? She takes such good care of the frontman.

385
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:49,025
What should I do? I haven't even reconciled with Se Gyeong yet.

386
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:51,024
Why didn't you bring her here? Why are you here alone?

387
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:53,254
She had to go back to her class. She'll come back after her class.

388
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:54,295
She's got a class?

389
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:56,665
Oh, no. The rumor was true.

390
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,525
Rumor? What rumor?

391
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:00,595
Seowon Arts High is notorious for doing this.

392
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:01,794
They suddenly hold supplementary classes...

393
00:23:01,795 --> 00:23:03,436
whenever there's a school festival in the area.

394
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:05,406
- Why? - What do you think?

395
00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:07,605
Getting excited about festivals could negatively impact...

396
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:08,905
their students' grades,

397
00:23:08,906 --> 00:23:10,906
and they don't want their students to date and cause trouble.

398
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:13,515
What? Does that mean Se Gyeong might not make it?

399
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:17,545
Hey, a model student like Se Gyeong won't skip her supplementary class.

400
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:18,816
You idiot.

401
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,954
No wonder...

402
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:25,225
I didn't really see anyone wearing Seowon Arts High's uniform.

403
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:29,896
We're doomed. We failed.

404
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,365
Gosh, what should we do?

405
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:35,295
We need to sell everything here to cover our costs.

406
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:36,935
It's okay, guys.

407
00:23:36,936 --> 00:23:38,705
As our frontman said,

408
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:41,034
"If you push the wall, it becomes a bridge. If you fall..."

409
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:42,304
Oh, Choi Se Gyeong is here!

410
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:44,345
- What? Choi Se Gyeong? - What?

411
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:46,714
- My gosh! - Se Gyeong!

412
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:47,916
- Come on, quick! - Se Gyeong!

413
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:51,115
- Oh, my. - There she is.

414
00:23:51,116 --> 00:23:53,086
- Hey, that's Choi Se Gyeong. - She's really pretty.

415
00:23:53,586 --> 00:23:55,015
- My gosh. - She's so pretty.

416
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:57,455
Where you fall...

417
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:01,396
You will find a hidden treasure!

418
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:12,835
Se Gyeong, you came.

419
00:24:12,836 --> 00:24:14,775
Of course, I promised you that I would.

420
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:16,975
- My gosh. - Oh, my.

421
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:18,504
Se Gyeong, can we talk?

422
00:24:18,505 --> 00:24:21,015
Just so you know, this has nothing to do with the bet.

423
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:23,416
You'd better do a good job with your performance today.

424
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:28,856
Of course. You know who the performance is for.

425
00:24:30,326 --> 00:24:31,524
- Hey. - Oh, right.

426
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:34,554
We still have plenty of time. Shall I give you a tour of the school?

427
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:36,525
- Sure! - Or do you want to see our booth?

428
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:38,724
Well, give me a tour of your school first...

429
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:40,034
I'll give you a tour. Spare me a moment...

430
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:42,464
Actually, I want to check out your booth first.

431
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:43,665
Let's go. Where is it, Ma Joo?

432
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,906
Follow me!

433
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:46,106
Let's go!

434
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:49,775
- Let's go! - Let's go!

435
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:51,304
This is it here.

436
00:24:51,305 --> 00:24:53,075
This is your booth. It looks nice.

437
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,275
You guys did a good job.

438
00:24:55,376 --> 00:24:56,385
Look, Se Gyeong.

439
00:24:56,386 --> 00:24:58,645
I displayed the photos you took.

440
00:24:58,646 --> 00:25:01,055
I see. But you guys haven't sold a single one.

441
00:25:01,656 --> 00:25:02,754
Shall I be your first customer?

442
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:04,086
- Really? - Yes.

443
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,096
Hold on.

444
00:25:06,225 --> 00:25:08,954
Let's see. First, I want Ma Joo's photo.

445
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:09,965
Yes!

446
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,465
Next, Se Bum.

447
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:13,295
Hyun Yul.

448

451
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:19,474
And my cute Yi Chan.

(Ha Eun Gyeol)

453
00:25:20,906 --> 00:25:23,304
All right, that would do. Can I get the T-shirt too?

454
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:24,505
You want the T-shirt? Okay.

455
00:25:24,576 --> 00:25:26,974
Here it is.

456
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:27,975
Here.

457
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,645
- It'll look good on me, right? - Of course!

458
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:33,215
That's a given. Why bother asking?

459
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:38,525
- Oh, my. - Applause!

460
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:40,925
I want one too!

461
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:42,464
Okay, what size?

462
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:43,865
- Okay. - I need one too!

463
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:46,436
Yes!

464
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:49,234
Se Gyeong!

465
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:51,405
- Hi. - Hi. You know...

466
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:54,175
Can you please come and play the game my club organized?

467
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,605
It's the most famous game at the festival. Let's play...

468
00:25:56,606 --> 00:25:57,875
- No. - Why not?

469
00:25:57,876 --> 00:25:59,544
She's a cellist. What if she hurts her hand?

470
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:02,045
No, Yi Chan. It sounds fun. Let's play it together.

471
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:03,515
- Shall we? - Yes.

472
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:05,385
Guys, we should all do it together. What do you say?

473
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:06,454
- Shall we? - Sure.

474
00:26:06,455 --> 00:26:07,615
Wait, hold on.

475
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,886
One person should stay and man the booth. Who will stay?

476
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:25,636
- Choi Se Gyeong! - Choi Se Gyeong!

477
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:28,936
Eun Gyeol.

478
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:30,876
How's it going here?

479
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:32,305
Where's everyone else?

480
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,576
What?

481
00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:35,816
Watch the booth for me.

482
00:26:36,586 --> 00:26:37,686
What? Where are you going?

483
00:26:38,785 --> 00:26:41,915
All eyes are on us now! This is the match of the century.

484
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:43,454
It's happening right now, today!

485
00:26:43,455 --> 00:26:45,155
Sworn enemies met on a single-log bridge.

486
00:26:45,156 --> 00:26:47,794
Round Four! Hold in your burps after downing the soda!

487
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:50,396
Applause, everyone!

488
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,264
You get one minute.

489
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:56,265
Are you ready?

490
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:58,566
Are you ready? Stand by.

491
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:00,535
Start!

492
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:22,625
- Choi Se Gyeong! - Choi Se Gyeong!

493
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:25,325
- Choi Se Gyeong! - Seven, six,

494
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:28,135
- Choi Se Gyeong! - five, four, three, two,

495
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:29,836
- Choi Se Gyeong! - one. You team lost!

496
00:27:34,705 --> 00:27:38,704
- Choi Se Gyeong! - Choi Se Gyeong!

497
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:40,315
Round Five!

498
00:27:40,316 --> 00:27:44,315
Who can make the biggest bubble?

499
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:46,615
All right. Get ready and start!

500
00:27:46,616 --> 00:27:48,555
Go!

501
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:52,255
- Nice, that's it. - Keep going.

502
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:55,555
- Oh, my! - My gosh!

503
00:28:21,755 --> 00:28:23,385
Quiet down!

504
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:24,655
(Baekwang High School's Sparkling Festival)

505
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:25,725
Quiet down, please.

506
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:32,166
No chitchat.

507
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:34,295
- Be quiet. - Sorry.

508
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:35,566
Wait in an orderly fashion.

509
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:39,165
Stay seated.

510
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,376
Se Gyeong.

511
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:43,805
I said we should go together, but you left without me.

512
00:28:44,076 --> 00:28:45,645
Will you keep hurting my feelings like this?

513
00:28:45,646 --> 00:28:46,915
You're the chairwoman's daughter.

514
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:48,675
Was I supposed to lure you into skipping the class with me?

515
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:50,015
That's exactly my point.

516
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:52,615
I skipped the supplementary class and came here because of you,

517
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:54,015
but you aren't even happy to see me.

518
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:57,555
I asked you about my style earlier, but you ignored me.

519
00:28:59,025 --> 00:29:00,455
You're stylish, so you don't care how I look?

520
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:02,356
I thought we were closer than this!

521
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:07,166
That headband doesn't suit you.

522
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:10,865
- What? - I think you're Cool Summer.

523
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:13,275
Such vivid colors are the worst for those with Cool Summer tones.

524
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:15,875
You should go for muted tones or mauve.

525
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:18,076
"Cool Summer?"

526
00:29:18,445 --> 00:29:21,015
"Vivi..." What?

527
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:22,346
Hey.

528
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:25,285
Let's keep our mouths shut and get ready to enjoy the performance.

529
00:29:26,886 --> 00:29:28,585
Hey, it'll be a lame performance anyway.

530
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:29,885
The band was put together at the last minute.

531
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:31,686

(The debut show of Watermelon Sugar)

533
00:29:49,576 --> 00:29:50,805

00:30:24,346 --> 00:30:25,406
Yi Chan.

537
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:27,445
What? Shall I pick up some calming medicine for you?

538
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:35,485
I won't go easy on you today.

539
00:30:37,555 --> 00:30:38,656
You think you're the only one?

540
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:41,995
Hey, I have one too.

541
00:30:42,826 --> 00:30:44,495
Stop acting cool.

542
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:48,295
They'll call a standby in three minutes. Are you guys ready?

543
00:30:48,396 --> 00:30:50,436
Of course. Come on, brothers.

544
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:56,745
- You can do a good job, right? - Yes. I always do a good job.

545
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:58,275
You too?

546
00:30:58,545 --> 00:31:00,245
With each mistake you make, you'll get three teeth knocked out.

547
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:02,346
Then you'll get dentures soon, Yi Chan.

548
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:05,316
All right.

549
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:07,415
Who are we?

550
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,285
- Watermelon Sugar! - Watermelon Sugar!

551
00:31:10,356 --> 00:31:11,426
Viva!

552
00:31:12,156 --> 00:31:13,626
- La vida! - La vida!

553
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:15,495
Watermelon!

554
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:17,565
- Sugar! - Sugar!

555
00:31:17,566 --> 00:31:19,896
- Let's go! - Let's go!

556
00:31:22,805 --> 00:31:26,606
Your face

557
00:31:27,576 --> 00:31:31,106
Your name

558
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:35,846
Your story

559
00:31:37,116 --> 00:31:41,316
And I'm left with.

560
00:31:46,856 --> 00:31:47,896
Drums!

561
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:52,295
Bass!

562
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:56,936
Guitar!

563
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:01,775
Piano!

564
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:09,785
It still wasn't enough.

565
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:14,856
The way you were looking at me.

566
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:19,325
Like the love scattered around the world.

567
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:22,555
Everything was uncertain back then.

568
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:28,436
As time goes by.

569
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:33,336
We're bound to forget things.

570
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:37,875
But it is now that I am leaving.

571
00:32:37,876 --> 00:32:40,916
Your shadows behind.

572
00:32:43,015 --> 00:32:48,315
I never told you that I loved you.

573
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:52,254
Although I regret it now.

574
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:56,264
Your late confession

575
00:32:56,265 --> 00:33:00,795
I'm leaving that confession behind.

576
00:33:02,035 --> 00:33:04,005
Everybody, get up!

577
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:10,444
Your face, your name.

578
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:15,075
Your story and my lovely bygone days.

579
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:19,655
It may seem like this love came true.

580
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:24,055
But I'm left with nothing but a farewell.

581
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:45,274
Amazing! My gosh.

582
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,076
He's so good.

583
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:49,346
Hold on. Ha Eun Gyeol, that guy...

584
00:33:50,116 --> 00:33:51,145
Wasn't it him?

585
00:33:51,146 --> 00:33:53,086
The one who had a jam session with Ji Hwan's band.

586
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,116
Who did what?

587
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,985
Those two.

588
00:33:58,356 --> 00:33:59,695
With Ji Hwan's band.

589
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:01,156
Dad...

590
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,965
No, I mean... Ji Hwan is in a band?

591
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:06,265
Hey, what's with you?

592
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:09,165
You came with me when I went to Myeongse Outdoor Theater.

593
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,705
To see Ji Hwan's band perform. Don't you remember?

594
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:14,905
Yes, it's him.

595
00:34:15,276 --> 00:34:17,146
No wonder I thought he looked so familiar.

596
00:34:18,745 --> 00:34:20,276
Se Gyeong. You knew, didn't you?

597
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:23,445
Where are you going? Are you going to the restroom?

598
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:24,986
It's bright outside.

599
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:29,155
Walking briskly.

600
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:32,626
In the morning.

601
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:36,325
Everyone is.

602
00:34:36,925 --> 00:34:39,066
Humming together.

603
00:34:42,035 --> 00:34:45,764
Waiting for a sunny day.

604
00:34:45,765 --> 00:34:49,235
With a heart full of excitement.

605
00:34:49,236 --> 00:34:52,775
Crossing paths.

606
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:56,245
Affectionate gazes fill the streets.

607
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,345
- Hey! - Hey!

608
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:01,916
- Hey! - Hey!

609
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:07,196
Did I tell you my first love was in a band?

610
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:10,666
So the bandsman was Dad?

611
00:35:11,765 --> 00:35:13,495
You see, my first love...

612
00:35:16,265 --> 00:35:18,405
He was cheerful and bright like sunshine.

613
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:28,146
He seemed indifferent and cold from time to time,

614
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:30,646
but he was kind.

615
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:49,566
(You're my music.)

616
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,205
And he only loved me, always.

617
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:03,785
Look, what a handsome dog.

618
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:06,115
This won't be spicy, right?

619
00:36:06,385 --> 00:36:07,586
It looks spicy.

620
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:09,416
I'll try it.

621
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:11,285
Isn't it spicy?

622
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:13,824
Oh, that's right. He was very good at eating spicy food.

623
00:36:13,825 --> 00:36:15,396
- It's not spicy at all. - It's not spicy?

624
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:16,966
Try it.

625
00:36:21,365 --> 00:36:22,836
I couldn't handle spicy food.

626
00:36:24,336 --> 00:36:25,365
Oh, gosh.

627
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:30,344
- Oh, my gosh. - My gosh.

628
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:32,674
- You're handsome. - Oh, my gosh.

629
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:34,574
How can he be so good-looking?

630
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:37,345
- He's handsome. - He's handsome.

631
00:36:39,245 --> 00:36:40,285
What?

632
00:36:41,455 --> 00:36:43,585
- My goodness. - How is he so sweet?

633
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:46,055
He's so cool.

634
00:36:46,155 --> 00:36:47,595
I didn't know when I was younger.

635
00:36:48,526 --> 00:36:51,595
Because we were like siblings.

636
00:36:52,595 --> 00:36:53,666
But...

637
00:36:54,265 --> 00:36:59,736
You're a beautiful woman.

638
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:04,245
And I'm happy.

639
00:37:06,075 --> 00:37:08,446
You're like much-needed rain.

640
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:13,955
You're like much-needed rain to my dry heart.

641
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:19,585
You're like the scent of dawn that is forgotten

642
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:21,655
I was sure that he was the one...

643
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:23,225
at the spring festival.

644
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:28,094
That day, he serenaded me...

645
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:30,135
at the festival.

646
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:43,046
He was my dad?

647
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:48,686
Your first love was my dad when he was younger?

648
00:37:54,296 --> 00:37:55,356
Se Gyeong.

649
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:00,566
Do you know me?

650
00:38:07,405 --> 00:38:08,575
Do you know me?

651
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:14,146
I'm sorry. I was mistaken.

652
00:38:18,245 --> 00:38:20,555
It's okay.

653
00:38:23,986 --> 00:38:25,686
That was awesome.

(Baekwang High School's Sparkling Festival)

655
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:32,864
Are you guys having fun?

656
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:34,165
- Yes. - Yes.

657
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:35,995
I can't hear you.

658
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:38,966
Say it louder!

659
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:42,474
Are you guys having fun?

660
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:44,645
- Yes. - Yes.

661
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:45,705
Thank you.

662
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:49,675
I'm going to dedicate the last song...

663
00:38:52,946 --> 00:38:54,655
to a girl.

664
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:01,455
I'm going...

665
00:39:02,055 --> 00:39:04,595
to sing this song...

666
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:08,296
for the girl who made our band possible.

667
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,181
It's "The Magic Castle" by The Classic.

668
00:39:14,175 --> 00:39:15,336
Darn it.

669
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:21,816
(Baekwang High School's Sparkling Festival)

670
00:39:51,146 --> 00:39:55,675
When I gaze at the setting sun, tinged with red.

671
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:59,316
The sad look on your face comes to my mind.

672
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:03,285
I sink my head, and tears fall down.

673
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:06,025
There's nothing I can say.

674
00:40:06,026 --> 00:40:08,955
But the truth is that I love you.

675
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:12,396
You are my world.

676
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:15,994
I'm screaming that to the world.

677
00:40:15,995 --> 00:40:20,075
But the setting sun burns silently.

(Watermelon Sugar)

679
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,446
- Can I have your autograph? - Gosh.

680
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,715
- What's your name? - Hye In.

681
00:40:29,716 --> 00:40:31,145
- Sorry? - Hye In.

682
00:40:31,146 --> 00:40:32,245
Hye In.

683
00:40:35,785 --> 00:40:36,785
Then...

684
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:43,026
Where are you going? There's an after-party.

685
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:46,424
Sign the autograph for me before you go.

686
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:47,895
Just for me.

687
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:49,264
- It's my bad. - No.

688
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:51,065
- Viva. - La Vida.

689
00:40:51,066 --> 00:40:53,506
- Watermelon. - Sugar.

690
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:58,045
Look. The table looks so beautiful...

691
00:40:58,046 --> 00:41:00,045
when you order the right amount of food for you.

692
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:02,175
So is there anything else you need?

693
00:41:03,015 --> 00:41:04,385
One more free plate of fried dumplings, please.

694
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:07,615
I could raise a cow, but I can't raise you.

695
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:10,026
One more seafood and vegetables with mustard sauce, please.

696
00:41:11,225 --> 00:41:13,454
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

697
00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:15,325
I'm going to raise a cow today.

698
00:41:15,396 --> 00:41:17,466
I can tell that you're blessed with luck.

699
00:41:17,995 --> 00:41:19,765
You're definitely going to become rich.

700
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,236
Give us stir-fried seafood and beef too.

701

- Oh Ma Joo. - Oh Ma Joo.

702
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:28,435
Seafood and vegetables with mustard and stir-fried seafood and beef.

703
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:30,305
- Let's get it started. - Let's do it.

704
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,876
Can you really eat the noodles right now?

705
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:38,515
Didn't you think that something was off while performing today?

706
00:41:45,256 --> 00:41:46,625
It's okay.

707
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:49,455
We lost the bet, but it was a successful performance.

708
00:41:49,955 --> 00:41:52,396
Yes. Se Gyeong is very considerate.

709
00:41:52,865 --> 00:41:54,935
She didn't reject you...

710
00:41:54,936 --> 00:41:56,396
in front of the whole school.

711
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,935
"Reject?" Who?

712
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:00,105
You.

713
00:42:00,106 --> 00:42:01,705
She didn't reject me.

714
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:04,404
Kind Se Gyeong finished it with an open ending...

715
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:05,946
with the wisdom of Solomon.

716
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:09,845
Because she didn't want to choose one of us and hurt the other.

717
00:42:10,646 --> 00:42:12,486
Because she didn't want us to disband.

718
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:14,885
That's who she is.

719
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:18,284
She's righteous and loyal.

720
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,154
I thought it was a cartoon theme song or something.

721
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:22,225
Are you done now?

722
00:42:23,325 --> 00:42:25,626
Let's slurp the noodles now.

723
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:26,796
Sounds great.

724
00:42:30,436 --> 00:42:32,466
What do you mean I'm done, you punks?

725
00:42:32,705 --> 00:42:34,535
Chung Ah isn't here.

726
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,945
- Oh, right. - Chung Ah?

727
00:42:36,946 --> 00:42:38,205
"Oh, right?"

728
00:42:39,046 --> 00:42:40,146
Gosh.

729
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:42,816
These disloyal punks.

730
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:45,514
You just want to eat even when your colleague...

731
00:42:45,515 --> 00:42:47,955
who has always been with us isn't here.

732
00:42:49,455 --> 00:42:51,285
You're no better than animals.

733
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:02,836
Can we meet for a moment?

734
00:43:02,995 --> 00:43:04,834
You decide the time and the location.

735
00:43:05,673 --> 00:43:06,843
Why are you not answering?

736
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:09,436
Are you not home yet?

737
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:12,205
Is the fax broken?

738
00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:14,345
(Are you unwell?)

739
00:43:16,575 --> 00:43:17,785
Are you unwell?

740
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:21,055
Did something happen?

741
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:24,526
I'll be in front of your house in 30 minutes.

742
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:26,155
Can we meet for a moment?

743
00:43:26,555 --> 00:43:27,896
I'll wait until you come out.

744
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:04,095
Hi.

745
00:44:08,196 --> 00:44:09,265
Where are you going?

746
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:15,336
Why did you not come to watch our performance today?

747
00:44:16,675 --> 00:44:17,905
I was waiting.

748
00:44:23,686 --> 00:44:24,885
I'm deaf.

749
00:44:25,745 --> 00:44:26,785
I know.

750
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,586
I can't hear anything.

751
00:44:29,555 --> 00:44:30,986
I know.

752
00:44:32,955 --> 00:44:34,896
Why did you invite me then?

753
00:44:35,696 --> 00:44:38,126
Invite? Why did I invite you?

754
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:40,865
- Of course, that's... - To mock me?

755
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:42,665
To make me a spectacle?

756
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:43,966
- Because you pitied me? - What?

757
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,566
To show that you have a friend with disabilities and look nice?

758
00:44:47,305 --> 00:44:49,134
"You're bad. But we're having fun like this."

759
00:44:49,135 --> 00:44:50,405
Did you want to brag like this?

760
00:44:50,876 --> 00:44:52,075
Wait. It's too fast.

761
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:54,946
Hold on.

762
00:45:01,586 --> 00:45:02,615
Oh.

763
00:45:07,026 --> 00:45:10,325
Music isn't something you listen to just by ear.

764
00:45:12,595 --> 00:45:15,095
Music is something you can feel with your eyes,

765
00:45:15,936 --> 00:45:17,006
mind,

766
00:45:17,736 --> 00:45:19,936
and heart.

767
00:45:23,035 --> 00:45:24,404
Don't try to act cool.

768
00:45:24,405 --> 00:45:25,475
It disgusts me.

769
00:45:28,716 --> 00:45:29,816
You're done, right?

770
00:45:33,586 --> 00:45:35,086
Then why did you help our band...

771
00:45:36,515 --> 00:45:37,555
No.

772
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,055
Why did you help me all this time?

773
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:49,696
Why did you want to be friends?

774
00:45:55,575 --> 00:45:56,606
Why...

775
00:45:59,205 --> 00:46:00,276
did you say...

776
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,946
you liked me?

777
00:46:42,256 --> 00:46:43,785
I guess I'm not invisible anymore.

778
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:53,196
What am I doing in front of your house?

779
00:46:55,336 --> 00:46:56,494
I've been worrying...

780
00:46:56,495 --> 00:46:58,566
why you rushed out of the auditorium in the middle of the show.

781
00:47:00,236 --> 00:47:03,006
And I've been trying to figure out a way to get you to forgive me.

782
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:09,216
I think I just found a solution for my second problem.

783
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:13,015
My biggest worry was...

784
00:47:14,316 --> 00:47:15,716
figuring out how I was going to apologize...

785
00:47:16,885 --> 00:47:18,825
to get your forgiveness.

786
00:47:20,955 --> 00:47:23,796
I've been thinking, and this is the best way.

787
00:47:28,066 --> 00:47:29,066
I'm sorry.

788
00:47:31,106 --> 00:47:32,166
It's my fault.

789
00:47:34,106 --> 00:47:35,175
Please forgive me.

790
00:47:38,876 --> 00:47:40,675
Should I tell you what I did wrong?

791
00:47:41,115 --> 00:47:42,146
I'm sorry.

792
00:47:45,046 --> 00:47:46,416
I was mistaken.

793
00:47:51,055 --> 00:47:53,185
You looked down on me, loathed me, and expressed hatred against me.

794
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:54,856
You pulled the trifecta while treating me as if I was invisible.

795
00:47:55,896 --> 00:47:56,896
Did you change your tactics?

796
00:47:56,897 --> 00:47:58,126
Are you apologizing as if we've never met?

797
00:47:59,425 --> 00:48:01,365
Anyway, I'm sorry.

798
00:48:01,765 --> 00:48:03,566
You'll never see me again.

799
00:48:03,936 --> 00:48:04,936
Bye.

800
00:48:07,535 --> 00:48:09,304
Hey, I'm apologizing from the bottom of my heart.

801
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:10,446
Please!

802
00:48:12,475 --> 00:48:14,446
Can't you just leave me alone?

803
00:48:15,816 --> 00:48:18,416
I have so much on my mind that my brain is going to explode.

804
00:48:19,345 --> 00:48:21,454
I can't even begin to think how I wasted my time and energy.

805
00:48:21,455 --> 00:48:22,755
There's no way of knowing...

806
00:48:22,756 --> 00:48:24,224
what I found out is the truth...

807
00:48:24,225 --> 00:48:26,526
or a misunderstanding. This is driving me crazy.

808
00:48:27,626 --> 00:48:29,526
So I'm asking you not to complicate this further.

809
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:33,126
Did something happen?

810
00:48:34,135 --> 00:48:35,166
No.

811
00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:38,035
Even if it did, it's none of your business.

812
00:48:38,606 --> 00:48:39,634
Hey, Choi Se Gyeong.

813
00:48:39,635 --> 00:48:42,035
I won't pick anyone. Are you happy now?

814
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:45,745
I'll choose neither you nor Yi Chan.

815
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:47,344
That's why you're here.

816
00:48:47,345 --> 00:48:48,815
You're worried that I might choose Yi Chan.

817
00:48:48,816 --> 00:48:50,785
Why are you turning me into a bad guy?

818
00:48:51,316 --> 00:48:53,244
I came because I was worried about you.

819
00:48:53,245 --> 00:48:54,615
Don't worry about me!

820
00:48:55,615 --> 00:48:57,884
You and I will never have to see each other again.

821
00:48:57,885 --> 00:48:59,455
You and I are...

822
00:49:01,225 --> 00:49:03,325
from two different worlds, to begin with.

823
00:49:14,905 --> 00:49:16,135
I'm going to check.

824
00:49:18,345 --> 00:49:20,146
I'm going to meet them in person and check.

825
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:15,236
Hello.

826
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,575
(Used Musical Instruments)

827
00:50:30,115 --> 00:50:32,646
(White Night)

828
00:50:50,095 --> 00:50:51,135
Here.

829
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:37,075
What are you doing here alone?

830
00:51:38,186 --> 00:51:39,245
I just...

831
00:51:40,285 --> 00:51:41,455
liked the song.

832
00:51:44,055 --> 00:51:45,785
This is a perfect song to seduce women with.

833
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:01,876
So you've tried that.

834
00:52:02,405 --> 00:52:03,975
Gosh, no way.

835
00:52:04,606 --> 00:52:07,075
This song is about a father who lost his son.

836
00:52:07,175 --> 00:52:09,345
I wouldn't sing this song just to seduce women.

837
00:52:17,655 --> 00:52:18,986
Don't jump to conclusions.

838
00:52:19,986 --> 00:52:21,525
I don't know if I'll have good fortune,

839
00:52:21,526 --> 00:52:23,026
but from the looks of it, I don't have any children.

840
00:52:26,966 --> 00:52:28,865
(White Night)

841
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,135
Ask me.

842
00:52:33,365 --> 00:52:34,436
Ask you what?

843
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:36,005
Ask your face what.

844
00:52:36,006 --> 00:52:37,606
It's full of question marks.

845
00:52:38,006 --> 00:52:39,245
I'm all ears. Ask me.

846
00:52:41,615 --> 00:52:43,876
Of course, it's probably about your friend, not you.

847
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,385
I had a mission to complete.

848
00:52:48,756 --> 00:52:51,055
I had to fulfill the mission even if I had to risk my life.

849
00:52:51,225 --> 00:52:53,625
Did I say that I could never guarantee...

850
00:52:53,626 --> 00:52:55,026
a wise solution?

851
00:52:55,356 --> 00:52:57,054
I had to get chosen by a girl...

852
00:52:57,055 --> 00:52:59,196
who was so out of my league. That was the mission.

853
00:52:59,765 --> 00:53:02,465
It looked as if she was going to choose the other guy.

854
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:03,736
So it was really tough.

855
00:53:05,365 --> 00:53:07,776
- So did you fail the mission? - No, I completed the mission.

856
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:09,675
No.

857
00:53:10,405 --> 00:53:12,305
It just happened that way.

858
00:53:12,805 --> 00:53:15,146
What do you mean? Did she choose you over him?

859
00:53:15,316 --> 00:53:18,244
No. She said she wasn't going to choose anyone.

860
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:21,186
Gosh. That's strange.

861
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:22,586
It is, right?

862
00:53:23,615 --> 00:53:26,284
Anyway, you completed the mission,

863
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:27,555
but you're not happy.

864
00:53:29,396 --> 00:53:30,825
I'm not sure about that.

865
00:53:32,396 --> 00:53:34,295
It feels as if I swallowed something wrong.

866
00:53:34,296 --> 00:53:35,436
It's frustrating.

867
00:53:35,995 --> 00:53:38,765
When I forced myself to swallow it, it stung.

868
00:53:39,936 --> 00:53:40,975
It aches.

869
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:43,006
- That's love. - What?

870
00:53:44,175 --> 00:53:47,245
Wait. Don't tell me she's your first love.

871
00:53:47,446 --> 00:53:49,145
Gosh, don't tease me.

872
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:51,216
She and I can never end up together.

873
00:53:52,245 --> 00:53:54,185
There's no limit to love.

874
00:53:54,186 --> 00:53:55,256
There is.

875
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:57,756
I can't overcome a 28-year age gap.

876
00:53:57,856 --> 00:54:01,526
Gosh. Oh, my.

877
00:54:02,026 --> 00:54:04,425
A 28-year age gap?

878
00:54:05,425 --> 00:54:06,566
That might be hard.

879
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:13,566
It's okay. Stuff like that can happen in your youth.

880
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:17,475
Immaturity can't be an excuse for my actions.

881
00:54:18,075 --> 00:54:20,745
You'll end up writing great lyrics for a song.

882
00:54:27,345 --> 00:54:28,615
What a beautiful moon.

883
00:54:31,256 --> 00:54:33,225
This is the perfect night to get one's heart broken.

884
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:39,365
The festival is over.

885
00:54:40,396 --> 00:54:41,896
Don't come to see me ever again.

886
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:46,336
You and I live in different worlds, anyway.

887
00:55:29,845 --> 00:55:31,146
- What's wrong with her? - I don't know.

888
00:55:45,296 --> 00:55:47,195
Gosh. Seriously.

889
00:55:47,196 --> 00:55:49,595
Se Gyeong has been acting like a different person lately.

890
00:55:49,865 --> 00:55:53,165
It's not like going to the US is as easy as taking the bus downtown.

891
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:54,705
She treated it as if she was going to a corner shop.

892
00:55:54,876 --> 00:55:56,674
She said, "I'm going to the US. Bye."

893
00:55:56,675 --> 00:55:57,946
How can anyone just do that?

894
00:56:00,506 --> 00:56:02,376
No, I'm being serious right now.

895
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:05,215
She said she was going to the US right now.

896
00:56:05,216 --> 00:56:07,685
I just talked to her on the phone. Who is this?

897
00:56:07,686 --> 00:56:08,785
What are you talking about?

898
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:10,784
Where's Se Gyeong going?

899
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:13,155
You must have a death wish, seriously. Darn it.

900
00:56:14,495 --> 00:56:15,626
The United States!

901
00:56:17,026 --> 00:56:18,396
Don't worry about me!

902
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:21,594
You and I will never have to see each other again.

903
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:22,995
You and I are...

904
00:56:24,905 --> 00:56:26,966
from two different worlds, to begin with.

905
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,285
Taxi!

906
00:56:46,655 --> 00:56:48,526
Taxi!

907
00:56:52,526 --> 00:56:53,796
Do you like me?

908
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:56,365
Be honest with me.

909
00:56:57,095 --> 00:57:01,535
Is it me? Or is it Yi Chan?

910
00:57:06,705 --> 00:57:07,745
Taxi!

911
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:16,816
I bet you've never dated.

912
00:57:17,555 --> 00:57:19,725
You've never dated, right? I knew it!

913
00:57:21,225 --> 00:57:26,066
Look at you, you've never dated.

914
00:57:40,606 --> 00:57:43,046
Taxi!

915
00:57:44,216 --> 00:57:45,285
Taxi!

916
00:57:56,925 --> 00:57:59,566
(Entrance)

917
00:58:07,405 --> 00:58:08,805
You can't go in there!

918
00:58:24,186 --> 00:58:25,325
(Gimpo International Airport)

919
00:58:30,095 --> 00:58:32,466
(International Departures)

920
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:35,066
(International Departures)

921
00:59:10,635 --> 00:59:13,736
Why are you crying here all alone? You're breaking my heart.

922
00:59:15,736 --> 00:59:17,805
I don't know how to go back.

923
00:59:20,606 --> 00:59:23,175
I need to check some things with my parents.

924
00:59:24,615 --> 00:59:26,146
I have questions for them too.

925
00:59:27,416 --> 00:59:30,416
I thought I would be able to go back as easily as I came here.

926
00:59:32,455 --> 00:59:34,155
But I can't find my way back.

927
00:59:36,026 --> 00:59:38,425
I even thought about not going back.

928
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:42,396
But now, I can't go back even if I wanted.

929
00:59:43,236 --> 00:59:44,265
What should I do?

930
00:59:45,135 --> 00:59:47,436
What if I can't go back for the rest of my life?

931
00:59:48,662 --> 00:59:49,901
I'll help you.

932
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:52,745
How?

933
00:59:53,405 --> 00:59:54,475
How can you help me?

934
00:59:54,782 --> 00:59:56,083
I'll make it work.

935
00:59:56,116 --> 00:59:59,286
I'll do whatever it takes to help you find your way back.

936
01:00:01,084 --> 01:00:02,783
But stay here with me for now.

937
01:00:09,055 --> 01:00:10,979
Stay with me.

938
01:00:31,146 --> 01:00:33,816
You said we were from two different worlds, right?

939
01:00:35,251 --> 01:00:36,320
But I don't care.

940
01:00:38,686 --> 01:00:41,595
I don't care who you are.

941
01:00:42,544 --> 01:00:44,814
I don't care if you're a middle-aged woman.

942
01:00:46,628 --> 01:00:48,298
I don't care if you turn out to be a zombie.

943
01:00:51,698 --> 01:00:54,028
That's why we should...

944
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:56,399
stay together.

945
01:01:54,019 --> 01:01:57,459
It looks like you finally found your helper.

946
01:02:01,698 --> 01:02:04,298
I hope it wasn't too late, though.

947
01:02:19,825 --> 01:02:22,726
(Special thanks to Park Ho San and Ryu Jin)

948
01:02:50,008 --> 01:02:54,817
(Twinkling Watermelon)

949
01:02:54,818 --> 01:02:57,487
How are we going to write a song in a month?

950
01:02:57,488 --> 01:02:59,288
How about a one-day song retreat?

951
01:02:59,289 --> 01:03:00,887
We can decide on the theme of our song.

952
01:03:00,888 --> 01:03:02,058
We can bond as a band too.

953
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:04,958
Your trip is nearing its end now.

954
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,698
When we met by chance, I liked that you were honest.

955
01:03:07,804 --> 01:03:11,043
That's really me! I'm serious!

956
01:03:11,068 --> 01:03:11,787
What about Yoon Chung Ah?

957
01:03:11,812 --> 01:03:13,197
You didn't care that she didn't come to the festival.

958
01:03:13,198 --> 01:03:15,007
You don't seem concerned that she's not coming to the retreat.

959
01:03:15,008 --> 01:03:16,908
What's your problem?

960
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:19,508
When your life can twinkle again on its own,

961
01:03:19,908 --> 01:03:22,008
I hope it twinkles as radiantly as possible...

962
01:03:22,579 --> 01:03:24,649
because I don't have much time left with me.
