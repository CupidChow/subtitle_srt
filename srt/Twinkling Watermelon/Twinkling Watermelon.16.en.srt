12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,950
I can't believe I didn't recognize Mr. Viva.

13
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,199
Mom.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,539
I did...

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,440
all sorts of disgusting things...

16
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,678
to make you a member of the Jinsung Family,

17
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:18,479
so it was your job to protect it.

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,520
Forget his secret child. Even if his dead son came back to life,

19
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,350
you should've protected it no matter what.

20
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,360
How could you not win Mr. Chairman's affections even once?

21
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,719
Even that boy from who knows where...

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,690
managed to grab his attention at once!

23
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,830
I'll just go and kill myself, then.

24
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,199
I'll do it for you, if that's what you want.

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,669
Hey, come on.

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,739
You said so.

27
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,538
- Hey. - What are you doing?

28
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,079
Why did he suddenly come back to Korea?

29
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,550
Did you not hear the rumours?

30
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,649
Chairman Yoon's secret son showed up.

31
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,149
I hear he's very smart and good-looking.

32
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:59,690
That idiot is like a deposed crown prince now.

33
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,520
Yes.

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,059
That jerk should be the one dying, not me.

35
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:27,750
- Stop! - Stop him!

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,949
(Seoul 2, NA 4836)

37
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,979
Dad...

38
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,729
I thought about it...

39
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,000
and realized that everything you had asked me to do was for my own sake.

40
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,739
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:32,710
I'm sorry, Yi Chan.

42
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,220
Just today...

43
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,789
All I had to do was stay right by your side for just this one day.

44
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,319
I should have protected you.

45
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,630
This is all my fault.

46
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:51,530
It's all my fault. I'm sorry, Yi Chan.

47
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,310
I wonder if there's been an accident or something.

48
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,940
I hope it's not a big accident.

49
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:08,079
Hey, it's getting late. Where are you going?

50
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,949
Are you going out for drinks?

51
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,660

52
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,460

(Yeonnam Hospital)

54
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,270
Is Ha Yi Chan's guardian here?

55
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,400
I'm his guardian. I am his cousin.

56
00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:31,308
We need his guardian's signature to perform emergency surgery.

57
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:32,669
- Please come with me. - Okay.

58
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,979
Hey, I'll go.

59
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:37,109
Go to the restroom and wash up.

60
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,410
No way.

61
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,010
That can't be. I got in?

- band Watermelon Sugar! - Hey, it's us!

74

- Hey, let's go. - Hurry.

75
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:24,850
- Go. - Let's go!

76
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,619
Guys, what did I tell you?

77
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,820
MGGO.

78
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,059
Never give up, and you will win.

79
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:36,830
- Applause! - Yes! Applause.

80
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,600
- Nice. - Give him a big hand!

81
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,900
You look pretty.

82
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,140
Grandma.

83
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:49,379
Have all your wishes come true?

84
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,179
All right, everyone. Look here!

85
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,679
Grandma, look at the camera.

86
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,080
Come on, guys.

87
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:59,049
We only have five seconds. Come on, quick!

88
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:01,720
- One, two, three! - One, two, three!

89
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,100
Thank you for raising me, Grandma.

90
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,080
It's a holiday, so there weren't many cars. How did this happen?

91
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,150
He pushed away a guy who was running and got hit instead of him.

92
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,359
- Really? - My goodness. What a scumbag.

93
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,189
How could this jerk run away after hitting someone with his car?

94
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:40,859
Oh, dear.

95
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:52,669
I'm sure of it. I saw the car with my own eyes.

96
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,939
It was the only car that left the scene at the time of the accident.

97
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:59,309
The plate number was Seoul 2, NA 4836.

98
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,419
I don't know the model, but it was a red sports car.

99
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,449
Please, you must catch this person.

100
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,189
This hit-and-run driver hit someone with his car.

101
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,789
No, he should be charged with attempted murder.

102
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,390
Please calm down. Which way did he go?

103
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,390
That way, toward the main road.

104
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,039
Yi Chan is the one who got hurt in the accident?

105
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,410
He was on his way here...

106
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,748
to have me listen to this?

107
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:36,279
("A Song for You")

108
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,920
Yes, I think so.

109
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,489
We tried so hard to prevent this from happening.

110
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:50,430
That cassette tape ended up in your hands, after all.

111
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,009
Please burn it with your own hands.

112
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,170
Something tells me...

113
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:04,340
that it's the only thing that can break this chain of misfortunes.

114
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:07,680
You know, earlier...

115
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:12,920
I'm sorry I didn't say anything at all.

116
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:18,629
By any chance...

117
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,300
Did you come back to see me?

118
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,269
Mom, if you could go back to that moment in time,

119
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,069
what's the first thing you'd ask him?

120
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,170
(Spring 2022)

121
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,310
"Why did you abandon me?"

122
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,680
Something like that, I guess.

123
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,609
Why couldn't you ask him that question?

124
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,820
I think I was afraid of facing the truth.

125
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:45,820
He was probably afraid too.

126
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,019
Because he had nothing to say if I were to ask that question.

127
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:56,700
If you came back...

128
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,100
because you wanted to talk to me about something...

129
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,639
Why did you abandon me?

130
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,939
The day I asked you about Shin A Young, the actress,

131
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,139
you told me...

132
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,680
that it was love, not just a fling.

133
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:15,550
You said you found out about me and Shin A Young's death...

134
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,879
after I was adopted...

135
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,889
and that you never abandoned me.

136
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,720
- Se Gyeong. - What you said that day...

137
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,859
I will try to believe it.

138
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,629
I will try to understand you, but you see...

139
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:30,399
If that was the case,

140
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:33,600
shouldn't you have looked for your daughter once you found out?

141
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,700
You never abandoned me because you simply didn't know?

142
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,239
Don't you think it's so irresponsible?

143
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,440
You looked happy.

144
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,180
A wealthy family and wonderful adoptive parents.

145
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,618
You were growing up well, enjoying a happy childhood.

146
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:51,690
I did not want...

147
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,789
to ruin your happy life.

148
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,290
Your daughter has never once felt happy.

149
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:02,129
She was always anxious, having to live someone else's life,

150
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,659
and she often felt miserable.

151
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,028
She had to surpass Han Na, her adoptive parents' real daughter.

152
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,439
She thought it was the only way to be loved.

153
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
She never once...

154
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,210
lived as Choi Se Gyeong.

155
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:16,279
So, say this as your answer.

156
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,749
If someone who looks just like me asks you the same question,

157
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,850
tell her this over and over.

158
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,789
"I never once abandoned you."

159
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,220
"You're not Han Na."

160
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:30,019
"You're my daughter born of love,"

161
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,430
"Choi Se Gyeong."

162
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:36,800
If you don't tell her,

163
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,029
she'll never know.

164
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,210
That's it, no more.

165
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:49,639
The rest is up to you people to figure out.

166
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,879
I won't meddle anymore.

167
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:53,080
I'm afraid something else might change.

168
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,249
I'm afraid I might fail to protect my loved ones, like Yi Chan.

169
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,320
I want to go home now.

170
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,769
(Operating Room, Intensive Care Unit)

171
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,249
Who are you, really?

172
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,050
Tomorrow night, two full moons will rise.

173
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,059
When the two full moons appear in the sky,

174
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,658
the gate that connects the past to the present...

175
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:16,700
or the present to the future will open.

176
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:18,729
What does that have to do with me?

177
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,528
Wrap up your journey...

178
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,670
and come to the place where you arrived.

179
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:23,970
As I had promised,

180
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,369
I'll keep the lights on at La Vida Music.

181
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,680
Oh, right.

182
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,478
I'll also have lavender tea ready as your welcome tea.

183
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,649
Do you think...

184
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:36,379
I can go back in this situation?

185
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,119
Tomorrow is your only chance to go back.

186
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,459
If you decide to stay,

187
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,989
your life in 2023...

188
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:47,960
will disappear.

189
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,729
Will you be okay with that?

190
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:53,498
You do not belong to this world,

191
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,399
so we cannot even predict what kinds of ripple effects...

192
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,239
your existence in this world might bring about.

193
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,580
Are you...

194
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,879
really okay with that?

195
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,080
Why are you doing this to me?

196
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,050
What on earth did I do?

197
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,389
What did I do so wrong...

198
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,489
that I've ended up in such a ridiculous situation?

199
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,259
Whatever you decide,

200
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,029
I truly hope that you make a choice for your own sake.

201
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,100
- Goodbye. - Don't hang up.

202
00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:27,499
I told you not to hang up.

203
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,369
I told you not to hang up! I'm not done talking yet!

204
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,950
Hey, Eun Gyeol.

205
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:43,050
They just finished Yi Chan's surgery.

206
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,690
How did it go? Did the surgery go well?

207
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,358
Yes, it went well.

208
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,960
They said he'd be okay, for sure.

209
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,960
He'll soon be moved to a regular ward.

210
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,700
(Yeonnam Hospital)

211
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,580
Yi Chan.

212
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,790
Dad.

213
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,489
I'm sorry, Dad.

214
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,060
Had I not come here,

215
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,470
this wouldn't have happened.

216
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:37,940
Dad.

217
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:45,310
The fact that you can't hear wasn't the reason I said nothing to you.

218
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,320
Dad.

219
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:55,889
I didn't say...

220
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,590
those mean things to you because I hated you.

221
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,899
I love you very much, Dad.

222
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:13,440
So please...

223
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,580
Please open your eyes.

224
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,618
There's something I must tell you.

225
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:30,420
You can't keep on sleeping like this.

226
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,430
Also...

227
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,930
I might have to...

228
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,239
go back soon.

229
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,859
(Yeonnam Hospital)

230
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,600
Yi Chan.

231
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,409
Yi Chan.

232
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,590
Hey, something's wrong with me.

233
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,260
I can't hear anything.

234
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,139
I can't even hear my own voice.

235
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,490
Gosh, Ms. Go.

236
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:14,060
You'll trip and fall. Slow down.

237
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:20,730
My gosh.

238
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,749
We can't keep this a secret forever.

239
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,389
It's not like he can go home in a day or two.

240
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:52,699
Oh, dear. My goodness.

241
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,169
Do you recognize me?

242
00:18:56,939 --> 00:18:59,109
Ms. Go, I told you that he was totally fine mentally.

243
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,139
Who am I? Answer my question at once.

244
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,780
You're my grandma.

245
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,980
Do you hear my voice?

246
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:17,689
I'll be home soon. Why did you come here?

247
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,530
I was happy, thinking I could take a break from your nagging.

248
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:23,600
Do you hear my voice?

249
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,800
I'm sorry, Grandma.

250
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,668
You said you adored me because I was healthy physically and mentally.

251
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:33,810
What should I do now?

252
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,840
To make up for what happened,

253
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,080
I'll try to cultivate a more beautiful heart.

254
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,480
I'll focus on building that muscle.

255
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,619
Gosh, my sweetheart.

256
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,259
They say all good things must come to an end.

257
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,399
How could something like this happen?

258
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,270
I've never seen anyone kinder than my grandson.

259
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:03,368
What did my sweet grandson do to deserve this?

260
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,509
I can't believe this.

261
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,208
Oh, dear.

262
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:09,079
Grandma, why are you crying?

263
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,409
It's not like I'm dead.

264
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,378
I was always so busy cooking for others...

265
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,480
that I never once properly fed you or clothed you.

266
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,350
You never even experienced your parents' love,

267
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:24,359
and yet I always picked on you.

268
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:30,859
I've never once warmly embraced you.

269
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,668
What should we do now?

270
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:35,070
Grandma.

271
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,480
- Gosh, what should we do? - Grandma.

272
00:20:45,949 --> 00:20:49,449
Let's ask them to carefully examine you,

273
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,919
from head to toe.

274
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,019
If they say they can't fix it,

275
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,859
I will give you my ears.

276
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,388
If it is a new heart that you need, I will give you mine.

277
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:03,760
If you need new eyes, I will give you both of my eyes.

278
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,769
Oh, dear. What should we do? You poor thing.

279
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,198
My sweetheart, what are we going to do?

280
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:13,540
Gosh, my sweet grandson.

281
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:16,639
I will fix you. Don't you worry.

282
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:22,178
I will give you my heart and my eyes too.

283
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:23,879
I'll give you whatever you need.

284
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,850
Hey, Eun Gyeol.

285
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,590
What's going on? Where are you going?

286
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,520
To find the scumbag who made Yi Chan like that.

287
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,489
If the police can't find the driver, I will.

288
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,030
I will find him and kill him.

289
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,969
They already caught the driver, so calm down.

290
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,129
They caught him this morning.

291
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
I just checked. I'm coming from the police station.

292
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:45,169
But the thing is,

293
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,139
I think it's better that we don't tell Yi Chan or his grandmother.

294
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,840
What do you mean?

295
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:53,209
Why?

296
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:57,179
Is it someone we know?

297
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,990
Yes.

298
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,050
It's Yoon Ju Yeop, Chung Ah's stepbrother.

299
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,020
Do you want to tag along on my upcoming business trip?

300
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:41,490
I'm going to a place with many art galleries, so you'll have fun.

301
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,570
Paintings.

302
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,770
You like them, right?

303
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:53,139
Did I get it wrong?

304
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:55,510
("The Most Beautiful Language: Lovely Sign Language")

305
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,490
You can look...

306
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,560
at paintings,

307
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,830
and I'll make some time...

308
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,929
so we can take a trip...

309
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,340
I really want you to see it.

310
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,510
See what?

311
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:30,010
Chung Ah's smile.

312
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,149
She has such a pretty smile.

313
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,260
I'll join you.

314
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:12,419
I told you. It wasn't intentional.

315
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,319
He suddenly jumped in front of my car.

316
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,820
I meant to hit the brakes, but I was so startled...

317
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,128
that I stepped on the accelerator by mistake.

318
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:22,800
How many times do I have to tell you?

319
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,869
That's really odd.

320
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:29,139
The skid marks on the road tell a different story.

321
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:31,939
What are you, a psychic?

322
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,969
Do cops have the ability to commune with asphalt or something?

323
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,509
You'd better strategize wisely.

324
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,648
It'll be considered attempted murder if we prove that it was intentional.

325
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:40,909
I told you it wasn't intentional...

326
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,080
Forget it.

327
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,449
I won't say a word more until my attorney gets here, so...

328
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:49,990
It was intentional.

329
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:53,230
You saw me and drove straight toward me.

330
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:55,429
Stop. We're at a police station now, Eun Gyeol.

331
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,999
Thank you for letting him know and telling him to stop.

332
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,230
You tried to kill me.

333
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,800
You were trying to kill me,

334
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:03,398
but Yi Chan got hit because he tried to save me!

335
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,669
Darn you, seriously!

336
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:06,810
You're falsely accusing me. Do you have evidence?

337
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,939
I will kill you.

338
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:11,039
If you bribe your way out of this, I'll follow you...

339
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,449
to the end of the world and punish you myself.

340
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,280
I will do anything and everything you're imagining and are afraid of.

341
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,679
I will latch on to you like a leech and kill you slowly.

342
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,319
Don't complicate things. Let's get out of here, okay?

343
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,389
I will kill you.

344
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,520
I won't leave you alone until the day you die!

345
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,159
I will kill you!

346
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,730
Darn it.

347
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,530
When will my attorney get here?

348
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,030
Can I make a phone call?

349
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:37,570
This is a democratic country. You can let me do that much, right?

350
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,419
The two moons will rise tonight.

351
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,590
Master called you too, right?

352
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,399
This is where we stop. We shouldn't meddle anymore.

353
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,000
We must go back.

354
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:06,600
Not now.

355
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,840
If we don't go back today, we'll be trapped here forever.

356
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:13,340
Until I make sure everything can go back to the way it used to be,

357
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,240
I will not go back.

358
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,379
But how?

359
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,909
How will you undo something that already happened?

360
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:22,619
By going back to the past?

361
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,280
And you'll travel further back in time if something else changes?

362
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,090
Come to your senses.

363
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,188
You must go back to 2023.

364
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:30,459
How could I go back?

365
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,359
Knowing my dad's life got ruined because of me...

366
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:38,230
and that I couldn't change anything.

367
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,409
I should've just let things unfold the way they were supposed to.

368
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,280
I shouldn't have stepped in.

369
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,010
What do you mean you changed nothing?

370
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:57,580
You saved me,

371
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,719
and you rescued Chung Ah.

372
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,780
Yi Chan, I'm going on a trip with my dad.

373
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:33,250
I'm just tagging along on his work trip,

374
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:37,119
but this is my first trip with him, so I'm a little excited.

376
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,480
Thanks.

377
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,750
I owe it all to you.

378
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:46,290
Knowing that someone's always on my side makes me very happy.

379
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,830
It makes me feel safe and gives me courage.

380
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,429
For some reason, it helps me become stronger.

381
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,540
I hope I can do the same for you.

382
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:08,649
To Yi Chan, who's always on my side.

383
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,179
From Chung Ah, who's always on your side.

384
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:18,719
Please find a good school overseas for Chung Ah.

385
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:20,459
Sure thing, sir.

386
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:23,729
I heard about Gallaudet University. It's a college for the deaf.

387
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,730
Look into their admission requirements as well.

388
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,369
Even college?

389
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:28,929
Chung Ah...

390
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,939
will not come back once she leaves Korea this time.

391
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,510
Please don't tell Chung Ah.

392
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,709
Well understood, sir.

393
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:43,419
Also, we'll cover Yi Chan's medical expenses and all his tuition fees...

394
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,179
until he graduates from college.

395
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:46,590
I'll proceed accordingly, sir.

396
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,219
As for the case involving Ju Yeop,

397
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,219
I will not cooperate no matter what the legal team...

398
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,330
asks me to do.

399
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,359
Ms. Im Ji Mi.

400
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,669
We're from the National Tax Service.

401
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,040
You've just been banned from leaving the country due to a tax audit.

402
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,139
I'm sure all your efforts...

403
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:10,480
changed the situation for the better.

404
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,480
So...

405
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,510
let's stop here...

406
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,550
and now return to the world where we belong.

407
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,449
But...

408
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:21,290
I cannot leave.

409
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,189
Would you be happy if your life in 2023 completely disappeared?

410
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,629
My dad is in utter despair now.

411
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,399
I can't ditch him and run away alone.

412
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,669
Now, I understand what Eun Ho meant.

413
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,539
Back then, I couldn't fully understand him...

414
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,368
as I didn't know much sign language,

415
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,409
but I get it now.

416
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,310
The reason...

417
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:44,709
Eun Ho didn't tell you about your dad's accident.

418
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,050
When will you show your brother?

419
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:53,320
When the burden on his shoulders becomes lighter.

420
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,189
Right now, it seems a little too heavy.

421
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,230
Put down the burden already. It's not your burden to carry.

422
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:05,659
You forced yourself to take on the burden.

423
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:09,169
Do you think it made them happy?

424
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,270
No.

425
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,439
On the contrary, it made them worry, and it made them sad.

426
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:17,240
They worried that you'd become more miserable because of them.

427
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,179
No one can live your life for you.

428
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,550
Let Yi Chan in 1995...

429
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,290
figure things out on his own.

430
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,560
Believe in Yi Chan.

431
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,359
Yi Chan and Chung Ah exist in 2023 too.

432
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,060
Eun Ho is there too.

433
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:42,399
There are people who are waiting for you.

434
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,040
And I live in that world too.

435
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,949
I will go back.

436
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:58,349
Pack your things and meet me at my place at 9pm.

437
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,389
I'll be waiting for you.

438
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,300
You could flip a coin.

It's been a while, Mr. Viva.

445
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:38,480
I thought I'd never see you again.

446
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,449
But we meet again like this.

447
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,100
Oh, my. Brava.

448
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,540
I thought you just felt a little lost for a short while.

449
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,969
But you were a lot more rebellious than I thought.

450
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,239
What are you?

451
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:10,940
Who are you?

452
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,009
Me? I am...

454
00:35:18,779 --> 00:35:21,190
I must be going crazy. I'm losing my sanity.

455
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:23,360
I've lost my mind.

456
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:25,790
Hey, wait.

457
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,889
Just one moment.

458
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,259
Since I've already revealed myself, let me say a few more things.

459
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,830
Keep that rebellious spirit and tell your adoptive parents...

460
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,139
that you can't replace Han Na.

461
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,109
And you had to pluck up your courage to meet your birth father,

462
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,139
so go back and ask him.

463
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,869
"Why did you abandon me?"

464
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,810
Then he'll answer your question as if he's been waiting for it.

465
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,279
And just like you can't replace Han Na,

466
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:53,719
I can't live your life for you, Mom.

467
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,719
So, go ahead and live your life, Mom.

468
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,589
You deserve it.

469
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,189
Why? Because...

470
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,060
you're charming and cool just as you are.

471
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:12,068
Oh, you can run away now.

472
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,110
I'm busy too.

473
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,508
I'll tidy up here,

474
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:16,540
so don't worry.

475
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,210
You cleaned my room for me for years, Mom.

476
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,880
This has to be a dream. I'm seeing things.

477
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,190
This can't be real.

478
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,619
I can't see you out!

479
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,330
Bye, Mom.

480
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,259
We'll meet again 28 years later.

482
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,480
It's written all over your face.

483
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,549
Your mind is full of questions now.

484
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,989
I debated whether I should flip a coin before coming here.

485
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:04,159
You read my mind.

486
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,529
A coin?

487
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,159
Someone once advised me...

488
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,830
to try flipping a coin...

489
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,029
if I ever had to make a difficult decision.

490
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,869
How about I give you this instead of a coin?

("A Song for You")

492
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,980
Se Gyeong told me to burn it,

493
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,880
but I really think you should take a listen.

494
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,850
The song is great. Make sure you listen to it to the end.

496
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,389
Did I ever tell you?

497
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,469
My parents are deaf.

498
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,630
I have a brother who's a year older than me.

499
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,670
He's also deaf.

500
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,969
A child like me...

501
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:58,310
who was born to deaf parents...

502
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:00,710
is called a CODA.

503
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,549
"CODA?"

504
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:08,048
People who do music all understand what this means.

505
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:09,860
It's like a code word.

506
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:11,360
It's called a coda.

507

When you see a coda near the end of a song,

508
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:19,029
you know you should get ready to wrap it up beautifully.

509
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:22,429
That's why I came to see you.

510
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:24,869
I think it's time...

511
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,739
to get ready to wrap things up beautifully.

512
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,409
Are you going somewhere?

513
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:46,759
Thank you for everything.

514
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:51,699
This time, I wanted...

515
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,029
to say my final goodbye to you in person.

516
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,069
What's with you? Why are you acting like I'll never see you again?

517
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,909
Take care of your health.

518
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,710

519
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,779

00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:20,429
if you see a boy crying alone in front of your shop,

523
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,759
give him a glass of milk instead of hot cocoa.

524
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,469

00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:11,540
you were always there with me.

541
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,869
You lied to me that you were my son.

542
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,009
I'm your son from the future.

543
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,009
You're my dad.

544
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,610
But you know what?

545
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,850
For some reason, I felt as though you were like my father.

546
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,650
Even though I have never experienced a father's love,

547
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:30,690
I got to experience something similar thanks to you.

548
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,630
Son, thank you.

549
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:39,299
But...

550
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,770
in my next life, I'll be born as your father.

551
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:49,770
Hey, Yi Chan!

552
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,080
Don't make me set the table twice. Come out and eat now!

553
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,049
Are you going back?

554
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:42,389
I saw your reflection on the window...

555
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,500
and the sad look on your face before bidding farewell.

556
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:50,339
That was my Sherlock Holmes moment.

557
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:57,409
I'm sorry.

558
00:42:58,779 --> 00:42:59,839
Where are you going?

559
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,150
Home? Abroad to study?

560
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,980
Or the future?

561
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:08,290
You said you were from the future.

562
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:12,589
I'm really sorry.

563
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,290
I'm just curious.

564
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:19,600
What happens to me in the future?

565
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,400
Do I even go to college?

566
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:25,739
What about the band? Do I keep playing?

567
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,610
Will I...

568
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,909
be able to hear then?

569
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,750
Will I have stopped putting my grandma through a hard time...

570
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,449
and become a good grandson,

571
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:45,960
leading a proper life?

572
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,290
You will have a good life.

573
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,969
Your life will twinkle more than anyone's life.

574
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,540
Remember what I told you before?

575
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,739
Your wife will love you.

576
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,310
Your children will respect you.

577
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:07,580
You will become an excellent father.

578
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,250
That will be your future.

579
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:14,190
Your weakness will make you unique.

580
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,420
You will turn every hardship...

581
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:19,389
into the story of a hero.

582
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,929
- So... - What are you saying?

583
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,829
I can't hear you at all.

584
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,029
So...

585
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,739
Keep your promise.

586
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:43,980
Be strong and overcome this.

587
00:44:45,779 --> 00:44:47,449
Make sure to become my father.

588
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,230
You listened to it.

589
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,440
This isn't your fault.

590
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,409
Accidents are just accidents.

591
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,850
I will be miserable for some time now.

592
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,719
But I won't be in despair, thinking my life is ruined.

593
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:23,690
So go.

594
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:26,060
Don't even look back, and leave.

595
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,330
Go.

596
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:31,730
When you can finally get rid of that guilty look on your face,

597
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:35,069
come back to see me.

598
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,349
(I have no doubt that you will come.)

599
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,889
I have no doubt that you will come.

600
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,988
I thought about waiting for you a little longer.

601
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:01,960
But I have a long way ahead of you, so I'll get going first.

602
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:05,299
See you after 28 years. Metaphor On.

603
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:23,449
What? What's wrong with this?

604
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,489
Gosh.

605
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,690
Oh, no.

606
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,730
Excuse me!

607
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,560
Is anyone out here? I need help!

608
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,969
Gosh. Please help me!

(Used Books, The Day)

612
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,060
I want my guitar back.

613
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,600
I guess you want to change your life,

614
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:49,630
not other people's lives this time.

615
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:52,100
Drink this while I go and look for it.

616
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,239
The lavender in the tea was harvested personally by me.

617
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,670
It will help you calm down and sleep better.

618
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:01,810
Here's a thing about life.

619
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:04,779
It may not give you everything you want.

620
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,690
But it does hide a small present for you from time to time.

621
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,459
I hope you can endure...

622
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,920
the cruel hardship life throws your way.

623
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,029
So you can receive the present life has tucked away.

624
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:21,369
To you...

625
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,600
and everyone you wanted to protect,

626
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,569
viva la Vida.

627
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,009
Long live life.

628
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:47,230
What is it? Was there a problem with the way I stored it?

629
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:49,929
Who on earth are you?

630
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,400
Even if I were to ask you that, you won't give me an answer.

631
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,940
Just think of it as a joke from the deity.

632
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:03,009
Life is filled with all kinds of metaphors.

633
00:49:03,469 --> 00:49:05,080
Interpretation is solely up to the receiver.

634
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,350
There are no right answers.

635
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,750
- I don't follow you. - Okay.

636
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:17,049
But thanks for the tea.

637
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,339
You're an artist. You should know what a metaphor is.

638
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:48,420
When you find yourself in need of an answer, flip a coin.

639
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,560
It was nice meeting you, kiddo.

640
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,250
What happened?

641
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,179
This is the guest room of the Jinsung family.

642
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:21,719
Am I dreaming?

643
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:24,089
Or is this real?

644
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,429
What did he put in the lavender tea? Come on.

645
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,730
- I'm sorry. I didn't get that. - Gosh, that startled me.

646
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:38,139
What year is it now?

647
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,509
It's 2023.

648
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,770
Then did I come back to the present?

649
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:46,480
Then why am I here?

650
00:50:57,989 --> 00:50:59,389
What do you mean you changed nothing?

651
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,259
You rescued Chung Ah.

652
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,759
Believe in Yi Chan.

653
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:09,230
Yi Chan and Chung Ah exist in 2023 too.

654
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:11,069
Eun Ho is there too.

655
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:14,339
There are people who are waiting for you.

656
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:17,679
And I live in that world too.

658
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:31,659
The number you dialled does not exist.

659
00:51:39,759 --> 00:51:40,969
Who are you?

660
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,170
Did you get the wrong house?

661
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:47,670
It was definitely this house.

662
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:52,039
Do you know where the previous tenants moved?

663
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,080
Nonsense.

664
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:55,880
I built this house five years ago and moved in here.

665
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:58,480
- There were no previous tenants. - Then...

666
00:52:10,759 --> 00:52:12,500
Eun Yu's history has changed.

667
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:17,170
No way. Did she fail to come back from 1995?

669
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,610
- Hey! - Where are you right now?

670
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,949
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you at the salon?

671
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,879
Forget it. I'm on my way to pick you up. Wait at your house.

What? Hello?

673

The salon?

674
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,020
What salon?

675
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,360
Excuse me.

- It's him! This is awesome! - No way!

00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:49,500
Gosh. Take his pictures.

Eun Gyeol.

680
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,569
Can you give me a strand of your hair?

681
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:55,969
My hair?

682
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:57,909
- Two, please. - What?

683
00:52:58,339 --> 00:53:00,040
I just need two strands of your hair.

What's happening? Why are they following me?

686
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:07,619

Are we going on a travel tour as a group?

00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,459
A travel tour, my foot.

705
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,329
I'm talking about our tour abroad!

706
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,400

We'll perform on stage as Yoon Dong Jin's support band.

715
00:54:13,219 --> 00:54:14,749

So let me get this straight.

719
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,339

722
00:54:41,909 --> 00:54:44,520
So we are going to perform at the party.

724
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,750
You're back to your senses, right?

725
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:52,420
Then can you please get to the green room already?

726
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,960
Let's go. Come on.

727
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,100

729
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,799
I missed you, Eun Ho!

730
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:11,909
What about your suit?

732

You need to meet Dad's friends.

733

I told you to put that on.

734
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:19,779
I had never...

735
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,089
considered you my burden.

736
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,420
Is that so?

737
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,460
I considered you my burden many times, actually.

738
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:32,259
Like now.

739
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:40,569

I don't agree with your dad.

754
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:02,088
Don't forget that I let you play in the band...

755
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:03,350

They're Dad's high school friends. They played in the band together.

Have you been well?

767
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:41,659

Yi Chan was the one who cut all ties with his friend.

774

775
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,549
and he missed those days.

776
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:10,448
Whenever they saw him, they seemed sad,

777
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:12,060
and watching their sad faces was painful.

(Jinsung Musical Instruments)

788
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:47,420
My initial dream was to become part of a cool band,

789
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,819
dominate the world with our music,

790
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:52,159
and win over the pretty girl.

791
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:59,400
I had lost my hearing from an accident.

792
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,529
So my dream was shattered to pieces back then.

793
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,069
When I first lost my hearing,

794
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:12,040
I was very scared.

795
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,489
I was afraid.

796
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:24,790
I was furious.

797
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:28,560
Hopelessness swallowed me.

798
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:33,630
So there was a time I couldn't talk at all.

799
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:58,819
However,

800
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,659
I gave up on giving up...

801
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,069
because as I had lived 18 years of my life...

802
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,400
in the world with sounds,

803
01:01:10,529 --> 01:01:12,369
so I was able to remember sounds.

804
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:15,069
I was also able to imagine them.

805
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:18,079
Afterwards, I had lived 28 years of my life...

806
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,339
in the world without sounds.

807
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,850
So I was certain that I'd be able to make the most beautiful...

808
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:26,520
and sought-after sound.

809
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,089
In the end,

810
01:01:32,259 --> 01:01:33,989
I had won over the pretty girl.

811
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:37,529
- What? Come on. - Gosh.

812
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,500
As for my dream of world domination,

813
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:46,000
I believe that Goliath will achieve it in my place.

820

He did!

821

I told you.

Don't you think we were slightly better than them?

don't you think Eun Gyeol looks like someone?

I feel like I can remember, but I can't. It's driving me crazy.

875

01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,120
I didn't run away.

01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:44,870
I made it.

903
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:46,940
You're back.

904
01:10:47,179 --> 01:10:49,480
I mean, you told me to come.

905
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,049
Can I drink this?

906
01:10:57,749 --> 01:10:58,959
I feel better now.

907
01:10:59,389 --> 01:11:01,159
Hearing that you feel better now,

908
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,360
I guess you gave up on that creative suicide method.

909
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,999
It's not because of you. So you don't have to feel proud.

910
01:11:08,429 --> 01:11:10,129
Oh, right. Master.

911
01:11:11,129 --> 01:11:12,400
Hurry up and just give my cello back.

912
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,139
Already?

913
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:15,939
You're rushing it too much.

914
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,809
Take a seat and calm down. Let's have a conversation.

915
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:18,979
I'm a little busy.

916
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,078
I want to see how my mom is doing.

917
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:22,679
I have questions for my dad too.

918
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,810
And I promised to meet someone.

919
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:28,179
Are you not going to give it to me? I don't have time.

920
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:34,789
Here.

921
01:11:36,329 --> 01:11:37,329
Here you go.

922
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:47,440
Thank you for the travel, Grandpa.

923
01:11:48,969 --> 01:11:51,570
For the one-dollar bills you gave only to me.

924
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:54,079
For letting me meet my mom who is the same age as me.

925
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,480
For all the good friends I made. For everything.

926
01:12:01,219 --> 01:12:03,619
I'll be doing well with my mom when I go back.

927
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:04,990
So don't worry too much.

928
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:09,190
We'll keep arguing, though.

929
01:12:11,459 --> 01:12:14,259
I'll get going then.

930
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:17,129
I'll live a good life there.

931
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,740
I was so happy that I could meet you.

932
01:12:24,969 --> 01:12:25,980
Bye.

933
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:45,259
Viva la Vida. Long live life.

934
01:12:47,299 --> 01:12:49,929
(Cameo appearance: Ryu Su Young, Song Chang Eui, and Zin Tai Hyun)

935
01:13:40,919 --> 01:13:43,850
(The soundtrack "Story About You and Me" by wYte is released.)

936
01:13:50,829 --> 01:13:53,400
(Thank you for watching Twinkling Watermelon.)

937
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:58,839
