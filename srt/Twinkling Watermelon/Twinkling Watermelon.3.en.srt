1
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,750
(Ryeo Un)

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,949
(Choi Hyun Wook)

3
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:19,650
(Seol In Ah)

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,630
(Shin Eun Soo)

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,909
(Twinkling Watermelon)

6
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,939
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,968
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:41,009
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

9
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,340
This is a Pythagorean prime. We have 1, 2,

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,949
and square root of five.

11
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,050
We have a 4 on this side. These sides are 3 and 5. That's it.

12
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:49,449
This is 2 square root of 10.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,289
It's 2 square root of 10.

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,649
Two square root of ten.

15
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:53,919
Then we have everything we need.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,120
How can we figure this out, then?

17
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,318
Use the Ptolemy's theorem.

18
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:58,929
- We can just use that theorem. - Yes.

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
I did it.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,130
Gosh, that brat.

21
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:06,429
Goal.

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,140
Hey.

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,740
If you want to waste your life, get out of my class.

24
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:18,479
Sir.

25
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,020
When was the era of glory for you?

26
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,050
Was it when you passed the exam to be a schoolteacher?

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,289
Was it when you married your wife?

28
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:26,819
Or...

29
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:28,660
was it when your son was born?

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,390
I don't have a child. I'm divorced too.

31
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:31,929
What nonsense is this?

32
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,000
My era...

33
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,240
is now.

34
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:47,168
- Get out of my class now then. - I'm sorry.

35
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:48,909
- Get out. - I didn't know you were divorced.

36
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,538
- I'm sorry. - You brat. Get out now.

37
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,178
- Get out. You little... - Okay.

38
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,280
Gosh. That brat. Seriously.

39
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:58,949
My name is Ha Yi Chan. I'm 18 years old now.

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,619
My life is twinkling to the fullest.

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,890
Pedal faster!

42
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,990
Come on. Let's go!

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,929
It was the spring of 1995.

44
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,699
There was no doubt that I was in my youth.

45
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,769
My youth radiated without much effort that spring.

46
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:18,910
I met other young kids who would change my life completely.

47
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,810
(Used Books, The Day)

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,410
Thanks.

49
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,289
Sir, did you get any new issues of "Slam Dunk?"

50
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:34,589
Check the bookshelf over there.

51
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,590
What about "Dragon Ball?"

52
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,919
Check the shelf above the stairs.

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,960
The first person to change my life completely was...

54
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:15,859
"My left hand is there..."

55
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:17,930
"solely as support."

56
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,069
Kang Baek Ho, the epitome of innocence and positive energy.

57
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:23,500
He'll forever be my comic brother.

58
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,340
Choi Se Gyeong.

59
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,509
My queen. My muse.

60
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,310
And...

61
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:35,519
You should be in a band then.

62
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,219
They worship guys in a band.

63
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,989
What is this? Why did you just pop up?

64
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,619
He's not that important. Let's skip him.

65
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,159
Hey, wait.

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,059
Why are you skipping me? What are you doing?

67
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,430
Come here, you punk.

68
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,630
Gosh. I'll give you a really good deal for that.

69
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,970
I'm supposed to charge you 23 dollars.

70
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:56,840
But you can buy it for 20 dollars.

71
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,639
What's that look on your face?

72
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,310
Okay. You have a likable face.

73
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,280
Then...

74
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,650
I'll be reasonable. Just give me 12 dollars.

75
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,279
- Thank you. - My close friend's...

76
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
girlfriend's brother...

77
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,019
goes to Baekwang High School, so I'm giving you a good deal.

78
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,350
Okay.

79
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,988
Kurt Cobain.

80
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,660
The legendary band musician. The idol of the ladies.

81
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,199
His life sparkled the most intensely, albeit briefly,

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,530
and taught me a piece of truth.

83
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,399
- Se Gyeong. - Se Gyeong.

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,168
- It's Se Gyeong. - What's going on?

85
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,369
- She looks great in that shirt. - Gosh, she's so pretty.

86
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,340
My gosh. Why is he not here?

87
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,418
The only way to win over a beauty like her...

88
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,989
for a poor guy with no connections like me is...

89
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,590
I guess you like bands as well.

90
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,129
You should've told me.

91
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,960
Actually,

92
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:58,470
I'm in a band too.

93
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:02,939
Se Gyeong.

94
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,809
Do you want to come to our concert later?

95
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,710
My school is having a festival a month later.

96
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:12,950
I will prepare a performance, just for you.

97
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Please come to watch me.

98
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,279
Does your band actually exist?

99
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,950
- I'm going to make one now. - What?

100
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:18,590
I bought this T-shirt.

101
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,689
I also bought a guitar pick.

102
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,960
I'm ready to show you my affection.

103
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,629
I just need to start my band. You'll come, right?

104
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,460
Why would I?

105
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,030
I'm making the band just for you...

106
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,559
and putting on the concert just for you too.

107
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:32,600
Besides, there will be a spot, just for you.

108
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,169
- Give him an answer. - Give him an answer.

109
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:41,639
- What? - What's going on?

110
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,439
Se Gyeong, I didn't peg you to be such a bold woman.

111
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:45,350
- Sure. - Really?

112
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,879
Did you really just say, "sure?"

113
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:51,989
But...

114
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,489
- I have conditions. - Go ahead.

115
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,589
What are the conditions? Just tell me!

116
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,859
But you must promise me this first.

117
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,829
If you can't keep your promise,

118
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,859
you will never show up in front of me ever again.

119
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,530
Fine. But you need to promise me something too.

120
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:06,770
If I keep my promise,

121
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:08,770
give me a chance to be your boyfriend.

122
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,538
The chance of that happening is close to zero.

123
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,210
The world of possibility is unbelievable.

124
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,039
Tell me what the conditions are.

125
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,510
Firstly, it must be a new band.

126
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,649
You'd better stop now...

127
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,418
if you're thinking about joining an already successful band.

128
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,678
Secondly, you must already know how to play an instrument.

129
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:24,949
You will have to do a solo performance.

130
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,820
Thirdly, I will pick the song.

131
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:28,659
If you're thinking about picking an easy song,

132
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,720
you might as well stop now.

133
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,260
What do you say? Are you still in?

134
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,058
Of course. What's the title?

135
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:37,200
- What's the title? - What's the title?

136
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,100
What's the title?

137
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:40,229
- What's the title? - What's the title?

138
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,369
"Come as You Are" by Nirvana.

139
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,580
Hey, can you actually do it?

140
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,350
- That was insane. - Can you really do it?

141
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,359
- Are you sure about this? - What do you mean?

142
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:07,830
The bet.

143
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,799
What if he pulls it off?

144
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,969
He will never be able to pull it off.

145
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,570
How can you be so certain?

146
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,069
I could tell just by looking at his fingers.

147
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,070
Those weren't the hands of a man who could play an instrument.

148
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,210
Then why did you play along?

149
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,239
That innocent boy must be excited for nothing.

150
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,649
He will need people to play in a band.

151
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,379
The song by Nirvana isn't easy to perform either.

152
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,319
He will be busy forming a band and practicing the song.

153
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,850
He won't be bothering me for a while now.

154
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,450
When he fails his mission,

155
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,950
he'll be too embarrassed to show his face.

156
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,419
But you might have overlooked something.

157
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,390
What do you mean?

158
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,059
A boy in love...

159
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,929
can sometimes have superpowers.

160
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,869
I will bet ten dollars that he will succeed.

161
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,570
Come on. Whose side are you on?

162
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,179
- You want to make what? - A band.

163
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,049
You're not talking about the Band-Aid, right?

164
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,080
- That was a joke, right? - You're crazy, right?

165
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,520
Bands aren't something you can just form overnight.

166
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,249
Apparently, that's possible.

167
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,489
- How? - Baekwang Band.

168
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,260
Are you talking about our school band?

169
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:26,309
Performances by attention-seekers.

170
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,309
A group of nutcases.

171
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,209
Every time they performed,

172
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,409
they competed against each other to stand out.

173
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,048
So the only sane member, their guitarist,

174
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,049
transferred to another school.

175
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,419
In the end, the band was forced to disband.

176
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,349
- That Baekwang Band? - Yes.

177
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,618
They said yes when I promised them dates with college girls.

178
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,859
Are you crazy? What could you possibly do with those guys?

179
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,930
Hey, my friend.

180
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:47,728
The name, Baekwang Band,

181
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:51,699
has already vanished into thin air as a part of their humiliating past.

182
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
So now...

183
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:56,739
(First Love Memory Manipulators)

184
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,570
Did you see that?

185
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,540
I will be the first love of every girl out there.

186
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,479
Se Gyeong will especially lose her memory completely.

187
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Right.

188
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:10,019
You're my band's manager.

189
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,989
- Congratulations. - What?

190
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,560
- Gosh. No. Never. I don't want... - My friend.

191
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,889
Welcome to The Manipulators.

192
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,070
You definitely promised us dates with dance majors.

193
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,569
I'll kill you if you bring martial arts majors.

194
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,600
What? Have you been lied to your whole life?

195
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,100
I'm sure you've heard of it.

196
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,039
Getting a room in Snail Guesthouse...

197
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,710
is harder than getting accepted into college.

198
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,940
My grandmother runs the guesthouse.

199
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:39,009
Isn't that a men-only guesthouse?

200
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,309
No college girls can stay in that guesthouse.

201
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,419
You must not know that...

202
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,420
all these men go to prestigious universities.

203
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,949
Their girlfriends are flight attendants,

204
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,220
ballerinas, and designers.

205
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,559
How much time do we have left until the show?

206
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,330
We have 1 month and 10 days until the festival.

207
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,200
- We have enough time. - Okay.

208
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,430
Then...

209
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,200
show us what you got, frontman.

210
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,670
Of course.

211
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,739
This is the moment of truth.

212
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,690
Two, three, four.

213
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,580
What? Why did you stop?

214
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
- Are you nervous? - This is all I've got.

215
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,618
How could he be so nonchalant about this?

216
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:58,729
Am I the only one,

217
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,528
itching to throw a few punches? It's been a while.

218
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,158
Hey, I'm a vocalist.

219
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,998
I can just do a good job with the intro.

220
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:06,829
I will play by myself during the intro.

221
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,138
You guys can play your instruments while I sing.

222
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,200
Darn it.

223
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,340
Do you think we're some backup band for you?

224
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,179
If you want to sing, go to karaoke and sing by yourself.

225
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,779
Hey, calm down.

226
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,849
Yi Chan, just give it up.

227
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,820
You can't have a band without a guitarist.

228
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,279
You heard your friend, right?

229
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,590
Unbelievable.

230
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,550
It was awful meeting you.

231
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:29,658
Let's not see each other again.

232
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:30,659
Let's go.

233
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:35,200
Wait!

234
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:37,259
Wait.

235
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:41,070
Okay. I understand what you're saying.

236
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,600
Let's get someone then. Let's do it!

237
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,138
I'll recruit an awesome guitarist.

238
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,180
Are you that dumb?

239
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,709
We don't have time to recruit a guitarist and practice with him.

240
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,608
We'll need someone like Yoon Dong Jin to make this work.

241
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,779
Yoon Dong Jin? Who is that?

242
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,420
I'll bring him then!

243
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,189
Do you even know who Yoon Dong Jin is?

244
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,220
Dong Jin.

245
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:03,759
I know him very well.

246
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,259
I knew it.

247
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,399
See? What did I tell you?

248
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,699
I told you he might know Dong Jin because he's from Chuncheon.

249
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,299
Anyone can know him. Knowing him personally matters.

250
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,070
I know who Yoon Dong Jin is too.

251
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,499
Yoon Dong Jin.

252
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,408
The genius guitarist...

253
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:21,009
in the second year at Chuncheon National University of Education.

254
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,738
He gave a song he wrote at the age of 13 to a professional singer.

255
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:28,149
He's a talented musician in songwriting as well.

256
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,720
Gosh, he was one of my students, but he was indeed special.

257
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,849
You taught Yoon Dong Jin?

258
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,889
Oh, no.

259
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,560
I said something I shouldn't have said.

260
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:41,628
The truth is, I'm the one who taught him how to play the guitar.

261
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,898
Gosh. Have some of this.

262
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,170
It's nicely grilled. It's Chuncheon-style spicy chicken.

263
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:47,399
Let me try it.

264
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:52,210
It smells just like Chuncheon.

265
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,710
Bal San.

266
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,709
Can you give Dong Jin a call?

267
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,050
- Please? - Yi Chan, it's burning. Flip it.

268
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,519
Hey, you're burning it. Come on.

269
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,050
But why do you need me to call him?

270
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,289
The truth is, he formed a band.

271
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,929
He needs to invite a guitarist at the last minute.

272
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,998
He must do it before the festival.

273
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:17,498
Gosh. I wonder if Dong Jin will do it.

274
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:18,868
Perform with a high school band?

275
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:21,229
That's why I'm asking you to call him.

276
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,138
If you don't want to talk to him directly,

277
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,139
give me his number.

278
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,540
I'm good at kneeling in front of people.

279
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,239
You brat.

280
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,279
Wait.

281
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,289
Dong Jin is a night owl.

282
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,290
So I don't think he will pick up the phone now.

283
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:43,320
I'll call his oldest brother instead.

284
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,529
Hey.

285
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,039
Hello.

286
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,570
- Hello. - He answered it.

287
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,340
I'm Bal San from Chuncheon.

288
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:01,739
Who is this?

289
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,739
I think you got the wrong number.

290
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,009
Gosh. I know.

291
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,680
By the way, what's Dong Jin up to these days?

292
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,519
What? He disappeared?

293
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,859
He went to Mount Odae four days ago...

294
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,759
to work on a song?

295
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,590
It's impossible to reach him?

296
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,158
Mount Odae? Are you kidding me?

297
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,429
- You jerk. - Okay.

298
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,199
- How dare you make a prank call... - All right...

299
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,939
- in the middle of the afternoon? - Okay. Bye.

300
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,540
You're totally disturbing my sleep.

301
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:34,670
So that's it.

302
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:36,809
Bal San, can you at least give me his phone number?

303
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,210
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

304
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:40,580
I need to get going. I have an appointment too.

305
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,658
This is the online forum all the talented musicians are on.

306
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:59,499
I've seen a lot of recruitment posts for bands too.

307
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,498
Who knows?

308
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:03,439
Maybe, Yoon Dong Jin might check this forum.

309
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,899
- Let's post one. - Sounds good.

310
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,839
(To Genius Guitarist Yoon Dong Jin from Chuncheon)

311
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,210
(Hello. My name is Ha Yi Chan, the frontman of a high school band.)

312
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,879
Hold on. The bait is too insignificant.

313
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,809
We won't be able to hook him with this.

314
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,749
Then what can we hook him with? Should we offer earthworms?

315
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,549
Tell him we'll offer room and board.

316
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,989
What? Have you gone mad? You need your grandma's approval...

317
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,330
As long as...

318
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,300
you join our bad,

319
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,440
we can provide you...

320
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,570
with three hot meals daily...

321
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:41,040
and a clean room...

322
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,249
to stay in for free.

323
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:53,819
Hello.

324
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,719
My name is Ha Yi Chan,

325
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,888
the frontman of a high school band,

326
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:00,129
First Love Memory Manipulators at Baekwang High School.

327
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,728
Excuse me for being forward in my first message to you.

328
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:04,059
But I was wondering if you would be interested in...

329
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,469
moving to Seoul, the heart of culture,

330
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,869
from the beautiful lake city of Chuncheon.

331
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,368
My high school will have a festival in a month.

332
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,368
So I have mustered up my courage to invite you...

333
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:14,239
as a special guest of our band.

334
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,978
As long as you join our bad,

335
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:18,949
we can provide you with three hot meals daily...

336
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,820
and a clean room to stay in for free.

337
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:24,148
I also promise you that we will help you navigate...

338
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,889
your new life in Seoul.

339
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,019
Who is this jerk, calling at this late hour?

340
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,369
- Hello. This is Snail... - Hey. He wrote back!

341
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,810
Yoon Dong Jin wrote a post on the online forum!

342
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:48,580
Wait. I need to hang up.

343
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:07,989
Dong Jin!

344
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,429
Hello, I'm Yoon Dong Jin.

345
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:14,329
I was actually planning to go to Seoul soon,

346
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,199
so I was looking for a place to stay.

347
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,540
Reading your offer at the Snail Guesthouse was perfect.

348
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,840
I feel so honored and lucky.

349
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:26,580
I will gladly join you...

350
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,209
as a guest member for the festival.

351
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,350
- Hi, how can I help you? - Hi.

352
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,589
Do you have any rock albums?

353
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,490
Rock? Just a second.

354
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,490
So he's going to be standing there with the school newspaper?

355
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,060
Yes. I said we would be wearing school uniforms.

356
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,260
So he will recognize us soon.

357
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:45,599
But I looked into Yoon Dong Jin. He seems quite unique.

358
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,729
He's a little whimsical and quirky.

359
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,739
- Ma Joo. - Yes?

360
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,740
He's a musician. That's how geniuses are.

361
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,009
Anyway, you should curry favor with him.

362
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,070
Don't say something anything stupid and make him change his mind.

363
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,280
Don't worry.

364
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,080
The horoscope said I would be extremely lucky today.

365
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,609
What did it say?

366
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:02,749
"As a butterfly's fluttering wings change the weather,"

367
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,619
"a small incident will lead to an unexpected result."

(Used Books, The Day)

369
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,500
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:25,909
Excuse me, you...

371
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,580
(The CNUE Monthly, April 1995 Issue)

372
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,080
What on earth is going on?

373
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,619
It's 1995?

374
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,850
Yoon Dong Jin?

375
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:44,959
It's you.

376
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,829
Oh Ma Joo!

377
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,699
- "Oh Ma Joo?" - He's over here!

378
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,169
Gosh. You're here early.

379
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:54,698
Hey, you're in a band.

380
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:55,869
How could you not know who Oh Ma Joo is?

381
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,500
You know who Yoon Dong Jin is, right?

382
00:18:57,699 --> 00:18:58,708
Of course, I do.

383
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,169
He's the godfather of Korean band music.

384
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,579
Oh Ma Joo is the one who helped Yoon Dong Jin...

385
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,139
become the number one artist in the country.

386
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:07,510
Could they be the Oh Ma Joo and Yoon Dong Jin I know about?

387
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Then...

388
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,480
Who...

389
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,688
I'm the frontman of the band, First Love Memory Manipulators.

390
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:17,359
My name is Ha Yi Chan.

391
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,959
"Ha Yi Chan?"

392
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,230
Ha Yi Chan?

393
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,330
Dad?

394
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,109
It's Dad.

395
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,570
Dad...

396
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:36,780
can talk.

397
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:40,178
- Are you really Dad? - I don't think I am.

398
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,519
Ha Yi Chan, born in 1978, Year of the Horse, right?

399
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,789
Unless I've been lied to about my birth, that's probably right.

400
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,349
You grew with up your grandma who ran a guesthouse...

401
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,819
until you were in high school. Her name is Go Yang Hee.

402
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,589
And the name of the guesthouse is Snail. Am I right?

403
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,729
Excuse me. Dong Jin, let's go somewhere to...

404
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,958
Am I right? Answer me right now!

405
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes, you're right.

406
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,969
But how can Dad speak?

407
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,270
Because I have a mouth. Can you just allow me to speak?

408
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:05,510
Why have you not been talking to me?

409
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,409
I thought you couldn't speak since you were born.

410
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:09,780
And why are you in a band?

411
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,149
How about Mom? Where is she?

412
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,250
It's a UFO.

413
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,580
My goodness.

414
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,349
You can't leave me behind.

415
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,119
I don't know anyone in this area.

416
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,858
Dad!

417
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,060
I'm not your dad!

418
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,169
He...

419
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:42,209
- Gosh. - Oh, gosh.

420
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,010
Hey, are you sure he's just whimsical?

421
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:47,878
He's just on another level.

422
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,218
I warned you.

423
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:51,049
That it wouldn't be easy to deal with him.

424
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,689
He's crazy. He called me Dad.

425
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:55,789
I would've gotten in trouble if Se Gyeong had heard that.

426
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,790
What do we do? Should we cancel our plan?

427
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,159
Should we give up on our band?

428
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:02,428
But is he actually Yoon Dong Jin?

429
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,629
Yes, I am.

430
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:08,800
I'm Yoon Dong Jin.

431
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:10,869
I don't think you are.

432
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:12,909
What should I do to make you believe that?

433
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:18,639
Which school do you go to?

434
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,049
CNUE, entered in 1994, mathematics education major.

435
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,009
- What instruments can you play? - I'm amazing at guitar and bass.

436
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,819
Better than average on the keyboard and quite good at drums.

437
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,490
- When did you start playing guitar? - When I was in elementary...

438
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,549
When I was a fourth grader.

439
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,059
- Date of birth? - March 21, 1975.

440
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,019
My baby bump nickname is Bambi, the deer.

441
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,688
Do you even know that?

442
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,388
Of course. He's a legend in Korea's band scene.

443
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:37,530
If you read his magazine interviews, you can get all that information.

444
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,368
Gosh, he said he was a legend himself.

445
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:41,699
He's indeed crazy.

446
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:43,668
Where did we talk to each other for the first time?

447
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,868
A club bulletin board on a PC network.

448
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:46,409
Why do you keep calling me Dad?

449
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,740
Because you look like the Father of Music.

450
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:53,780
What was my first impression?

451
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:55,279
You were much more handsome than I thought,

452
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,419
which was surprising.

453
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,850
Pass!

454
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,489
Welcome to First Love Memory Manipulators.

455
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,490
Yes.

456
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:03,490
(In front of Hongik University)

457
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,869
I guess it's your first time in Seoul.

458
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,540
No, it's not. I've been living in Seoul since I was born.

459
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:22,340
I was joking.

460
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:24,810
I was born and raised in Chuncheon, and it's my first time in Seoul.

461
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,280
It's my first time in Seoul in 1995, though.

462
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,980
Anyway, he's quite unique.

463
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,189
Don't you think so, Ma Joo?

464
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,560
Okay. Oh, my. The bus is coming.

465
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:54,039
- Excuse me. - Yes?

466
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,240
I lost my wallet and all my cash.

467
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,649
What do I do? I only have commutation tickets.

468
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,909
"Commutation tickets?"

469
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,790
Oh, well. You look way younger than your age, so...

470
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,089
I got another commutation ticket.

471
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,929
Here are two tickets for two.

472
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,399
This must be a dream.

473
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:19,469
I just had an argument with my dad before going out.

474
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:22,699
Now, I'm with my dad who is the same age as me.

475
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,340
And he can speak.

476
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:26,409
He's even a member of a band.

477
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,709
This must be a dream.

478
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,079
- Hey. - Yes?

479
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,419
I feel so uncomfortable.

480
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,750
His stare is so intense that it could fry me.

481
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,030
By the way, when did you come down from Mount Odae?

482
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:48,188
- "Mount Odae?" - What?

483
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:49,259
- What? - What?

484
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,830
I heard you were working on music there.

485
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,070
Oh, that one?

486
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:57,669
Oh, right. I went to Mount Odae to work on music.

487
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,510
It hasn't been long since I got back.

488
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,679
Like yesterday?

489
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,850
I see.

490
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,780
Oh, right.

491
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:11,178
Can I speak more casually since we'll be working together?

492
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:12,219
Excuse me?

493
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:15,590
I know people don't care about Confucian values anymore, but...

494
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,358
It means no.

495
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,230
No, I don't mind.

496
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,759
You can speak casually.

497
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,790
Really?

498
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,859
You speak casually first then.

499
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,770
How can I...

500
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,730
Come on, treat me as if I'm your younger brother.

501
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,540
Call me Yi Chan.

502
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,040
"Yi Chan." Come on.

503
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,350
Yi...

504
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:47,520
- Yi Chan. - Yes, Dong Jin.

505
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,889
Did you call me?

506
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,760
We should get off at this stop.

507
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:53,230
- Let's go. - But...

508
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,359
where are we going?

509
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,270
So who is this person?

510
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,810
The Son of Chuncheon. The genius guitarist, Yoon Dong Jin.

511
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,669
I told you I would bring him.

512
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,580
It was last fall...

513
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,549
when we went to the festival at CNUE.

514
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,590
Yes.

515
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,990
And finally, he came on the stage.

516
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,159
With a blinding halo.

517
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:27,859
Oh, my gosh.

518
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,830
Thanks.

519
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,669
He didn't need a band.

520
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,069
His guitar alone could cover all the bass riffs, drum parts,

521
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,269
and melody lines as well.

522
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,339
Hyun Yul, what a lengthy greeting.

523
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,469
- That's enough. Let's practice. - I was so excited to meet him...

524
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,909
that I even went to the sauna last night.

525
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:46,678
I had no idea that you'd fool me like this.

526
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,378
What do you mean? Explain so I can understand...

527
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:50,719
Isn't it obvious? Do I have to spell it out for you? Idiot!

528
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,590
This jerk. He's not Yoon Dong Jin.

529
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:56,789
What? What do you mean he's not Yoon Dong Jin?

530
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,888
Why are you so naive?

531
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,789
Do you not have a brain?

532
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,500
Dong Jin, you tell us.

533
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:04,229
Oh, me?

534
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,070
You were standing at that spot, holding the magazine.

535
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,868
You know a lot about my grandma's guesthouse,

536
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:11,000
about me, and about you as well...

537
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:16,240
In fact, you know too much.

538
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,109
Way too much.

539
00:26:20,449 --> 00:26:21,480
Do you get it now?

540
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,749
Do you know what this is called?

541
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,050
This is called fraud, you idiot.

542
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:29,389
You guys are so dead.

543
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:32,530
Darn it.

544
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:38,229
If I see you, you're dead meat.

545
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,499
You'd better behave yourself.

546
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,799
You little... I should've known better when you joined the band...

547
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,069
just because you were head over heels for Choi Se Gyeong.

548
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,369
Darn you!

550
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:56,919
So, you're not Yoon Dong Jin?

551
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,550
So...

552
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:02,389
you joined the band because of a girl?

553
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,388
You little... Who are you?

554
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:07,689
- Who is Choi Se Gyeong? - Are you out of your mind?

555
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:10,059
You duped me. How dare you mess with me?

556
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,499
Look who's talking. Dad, are you crazy?

557
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,168
You're cheating at age 18?

558
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:15,969
Am I Handel? Why do you keep calling me "Dad?"

559
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,740
Handel is the mother of music. Bach is the father of music.

560
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,069
Dad, you're supposed to be in love with Yoon Chung Ah!

561
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,179
Who is Yoon Chung Ah?

562
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,490
(Thanks for this.)

563
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,070
Oh, it's Frida Kahlo's painting.

564
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,840
I love this painting too.

565
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,889
You're always wearing your earphones.

566
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,290
Yes, your earphones.

567
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:11,918
Why are you wearing them all the time?

568
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:12,929
You can't hear anyway.

569
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,459
Oh, that's not what I meant.

570
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,330
I'm sorry.

571
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,219
You're listening to the beats.

572
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:43,189
Do you like band music?

573
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:53,500
Do you like band music?

574
00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:00,040
I see. That's cool.

575
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,379
Do you like that guy?

576
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,419

577
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,090

578
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,830
(Do you like that guy?)

579
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,939
(Do you like that guy?)

580
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,879
Oh, I guess you saw us that day.

581
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:45,649
Do I like him?

582
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,659
No. Not at all.

583
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:57,859
But I find him amusing,

584
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,770
like a fun comic book.

585
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,469
One that makes you curious about the next episode.

586
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:08,439
Hey, Yoon Chung Ah!

587
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,010
Oh, that's right. She can't hear.

588
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,750
What a hassle.

589
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:22,250
(The homeroom teacher said to come to the teachers' office now.)

590
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,159
Min A, is this really your painting?

591
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:27,459
Yes.

592
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:31,199
The art teacher brought this...

593
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,169
and said you kept copying Chung Ah's work.

594
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,600
You tell us the truth.

595
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:38,899
Whose painting is the original? Who copied whom?

596
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:41,908
Sir, this is so unfair.

597
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:42,939
What's unfair?

598
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:45,839
Why are you interrogating me and not her?

599
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,678
You're already assuming that I copied her!

600
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,780
My goodness. Stop crying at once.

601
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,719
You did nothing to be proud of.

602
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,749
Thank goodness we checked before you submitted this.

603
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,260
This would've been so embarrassing for the school.

604
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,829
Anyway, we can't submit this to the contest. Just know that.

605
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,590
No. Please submit it for me, sir.

606
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,358
I need to win more awards to go to college.

607
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,270
No. Controversial applications will be denied.

608
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,799
That's the rule.

609
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,270
Why are you standing there? Take your painting.

610
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:36,599
See? What did I tell you?

611
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,599
I said you wouldn't be able to fool our homeroom teacher.

612
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,070
Shut your mouth, will you?

613
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:48,240
That witch.

614
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:50,479
She won't even participate in the contest anyway.

615
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,139
Why must she get in my way?

616
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:55,879
I bet she was the one who told the chairwoman on me.

617
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,750
Chung Ah won't be participating in the contest?

618
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,090
Why not?

619
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,519
She's not satisfied with her painting.

620
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,559
My gosh.

621
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,090
She thinks she's a real artist or something.

622
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:08,888
But then again, her stepmother is the chairwoman of the school.

623
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:10,398
No wonder none of the teachers scares her,

624
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,260
and she's not even worried about getting into college.

625
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:15,529
She got into this school thanks to the special admission program.

626
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,240
The one for students with disabilities.

627
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,169
Gosh, that scared me. What's with her?

628
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,379
- My gosh. Has she lost her mind? - She must be going crazy.

629
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,020
Yes, keep acting up like that.

630
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:36,389

631
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:50,469
Hey!

632
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,300
Oh, no!

633
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:54,108
- Hey! - Break it up!

634
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:55,839
- Hey! - What are you two doing?

635
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,509
- Hey, stop! - Let go!

00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,549
- Girls! - You two can talk it out!

640
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:10,159
But he joined the band because of another girl?

641
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,859
I'm so disappointed. He totally let me down.

642
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,529
If this is a dream, I'll wake up.

643
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,060

About ten years.

654
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,979
Why do you ask?

655
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,079
Then don't you know La Vida Music? They sell musical instruments.

656
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,209
"La Vida?"

657
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,909
I've never heard of such a store before.

658
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,020
It must be somewhere around here.

659
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,989
Please try to remember if you've heard of it.

660
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,419
I've been living and working in this area for years,

661

What if that door allows you to travel through dimensions?

668

What if that door is the passage between the past and the present?

669

670

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,049
You know, from Chuncheon National University of Education.

717
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,080
Anyway, you said you offered him room and board...

718
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:40,089
in exchange for free tutoring sessions.

719
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,218
Oh, that. I decided not to do it.

720
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,860
- Why not? - Grandma.

721
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,690
I met him, and he's a con man.

722
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:47,989
Why do you say that? Did he look scary?

723
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:50,460
Yes, he looked so...

724
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,669
I mean, he's got a nice face. He's quite good-looking.

725
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,770
What? So why won't you do it?

726
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,809
Did he look dumb?

727
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,179
Yes! He's so...

728
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,579
You were much more handsome than I thought,

729
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,650
which was surprising.

730
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
He looks smart.

731
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,089
I don't know who his parents are, but he looked really smart.

732
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,889
What? Then why didn't you bring him here?

733
00:39:17,259 --> 00:39:19,859
You just don't want to study. That's it, right?

734
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,359
No, that's not it!

735
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,600
Grandma, you don't know anything. Seriously!

736
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,199
What in the world?

737
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:30,040
Goodness. I thought it was the best thing you'd ever done.

738
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,069
Hey.

739
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,080
So? You two parted ways right away?

740
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,949
Then what was I supposed to do? Have a gunfight with him?

741
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,420
Then you should've called me and let me know.

742
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,349
You said you'd bring him here,

743
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,249
so I went grocery shopping and cooked up a storm all day.

744
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,290
Why would you bother making food for him?

745
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,388
Can't you see that your grandmother is talking?

746
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:54,960
Don't you dare talk back to me.

747
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,600
You said he came here all the way from Chuncheon.

748
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,670
We should give him a warm welcome and take care of him.

749
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:04,799
Is that how I raised you?

750
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,909
No. I'm sorry.

751
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,710
Wash up at once, and have some food.

752
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,349
He must be exhausted after the long train ride.

753
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,409
He should've at least stopped by for some food.

754
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,650
You're so rude!

755
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:22,389
Gosh.

756
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,920
He's not a kid, so he won't starve.

757
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,190
- Sorry, excuse me. - Yes?

758
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:32,460
I lost my wallet, so I don't have a single penny on me now.

759
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,569
I wonder if he's eaten.

760
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:37,940
He did look quite tired.

761
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,569
What?

762
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,880
Why do I care whether or not that jerk is starving?

763
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,540
He's a despicable con man...

764
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,949
and a complete stranger who has nothing to do with me!

765
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,690
Okay, 1992...

766
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,860
This is from 1990. Nice.

767
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,860
This is from 1999.

768
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,000
Oh, this is from 1991.

769
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,500
Nice.

770
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,509
Gosh, I feel much better now.

771
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:28,119
Mom.

772
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,020
Dad kicked me out.

773
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
Mom.

774
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,469
I feel so lost.

775
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:44,369
Mom.

776
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:50,480
I wish I could have your doenjang stew right now.

777
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:54,610
Mom.

778
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,750
Mom...

779
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,589
That's right. I should look for Mom. Why hadn't I thought of that?

780
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,819
Mom and Dad are the same age,

781
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:07,860
so if I find her school...

782
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,799
Mom, how come you don't have a single yearbook?

783
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,000
I lost them all in a flood years ago.

784
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,409
What about pictures of your parents?

785
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,310
Do you have any other family members?

786
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:26,279
No, I don't.

787
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:28,610
I practically grew up an orphan.

788
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:30,279
The rest is a secret.

789
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,250
I'll tell you more when you're older, okay?

790
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
Okay.

791
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:39,659
I know nothing...

792
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,060
about Mom.

793
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,679
(Please use it as if it is your bathroom.)

794
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:19,360
I thought I knew a lot about my parents, but I was wrong.

795
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:22,569
I thought I knew enough about them,

796
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:25,500
so I never made an effort to learn more.

797
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:30,440
And at some point, I stopped being curious.

798
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,089
I told you. I didn't eat it.

799
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,619
Come on. I don't believe you.

800
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:57,770
Cover yourself with it, or you'll freeze to death.

801
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,380
My own worries always came first.

802
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:09,810
My problems always took precedence over all else.

803
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,929
I'm freezing.

804
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,159
So I didn't know these things.

805
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:40,040
The fact that Dad wasn't born deaf...

806
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:43,409
and the reason Mom said she practically grew up an orphan.

807
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,529
And that there was a time when Mom and Dad...

808
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,529
were called by their own names, not just "Mom" and "Dad."

809
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,519
- Hello? - Hi, there.

810
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,359
So? Are you enjoying your trip?

811
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,929
Who are you, really?

812
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:05,360
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

813
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,798
Oh, no.

814
00:46:06,799 --> 00:46:09,198
I guess you're not really enjoying your trip.

815
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,969
Why did you send me here?

816
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:13,298
Well...

817
00:46:13,299 --> 00:46:15,638
Don't you think you should find the reason yourself?

818
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,480
- Hey, mister! - What?

819
00:46:20,409 --> 00:46:22,309
Then how can I go back?

820
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:23,879
What can I do to return to the present?

821
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,920
Well...

822
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,319
That too. You'll have to figure it out on your own.

823
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:30,559
Then give me a hint, at least!

824
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,919
Tell me how I'm supposed to view this whole situation,

825
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,559
some rules or missions, for example.

826
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,659
I see. I guess that's what boys in the 21st century like.

827
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:38,759
For now, just enjoy the ride.

828
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,999
A trip is supposed to be fun, you know.

829
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,429
Viva la vida!

830
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:46,039
You'll hear from me again.

831
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,670
All right, then. Bye.

832
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,339
Hello?

833
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,979
Don't hang up!

834
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,080
Don't hang up, please!

835
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,779
From the reason I ended up here...

836
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,219
to how I can get back,

837
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,989
I have to figure out everything on my own?

838
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,389
That means...

839
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:44,100
I'll be stuck here for a while.

840
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:54,210
(Baekwang High School)

841
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,508
(Ignite your passion to enjoy your youth to the fullest!)

842
00:47:56,509 --> 00:47:58,839
(Contact us to join the band, First Love Memory Manipulators.)

843
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,449
Nice.

844
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,589
It's all over.

845
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,119
It's over? What do you mean?

846
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:15,829
Yoon Dong Jin just posted on the forum,

847
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,299
calling us con artists.

848
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,500
What?

849
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:23,428
Hey, that wasn't a con. It was just a misunderstanding.

850
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:25,269
That's what you think.

851
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,139
Hey, let's go meet him now.

852
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,968
We should apologize to him properly in person,

853
00:48:28,969 --> 00:48:30,209
clear up the misunderstanding,

854
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,210
- and officially ask him to join... - It's too late.

855
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:34,879
An indie band in Hongdae that recognized him that day...

856
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,408
approached him and recruited him on the spot.

857
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:37,549
It's game over.

858
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,190
First, post a public apology on the forum.

859
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:47,359
Then let's post another ad to...

860
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,789
He also posted a warning telling people not to be fooled...

861
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:51,299
even if they saw our ad looking for a new member.

862
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,368
My gosh. This guy is a good writer.

863
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:55,670
People are going wild over this.

864
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,670
In the band scene,

865
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,270
we're already done for.

866
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,619
Give up already, Yi Chan.

867
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:12,778
It's always beautiful to see those...

868
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:14,920
who leave because they know it's time to give up.

869
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,790
- Do you think Se Gyeong knows too? - What?

870
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:19,659
That the band is done for.

871
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,359
Goodness. I'm sure she knows.

872
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,559
I hear people are betting money...

873
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,699
on whether or not we can pull this off, so she must know.

874
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:28,330
Where are you going?

875
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,339
I must tell Se Gyeong the truth.

876
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,369
She'll understand.

877
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:36,309
Will one week be enough?

878
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,238
To get over the rejection?

879
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:40,980
No, to find a new member.

880
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:42,679
What?

881
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,448
I'm going to tell Se Gyeong that we're starting over.

882
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:48,989
I'll tell her to just ignore the rumors and wait for me.

883
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:53,189
You. Keep printing the ad.

884
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,130
We got this. I, Ha Yi Chan, can do this!

885
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:57,830
Darn you! I really can't stand him!

886
00:49:58,259 --> 00:49:59,360
Darn it.

887
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,440
My gosh!

888
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,310
Well, about yesterday...

889
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,610
I'm really sorry!

890
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:17,520
Wait. Would I be able to join you instead of him?

891
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,690
- What are you talking about? - The band.

892
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:23,960
The thing is, I can play the guitar pretty well too.

893
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,920

He got himself in trouble, trying to start a band.

925
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:50,440
This time, his plan failed miserably.

926
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,609
Good. He failed even sooner than I thought.
