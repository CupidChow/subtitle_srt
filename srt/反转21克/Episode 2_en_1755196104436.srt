1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,880
UN6570 is a United Nations

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,720
special operations peacekeeping unit designation.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,400
The one found at the crime scene,

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,760
the UN6570 military tag,

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,240
and the appearance of Huang Hai

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,480
have all made me feel uneasy and anxious.

7
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,440
Huang Hai

8
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,960
Why is it you?

9
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,240
38 to 39

10
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,720
You're still better than me.

11
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,120
You still need to practice, brother.

12
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,880
Brother

13
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,920
Please forgive me, I had no choice.

14
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Location blocking is now enabled.

15
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,000
You scared me to death.

16
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,800
Jenna.

17
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,720
What's wrong with you?

18
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,200
Hurry.

19
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Change your clothes.

20
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,840
Let's go, quickly.

21
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,440
Old Song.

22
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,560
The wound on your neck...

23
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,280
It's nothing.

24
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,040
Scan.

25
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,520
Begonia flower.

26
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,200
Huang Hai is the serial killer.

27
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,600
Old Song.

28
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,320
What exactly is going on?

29
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,520
It's Huang Hai.

30
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,680
Huang Hai.

31
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,800
Hasn't he been missing for years?

32
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,400
I don't know why he wants to kill me either.

33
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,760
Help me look into this.

34
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,520
Has he used another identity recently

35
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,680
to check into a hotel?

36
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,600
These two places—

37
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,200
one is the location of the old street grocery store,

38
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,360
the other is where I ran into him today.

39
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Back at the grocery store,

40
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,440
there was only begonia mud on his shoes.

41
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,360
No asphalt.

42
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,040
Today, both substances were present.

43
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,080
Also, use your intel network to check

44
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,480
where there are large areas of begonia planted.

45
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,480
Remember, there must also be newly paved asphalt roads.

46
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,360
No.

47
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,800
That's too dangerous.

48
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,000
You already got hurt so much today.

49
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,360
What if—

50
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,560
Huang Hai is very likely

51
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,800
the perpetrator of this case.

52
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,720
And there may be more than one victim.

53
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,040
Huang Hai caused your injury.

54
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,800
Enemies in the rear have been cleared.

55
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,720
We can continue the assault.

56
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,880
Huang Hai.

57
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
Wasn't he the one who risked his life to save you?

58
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
Huang Hai.

59
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,200
Old Song, Old Song!

60
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,680
There's no way to hide.

61
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,840
Our mission is to fight until the end.

62
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,960
No matter where I hide,

63
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
he'll find me sooner or later.

64
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,720
Don't worry.

65
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,280
I'll be fine.

66
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,520
We'll go look for Huang Hai.

67
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,600
We'll get back to you as soon as possible.

68
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,320
But you must not act on your own.

69
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,200
Okay.

70
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,240
Stay safe.

71
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,560
Mm.

72
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,520
Sorry, Hoshino.

73
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:01,400
I broke the flowerpot.

74
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,120
It's okay.

75
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,880
Hello, Jenna.

76
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,160
Lao Song, there's news.

77
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,000
Huang Hai went to Jiulong Street yesterday during the day.

78
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,080
Also,

79
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,560
last night, an orphan

80
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,200
saw him on Sanfan Street as well.

81
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,000
Jiulong Street and Sanfan Street are two blocks apart.

82
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,440
Both have crabapple flowers planted.

83
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,640
But the newly paved asphalt section from the day before yesterday

84
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
is only on Sanfan Street.

85
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,000
I've already distributed Huang Hai's photo

86
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,440
to Xiao Houzi and the others.

87
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,480
Let them focus their patrols

88
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
around Jiulong Street and Sanfan Street.

89
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,560
Where are you going later?

90
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,360
I'll come find you.

91
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
Tell Xiao Houzi

92
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,640
that if they spot Huang Hai,

93
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,280
they must keep their distance.

94
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,560
How is it?

95
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,520
Did you find anything?

96
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,680
What's going on?

97
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,640
Forget it.

98
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,200
I won't ask about your personal matters.

99
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,120
There’s too little surveillance in the old city.

100
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,160
But I still found something on Third Avenue.

101
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,720
I matched the same face.

102
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,920
It’s definitely that person.

103
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,000
Thanks.

104
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,120
Wait.

105
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,160
I looked up this person for you.

106
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,480
You said you had important information to exchange with me.

107
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,280
Are you just going to leave like this?

108
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,680
If I make it back alive,

109
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
the clues I give you won’t be less than now.

110
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,160
Then I advise you not to cross the line.

111
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,880
I don’t want to waste

112
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,160
a prison spot on you.

113
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,480
Every investigator

114
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,120
has their own intelligence network.

115
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,560
And my network

116
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,000
is a group that moves through the city

117
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,240
like stray children in its veins.

118
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,240
We built shelters

119
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,600
so they could have a better life.

120
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,680
Old Song, wait for me.

121
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,920
Don’t act alone.

122
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,880
Did you hear me, Old Song?

123
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,680
You don’t need to come.

124
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,480
I’m hanging up now.
