1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,680
Evil

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,520
is always more stubborn and cunning than humans imagine.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,600
But humans also possess gentleness and precious qualities

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,400
and emotions capable of overcoming evil.

5
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,120
They're researchers.

6
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,840
Ah, forget it.

7
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,480
Just a researcher.

8
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,400
Don't waste any more time.

9
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,960
The shell-changing lab is just ahead.

10
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,160
Everyone, hurry!

11
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,840
Go!

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,760
Run!

13
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,920
Stop!

14
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,840
Stop!

15
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,120
Stop!

16
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,200
We'll hold them off.

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,280
You go stop the shell-changing.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,560
You really are a persistent rat, aren't you?

19
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Perfect.

20
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,760
It's time we settled the score between us.

21
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Settle the score?

22
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,560
Do you really have what it takes?

23
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,840
This body is actually quite useful.

24
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,000
Hurry, go! Go!

25
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,080
Go, quickly!

26
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,240
Hurry, hurry!

27
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,160
Enough.

28
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
Blue Team No. 12 is out.

29
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,080
Red Team No. 7 is out.

30
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,840
Old Huang, you're serious about this.

31
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,680
All this just for a small outpost.

32
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,160
Why?

33
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,080
You want to take me down with you?

34
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,880
The situation on the battlefield changes in an instant.

35
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,560
Sometimes, it's even for a tiny outpost.

36
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,360
It can be the key to victory or defeat.

37
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,000
Alright, alright, alright.

38
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,360
You're impressive, you're a hero.

39
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,320
You'd sacrifice yourself for victory.

40
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,560
You owe me a drink later.

41
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,480
Otherwise, I can't let this go.

42
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,680
Then you have to get over it.

43
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,360
If we ever meet on the battlefield one day,

44
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,800
would you strike so ruthlessly?

45
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,000
Hard to say.

46
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
How is it going?

47
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,720
Wait a moment.

48
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,760
Let's keep a memento.

49
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,160
Do you want it?

50
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,960
I really...

51
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,760
Do you want it or not?

52
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,480
It's already at ninety-eight percent.

53
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,080
Is there a way to stop it?

54
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,440
I'm constantly refreshing the backend code.

55
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,160
I hope I can find an overlap.

56
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,960
So I can reverse and shut down the system.

57
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,920
Is it done?

58
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,440
Found it.

59
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,640
How much longer?

60
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,320
How is it going?

61
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,920
That's impossible.

62
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,960
I've already shut down the machine.

63
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,920
Qingyun.

64
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,880
He's dead.

65
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,160
You promised me you'd save him.

66
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,080
I'm sorry.

67
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,720
Save him, please save him again.

68
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,800
Qingyun.

69
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
What should we do?

70
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,880
What are we supposed to do?

71
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,040
Do you know how serious this is?

72
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,240
Don't worry.

73
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Huang Hai's goal is clearly different from theirs.

74
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,800
What exactly does he want to do?

75
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,120
And who's behind him?

76
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,520
He won't even let me go.
