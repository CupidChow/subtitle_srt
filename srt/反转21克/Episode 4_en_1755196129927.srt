1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,760
The person who met with Huang Hai from the White Shark Club

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,720
who exactly is it?

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,960
And who kidnapped him?

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,480
How can we find them?

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
Find Huang Hai.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,800
What's wrong?

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,200
The group that was chasing Huang Hai at the White Shark Club

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,360
is approaching the clinic.

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,760
Hurry!

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,960
Pack up your things.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,960
Don't worry, they can't get in.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,960
I've installed three layers of security at the building entrance.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,720
I also put in a reinforced electromagnetic lock.

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,800
I won't let them in.

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,880
No one can get in.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,280
Wait for me to notify the security bureau.

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,440
Do you have a floor plan?

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,440
Yes.

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,080
Who are you people?

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,720
Hurry!

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,600
Oh my god.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,000
These thugs kill people without hesitation.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,120
I can't stay here.

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,280
You guys are my disaster.

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,200
If it weren't for saving you,

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,480
would I be in such a mess?

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,960
I have to take this bottle of medicine.

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,000
It took me a lot of effort to get it.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,960
This is my treasure.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,680
Old Song.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,000
Jenna.

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,040
You two go first.

33
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,720
I'll hold them off.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,680
Are you crazy?

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,000
You just escaped from there.

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,480
No, we have to leave together.

37
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
If we do that, no one will get out.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,920
You two go out through the balcony first.

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,160
Go!

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,240
Okay, hurry, hurry!

41
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,320
Chase

42
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,920
Chase.

43
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,520
Chase.

44
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,280
Who are you people?

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,800
Tell me who you are.

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,440
Then I'll let you go.

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
Are you going to talk or not?

48
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,800
What is this?

49
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Why are you trying to kill me?

50
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,040
You messed with our boss's goods.

51
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,280
You can't escape.

52
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,560
Who's your boss?

53
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,120
Screw you.

54
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,400
Talk.

55
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,240
Old Song

56
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,720
They won't chase us all the way here, will they?

57
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,440
All my external contacts

58
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,760
are linked to the agency.

59
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,120
And I activated the location blocker.

60
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,840
They'll most likely only be able to trace it there.

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,720
You should also stay alert these days.

62
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,680
Okay.

63
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
Who exactly are they?

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,800
What's this?

65
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,560
This was found on them.

66
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,440
We should be able to get some information from it.

67
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,960
A dock access card.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
Are they workers?

69
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,520
All we can say is they've been to the dock to deliver goods.

70
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,880
Or for some other purpose.

71
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:11,960
Yeah.

72
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,040
Huang Hai not only killed someone, but also took something.

73
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,240
And I'm his next target.

74
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,600
Now he's been taken away by the main family's people.

75
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,480
And those people are still trying to eliminate me.

76
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,600
That shipment is no ordinary cargo.

77
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,960
If we want to figure all this out,

78
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,000
the most direct way is to find Huang Hai.

79
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,640
Old Song

80
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,920
Don't think about these things for now.

81
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,800
You haven't fully recovered yet.

82
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,760
Sorry to trouble you.

83
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm used to it.

84
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
Then I'll stay here for now.

85
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
You should head back first.

86
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,760
I need to sort out my thoughts.

87
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,200
Is there anything I can help with?

88
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,040
Could you bring something tasty tomorrow?

89
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,080
Why don't you just drop dead?

90
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,560
I'll head back then.

91
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,920
Make sure to pay close attention.

92
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,720
Alright.

93
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,640
This spot.

94
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
And these spots.

95
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,520
They're all blind spots for surveillance.

96
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,040
We must assign someone to watch them carefully.

97
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,160
Nothing can go wrong.

98
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,200
Okay.

99
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,960
Let's go.

100
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,200
I'll take you to check out this area.

101
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,280
There was chaos in a public place.

102
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
Clues are hard to preserve and extract.

103
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,240
We also don't know what the Security Bureau has found.

104
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,880
Their clothes were all contaminated.

105
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,600
With fluorescent powder.

106
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,880
How did they get in?

107
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,280
What is their relationship with them?

108
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,120
Military-grade signal jammer.

109
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,800
I'm tracking the grocery store murder case.

110
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,480
The suspect.

111
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,280
Came here.

112
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,720
The killer's logic is very strange.

113
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,160
He killed the shop owner.

114
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,640
But arranged the body very neatly.

115
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,040
Either the two of them knew each other,

116
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,200
or it's the killer's personal habit.

117
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,160
The wound on the victim's chest shows

118
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
the killer's goal

119
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,200
was to obtain something.

120
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,760
His purpose for coming here

121
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,400
might have been to attack the next target,

122
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,040
or maybe to exchange goods.

123
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,400
But he was unexpectedly taken away by an intruder.

124
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,680
The trail has gone cold.

125
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,520
All the leads are gone.

126
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,240
I have to find a way to locate the suspect.

127
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,440
Anything else?

128
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,280
That's all I know.

129
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,160
What about you?

130
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,720
Their counter-surveillance skills are very strong.

131
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,280
At present, we haven't obtained

132
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,720
any direct clues.

133
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,800
Through investigation of the scene,

134
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,720
we have determined

135
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,800
that the first set of off-road combat-grade

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,040
shoe prints

137
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,320
were left by the suspect.

138
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,400
By sampling the soil elements left in the footprints,

139
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,520
and analyzing them,

140
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,320
we have narrowed down

141
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,200
the river bends in the Qishui and You'an districts.

142
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,440
That's all.

143
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,360
Welcome home.

144
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,280
Based on the information you provided,

145
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,920
we found a lead.

146
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,760
Baifeng Wharf.

147
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,720
Jenna.

148
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,440
Come with me to Baifeng Wharf.
