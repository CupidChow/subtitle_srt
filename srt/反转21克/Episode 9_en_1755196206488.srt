1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,600
All beings are equal.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,440
In a society where the strong prey on the weak and rights are unequal,

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,320
in such a society,

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,000
equality can only be an ideal for the vulnerable.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,600
If you need anything, just let me know.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,479
You haven't come to see me in a long time.

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,400
This lawyer Jin is quite similar to you.

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,480
I think

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,680
we should wait for me to apply for a search warrant first.

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
There are too many guards.

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,360
You and I both know it.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,280
If we could really get a search warrant,

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,640
we wouldn't need to disguise ourselves like this.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,240
No.

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,320
I have to go in and talk to him alone.

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,920
So how do you plan to get in?

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,320
Okay, I'll be there soon.

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,080
Why is there food delivery?

19
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,920
That's strange.

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,720
Wait a second.

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,080
At this time,

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,200
no one at the villa orders food.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,560
That's impossible.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,880
Let me take a look.

25
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,280
What are you doing?

26
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Why was Lawyer Jin's meal delivered here?

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,680
We're all starving.

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
Send it over there.

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,080
What,

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,480
you don't recognize me already?

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,800
How do you plan to get in?

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,600
Help me push the food cart back.

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,360
Thanks.

34
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,240
Decibel Bomb

35
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,200
I ask, you answer.

36
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,160
Tell me your real identity.

37
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,680
Don’t you already know all this?

38
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,200
Tell me your real identity.

39
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,920
Besides running this club,

40
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,880
I’m also involved in underground smuggling in K City.

41
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,040
Trading in some contraband.

42
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,600
Before that,

43
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,200
I served in a combat unit.

44
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,760
Which unit?

45
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,400
UN6570.

46
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,640
Next question.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,120
Answer honestly.

48
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,840
I won’t make things difficult for you.

49
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,600
Do you know Huang Hai?

50
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,960
No, I don’t.

51
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Lot number nine.

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,680
I haven’t had much contact with him.

53
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,720
Before the auction,

54
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,800
I was chosen by Wu Shan.

55
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,800
You mean the one wearing silver boots?

56
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
What did he do to you?

57
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,720
Swap, swap bodies

58
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,760
He

59
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,640
He’s going to have his body swapped by Wushan

60
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Body swapping

61
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,400
Body swapping was developed by Imagawa

62
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,400
It’s a kind of consciousness transfer technology

63
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
It transfers a person’s consciousness

64
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,760
into another person’s body

65
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,160
into another person’s body

66
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,720
Yeah

67
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,160
What else?

68
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,800
I don’t know the details

69
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,200
I just know the technology is already very advanced

70
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,120
Including its upstream and downstream channels

71
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
They’re also quite stable

72
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,280
I only handle the supply

73
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,800
and organize operations

74
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
Imagawa provides the clients

75
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Imagawa Group is also involved

76
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,280
After someone’s body is swapped

77
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,280
they still have to return to society, right?

78
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,920
Aren’t you worried they’ll be discovered?

79
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,080
We clean up the supply

80
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,440
I handle external cleanup

81
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,240
using certain methods

82
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,680
to erase their social connections

83
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,600
As for internal cleanup

84
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,480
that’s the body swapping

85
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,280
This technology

86
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,400
is managed by someone named Mr. Qiu

87
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,400
Who is Mr. Qiu?

88
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,520
Speak.

89
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
I don't know his real name.

90
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,640
He's a researcher.

91
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,080
He's in charge of the shell-changing technology.

92
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,720
He works for Imagawa.

93
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,080
Who is your boss behind the scenes?

94
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,520
Tell me.

95
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,360
Tell me.

96
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Suffocation chip

97
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,919
He just triggered a forbidden word.

98
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,760
Sorry about that.

99
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,040
What's going on?

100
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,960
Go take a look over there.

101
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,080
Let's go.

102
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,960
Let's go.

103
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,760
Go search over there.

104
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,440
Let's go.
