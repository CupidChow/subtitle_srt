1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,360
Although life may seem insignificant,

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,600
human desire is terrifying.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,760
It can make people forget about others,

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,680
make them ignore others,

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,120
and commit terrible acts against their own kind.

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,840
I was just about to go in and save you.

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,040
Boss Bai is dead.

8
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:52,680
Suffocation chip.

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,480
As soon as it detects a keyword,

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,120
it releases a powerful electric current,

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,400
instantly destroying organs.

12
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,920
I think

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,360
if you can track down that chip,

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,760
maybe you can find out

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,960
who is really behind Boss Bai.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,000
This thing isn't cheap to make.

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,800
It seems the people behind it are powerful.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,880
Alright, you leave first, I'll investigate.

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,880
What did Boss Bai say?

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,200
He said

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,840
all of this is related to a technology called

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,240
"Shell Replacement."

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Do you know about Shell Replacement?

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,640
No.

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,720
It's the first time I've heard of it.

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,000
The Public Security Bureau's backup has arrived.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,640
You go first.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Leave the rest to me.

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,520
Are you sure?

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,840
Don't worry.

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,800
Our people have already surrounded this place.

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,840
Is it not done yet?

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,440
I'm using data recovery.

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,480
It's not that simple.

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,640
It'll take some time.

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,320
Old Song.

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
I found some old news reports.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,440
They seem to be related to that Shell Replacement you mentioned.

39
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,600
Hey, wait a moment.

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,040
Chairman of Frontier Media, Li Chunhua

41
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,000
passed away this morning due to illness

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,600
at the age of 75.

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,360
This has been confirmed by the company's legal department.

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,320
Li Chunhua had already made a will.

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,720
All assets under his name

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,440
and all shares of Frontier Group

47
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,920
will be inherited by Li Shiyao.

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,840
Major media outlets are speculating about this mysterious heir's

49
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,120
true identity.

50
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,880
It's her.

51
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,840
Do you know

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
this girl?

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,360
She was one of the people kidnapped at Baifeng Wharf.

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,160
I saw her at the hot spring club in Morocco.

55
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
This old lady

56
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,480
was also at the auction at the Morocco hot spring club.

57
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,320
She appeared there as well.

58
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,840
She was kidnapped.

59
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,480
Could it be related to her secret identity as a wealthy heiress?

60
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,040
No.

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,440
It's about body swapping.

62
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,840
Body swapping?

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,600
It seems that at the auction,

64
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,640
those people were aiming for a new life through body swapping.

65
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,480
It wasn't about trading virtual identities.

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,520
Who is really behind all this?

67
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,560
We still don't know.

68
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,960
How is Huang Hai now?

69
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,560
This is an old news article I found about body swapping.

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,400
This person named Chen Rui

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,720
was once the chief scientist at Jingchuan Group.

72
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,080
Because he developed a technology

73
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
that violated human ethics and morals,

74
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,720
he was dismissed by Jingchuan Group.

75
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,280
Unwilling to accept this,

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,120
he eventually committed suicide by jumping off the Jingchuan Group building.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,080
Technical people tend to be stubborn.

78
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,080
If Imagawa Industries hired me as chief,

79
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,760
why would I bother with research anymore?

80
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,360
I’d just worry about how to spend money every day.

81
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,680
With your limited skills,

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,880
you think you could be chief?

83
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,600
You can't even handle this simple task.

84
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,560
How about I do it instead?

85
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,480
Go ahead, you do it.

86
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,120
Alright.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Done.

88
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,840
Let’s listen to it.

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,520
CSHL-3 machine has finished operating.

90
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,800
What do you mean, finished operating?

91
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,560
CSHL.

92
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,720
Medical equipment produced by Lengquan Laboratory.

93
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,080
What does that mean?

94
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,440
Lengquan Laboratory.

95
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,040
It’s the oldest in the world.

96
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,520
An advanced biochemical laboratory.

97
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,280
Later, most of the lab’s equipment

98
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,360
and technical documents

99
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,880
were acquired by a private

100
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,680
prosthetics company.

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,480
That company is the Imagawa Group.

102
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,280
To be precise,

103
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,960
it’s Imagawa Industries, a subsidiary of Imagawa Group.

104
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,560
They acquired

105
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,480
all the technical equipment from Lengquan Laboratory

106
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,960
for their own prosthetics research and development.

107
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,280
Jenna,

108
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,320
how much do you know about them?

109
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,320
Many years ago

110
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
Zhao Qinchuan and Chen Rui

111
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,440
founded the Jinchuan Group together

112
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,040
Just as the group was thriving

113
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,680
the head of the industrial department

114
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
which was Chen Rui, the chief scientist

115
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,360
chose to end his own life

116
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,400
Since then

117
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,360
Zhao Qinchuan halted all operations

118
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,960
and destroyed all information

119
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,240
Lin Yongfu

120
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600
is the current head of Jinchuan Industry

121
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,920
and the group's second-in-command

122
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,400
The fact that Zhao Qinchuan

123
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,320
entrusted such an important department to him

124
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,160
shows their close relationship

125
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,440
Tonight

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
Zhao Qingyun's birthday party

127
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
will be held in the industrial building

128
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,840
It seems to have a deeper meaning

129
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,400
This is Super Eye Company

130
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,760
the core project of Jinchuan Technology Operations Group

131
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
the Super Eye System

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,960
Initially, it was just simple communication

133
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,000
Now it is fully integrated with brain-computer interfaces

134
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,800
This is Ding Yi

135
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,000
the head of Jinchuan Bio

136
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,680
After Chen Rui's incident

137
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,200
this new department was established

138
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,040
mainly focusing on bionic technology and medical biology

139
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,920
Compared to the other two departments

140
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,040
it is smaller in scale

141
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,880
but within Jinchuan Group

142
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,680
it is still considered outstanding

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,880
Come and take a look

144
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,360
I've prepared a gift for you

145
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Iris system

146
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,280
As long as you install it in your super eye,

147
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,200
I can guarantee

148
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,840
that wherever you go in the future,

149
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,920
you’ll have free access.

150
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,520
Tch.

151
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Stop bragging.

152
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,040
Even the Imagawa Group’s super eyes can’t do that.

153
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,760
But you can?

154
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,200
Don’t get mad, don’t get mad.

155
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,000
I just think it’s amazing.

156
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,520
This technology isn’t actually that difficult.

157
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,880
It was only disabled

158
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,000
to protect the super eyes.

159
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,280
At first, every super eye

160
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,640
had only one iris system.

161
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,480
The iris was the ID.

162
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,720
Thanks, man.

163
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,200
You are...

164
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,760
Found you.

165
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,600
No.

166
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,960
You...

167
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,880
Why are you here?

168
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,040
Who are you?

169
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,760
This is...

170
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,880
Let me introduce you.

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,680
This is my assistant, Jenna.

172
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,280
And this is...

173
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,880
Someone I met in the old city a couple of days ago,

174
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
a friend.

175
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,880
A friend?

176
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,000
How come I’ve never heard of

177
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,360
you having a friend like this?

178
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,320
Her name is...

179
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,560
I’m Zhao Qingyun.

180
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,360
Zhao Qingyun.

181
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,640
Thanks to Mr. Song a few days ago,

182
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,960
for rescuing me in the old city.

183
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,240
Rescue.

184
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,600
How come I don't remember?

185
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,200
I told you my name.

186
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Why are you looking for me?

187
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,000
That's right, Miss Zhao.

188
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,480
You're looking for our Song?

189
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,760
Is there something you need?

190
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,040
It's not hard to find out your name.

191
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,840
I want to invite you to my birthday party tomorrow.

192
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,760
Happy birthday.

193
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,160
And also,

194
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,400
It was right to help you out.

195
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,760
You don't need to worry about it.

196
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,280
You're different from others.

197
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,440
We're very busy.

198
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,480
You should go back first.

199
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,040
This young lady who rarely goes out,

200
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,800
You must come.

201
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Ever since I was little,

202
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,400
no one has ever refused me.

203
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,320
Don't be the first.

204
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,000
Imagawa Group

205
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
Zhao Qingyun

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,520
So Zhao Qinchuan is...

207
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,880
My dad.

208
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,520
Song Xingye

209
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,160
Be on time.

210
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,560
See you tomorrow.

211
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,680
Are you really going to Imagawa Industries alone?

212
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,720
Yes.

213
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,000
But I'm not going alone.

214
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,760
The image is a bit distorted.

215
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,120
I need to recalibrate it.

216
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,960
Old Song,

217
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,560
Observe the surroundings first.
