1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,880
As an assisting investigator

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,440
I could have gotten more deeply involved

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,520
in this case

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,520
but now the assisting investigation has been canceled

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,080
and I also have a complicated relationship with Huang Hai

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,840
that’s hard to explain

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,160
so the investigation is much harder than before

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,280
They have heavy security

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,000
It seems the cargo at this dock is not ordinary

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,600
You’ve fought with them before

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,040
They’re all ruthless

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,640
Looks like they’re determined to kill you

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,720
Be careful

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,160
Where should we check first?

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,200
The outer containers

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,160
Okay

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,280
Old Song

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,040
We’ve entered the thieves’ den

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,960
The camera views and routes

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,720
are all marked for you in the Super Eye system

21
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,280
Brother Bai

22
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,560
How's this batch of goods?

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,720
It definitely won't disappoint you.

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,840
Make sure to protect it well for me.

25
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,520
Don't worry.

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,400
Don't let anything go wrong.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,760
That man is nicknamed Boss Bai.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,680
He's the owner of the city's largest entertainment complex.

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,600
The boss behind the scenes.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,120
There's no information on the guy in the red leather jacket.

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,080
But judging by how polite Boss Bai is,

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,480
his identity must be unusual too.

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
The power behind him is no small matter.

34
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,240
Stop.

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,640
Old Song, fall back.

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,000
There are two patrolling ahead.

37
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,920
Turn right.

38
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,280
I need to get closer to them quickly.

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,720
Huang Hai might be there.

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,080
Then let's take them out.

41
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,560
Do you know how much your body is worth?

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,360
Any bump or bruise

43
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,840
is a huge loss for us.

44
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,000
You need to behave.

45
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,280
What year is it? People are still trafficking humans?

46
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,560
Huang Hai isn't here.

47
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,520
Boss.

48
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,160
Two of our guys in Zone 2 have been taken down.

49
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,400
Retreat.

50
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,880
To the right.

51
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,200
Old Song

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,720
Get out of here, quickly!

53
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,680
They're surrounding us!

54
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,520
Huang Hai is connected to human trafficking.

55
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,800
How is that possible?

56
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
People like him,

57
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,400
as long as there's profit to be made,

58
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,400
are capable of anything.

59
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,720
Impossible.

60
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,800
The traffickers are working against Huang Hai.

61
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,920
They're not directly involved.

62
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,160
Is your Super Eye a limited military edition?

63
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,880
Yes, it is.

64
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,080
Then it could fetch a good price.

65
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,320
In your eyes, anyone could fetch a good price.

66
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,440
Old Song, do you want to take a break?

67
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,040
You're not a robot.

68
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,880
Is this guy in white boots really a trafficker?

69
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,400
Why can't I find anything?

70
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,560
This is for Old Song.

71
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,480
If you want to eat, get it yourself.

72
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,640
What's wrong with me having one?

73
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,280
Old Song.

74
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,600
What are you looking at?

75
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,200
I looked up Bai Boss's public information.

76
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,000
These three people are closely connected to him.

77
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,960
I'm planning to impersonate one of them to get close to him.

78
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,160
So who are you going to impersonate?

79
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,520
This one.

80
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,240
He's Bai Boss's personal lawyer.

81
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,440
Not so close that it would give me away,

82
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,840
but not too distant to approach.

83
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,800
You're way too different from this guy.

84
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,960
Look how fair his skin is.

85
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,000
Now look at yourself.

86
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,320
If this can be fixed,

87
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,440
then none of these are problems.

88
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,040
But this disguise collar

89
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
was banned a long time ago, wasn't it?

90
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,720
I'm afraid it can't be repaired even if we want to.

91
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,480
What's so difficult about that?

92
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,440
Brother Qian,

93
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
I'll leave this to you.

94
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,240
Who are you calling brother?

95
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,600
Hey, what do you want to eat?

96
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,520
I don't want to eat anything.

97
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,560
Hey, don't go.

98
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,640
What parts do you need?

99
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,360
I'll go find them.

100
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,680
I don't need anything, I don't need anything.

101
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,560
Can't you give me something to eat first?

102
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,120
I'm starving.

103
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,600
Finally, you're back.

104
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,960
Jenna.

105
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,240
Remember to help me stall Peter Kim tomorrow.

106
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
Piece of cake.

107
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,280
I guarantee you'll be the only one at the club tomorrow.

108
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,160
Attorney Kim.

109
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,960
You're really stingy, you know.

110
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,440
Where did you get so many knockoff chips?

111
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,320
Jenna lent me the money for all of these.

112
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,800
Of course I save wherever I can.

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,120
You're so troublesome.

114
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,640
Can you actually fix it or not?

115
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,280
If you can't fix it, stop eating.

116
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,480
Is that how you ask someone for help?

117
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,400
Fine, I really won't fix it then.

118
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,000
You—

119
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,640
No.

120
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,560
I was doing just fine before.

121
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
I ran my own little shop.

122
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,600
I was free and independent.

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,160
But then I met you all.

124
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,040
Now I've lost everything.

125
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,120
Not only do I have to rely on others every day,

126
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,240
I also have to put up with constant frustration.

127
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,960
About this matter,

128
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,120
it really shouldn't have involved you.

129
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,080
But I run a business.

130
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,880
Isn't it normal for me to charge money?

131
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,200
As for her,

132
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
she just speaks her mind.

133
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,000
Don't take it to heart.

134
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,400
She brings up money with you

135
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,720
because she's trying to save up.

136
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
To build a shelter.

137
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,440
To help the children.

138
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,080
Please forgive her.

139
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,200
The shelter you just mentioned—

140
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,440
Are you serious?

141
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,600
Of course I'm serious.

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,280
It's a promise I made with Sister Na.

143
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm working hard every day to earn money too.

144
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,920
Alright.

145
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,880
If

146
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,640
you're really going to give those homeless kids

147
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,600
a home,

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,320
then I might consider

149
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,680
investing.

150
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,400
Did I hear that right?

151
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,160
Miracles do happen.
