1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,840
Everything returns to the starting point.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,800
The origin of the case.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,800
The origin of the crime.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,040
My starting point.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,440
Be more careful.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,680
Good thing you came early.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,920
Young man, come over and take a look.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,720
Lao Xiao

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,880
Song

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,400
You're back.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,480
Well, um...

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,480
You go back first.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,520
I'll find you in a couple of days.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,200
That matter.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,680
Lao Song, you've been so mysterious lately.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,560
Leave the stuff with me.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,840
You left without saying a word.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,120
I don't know where you went.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm not criticizing you.

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,600
You shoulder everything yourself.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,120
Do you still consider me a brother?

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,200
Lao Song

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,360
Lao Song

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,200
Are you okay, Lao Song?

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,440
Old Song, something feels off.

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,440
What's wrong?

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,880
I just accessed your Super Eye system data.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
It seems like your system has been tampered with.

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,520
Or maybe someone

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,080
intercepted your Super Eye data.

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,960
That's probably why the system malfunctioned.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,880
But after scanning your Super Eye structure,

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,280
it seems that apart from

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,160
some minor damage from the attack,

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
there aren't any major issues.

36
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,960
There seems to be an extra chip slot here.

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,080
Look, from here to here,

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,560
isn't there an extra one?

39
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,440
This is a military prosthetic eye.

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,520
It might be different from the regular version.

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,160
I've repaired military prosthetic eyes before.

42
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,000
They don't have this feature.

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,600
They just add upgrade modules.

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Adding a small memory chip doesn't do much.

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,240
Is my eye problem related to this?

46
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,840
Your eye just has some damaged components.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,640
So,

48
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,080
even if we delete this extra

49
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,240
chip data now,

50
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,720
it won't affect you.

51
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,840
It's deleted.

52
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,040
This was clearly deleted manually.

53
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,440
Has anyone tampered with your eye before?

54
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,760
The wound is at the heart.

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
The wound is small but very deep.

56
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,360
It’s very likely that it pierced the heart.

57
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,480
It seems this is probably the fatal injury.

58
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,080
I once served

59
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,640
in a combat unit.

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,040
UN

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,520
6570

62
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,520
UN6570

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,720
Lao Xiao

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,640
The deleted data

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,280
Is there any residual information?

66
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,320
Can it be recovered?

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
In theory,

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
even if it’s deleted,

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,080
there will definitely be some data fragments left.

70
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,040
So it can definitely be restored

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,280
to recover some of the information.

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,560
However,

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,120
your military confidentiality agreement

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,440
is a bit hard to crack.

75
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,120
You can leave the chip here.

76
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,760
Recovery might take some time.

77
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,360
I’ll leave it to you, then.

78
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,520
Alright, that’s enough.

79
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,640
Stop with the useless stuff.

80
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,080
Jenna

81
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,600
I need you to help me look into something.

82
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Shang Wei is handling the aftermath at Imagawa Industries.

83
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,280
So I have to ask you to investigate.

84
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,880
Investigate what?

85
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,760
Help me check cases from recent years.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,520
See if any involve crisis operations.

87
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,440
Contact with combat units,

88
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,040
veterans, and military-grade prosthetics.

89
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,640
No problem.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,160
But why are you looking into this?

91
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,400
I think I'm close to figuring out

92
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,800
why Huang Hai wants to kill me.

93
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,240
They all want my eye.

94
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,000
I think it’s related to those military prosthetics.

95
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,959
Around her pupils

96
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,480
a faint blackness has appeared.

97
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,960
It’s probably psychogenic fainting.

98
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,520
Not physiological.

99
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,880
How many times has this happened?

100
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,560
Three or four times, I think.

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,040
After experiencing great grief,

102
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,560
people can have this kind of psychological stress response.

103
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,000
But don’t worry too much.

104
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,040
She’ll get better with time.

105
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,520
Don’t blame yourself too much.

106
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,200
This isn’t your fault.

107
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,240
But I have to do something.

108
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,240
Do you have something to say to me?

109
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,440
No.

110
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,680
Are you okay?

111
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,480
I’m fine.

112
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,760
Just haven’t rested well.

113
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,880
Get some rest early.

114
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,600
Am I being too suspicious?

115
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,200
How could it be him?

116
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,400
Thanks, Captain Wu.

117
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,960
We've known each other for a long time.

118
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,880
It's nothing.

119
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,080
Bai Zhuo.

120
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Member of Unit U.

121
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,240
Previously underwent special operations prosthetic modification.

122
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,000
The modified part was the lungs.

123
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,280
The cause of death was

124
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,440
an explosion of the language chip implanted in the brain.

125
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,280
There are two wounds on the body.

126
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,400
One is on the head.

127
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,440
The other is on the lungs.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,760
Lungs.

129
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,800
Left rib under the armpit.

130
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,200
External force penetrated the mechanical lung.

131
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
It seems a chip was taken.

132
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,240
Who else could have accessed this body?

133
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,080
This case isn't high-level.

134
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
Security officers from the Public Security Bureau

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,440
can almost all access the body.

136
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,000
Even the mortuary makeup artist can.

137
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,520
What is it?

138
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,880
Is there something wrong with the body?

139
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Hard to say.

140
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,120
Captain Wu.

141
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,800
Can I take a look

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,560
at the information report before the body was stored?

143
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,440
No problem, I'll get it.

144
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,560
By the way,

145
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,600
Didn't you always work with He Shangwei before?

146
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,080
Why did you come to me this time?

147
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,160
The Imagawa Industries case

148
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,640
is already keeping her busy enough.

149
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,880
I can only trouble you.

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,280
That's true.

151
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,320
I'll go get the information report for you.

152
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,720
What is it?

153
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,480
It's so scary.

154
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,840
By the way, Lao Song,

155
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,440
I followed the method you suggested

156
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
and found some information.

157
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,400
Come take a look.

158
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,280
All these people match the characteristics you mentioned.

159
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,400
And in their prosthetics

160
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
there are unexplained wounds.

161
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,480
This person named Zhang Ziyi

162
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,840
is the owner of the grocery store.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,680
I didn't expect he was also from your unit.

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,400
So far, only these six victims have been identified.

165
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,920
There was nothing found in the case files.

166
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,520
No information on Bai Zhuo or Wu Tian.

167
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,880
Bai Zhuo is already dead.

168
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,000
How do you know that?

169
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,880
He was Boss Bai.

170
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
The item implanted in his prosthetic was also taken.

171
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,120
If that's the case,

172
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,120
right now, only you and Wu Tian are still alive.

173
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,800
He might have already been killed too.

174
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,360
It's just that it hasn't been discovered yet.

175
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,320
They were all members of UN6570.

176
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
You don't know each other?

177
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,840
UN6570 has over a dozen squads and hundreds of people.

178
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,000
It's impossible for us all to know each other.

179
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
This list exists because

180
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,680
we all used

181
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,160
the same batch of military prosthetics.

182
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,320
Actually, other people in the unit

183
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,960
used prosthetics from other batches too.

184
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,960
It seems the problem lies with this batch of prosthetics.

185
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,320
Boss Bai's body storage information sheet.

186
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,919
There was an unexplained puncture in the lung.

187
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,480
And the weapon is unknown.

188
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,159
Before he was sent to the morgue,

189
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,280
he already had this puncture.

190
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,840
But didn't you say

191
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,640
Lin Yongfu implanted a suffocation chip in the back of his neck?

192
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,600
He was killed by remote destruction of his brain center, right?

193
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,000
This lung wound

194
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,760
before I left the office,

195
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,160
couldn't have existed.

196
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,120
The person who transferred the body was Shang Wei.

197
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,960
She was at the club at the time.

198
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,720
Handling the body was normal.

199
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,840
But didn't you say

200
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,680
that before you left the office,

201
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,200
there was no such wound?

202
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,240
Too many people

203
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,680
could have had access to the body during that time.

204
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,080
Are these clues connected to the Huang Hai case?

205
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,040
At the moment,

206
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,600
the shell-changing incident behind the Huang Hai case

207
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,840
seems to have ended.

208
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,400
But

209
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
But what?

210
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,760
But Huang Hai's true purpose

211
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,080
is still unclear to us.

212
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,000
We always thought he was opposing Lin Yongfu,

213
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,120
trying to sabotage his shell-changing experiments.

214
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,520
But that's not actually the case.

215
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,080
What we know

216
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,480
is likely just the tip of the iceberg.

217
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,400
So this case,

218
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,720
when will it finally be over?

219
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,920
Don't worry.

220
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,160
The truth might be right in front of us.

221
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,720
So what do we do now?

222
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,200
Here's what we'll do.

223
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
You keep tracking down Wu Tian's whereabouts.

224
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,400
If he's still alive,

225
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,360
make sure to bring him to see me.

226
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,240
Oh, by the way,

227
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,960
what were you doing at Lao Xiao's shop that day?

228
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,880
Yeah,

229
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,280
Lao Xiao still hasn't helped me retrieve the data.

230
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,840
Here it is.

231
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,920
What is this?

232
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,480
This is the residual data

233
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,000
retrieved from your main system.

234
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,840
I managed to recover part of it.

235
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,800
A map.

236
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,280
That doesn't seem right.

237
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,240
It's actually an image embedded in a program.

238
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,440
Like a navigation system.

239
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Perfect World.

240
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,960
It's the oasis of humanity's future.

241
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,760
Suffering greatly.
