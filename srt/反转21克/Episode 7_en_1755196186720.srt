1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,640
Technology

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,160
has greatly improved the standard of living for humanity

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,440
by a significant margin.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,280
But at the same time, it has made people give up their sense of self.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
Letting technology dominate and control

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,800
our free and joyful souls.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,760
What do you think?

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,160
Are there any flaws?

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,000
You'll know if you try.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,840
Nianqiu, why did you come so early today?

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,880
You... you all are

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,960
Xingye's friends?

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,840
Ah, yes.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,440
He went out.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,320
Do you need something from him?

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,200
I...

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,360
I have a gift I want to give him.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,160
Then give it to me.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
I'll pass it on to him for you.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,200
Don't worry.

21
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:04,840
Thank you.

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,240
You see,

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,400
life is full of misfortunes,

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,680
but people still strive for happiness.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,240
As for things like happiness index,

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,040
to me,

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,680
it's just a cold number.

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,520
I think

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,960
as long as you live well,

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,000
those numbers can always be changed.

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,480
If

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,760
there could be a world without pain

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,920
and worries, a perfect world,

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,040
wouldn't that be even better?

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,440
A place where you feel at ease is a perfect world, isn't it?

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,160
Alright, I've been up all night.

37
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,480
My old back can't take it anymore.

38
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,080
I need to go back and get a good sleep.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,760
Although this thing of yours is fixed,

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,640
its version is too outdated.

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,760
It won't last long.

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,200
And don't miss your pumpkin carriage.

43
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,320
Attorney Jin, you're here.

44
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,360
There's still some time before the auction starts.

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,440
We still have a while to go.

46
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,400
You can rest at the bar for a bit if you like.

47
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,600
I'll just wait here.

48
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
Please follow me.

49
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,240
Please have a seat here.

50
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,440
These are the items up for auction tonight.

51
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,640
You can take a look first.

52
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,320
If there's anything you don't understand,

53
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,600
or if you have any requests,

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,080
feel free to come to me anytime.

55
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,080
Anything at all.

56
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,920
Flesh trade.

57
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,760
But these records are way too detailed.

58
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,360
Wait a moment, miss.

59
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
Sorry, miss.

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,040
No invitation.

61
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,760
You can't go in.

62
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,960
Sorry, miss.

63
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,600
You're not on the guest list.

64
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,640
Please cooperate with us for identity verification.

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,040
I've said it many times already.

66
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,520
I've already been verified.

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,160
What's going on?

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,080
Did you wash your hands?

69
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,080
What did you say?

70
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,040
You dare touch my girlfriend with such dirty hands?

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,240
Is this how your boss Bai usually

72
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
teaches you guys?

73
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,240
Jin,

74
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,280
why are you so angry?

75
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,600
Boss.

76
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,280
Is she someone new you found?

77
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,040
Attorney Jin.

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,400
Don't you know him?

79
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,160
Boss.

80
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,760
New girlfriend

81
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,720
Yeah

82
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't touch me

83
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,520
Where did you go just now?

84
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,480
Baby

85
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,040
Don't be mad

86
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
So just now, Lao Bai

87
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,200
didn't he stand up for you?

88
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,880
Right?

89
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,960
Yeah

90
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,840
Don't make things hard for your subordinates

91
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,280
Later

92
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,640
I'll teach them a lesson

93
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,280
But Lao Jin

94
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,640
this private photo session

95
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,000
can't bring strangers

96
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,600
You know

97
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,640
I hate people who break the rules the most

98
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,160
Yeah

99
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
Have them verify their identity

100
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,560
If they don't cooperate

101
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,200
Do you know who she is?

102
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,600
She's the key person in your dispute

103
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,440
with Sanxin Group

104
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,640
Treat her well

105
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,880
and your problem will be solved

106
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,000
Lao Jin

107
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,680
This is the Boss Bai you always mention

108
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,280
Yeah

109
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,720
This is my best brother

110
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,840
Boss Bai

111
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,480
Now this

112
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,560
is what someone

113
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,880
should look like after making a mistake

114
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,960
He knelt down to you

115
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,640
Are you satisfied now?

116
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,720
Or

117
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,960
get rid of him

118
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,040
You do it

119
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,960
It's not that serious.

120
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,680
It's not a big deal, Lao Bai.

121
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,880
It's not that serious.

122
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,520
Lao Jin is so easygoing today.

123
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,760
He's not usually like this.

124
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,800
No.

125
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,280
Your own dog.

126
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Handle it yourself.

127
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,440
You have to deal with it.
