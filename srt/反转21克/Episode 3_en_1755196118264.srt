1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,360
Huang Hai is someone who values goals and honor above all else.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,800
If he wants to kill me, there must be a reason.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,040
An ultimate mission.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,760
But what kind of mission

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,320
would make him want to kill me?

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,960
He can't possibly not notice.

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,880
What is Huang Hai's relationship with these people?

8
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,680
Huang Hai hates noise the most.

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,320
Why would they meet here?

10
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,520
They're an organization.

11
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,400
Huang Hai

12
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,400
You

13
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,080
owe me

14
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
an explanation

15
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,640
Tactic Three

16
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,240
How dare you touch my stuff.

17
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Boss.

18
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,680
The Public Security Bureau people are here.

19
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,960
Who’s that?

20
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,040
No idea.

21
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,400
Looks like he’s with them.

22
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,800
Let’s go.

23
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,640
Hurry, let’s go.

24
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,920
After leaving the service

25
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,280
We'll be scattered all over

26
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,760
Who knows when we'll meet again

27
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,640
Oh, right

28
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,000
Here, keep this as a memento

29
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,920
Don't forget about this brother

30
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,640
Oh, let me give this to you

31
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't want this

32
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,200
Even as a pillow, this book is too uncomfortable for me

33
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,120
Do you want it?

34
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,360
I really don't want it

35
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,520
Do you want it?

36
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,240
I really—

37
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,160
Do you want it?

38
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,480
I really—

39
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,160
Alright, alright, I'll take it

40
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
That's more like it

41
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,200
Perfect World

42
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,120
The oasis for humanity's future

43
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,880
It's also the hope for those who have suffered

44
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,840
See, I've already matured thanks to your influence

45
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,800
After all we've been through

46
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,640
Only you

47
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,040
Still hope for a normal life

48
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,200
Old Song

49
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't be nervous

50
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,080
It's very safe here

51
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
What's wrong with you?

52
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
Why is he like this when he wakes up?

53
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,400
It's very safe here

54
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,720
Are you feeling better?

55
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,960
Where am I?

56
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,560
This is a clinic in the old town.

57
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,760
This is Dr. Qian Boen, the doctor treating you.

58
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,160
Why are you looking at me?

59
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,280
If it weren't for me,

60
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,000
you might not have even woken up.

61
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,920
What happened to me?

62
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,600
No.

63
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
Does he have any trauma?

64
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,440
Such a strong reaction after waking up.

65
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,840
If this kind of situation isn't treated,

66
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
it can easily affect those around him

67
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,280
and cause harm.

68
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,680
Maybe I can help treat him as well.

69
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
You can't fix it.

70
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,320
I was the one who repaired your military super-eye.

71
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,360
Not to mention your minor

72
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,520
post-war trauma.

73
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,040
How do you know I have post-war trauma?

74
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,960
If you didn't have some kind of background,

75
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
how could you have a military super-eye?

76
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,040
Your condition just now was obvious.

77
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
My super-eye is broken.

78
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,200
It was probably damaged in battle.

79
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,440
But I don't know exactly how it was damaged.

80
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
You were already unconscious when I arrived.

81
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,960
How long was I unconscious?

82
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,920
Two days.

83
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,080
Two days?

84
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,720
Yeah.

85
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,960
It felt like just a moment passed.

86
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,120
A second ago,

87
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,600
I was still with Huang Hai.

88
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,520
Huang Hai

89
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,280
Where are you going?

90
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm going to find him.

91
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,800
Hey, wait a moment.

92
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,240
All your payment accounts

93
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,760
Total is 127,000.

94
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,560
When I just helped you fix your eyes,

95
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,680
I already deducted it for you.

96
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,320
This is what's left.

97
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,680
What? You took it?

98
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,600
Don't come over here.

99
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,840
You weren't like this before.

100
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,720
You said before, no matter the cost,

101
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
you had to save him.

102
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,800
These military-grade super eyes

103
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,400
These military-grade super eyes can't be bought.

104
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,120
I found someone to get them for me.

105
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
It cost 30,000.

106
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,400
Plus the surgery and treatment fees,

107
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,520
Alright, I'll owe you for now.

108
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,320
No.

109
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,280
What's wrong?

110
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,720
The group that was chasing Huang Hai at the White Shark Club

111
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,840
is approaching the clinic.
