1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,766
With Gav.

2
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:07,366
Baby

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi, baby.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Baby.

6
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:12,966
Hey, focus!

7
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:15,166
Sorry. I’ll focus on you.

8
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:34,366
The world is now a brighter place for me

9
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:38,266
Because we’re together now

10
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:42,066
My heart is just so happy

11
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:46,300
Because we’re together now

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,733
What did I do right

13
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:53,733
To win your love

14
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:57,566
I’ll always be here

15
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:03,433
You can count on me

16
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,833
Baby, I have something for you.

17
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,533
More gifts.

18
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,733
What is it?

19
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,033
Look at the back.

20
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,866
Nice.

21
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,300
It’s mine?

22
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:28,233
You and me

23
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:32,800
You and me

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,900
This one is for me.

25
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,233
So handsome!

26
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:39,233
What’s at the back?

27
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:43,533
Gav's baby.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,633
The world is now a happier place for me

29
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:59,666
Because we’re together now

30
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:03,366
My heart is just so excited

31
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:07,300
Because we’re together now

32
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,066
What did I do right

33
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:15,066
For us to be the perfect match

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Baby.

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,700
Come on, baby. Slide down.

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,700
OK here I go.

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,433
Hand in hand

38
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,966
In our world

39
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:34,333
We will never be apart

40
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:38,566
As long I am here with you

41
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:41,900
As long as there’s you and there is me

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,900
Gav?

43
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,333
Gav?

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
Gav?

45
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,666
Hey.

46
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,133
You and me

47
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,800
No one will be able to say

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,500
We won’t get very far

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,600
As long as we’re together

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,966
We’ll take on the world

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,166
You and me

52
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,933
You and me

53
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:26,033
You and me

54
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,766
You and me

55
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,633
You and me

56
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:34,200
You and me

57
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,633
Nice view.

58
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:44,833
What a really nice view.

59
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:46,966
Hi.

60
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,666
Hi.

61
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,800
You’re so cute, baby.

62
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,400
It’s pouring hard.

63
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:02,000
Come closer.

64
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,533
Baby, thank you.

65
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:10,666
You made me really happy today.

66
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,033
I love you, Cairo.

67
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:19,833
I’ll always try to make you happy 
every single day.

68
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:32,333
You’re never too far as long as 
you’re in my heart.

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,866
Distance wants us to love harder.

70
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:45,733
Wherever you are in the world, 
you will always be in my heart.

71
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,666
It doesn't matter where I go. I'm yours.

72
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:58,133
Go babes! #CaiReel

73
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,666
Seriously, that game was tiring.

74
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,666
It’s hard when you have to work 
with toxic teammates.

75
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,700
Aren’t you tired because you keep 
running on my mind?

76
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,900
Stop it, baby—

77
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,100
I mean Angel2000.

78
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:18,266
I have a new username, baby.

79
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,200
CairosAngel. Remember?

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
I said cut it out.

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,966
Not during my livestream.

82
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:24,833
You’re really asking for it.

83
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,000
Why, baby?

84
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,433
What are you planning to do to me?

85
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,533
My body is ready.

86
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:32,533
Idiot.

87
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,566
Don’t mind him.

88
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,500
Let’s do another game.

89
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,100
One on one. Enough with losers.

90
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,000
I’ll be choosing one of the comments.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,133
Anyone?

92
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:46,100
Ssob!

93
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,600
Let’s play, ssob!

94
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:51,633
Master! I didn’t know Master is here!

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,866
Master who?

96
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:55,700
Hi, Master Wesley! Long time!

97
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,200
Hi, ssob! How’s it going?

98
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,700
Hey!

99
00:05:58,033 --> 00:05:58,866
What’s ssob?

100
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:00,233
I’m not liking this.

101
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:01,666
Let’s go, ssob! Choose me, please!

102
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:05,366
OK. We have a special guest, guys.

103
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,933
Master is a fantastic player.

104
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,400
I’m sure I’m better than him.

105
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,266
Invite me to your live stream. It’ll be fun.

106
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:15,833
OK. Inviting him to my live stream now. Wait.

107
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,700
Hey. Not that guy.

108
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:22,133
Ssob! Good thing you remember me.

109
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,433
Of course, Master. You’re the man!

110
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,333
That’s him?

111
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,233
Hideous. Next please.

112
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,933
Let’s play?

113
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,633
Sure! What’s your  username?

114
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:35,633
masterwesley.

115
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:37,933
One word, all lower case.

116
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,333
Let's go,

117
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,400
OK, game.

118
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,200
What game?

119
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,033
Time to go home, baby.

120
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,633
I don’t like this.

121
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,366
Any news about Pearl?

122
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,900
I haven’t heard from her lately.

123
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,400
I have no idea… ssob!

124
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
What?

125
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:57,133
Nothing… ssob!

126
00:06:58,733 --> 00:06:59,633
What’s eating you?

127
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:01,300
I said nothing… ssob!

128
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,800
Stupid. Are you trying to sound like Wes?

129
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,666
Yes, Master.

130
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:07,700
Don’t be crazy.

131
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,100
He’s my childhood friend.

132
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,700
Why do you call each other like that?

133
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,266
What’s ssob? I don’t like the sound of it.

134
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,800
It’s boss. Spelled backwards.

135
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,900
How sweet.

136
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,000
Idiot. 

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,266
It’s like this.

138
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:24,266
As kids, we both liked to be the leader
in every game we played.

139
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:26,300
Nobody wanted to give in.

140
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,866
So our playmates called us master and boss.

141
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,100
But why ssob?

142
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,600
It sounds like a cute couple nickname.

143
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,966
You’re overreacting.

144
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,133
It's not even cute.

145
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,833
“Baby” still sounds better.

146
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,733
Really, baby?

147
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,333
Yes.

148
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,166
Wait. Are you jealous?

149
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,000
Me? Jealous?

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,533
No way.

151
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,733
He’s not even good looking.
Honestly he looks like a gecko.

152
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:56,000
No he doesn’t. Come on.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,700
Now you’re defending him.

154
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,166
I’m not, baby.

155
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,033
Then tell me, baby. 
Who’s better looking, me or him?

156
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,833
Of course…

157
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:05,333
no one. 

158
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,766
Ouch.

159
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,866
Don’t be stupid. You know the answer.

160
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,866
I want to hear you say it, baby.

161
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:15,366
You’re better looking, baby.

162
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:16,733
Is that true, baby?

163
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,066
What else?

164
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:19,700
Better looking and?

165
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,066
Hotter?

166
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,066
Sexier?

167
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,700
And shameless.

168
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:28,066
Don’t be cruel, baby.

169
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:32,200
Hey. Because of your shamelessness, 
we became close, baby.

170
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,400
You fell for me because of my 
good looks, baby?

171
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,666
Whatever.

172
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,966
Stop picking on Wes. 

173
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:41,800
Do you want to meet him?

174
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,366
He’s cool, baby. I think you’ll get along.

175
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:45,966
Forget it.

176
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:55,166
But if that’s what you want, baby. Sure.

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,033
Cairo. You haven’t started packing?

178
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Hi Gav.

179
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Bro.

180
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,566
It’s not like we’re leaving tomorrow.

181
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,733
You move so slow. 

182
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,833
There are more boxes in the kitchen.

183
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,533
Gav, please remind him.

184
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,933
Yes, bro.

185
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,700
Hey Gav, you have pizza for us?

186
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:27,200
- Brother!
- What?

187
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,633
Sure, I’ll have one delivered later.

188
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:30,400
Great! Thanks!

189
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,766
This is stressful.

190
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,266
Moving is so difficult.

191
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,266
So is being left behind.

192
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,500
Just teasing you, baby.

193
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,566
But don’t forget me, OK?

194
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,300
You’re crazy.

195
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,766
I think this is enough.

196
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:07,700
Three disinfectants each for baby, Mama, London and Paris.

197
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,200
Baby, this is a lot.

198
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,266
We still have some supplies left.

199
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,566
Just take them with you to Bukidnon, baby.

200
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,400
I want you to be safe always.

201
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,466
Okay, baby. Mama says thanks.

202
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,100
You're welcome.

203
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,400
Gardening.

204
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,700
Unbelievable.

205
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,666
She can’t return calls but she can post 
stories on her Vidgram.

206
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,566
Who is this Ssob anyway?

207
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:46,566
Wait.

208
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:57,633
Who is Harry Potter’s godfather?

209
00:10:57,633 --> 00:11:00,833
That’s easy. It’s Sirius Black.

210
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:08,033
What subject does Hagrid teach?

211
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,000
Care of magical creatures!

212
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,833
This is too easy.

213
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:20,733
What is Snape’s Patronus?

214
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,433
Doe! 

215
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:24,933
See?

216
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:28,033
It’s what symbolizes Snape’s love for Lily,

217
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,800
Harry Potter’s mom,

218
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,966
his childhood best friend.

219
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,900
I was really surprised to see your 
comment during my livestream.

220
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,466
My mom told me that you were 
moving to Bukidnon.

221
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:46,333
I was planning to chat you up.
But then I saw you were live, ssob.

222
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:50,366
How did you know we were moving? 

223
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:52,733
I didn’t know you were back in Bukidnon.

224
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,533
Your mom asked my mom for help.

225
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:59,433
You need  to secure travel permits from 
the government office here. 

226
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:03,000
In fact, I’m taking care of it. 

227
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,233
You know, you don’t really have to. 
It’s OK.

228
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,133
Just enjoy your time there. 

229
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:08,400
Go out, take walks.

230
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,966
We’re not in a hurry. 

231
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:14,366
What are you talking about?
I’m so bored here.

232
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,933
I’m sure it’d be fun to have you here again.

233
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,466
Well it’s great that you’re home.

234
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah. I really wanted to go home 
before the lockdown. I was planning to talk to Mama.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,266
I’ve been thinking about shifting my program.

236
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:29,400
Then this pandemic happened.

237
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,700
Wrong timing.

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,066
Were you table to talk to her?

239
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,833
No. You know my mom.

240
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,733
She won’t agree to it.

241
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:40,633
Maybe I shouldn’t ask her at all.

242
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:44,600
Your mom is scary when she’s angry.

243
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,033
She’ll probably hang you upside down.

244
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,400
But I really don’t want to go to med school.

245
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,366
It’s not for me.

246
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,033
What do you want?

247
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:52,633
I don’t know.

248
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,033
Seriously?

249
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,566
You came home to Bukidnon to 
talk to your mom,

250
00:12:57,566 --> 00:13:00,833
and you don’t know what you want?

251
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,000
I really don’t know.

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,933
Maybe film?

253
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:07,066
Recently, I’ve been enjoying photography.

254
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,866
Fine Arts is also an option.

255
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:11,500
Anything but med school.

256
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,100
I don’t want to finish my Biology 
course anymore.

257
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,400
There are so many things I want to do. 

258
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,300
It’s my parents who insist that I 
become a doctor.

259
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,600
It’s not easy to talk to our parents.

260
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,800
If only I wasn’t stuck here in Bukidnon, 
I would tell them straightaway.

261
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,033
But they might throw me out. 

262
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:31,800
Wow. Look at you being brave.

263
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,566
When we were little, one look from your mom
and you’d hurry back to her.

264
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:40,266
You think you’re funny.

265
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:43,933
I’m your master, remember.

266
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:45,800
A master who’s terrified of his mom.

267
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,766
And you’re not?

268
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:49,066
Not really.

269
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,066
Oh really.

270
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,733
As if. The nerve.

271
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:56,066
Ma'am Leila! Hi! How are you?

272
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,866
I hate you!

273
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,300
You thought she was there.

274
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,700
So you’re not afraid of her?

275
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:08,300
I don’t run in fear like you.

276
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,066
Let’s see his Vidram.

277
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,966
I’m sure this ssob sucks.

278
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:16,466
Ssob, ssob. Stupid name.

279
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:25,066
What the heck is that, ssob?

280
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,166
Are you high?

281
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,366
You’re too stiff.

282
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:36,900
This is how you do it!

283
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,466
Want me to teach you?

284
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:40,966
What’s up, guys? 
It’s your boy Wesley

285
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,333
Could your intro be any newer…

286
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,233
ssob?

287
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,400
What’s up?

288
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,633
So, I’m about to share…

289
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,900
Stop blabbering. Just show it.

290
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,666
These are artworks I created.

291
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:51,233
Ssob…

292
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:53,933
that’s it, ssob?

293
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:56,766
It’s beautiful, right? What do you think?

294
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:57,600
Horrible.

295
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,033
It looks like charcoal stains!

296
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,866
My pillowcase looks exactly like that.

297
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,433
- That’s it?
- OK guys, it’s time for my second artwork.

298
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:06,566
- I’m still thinking of a title for this one.
- Ugly as well.

299
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:08,433
It looks like a mossy wall.

300
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:11,000
My inspiration for making this artwork…

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,433
It just reminded me of my childhood.

302
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:17,566
Childhood? It looks like a child 
went crazy with fingerpaints.

303
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,600
I remember my best friend, all my friends…

304
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,033
- When we used to play in the mud…
- You can’t fool people with your stories.

305
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,433
Show-off!

306
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,466
Wait.

307
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,433
Now this is art. 

308
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,700
I made it.

309
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,366
Look at it!

310
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,633
Very wrong!

311
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:45,366
Watch this!

312
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,866
You can’t fool me!

313
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,233
These muscles can crush you.

314
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,900
Show-off!

315
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,333
Whoa.

316
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,166
Really now.

317
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:17,866
She seems to he having a lot of fun.

318
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:20,466
Madame is busy talking to others, huh.

319
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,266
Thank you guys for joining my
VG live.

320
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:24,866
I hope you guys learned something.

321
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:30,000
And I hope my advice 
will help you find true love.

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Bye.

323
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,633
Your highness!

324
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:38,066
We’re so honored to be graced by your presence.

325
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:40,166
Yeah, I thought you’ve forgotten about us.

326
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,266
Is that what happens when you 
become a famous vlogger?

327
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:46,166
You guys are picking on me again. 

328
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,100
You’ve been declining my invitations.

329
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,466
I wish we could do zumba,

330
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,000
meditate,

331
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,400
and game nights together. 

332
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,166
But you always have excuses.

333
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,666
- Now it’s my fault?
- Admit it. You’re too busy flirting with your crush.

334
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,200
Wow. You finally have a love life, Pearl.

335
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,466
Stop teasing me.

336
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:03,333
Don’t jinx it. Nothing’s happened yet. 

337
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,266
Lame.

338
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:05,566
So when are we meeting this person?

339
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,000
No!

340
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,200
It’s not happening until we’re 
officially a couple.

341
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,500
Otherwise you might cause trouble again.

342
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,833
Remember what you did the last time?

343
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,866
What did Gav do?

344
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,333
He punched James in the face.

345
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,933
James probably deserved it.

346
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:25,366
- It could have gone worse. Scary.
- I did not punch him.

347
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,166
I just pushed him away.

348
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:27,800
Yeah, right.

349
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,200
I couldn’t allow him to treat you with disrespect.

350
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,633
Of course I would defend you.

351
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,400
See, baby?

352
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,033
These muscles will always protect you.

353
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:41,100
You’re crazy.

354
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,400
Anyway, enough about me.

355
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,333
How are you two lovebirds?

356
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,066
How was the honeymoon?

357
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,133
Stop it, Pearl

358
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,166
What honeymoon?

359
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,966
It’s just between us. Right, baby?

360
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:54,833
Idiot. She might think it’s true.

361
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,266
No, all I’m asking is… 

362
00:17:57,266 --> 00:18:00,233
how’s the honeymoon stage been going?

363
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,066
Go ahead, baby. Answer it.

364
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:03,500
- Don’t be shy.
- What?

365
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,900
Just tell her.

366
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,600
It’s only for married couples.

367
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,166
We’ll get there soon, baby.

368
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,533
Even so, that’s not the point, baby.

369
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:12,133
Baby?

370
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh my God. Did I hear it right?

371
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,433
You’re calling him baby?

372
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:20,033
What an improvement!

373
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:23,033
I’m so giddy for you, babes.

374
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,600
Right? It’s music to my ears when he says it.

375
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,300
I’m falling for him even more.

376
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,066
Nothing compares with “baby.”

377
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,800
Especially “Gav’s Baby.”

378
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,200
So cute.

379
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,700
- I hope I can be like that with—
- With?

380
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,566
- We can’t wait to stalk this person on Screentime.
- Secret.

381
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:46,933
And no clues for now.

382
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,166
Stay happy, OK?

383
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,933
Even in the middle of this pandemic.

384
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:52,300
Even if you can’t see each other often—

385
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,366
We’ve only gone on one date you know.

386
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,433
Are you complaining?

387
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:01,066
Mama forbids me from going out.

388
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:03,600
And I got really busy since we’re moving soon.

389
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,366
Baby! Of course I understand. I was just teasing.

390
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:11,666
Anyway, please stay strong
forever and ever…

391
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,733
Amen.

392
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:29,733
"How Physical Distancing Affects 
Lovers Around The World."

393
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,566
Baby.

394
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,700
Yes, my baby?

395
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:49,400
Do you want me to introduce you to Wes?

396
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:51,233
No way.

397
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,666
I don’t really care about that smartass.

398
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,700
Why, baby?

399
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,933
So you won’t get jealous anymore.

400
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,666
Why would I get jealous of that alien…

401
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,733
turtle…

402
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:12,200
alien-looking turtle?

403
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,833
I’m not jealous, baby.

404
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,233
OK, baby.

405
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,766
OK sure, baby. It’s OK with me.

406
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,633
OK thanks, baby.

407
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:42,266
But why the mad face?

408
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:48,400
My mistake, baby.

409
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,666
It's my most used emoji for you.

410
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,766
What’s up, ssob?

411
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,266
Didn’t I tell you I was going to introduce you
to  someone today?

412
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,033
And there’s something else…

413
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,733
What is it, ssob?

414
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,400
Would you mind if you stop calling me—

415
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,066
Hi, baby.

416
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,233
What’s so funny?

417
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,166
Sorry. I  heard “baby” and it made me laugh—

418
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,966
You think it’s funny?

419
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:22,100
Well “ssob” sounds ridiculous. Tacky even.

420
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,300
- I'm sorry.
- Wait—

421
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,266
I didn’t mean to offend you. 

422
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:27,000
I couldn’t help laughing because

423
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,766
I thought you were in the wrong Session call.

424
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:32,066
That’s understandable.

425
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:35,066
I thought you have a problem 
with me and my baby.

426
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:37,600
Your baby?

427
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:40,633
You mean you two are…

428
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,533
Go on, baby. You can tell him.

429
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,066
He already gets it.

430
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,100
It’s better if he hears it from you, baby.
So it’s clear.

431
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,266
OK.

432
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,500
So you call each other baby?

433
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,466
Yes. He’s my baby.

434
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,533
Yeah I thought so. You should have told me.

435
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:03,200
You two are cute together.

436
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,966
Your friend seems alright.

437
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:06,100
I told you so.

438
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,866
Nice meeting you…

439
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:09,100
Gav.

440
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,033
Gavreel.

441
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:10,766
Gavreel?

442
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:13,233
Oh, the angel of peace. 

443
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,966
Cool. What a cool name.

444
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:16,900
How did you know?

445
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,100
Did my baby tell you?

446
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,800
No.

447
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,200
I read it somewhere. I love to read.

448
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,600
I almost forgot.

449
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:27,800
Ask him the square root of any number.

450
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:28,700
Why?

451
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,200
Come on, baby.

452
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,033
Think of a random number.

453
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:35,800
What’s the square root of… 576?

454
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,766
24.

455
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:37,766
Boom!

456
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:39,566
Wait, I’ll check.

457
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,466
See?

458
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:43,800
Just a lucky guess.

459
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,866
What's the square root of  1444.

460
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:47,433
38.

461
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,100
4761?

462
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,900
69.

463
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,000
8836?

464
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,533
94.

465
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:57,266
See? Come on, Gav.
Doesn’t Wes look familiar to you?

466
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:58,166
Why, who is he?

467
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,266
There he goes again.

468
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:01,333
Remember the milk TV commercial?

469
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,666
That one about genius kids?

470
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,266
He’s the math genius in that ad.

471
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:06,500
Ssob, I’m not a genius.

472
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,066
- It’s just a commercial.
- You haven’t changed.

473
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:12,700
Why do you love telling that story?

474
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,100
Of course!

475
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,733
Remember, baby?
I also appeared in a TV commercial before.

476
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:18,200
I even showed you the video.

477
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,466
Yeah, but you just walked past behind the model.

478
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:26,066
Yes, but it’s at that moment that you 
realize it’s a fantastic soap.

479
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:27,700
It’s an important role.

480
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,100
Of course, baby.

481
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,300
Did you hear that…

482
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,700
Wesley.

483
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,566
But ssob calls me master. 

484
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,366
Monster.

485
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:38,266
What?

486
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:41,533
I said master.

487
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,566
Isn’t that how my baby calls you? Master?

488
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:44,766
Nice meeting you, Wesley.

489
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:46,266
Thanks.

490
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,700
So how did you meet?

491
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,366
Ssob and I are childhood friends.

492
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:55,433
But I only see him when he goes
to Bukidnon for the holidays.

493
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,833
Bukidnon?

494
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:58,600
You’re from Bukidnon?

495
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,566
Yes. 

496
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:00,900
We’re neighbors.

497
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:04,000
Well technically, his grandma is our neighbor.

498
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,633
But once they move here,
then we’ll be real neighbors.

499
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:09,166
Right, ssob?

500
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,833
Wait. I have to go to the john.

501
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,766
Sure, Wes. Go ahead.

502
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:22,233
Gav?

503
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:23,333
Yeah?

504
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,733
- Are you OK?
- Of course.

505
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:26,900
Are you sure?

506
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,400
Why wouldn’t I be OK?

507
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:43,266
Fabulous.

508
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:46,633
Looks like our queen is busy.

509
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:53,533
Hi. It’s your girl, Pearl.

510
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,233

Bye.

513
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,533
Does LDR really work?

514
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:09,966
Watch my latest vlog and please 
like and subscribe.

515
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:15,600
Yes it does! As long as you love 
and trust each other.

516
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,100
No. These days, it’s difficult to 
maintain a LDR.

517
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,800
It doesn’t work,

518
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,933
especially if there are people
who keep meddling with your relationship.

519
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:32,066
Don’t even get into one. You’ll only get hurt. 

520
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:35,433
So many bitter people.

521
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,466
Catching up with ssob. 

522
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:45,266
See you, very soon!

523
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,500
Oh yeah Mr Know-it-all? 

524
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,133
Show-off!

525
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,166
Hi, baby. May I call?

526
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:05,200
Let’s talk later. I have to run some 
errands for Mama, baby.

527
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,566
OK, baby. Love you.

528
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,266
Love you.

529
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,733
Maybe he’s busy.

530
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,233
Hi your highness. Busy? Want to chat?

531
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:36,400
Bummer. There’s no one to talk to.

532
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:48,500
In this pandemic and age of physical distancing,

533
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,933
every relationship feels like a
long distance relationship.

534
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,200
Exactly!

535
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:55,800
Wait.

536
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:57,633
Is he sincere?

537
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,700
Or he just wants attention again?

538
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:02,400
Why is he calling?

539
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,233
Hi, Gav.

540
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:11,000
Terrence,

541
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,233
what’s up?

542
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:15,800
Nothing.

543
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:19,800
I just have no one to talk to.

544
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:25,133
It seems everyone is busy.

545
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,833
Is this OK?

546
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:37,600
I understand.

547
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,766
Sorry, I just thought…

548
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:41,700
- Anyways, bye—
- Wait.

549
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:45,300
Are you OK?

550
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,833
I guess.

551
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,766
Not as OK as I used to be.

552
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:57,000
Like most people nowadays,

00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,300
I’m just looking for someone to talk to.

00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,766
Is it OK?

555
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:15,266
OK.
