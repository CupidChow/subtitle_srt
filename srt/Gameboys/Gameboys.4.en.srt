1
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:04,866
Are you guys together?

2
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:05,866
Not yet.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,066
I already texted him. Still no reply.

4
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:09,633
He should be close by.

5
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:11,066
He left hours ago.

6
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:14,600
Look for a brown Innova.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,466
Brown Innova…

8
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:21,466
I’m dying of excitement.

9
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:23,900
I think he’s here.

10
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,600
Oh my God, that’s him! That’s him!

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
Is it?

12
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:37,833
That's him!

13
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:40,033
Yes! Go, go!

14
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:42,000
Gav?

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Yes?

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,333
- Wait…
- Sorry… I thought…

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,200
Wait… who’s that?

18
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,933
Brown Innova…

19
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:14,600
Sorry. I don’t know what happened
to that dumbass. 

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,300
I’ve been calling him but he’s not answering my calls.

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,300
Huh?

22
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:20,466
It’s okay. 

23
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,033
I wasn’t really expecting him to show up.

24
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:25,166
Really? 

25
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:30,000
Didn’t you just take a shower so
you could meet with him with open arms?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,866
I took a shower because it’s hot.

27
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:35,200
Besides, it’s you who forced me to go meet him outside.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,600
OK, my bad. Sorry.

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,166
Well, I have to go.

30
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,433
Wait. 

31
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:44,433
What if something bad happened to him?

32
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,300
I hope I’m wrong.

33
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,533
Don’t say that, Pearl.

34
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:51,466
Erase, erase. Sorry. 

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
If I don’t hear from him,

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,433
I’ll go to his house tonight and kick his ass.

37
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,366
Let me know how it goes.

38
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,266
I’m sleepy. I’m taking a nap.

39
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:02,466
OK. Bye.

40
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:20,900
This was his last post before he went offline.

41
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,100
I wonder what happened to him?

42
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,866
Are you OK?

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,866
Baby!

44
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,233
You idiot. I hate you!

45
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,733
 Geez. I thought you were coming?

46
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:52,400
Good to know you're alive.
I almost went crazy wondering what happened to you.

47
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,433
Yes?

48
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:59,066
Sorry.

49
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,533
May I call you?

50
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,000
You think you're cute?

51
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:09,500
I’m sleepy.

52
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:14,966
OK.

53
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:26,233
Baby… sorry.

54
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,733
What for?

55
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,500
Because I wasn’t able to go there.

56
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:33,400
Oh, you were really going here?

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,633
Yes. I was so excited. 

58
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,433
But when I got to Bacoor,
l learned it was in extreme lockdown.

59
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:42,600
Vehicles weren’t allowed to proceed to Manila.

60
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:47,466
I had to turn back and return the items to Pearl’s dad.

61
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:50,166
Then my phone went dead.

62
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,866
I was such in a hurry to leave I forgot to bring my charger.

63
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,933
That’s why I couldn’t update you. 

64
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:57,633
I’m really sorry.

65
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:04,566
Baby?

66
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,000
Sorry.

67
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:10,766
It’s OK, I wasn’t even aware. I was asleep.

68
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:13,766
Oh really. I just read Pearl’s messages. 

69
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,000
You waited for me at the lobby.

70
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,433
Too bad. You missed your chance to hug me.

71
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,333
Wise-ass. 

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,033
It was Pearl who insisted that I meet you.

73
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:23,600
Did she really? 

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,633
Pearl said you were in such a hurry you forgot to wear a shirt.

75
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,566
I missed out on seeing you naked.

76
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,666
Shut up. 

77
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,033
Are you saying sorry or just trying to annoy me?

78
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,833
I really wanted to court you officially in your home.

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,733
You think Mama will like me?

80
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:41,433
You’re calling her Mama?

81
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,033
Why not?

82
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,700
She’ll be my mother-in-law anyway.

83
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
You’re crazy, Angel of Peace.

84
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,900
I’m thinking about changing my username.

85
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:52,400
Remember my suggestion? Devil2000?  

86
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,366
Or what about Demon666? 

87
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,100
They fit you perfectly.

88
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,800
I have something better… 

89
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:03,400
CairosAngel.

90
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:12,766
Idiot. 

91
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:17,633
It doesn’t suit you.

92
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,233
But we’re suited for each other.

93
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:21,033
Whatever.

94
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:23,200
Do you know what Cairo means?

95
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,266
Of course. It’s the capital of Egypt.

96
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:29,033
Other than that. Look it up.

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,700
Cairo is a given name that is Arabic in origin

98
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,600
It means "one who is victorious"

99
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:43,466
and is derived from the capital city of Egypt.

100
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:44,766
You're right.

101
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:47,166
One who is victorius. 

102
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,466
That's cool.

103
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,033
I didn’t know that. 

104
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,000
See?

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,066
We do complement each other.
You’ve won my heart from the start.

106
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:57,166
God. You’re so cheesy.

107
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:59,166
But it works.

108
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,333
Are you OK?

109
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:05,466
Gav?

110
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
Gav?

111
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,866
Wait.

112
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,333
Have you been coughing for long?

113
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,933
Have you been coughing for long?

114
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,133
Just clearing my throat.

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,900
Awww. You look really concerned. 

116
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,266
If you’re joking, it’s not funny. 

117
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:31,700
That’s how my dad’s symptoms started.

118
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,466
I was just clearing my throat. 

119
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,400
I wouldn’t make that kind of joke.

120
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:37,366
Especially with what’s happening to your dad.

121
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:38,366
OK.

122
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,566
But you were really concerned for me.

123
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:44,733
Shut up!

124
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,733
Good evening, Papa. 

125
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:53,700
I’m not sure if you’ll be able to read this.

126
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,366
I’m texting you every day 

127
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,900
to let you know what’s happening until you get better.

128
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,433
We’re doing fine. 

129
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:01,100
But we miss you so much.

130
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,466
I love you, Pa.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,466
Finally. I’m on my second bottle already.

132
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:30,000
Why are we meeting? Are you giving away money?

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,200
Fool. I’m so bored here. 

134
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,333
Seriously, Cai?
We’re supposed to be having drinks.

135
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,700
We can’t have alcohol in the house. 

136
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,200
My mom would kill me.

137
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,900
- Babe, talk to your boyfriend—
- He is not my boyfriend.

138
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,433
Don’t call me babe in front of my baby.
He’ll get jealous.

139
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:46,433
Idiot.

140
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,700
There’s no reason to be jealous.

141
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,133
Shut up.

142
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,066
Why would I get jealous?

143
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,533
You want me to kick your ass?

144
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,933
Hey, don’t start a lovers’ quarrel. Let’s just toast.

145
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
Cheers!

146
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
You’re gross!

147
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,966
Isn’t the news depressing? 

148
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:08,633
It feels like the end of the world.

149
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:11,766
Is it? Then why am I so happy
every time I see Cai?

150
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,600
Really, Gav? That’s so sappy.

151
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,866
But he seems to be buying it.

152
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,666
Don’t you look thrilled!

153
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,300
Of course not!

154
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,000
- Let’s just play a game and have fun!
- What game?

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,900
Scavenger hunt. I’ll be the host.

156
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,166
What kind of game is that?

157
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,100
It’s like “Bring Me.” 

158
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,666
You have to race to find an item.

159
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,800
The loser takes a shot.

160
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,766
So I take a shot of beer, 

161
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:42,200
but Cairo drinks chocolate milk? Is that fair?

162
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:44,733
He’s your baby, so stop complaining. 

163
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,666
OK, game

164
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:50,033
Bring me something only a grown-up would use. Go!

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,033
Don’t just sit there! Go look around!

166
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,900
10… 9…

167
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,733
8… 7.. 6…

168
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:06,466
Wait. What is that, Gav?

169
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,500
- Drink up, baby!
- What about you, Cai? What did you bring?

170
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:17,533
This.

171
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,900
Oh my God!

172
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,833
Baby!

173
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,600
- Why do you have a condom there?
- It’s not mine. 

174
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,900
It’s my brother’s. I just know where he hides his stash.

175
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,633
Baby!

176
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,533
Stop calling me baby!

177
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:32,333
- Are you sure it’s your brother’s?
- Yes.

178
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:35,400
Reserve one for us. We might need it.

179
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,366
Yuck!

180
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,366
You’re gross!

181
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:41,366
OK that’s enough! Next! 

182
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:47,033
OK game! Bring me something beautiful! Go!

183
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,066
Here. I got something.

184
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,166
Really, Cai? Just a second ago you were holding a condom.

185
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:01,933
I believe that a rosary is a beautiful gift of our faith.

186
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,366
Wow,

187
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:06,533
thank you for that wonderful answer,
candidate number 5. 

188
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,266
Hey, Gav. Where’s your “something beautiful”?

189
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:14,566
Right here. 

190
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,833
We’ve been talking to him.

191
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,900
Are you drunk, Angel of Peace?

192
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,866
- Drunk with my love for you, baby.
- Yuck!

193
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:26,166
That’s revolting, Gav!

194
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,266
Is it wrong to be sweet?

195
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,000
Let’s just cheers then!

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,233
Cheers!

197
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,600
Wait. Smile. I’ll take a screenshot.

198
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,800
- I have to fix my hair.
- You’re still cute, baby.

199
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,433
Stop flirting already. Let me take a picture first.

200
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:48,933
Wait, I have an idea. 
Let’s do the heart sign.

201
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,066
Heart sign? How?

202
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,800
Cai, do the right side. 

203
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,666
Gav, do the left side. 

204
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,000
I’ll just do the finger heart.

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,133
I’ll pretend you guys are my “oppa.”

206
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,166
Like this? 

207
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,166
Is this right?

208
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,700
Yes, perfect!

209
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,300
Do a countdown, Pearl.

210
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,900
One… two… smile!

211
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:14,100
With my favorite gamers.

212
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,900
Busy? Am I disturbing you?

213
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,600
You can disturb me anytime.

214
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,933
Fool. 

215
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:35,933
What are you doing?

216
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:40,533
I’m preparing healthy meals for our frontliners.

217
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,966
Wow.

218
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:43,633
So you have a heart after all.

219
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,733
You’re so mean.

220
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,266
That’s great.

221
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:49,600
They don’t mind that the food sucks?

222
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,433
Excuse me. 

223
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,633
These meals are delicious. Like me.

224
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,466
Ew. But it’s all veggies.

225
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,666
Not just veggies.

226
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,266
It depends on the menu. 

227
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:00,466
There’s fish, meat.

228
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,300
I bet you don’t eat vegetables.

229
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,433
Never.

230
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:04,966
And you love junk food. 

231
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:06,966
Baby, you have to eat healthy.

232
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,966
That’s why you’re thin.

233
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,766
I’m not thin.

234
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:13,466
I just wear clothing that hides my muscles. Look!

235
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,833
See?

236
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,533
That’s it? Let me see your abs.

237
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,500
Idiot. You just want to see me naked.

238
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
No.

239
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,033
But why not? 

240
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:26,566
With your consent.

241
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,333
Perv.

242
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,766
Baby, what’s that on your cheek?

243
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:37,366
- Where?
- Turn this way so I can see.

244
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:38,500
More.

245
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Huh? What?

246
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Look to your side. 

247
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
More.

248
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,266
How can I see if I’m looking this way?

249
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:49,200
- Let me look at it first. Stop moving.
- Tell me where it is.

250
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,666
That’s it. Keep still.

251
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Don’t move.

252
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Where is it?

253
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,600
Perfect.

254
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,233
Is this OK?

255
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:01,200
Let me give you a kiss.

256
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,533
What?

257
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,500
You’re so annoying!

258
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,200
Stop playing around!

259
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,566
I like it!

260
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:15,100
Whatever.

261
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,166
Listening to my new fave song.

262
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,700
Hi, baby.

263
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,900
Hello.

264
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,000
Finally, he answers to baby.

265
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,333
LOL

266
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,666
What are you listening to?

267
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:41,500
Is that our song?

268
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:44,833
The one I made for you?

269
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,500
Secret.

270
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,033
Gavreel.

271
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:25,200
Angel of Peace.

272
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
You already said play, right?

273
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,733
Please? Please.

274
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,233
Yes! Whoah!

275
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,833
That's nice. You look cuter when you smile.

276
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,866
If you need someone to talk to,
I'm just here, okay?

277
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:35,866
I'm your guy.

278
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:36,866
I heard that.

279
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:37,866
But I'm still your guy.

280
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:39,333
Hi, baby.

281
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,266
Baby, finally we're going to meet!

282
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:41,966
Baby...

283
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:43,700
Baby!

284
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,333
Baby...

285
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,333
Baby!

286
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,033
Hi, baby!

287
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:49,033
Baby...

288
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:50,766
But it's you I like.

289
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,066
Hi, Gav.

290
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,966
I want to tell you something...

291
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,433
Nevermind.

292
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,500
OK, guys. 

293
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,566
One of you gets to play against me now. 

294
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:20,566
One on one. 

295
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:21,566
But this time,

296
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,200
if I lose, I’ll give stuff away. 

297
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,366
No cheaters, okay?  

298
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:29,300
Type your username below.

299
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:33,833
Who’s up for the challenge?

300
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,666
Wow. This Terrence Carreon sure is excited.

301
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,800
OK, I choose you.

302
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,466
What’s your username? I’ll invite you.

303
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:46,100
Invite me to your live stream.

304
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,600
Sure.

305
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,533
But no crying if you lose. 

306
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:52,433
Don’t come running back to your mom, OK?

307
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:54,266
Wait.

308
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:00,833
Terrence?

309
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:03,533
OK, G.

310
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:06,000
What’s your username for the game?

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,300
Wait. I’m typing it now.

312
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:15,366
What’s that? 

313
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:20,133
GavreelsOnlyLove?
