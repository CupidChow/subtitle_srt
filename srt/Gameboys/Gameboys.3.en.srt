1
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:28,406
Cai… Cairo…

2
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:29,406
Baby!

3
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,539
Talk to me, please.

4
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:32,906
I miss you.

5
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,839
This year you’ll be lucky in love…

6
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,939
if you choose me.

7
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:46,772
Cairo, baby!

8
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,872
I miss you.

9
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:51,872
Don’t you miss me?

10
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:53,539
Baby!

11
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:59,272
Cai, I really miss you.

12
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,272
I just got here at my mom’s house.
Miss me already?

13
00:01:16,272 --> 00:01:17,206
Come back here.

14
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:20,906
And let you strangle me? No thanks.

15
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:22,306
I’ll stay here until the lockdown ends.

16
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:24,939
You live nearby. Come back here.

17
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:26,339
Let me strangle you a little.

18
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,039
Temper, temper.

19
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,706
You’re annoying.

20
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,506
He must be thinking bad of me.

21
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:33,772
He’s not answering my calls.

22
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:36,672
Good. Now he’s safe from your advances.

23
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:38,806
Aren’t you my friend?
You should be on my side.

24
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:42,339
I am your friend. That’s why I’m doing this.

25
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:43,772
You’ll probably ghost him soon.

26
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,339
Poor boy.

27
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:49,272
Excuse me! I’ve never ghosted anyone!

28
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:52,406
That doesn’t count.

29
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:54,306
I know you, Gav. You’re bored of the lockdown.

30
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:57,339
You’re only flirting to mess with him.

31
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:59,806
How can you accuse me of that?

32
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:01,306
Sure?

33
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:03,406
- What about—?
- We’re done, OK?

34
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,406
We’re never getting back together.

35
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:08,072
Okay.

36
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:10,339
You don’t believe me?

37
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:14,072
You fell for him just by watching his live streams?

38
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:15,972
You’re hopeless.

39
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,572
You’re not even into gaming.

40
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:22,606
He’s cute.

41
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:26,406
Cute?

42
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:28,739
- Wow!
- Really?

43
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,006
I’ve seen you fawning over cute boys!

44
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,839
I’ve also become his fan.

45
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,839
He’s smart. And we both love music.

46
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:38,106
You’ve been stalking him?

47
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:40,806
I learned my stalking skills from the best.

48
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:41,872
You.

49
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:44,239
I hate you.

50
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,572
Now it’s my fault?

51
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:48,406
I’m serious about him.

52
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:52,839
I got into online games because of him.

53
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,739
I even studied his moves.

54
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:57,772
OK fine, I believe you.

55
00:02:57,772 --> 00:02:58,906
Just don’t ghost him.

56
00:02:58,906 --> 00:03:00,906
Or I’ll make you sorry.

57
00:03:01,872 --> 00:03:03,572
Now can you come back here?

58
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:04,806
No way!

59
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:07,239
You make me do all the housework.

60
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,439
I live like a princess here.

61
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,039
Bye!

62
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:13,072
Good morning.

63
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,272
Hey?

64
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,606
Are you mad?

65
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:24,239
Is it because of Pearl?

66
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,939
She’s just my best friend.

67
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:32,939
Babe is your best friend?

68
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,539
Please answer.

69
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:35,872
I’ll explain everything.

70
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:50,272
What?

71
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:52,672
No “hello baby” up to now?

72
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:53,972
Not even “good morning”?

73
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:55,339
Like I care.

74
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:56,806
Okay.

75
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,306
Please don’t be mad.

76
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,806
Pearl is not my girlfriend.

77
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,539
Why would I be angry?

78
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,839
I don’t care if you two are lovers.

79
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:08,639
I think you’re jealous.

80
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,539
No, not at all!

81
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:12,772
I think you are.

82
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:15,372
You're jealous, right?

83
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:20,239
See?

84
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,306
Everything is a joke with you.

85
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,006
Everything is a game.

86
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:26,506
Sorry.

87
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,539
I’m not playing games with you.

88
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:31,639
I just want to see you smile.

89
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,372
Wow thank you.

90
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:35,972
What did I do wrong?

91
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:39,272
Tell me so I can fix it.

92
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:46,872
You said if I needed someone to talk to,
I could turn to you.

93
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,439
But… but…

94
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,239
You really are jealous.

95
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:54,272
I said I’m not jealous!

96
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:59,439
I thought you could be my friend.

97
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,806
It was stupid of me to expect anything from you.

98
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:05,539
We’re just strangers online.

99
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:08,706
Cairo,

100
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:11,972
you’re not a stranger to me.

101
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:15,772
When I made that promise,

102
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:17,272
I really meant it.

103
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:19,272
Promise.

104
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,206
Did anything happen?

105
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,839
I’m sorry for not getting in touch sooner.

106
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,272
Hey Cai,

107
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:31,106
are you okay?

108
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,472
What happened?

109
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:36,072
Sorry, I have to go.

110
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,039
Hey, wait-

111
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:44,439
Brother, can I visit papa at the hospital?

112
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:46,572
You know the answer.

113
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,772
Do you want to get infected?

114
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,672
Mama is already stressed as it is.

115
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,872
I’ll be careful.

116
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:00,906
Why would I stress her up?

117
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:10,772
Okay.

118
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:22,506
I’ll be gone for a while, babe.

119
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:25,339
Don’t miss me too much.

120
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,639
I’ll be back before you know it.

121
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,206
Love you.

122
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:32,472
Love you.

123
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:36,239
Pissed that she’s leaving?

124
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,472
Serves you right.

125
00:07:01,772 --> 00:07:06,539
I don't believe she's not your girlfriend.

126
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:09,839
Sorry… I’m so sorry, babe.

127
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,372
I had no idea he would react that way.

128
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:17,172
- Sorry yourself. He already blocked me.
- Let me chat him up.

129
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:19,372
I’ll apologize. Explain everything.

130
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,372
He’ll just ignore you… babe.

131
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:25,006
You should have explained our relationship to him.

132
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:27,572
Your boyfriends always think I’m a threat.

133
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,106
You’re not the only reason why he’s mad.

134
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:32,139
He’s going through a lot.

135
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:35,372
I promised to be always there for him.

136
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:38,472
But now I let him down.

137
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:40,872
Do you know what happened?

138
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:45,406
I think it has something to do with his dad.

139
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,906
I know the feeling.

140
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,572
I’ve been through it last year.

141
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:58,672
Seeing your loved one in the hospital
can make you feel helpless.

142
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:11,972
To be fair, Pearl is pretty.

143
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:17,739
Who’s this?

144
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,006
Is this his grandma?

145
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,339
I don’t know what it’s like to have parents.

146
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:30,539
But I never felt I missed out because of
Grandma Cora.

147
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:35,772
She took very good care of me
ever since my parents died.

148
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:37,839
Thank you for everything, Grandma Cora.

149
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,172
I know you will be watching over me.

150
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:41,706
I love you.

151
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:45,506
What’s your plan?

152
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:56,806
I have an idea,

153
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,039
but I need your help.

154
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,706
Do I really want to know?

155
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:05,106
You can’t say no.

156
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:07,472
You started this mess.

157
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,872
I admit it! Don’t rub it in!

158
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:13,372
I feel bad already.

159
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:14,972
What’s the plan?

160
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:18,239
I’m not sure if he will like it.

161
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:21,206
But I’m giving it my all.

162
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:23,139
Are you game?

163
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:26,806
Game!

164
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:29,439
For your boy!

165
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,972
Friend request?

166
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:37,739
Seriously?

167
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:40,606
Hi Cai.

168
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:43,739
I already blocked Gav.
What does she want now?

169
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:48,306
Sorry about the last time.

170
00:09:48,306 --> 00:09:51,172
It’s better if you let Gav explain.

171
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:54,672
Please give him a chance.

172
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:57,339
He has a big surprise for you.

173
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,072
Is this another game?

174
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:01,272
Should I reply back?

175
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:07,239
What is that idiot up to?

176
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:18,139
I will gladly look like a fool for you.

177
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,639
What is he up to?

178
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:22,206
Cai, please check my stories.

179
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:34,206
Baby

180
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:37,839
I'm sorry

181
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,739
I’m just here

182
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:45,039
even if

183
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,039
you push me

184
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:56,206
away

185
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,872
I

186
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:01,306
like

187
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:05,539
you

188
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:10,572
I really do

189
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:21,106
This song is for you

190
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:35,239
What do I have to do

191
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:39,272
with my feelings

192
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:42,872
You had me at one look

193
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:46,139
with just one breath

194
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,806
I thought it’s just a game,

195
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:53,472
but I wasn’t able to help it

196
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:57,706
Just one look at you

197
00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:03,206
and my heart skipped a beat

198
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:06,806
Just how far

199
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:09,972
will each smile take

200
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,839
how we feel

201
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:17,306
for one another

202
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:21,006
Just how far

203
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,706
will our hearts go

204
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:31,306
For a love that began

205
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:35,272
with just a game

206
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:48,439
Please answer my call.

207
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,806
What’s this?

208
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:05,506
Why did you send me flowers?

209
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:07,606
Are you just annoying me?

210
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:10,672
I told I would court you. That’s why.

211
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:14,906
Did you really make that song for me?

212
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:17,572
Yes. You’re the first person to hear it.

213
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:19,972
I wrote it especially for you, baby.

214
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:23,006
I am serious about you, and I’m not playing you.

215
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:24,472
Whatever.

216
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:26,406
It’s true.

217
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,839
I wrote it as a poem.

218
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,072
Then Pearl added the music
so you could appreciate it more.

219
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:33,906
Pearl again.

220
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,406
She’s really sorry for what she did.

221
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:39,472
She even posted about it.

222
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,906
Who is Pearl in your life?

223
00:13:42,272 --> 00:13:44,039
She’s my best friend.

224
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:47,872
OK I’ll tell you the whole story.

225
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:52,572
She’s my ex-girlfriend.

226
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:55,706
We were terrible as lovers.

227
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:00,239
Surprisingly, we really clicked as friends.

228
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,606
But she still calls me babe.

229
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:04,906
Is that possible?

230
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:06,806
Of course.

231
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:09,539
Ask Pearl. It’s the first time I wrote a song for anyone.

232
00:14:10,106 --> 00:14:11,306
So don’t be jealous.

233
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:13,039
In your dreams.

234
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,039
You’re being grumpy again.

235
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,472
You can be so annoying sometimes.

236
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,506
But I’m sorry too.

237
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:22,872
I overreacted.

238
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:26,739
These past few days have been rough.

239
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:29,106
I guess I just exploded.

240
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:31,506
I know I disappointed you,

241
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,572
but I’m still your guy.

242
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,272
I’m always here to listen to you.

243
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:42,072
Do you believe me?

244
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:43,072
OK.

245
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:44,139
Just OK?

246
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:46,239
What else do you want me to say?

247
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:48,072
I like you too?

248
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:49,539
Idiot.

249
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:55,606
I know what you’re going through.

250
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:59,272
Last year was the lowest point in my life.

251
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:03,639
My grandma was hospitalized for several months.

252
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,006
I thought I couldn’t live without her.

253
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:12,006
Look at me now. I’m singing again.

254
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:13,872
Hey.

255
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:17,206
It’s my dad…

256
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:20,772
He was recently intubated.

257
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:25,872
We don’t know if he will recover.

258
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,306
But honestly,

259
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:32,339
I’m afraid of what might happen.

260
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,739
I don’t think I’m ready.

261
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:40,439
No one is ready for something like that, Cairo.

262
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:46,039
We just have to trust your dad’s doctors.

263
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:50,806
I’ll pray with you for his quick recovery.

264
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:53,572
Thanks.

265
00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:09,806
Happy to have made a friend today.

266
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,072
Just a friend?

267
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:18,706
You assume much.

268
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:20,572
I wasn’t referring to you.

269
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:26,972
You know I’m cuter!

270
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:38,139
Hi baby!

271
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,272
Guess where I am?

272
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:40,872
You’re driving?

273
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:43,406
On my way there.

274
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:45,206
Yeah right.

275
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:46,539
Seriously.

276
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:50,139
ETA: 1 hour 15 minutes, according to Waze.

277
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:53,306
It used to take me 2 hours to get to Quezon City.

278
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,372
No traffic nowadays.

279
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:57,406
Stop messing with me.

280
00:16:57,872 --> 00:17:01,272
You can’t travel far because of the lockdown.

281
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:04,606
You will be stopped at the checkpoint.

282
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:08,406
I have my ways, baby.

283
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:14,206
Pearl’s dad has a food delivery business.

284
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:15,706
Their drivers have permits.

285
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:18,272
They deliver to as far as Quezon City.

286
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:20,139
You’re one of their drivers?

287
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,206
No.

288
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:23,706
But one of them got sick.

289
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:25,839
I’m substituting for him.

290
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:28,806
- We’re finally meeting, baby!
- Are you serious?

291
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:29,872
Yes!

292
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:31,239
Take a shower, OK?

293
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,239
Idiot.

294
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:34,372
Why would I take a shower?

295
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:37,006
You know why.

296
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:39,139
I even scrubbed my body for you.

297
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:42,372
Stop talking nonsense.

298
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:44,806
Aren’t you excited to meet me?

299
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:46,106
Huh?

300
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,772
I know you heard me.

301
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:50,472
Is this a prank?

302
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:53,372
I’m not falling for it!

303
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,806
Go talk to someone else.

304
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:59,006
Hey wait, baby-

305
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:10,806
Oh my God. I’m so excited for you guys!

306
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:11,806
Huh?

307
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:14,539
Gav is on his way there. You didn’t know?

308
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:15,639
He wasn’t kidding?

309
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:22,006
Of course! I had to convince my dad to let Gav
be the substitute driver.

310
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:26,672
I even got him a temporary permit.
Wait. What time is it?

311
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,039
I think he’ll be there in 20 minutes.

312
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,006
- Go out and meet him!
- Seriously?

313
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,072
He went to all this effort to see you.

314
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,839
Go down and meet him when he arrives!

315
00:18:38,072 --> 00:18:39,372
Wait.

316
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:41,206
Have you taken a bath?

317
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,839
Not yet.

318
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,806
- What? He hates stinky smells!
- Shut up.

319
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:47,806
Go take a bath!

320
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:49,806
Go, go, go!

321
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:51,539
Go, baby boy!

322
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:54,606
Wait, what’s happening?

323
00:18:55,572 --> 00:18:56,572
Go!

324
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,306
Take a bath now!

325
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:09,272
I can’t stop

326
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:11,372
I can’t resist

327
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,339
Wondering what this is about

328
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:15,439
Are you excited?

329
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,072
Not really.

330
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:20,006
Yeah, right.

331
00:19:22,106 --> 00:19:24,606
Oh my God. I think he’s there.

332
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:27,139
Go downstairs now!

333
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:35,272
What?

334
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:38,106
You have no shirt on!

335
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:39,539
Wait!

336
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,472
Really? You’re not excited?

337
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:54,572
Are you together?

338
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:58,606
No. I texted him but he’s not answering.

339
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:01,472
I’m sure he’s close by. He left hours ago.

340
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:04,939
Just look for a brown Innova.

341
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,639
Brown Innova.

342
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:11,439
I’m dying of excitement!

343
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,872
I think he’s here.

344
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:18,972
Oh my God! That’s him!

345
00:20:18,972 --> 00:20:19,972
Is that him?

346
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:27,172
Don’t ever think

347
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:31,239
I fall in love easy

348
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:38,306
My heart is picky too

349
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:43,339
Your voice is magic

350
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:46,339
And I’m enchanted

351
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:48,639
I concede

352
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:50,672
You’ve won me over

353
00:20:50,672 --> 00:20:53,672
My heart is yours
