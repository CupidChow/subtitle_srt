1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,006
He really deactivated his account.

2
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,206
What’s going on?

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,773
This, too?

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,840
I hope he’s okay.

5
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:46,806
Good morning, baby.

6
00:00:46,806 --> 00:00:48,806
Please take your breakfast.

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,473
I know you’re going through a hard time.

8
00:00:52,473 --> 00:00:54,673
I really wish I could be beside you right now.

9
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:58,806
Please know that I’m just here
if you need someone to talk to.

10
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:00,240
Hi baby.

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,440
I hope you’re doing well today and every day.

12
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:04,573
Let’s have lunch.

13
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:08,973
Just don’t eat only French fries.

14
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:12,240
And always eat on time. OK?

15
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Hi, baby.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,373
Good night. Sweet dreams.

17
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:23,740
You’ll have sweet dreams for sure
if you think of me before going to bed.

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,340
But don’t think about me too much.

19
00:01:26,373 --> 00:01:28,873
You’ll keep us both awake.

20
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:30,673
Good night.

21
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:32,506
Good morning, baby!

22
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:35,373
Here’s your daily reminder to smile
and always be strong.

23
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:36,373
Like this.

24
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:45,506
Should I call him?

25
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,806
Am I ready to talk to him?

26
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:56,406
Cai is still not answering your calls?

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,140
I hope he’s okay.

28
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,373
I hope so too. I’m really worried.

29
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:02,973
Let’s give him time to grieve.

30
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:06,206
You know what he’s going through.

31
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:10,406
Did you send them flowers?

32
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:11,406
Of course.

33
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,706
Your stalking skills came in handy.

34
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:15,806
We were able to confirm what happened.

35
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:17,173
You know me.

36
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:20,140
It helped that his brother’s posts are all public.

37
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,006
London is really cute, by the way.

38
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:24,540
He’s got nice legs.

39
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:26,440
So you were stalking him.

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,206
It’s just an observation.

41
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:29,606
An observation?

42
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,240
How many photos did you swipe through,
in order to conclude he’s got nice legs?

43
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,473
I wanted to distract myself, OK?

44
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,706
I don’t want to be depressed.

45
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:38,706
I know.

46
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:42,273
It’s sad that they couldn’t even hold a wake for his dad.

47
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:44,673
I can’t imagine how devasted he must be.

48
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:49,040
They couldn’t see him when he got sick.

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,840
They never had the chance to say goodbye.

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,973
It’s important to give your loved one a proper burial.

51
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:58,040
It gives you some closure.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,440
Baby boy is strong.

53
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,706
Let's just give him space.

54
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:06,173
I’m sure he’ll call you once he feels better.

55
00:03:06,173 --> 00:03:09,173
It’s frustrating that I can’t do anything.

56
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:13,140
I really want to be there for him and hug him.

57
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:15,673
If you only saw how he wept…

58
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,640
That’s why you also need to be strong for him.

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,873
I’m this close to breaking the law.

60
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:22,973
I really must see him.

61
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,106
Don’t be stupid.

62
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:27,940
You’ll be arrested by the police before you even reach him.

63
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,340
You will just add to his worries.

64
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,540
I need to know he’s OK, then I’ll be OK too.

65
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:58,873
I made a wish

66
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:00,506
to the stars

67
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,573
hoping you’ll be here soon

68
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:08,373
and we’ll be together

69
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:12,840
I always miss you

70
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,740
When you’re not around

71
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,540
I get restless without you

72
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:23,940
Each and every time

73
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:30,873
Where is the way to your heart

74
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:38,006
I’ll go to you no matter how far

75
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:45,406
And fulfill my promise 

76
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:52,406
That one day we’ll meet again

77
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:57,473
For this moment I wish

78
00:04:57,473 --> 00:05:03,806
You can be here with me

79
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:05,740
Every day I hope

80
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,606
That you’ll be here

81
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:10,606
To make me smile again

82
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:15,640
So I'll cry no more

83
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,940
I’ll make one more wish

84
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,940
Please hear me

85
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,806
As I pray

86
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:30,740
You’ll be with me someday

87
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:38,140
Where is the way to your heart

88
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:45,040
I’ll go to you no matter how far

89
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:52,640
And fulfill my promise

90
00:05:52,640 --> 00:06:00,173
That one day we’ll meet again

91
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:04,373
For this moment I wish

92
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:09,940
You can be here with me

93
00:06:10,873 --> 00:06:14,740
One day our hearts

94
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,173
Will be together again

95
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:37,773
Hi, baby. How are you?

96
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,773
Are you okay? How are you feeling?

97
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:42,773
You got some toothpaste there.

98
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:47,006
Sorry. I was going to brush my teeth when
I heard the phone ringing.

99
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,240
I knew it was you.

100
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,806
How are you?

101
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,206
I received the flowers you sent us.

102
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,873
Thank you.

103
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:03,440
I know flowers are not enough to ease your sorrow.

104
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,406
If you want to talk, I’m here to listen.

105
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:08,873
If not, I will still be here for you.

106
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:11,540
Even if you don’t want me here, I’ll be here.

107
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:14,640
You never run out of punchlines.

108
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,673
Never. Especially if it makes you smile.

109
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:21,673
Please tell Pearl, thank you.

110
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:22,673
I will.

111
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,173
She helped me find out what was
happening with you.

112
00:07:26,173 --> 00:07:27,940
Oh, so that’s why.

113
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:32,673
I really envy you guys.

114
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:34,206
Why?

115
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:37,273
I used to have a friend: Risa.

116
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:40,006
Like you, we were very close.

117
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:42,606
Where is she now?

118
00:07:44,273 --> 00:07:48,540
She confessed to me that she had feelings for me.

119
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,940
Anyone would fall for you, baby.

120
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,540
You’re so cute.

121
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,240
So what happened? Did you become a couple?

122
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,473
I wish we did.

123
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:59,773
Maybe all of this wouldn’t have happened.

124
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:04,006
I didn’t know for a long time that she was attracted to me.

125
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:08,206
When I told her that I didn’t feel the same way,

126
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:10,740
she was really hurt.

127
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:13,573
She demanded to know why.

128
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,006
Because who wouldn’t fall for her?

129
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:19,973
She’s beautiful, she’s nice, she’s intelligent.

130
00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:22,406
Anyone would fall for her.

131
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:25,540
If you don’t like her, you don’t like her.

132
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,406
You have nothing to explain.

133
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,206
She couldn’t accept it.

134
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:38,040
The rejection made her lose her self-worth.

135
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:41,040
So, I decided to tell her the truth…

136
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,406
that I’m not sure I’m into girls.

137
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:47,473
I thought she would understand.

138
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:48,973
Why, what happened?

139
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:51,273
She told my parents.

140
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:53,373
She spread it around school.

141
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:54,373
She spread it online.

142
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:57,740
"Beware this guy who leads you on.  He’s not into girls!"
- I wasn't ready.

143
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,406
I was still trying to figure out and understand myself.

144
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:03,406
But she took it away from me.

145
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:09,273
She took away the opportunity for me
to decide for myself.

146
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,806
I just really thought she was my friend.

147
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:18,840
She apologized later, after she realized her mistake.

148
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,673
She said she only did it because she was angry with me.

149
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:23,673
She’s crazy.

150
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:26,806
She had no right to do that to you.

151
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:30,673
Our situation is already difficult as it is.

152
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,773
I was really scared.

153
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,406
I didn’t know how I could face my parents,

154
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:40,340
even my brothers.

155
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,073
They’d find out that I wasn’t the Cairo they thought I was.

156
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:51,473
I knew I couldn’t take it if they rejected me.

157
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:54,540
So I ran away.

158
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:59,006
In the middle of this pandemic.

159
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:00,673
You know, Papa...

160
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:04,073
Papa’s immunity was already weak.

161
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:07,840
Aside from asthma, he also had a heart problem.

162
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:11,406
He was so worried about me.

163
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,673
Even if it could compromise his health,

164
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:21,006
he still went to look for me.

165
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:27,040
My brother said he went searching for me every day.

166
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,373
Until he started showing symptoms.

167
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:31,973
No, Cairo. It’s not your fault.

168
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:34,206
Stop blaming yourself, baby.

169
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:37,540
I only went home when I learned that Papa was sick.

170
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,806
We never got the chance to talk.

171
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,173
He was already in the hospital.

172
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,973
It’s my fault why this happened.

173
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:48,006
No, baby. It’s not your fault.

174
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:50,073
Don’t be so hard on yourself.

175
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:53,640
How could you have known what would happen?

176
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,273
Your fears are valid. Your feelings are valid.

177
00:10:57,273 --> 00:11:00,573
- But you mustn’t blame yourself.
- Cairo.

178
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
Brother?

179
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,406
Your friend is right, Cairo.

180
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:20,873
Stop blaming yourself.

181
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:23,206
It’s not your fault.

182
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,240
It would have never happened if not for me.

183
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,673
The things I said to you,

184
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
I didn’t mean them.

185
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,206
I was looking for someone to blame out of frustration.

186
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:52,373
I’m sorry for making you feel that way

187
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:56,206
I should have reached out to you.

188
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:59,673
I’m the eldest, I should know better.

189
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:04,840
It’s not your fault, okay?

190
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:18,640
Look at you. All grown up and still a cry baby.

191
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:20,906
You can stop crying now.

192
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,473
And who’s this?

193
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,573
I’m the guy who wants to date your brother.

194
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:35,673
Is it true?

195
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:38,306
Don’t listen to him.

196
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,473
So, you’re the one sending us food and flowers? Nice.

197
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:44,606
Do you approve, sir?

198
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:47,340
Just promise not to make him cry.

199
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,006
Look how ugly he cries.

200
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:53,940
Stop talking. You’re making me cry even more.

201
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:59,506
So what now, I already have your big brother's approval?

202
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:07,773
What? Don’t you dare make trouble again.

203
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:09,306
Wait please.

204
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:11,306
You’re already at it. I haven’t even said anything.

205
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:14,473
Why? Do you need an introduction before I scream at you?

206
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:16,073
Okay, okay.

207
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:18,740
I get it why you’re reacting that way.

208
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,406
But can you hear me out first?

209
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:22,406
And why should I listen to you?

210
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:24,573
Of all people, you should understand me.

211
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:27,373
We’re the same, we’re both Gav’s exes.

212
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,606
Hey, hey, hey!

213
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,840
We’re not same.

214
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,006
I’ve moved on long ago.

215
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:35,906
I don’t fancy Gav anymore.

216
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:38,306
Unlike you,

217
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:39,873
still bitter up to now.

218
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:42,273
That’s why I want to talk to you.

219
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:45,973
I’m here to apologize.
I realized that what I did was wrong.

220
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:49,740
It’s so wrong!
It was an asshole move to do such a thing.

221
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,340
You deserve a big virtual slap on the face!

222
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,106
OK, fine. I admit I was an asshole.

223
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:59,140
That’s why I want to apologize to them.

224
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,373
This quarantine is really affecting my mental health.

225
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:05,906
Wait, Terrence.

226
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:09,173
I know this crisis is affecting everyone’s mental health.

227
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:11,806
But if you did something stupid,

228
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:14,173
don’t use mental health as an excuse.

229
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:15,573
Own up to your mistakes,

230
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:18,073
make up for it and don’t do it again.

231
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:20,873
Now if you’re really sincere in asking for forgiveness,

232
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:22,840
now is not the right time.

233
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,306
They’re still pissed at you!

234
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,240
Sorry. You’re right.

235
00:14:29,006 --> 00:14:30,406
I’m an idiot.

236
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,406
I just need someone to talk to.

237
00:14:39,273 --> 00:14:42,340
Pearl…  I’m really sad.

238
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,940
It’s normal to be sad.

239
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,173
It’s okay to admit it.

240
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:52,206
Why not use this time to reflect on your actions?

241
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:54,440
You’re not a bad person.

242
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
OK, sometimes you’re an asshole.

243
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
But I hope…

244
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:01,440
I really hope you get over your sadness.

245
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,273
Thank you, Pearl.

246
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,506
- Hi, Ma.
- Hi, son.

247
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:13,473
Is your brother there?

248
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,973
What about Paris?

249
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,906
He went to the car to get something.

250
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:19,906
Paris is already asleep.

251
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:20,906
OK.

252
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,240
Have you had dinner?

253
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
Yes, Ma.

254
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:27,006
OK.

255
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,473
When are you coming home, Ma?

256
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:31,040
In a few days,

257
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,640
when it’s safe for me to come home.

258
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,606
Do you have symptoms, Ma?

259
00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:38,606
You don’t have to worry about anything.

260
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:42,340
I was exposed to people when...

261
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,706
I went to get your Papa’s urn.

262
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,840
I just want to be safe.

263
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:52,473
OK, bye.

264
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:54,106
Ma, wait.

265
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:55,106
Yes?

266
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Ma...

267
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,306
I’m sorry.

268
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:02,306
Why are you apologizing?

269
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,906
Because I’m not the son you think I was.

270
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:08,006
I’m sorry. I’m…

271
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:15,806
Sorry, I’m gay.

272
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:19,506
Cairo...

273
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:23,573
Don’t be sorry.

274
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,373
You don’t apologize

275
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:30,406
for being who you are.

276
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:34,506
If anyone needs to say sorry,

277
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:36,973
it’s me.

278
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:39,906
Son,

279
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:44,806
there’s nothing wrong with you.

280
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:49,940
I didn’t do enough.

281
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:53,340
You know, I knew all along.

282
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:56,706
But,

283
00:17:57,506 --> 00:18:00,440
I didn’t make an effort to

284
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,306
gain your trust

285
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,206
so you could tell me...

286
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,140
tell us anything.

287
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:15,673
Somehow I failed you.

288
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Because,

289
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:23,006
I wasn’t able to show you

290
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:33,440
that we’re on your side.

291
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,606
That you’re safe with us,

292
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,206
with me and your Papa.

293
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:50,206
I’m really sorry, son.

294
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:59,706
I love you so much, son.

295
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:04,306
Ma, thank you. I love you so much.

296
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:20,006
What are you doing?

297
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:22,340
You’re not taking this seriously.

298
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,540
Sorry, Pearl. I’m getting hungry.

299
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,706
We’ve been meditating for only 10  minutes.

300
00:21:27,706 --> 00:21:30,706
We look stupid. Why are we on video chat
if we’re just closing our eyes?

301
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,973
Come on. It’s what we need to get rid of stress.

302
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:38,973
I think I was dreaming.

303
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:40,506
It’s so weird.

304
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:41,273
Why?

305
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:43,473
There was this old man.

306
00:21:43,473 --> 00:21:49,873
He asked me to choose between two things
to survive the pandemic:

307
00:21:50,606 --> 00:21:52,640
the actor Alden Richards

308
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,140
or face masks.

309
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,140
What did you choose?

310
00:21:57,773 --> 00:22:00,240
Alden, of course.

311
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Seriously?

312
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:04,440
Yes! For sure Alden would stock up on face masks.

313
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,140
Would a face mask be able to give me an Alden?

314
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:08,173
No.

315
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:10,040
So you’re really a fan of Alden?

316
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,473
Dimples are my weakness.

317
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:15,273
Right, Gav?

318
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:17,540
That’s how he fooled me.

319
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,540
Shut up.

320
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:20,373
You might say something wrong again.

321
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,273
Well, if you don’t want to meditate, then I’ll do it alone.

322
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:25,640
Bye.

323
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:36,606
Baby.

324
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,373
you’re eating junk food again.

325
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:39,373
So what?

326
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:42,473
It looks like you’re drinking grass, but I don’t mind.

327
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:43,473
This is not grass.

328
00:22:44,106 --> 00:22:45,106
It’s delicious.

329
00:22:45,106 --> 00:22:47,373
Then just enjoy it.

330
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:50,240
Leave my chips alone.

331
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:52,006
I’m tired of crying.

332
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,306
Is that the reason why you stopped crying?

333
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:59,973
I thought I was the one making you happy.

334
00:22:59,973 --> 00:23:03,006
I thought, my smile was making you smile.

335
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,006
You’re right…

336
00:23:05,273 --> 00:23:09,473
these chips make me happy.

337
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,706
Sure, I’ll let it go for now.

338
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,773
Baby, what’s the matter?

339
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,373
It’s Papa…

340
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:30,540
he sent me an email.

341
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
What?

342
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:33,540
His ghost?

343
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
Stupid.

344
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,540
It’s a scheduled email.

345
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Oh, I thought…

346
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
What does it say?

347
00:23:42,773 --> 00:23:43,773
"Dearest Cairo,

348
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:48,340
I want to tell these things to you personally
when I get well.

349
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,006
But just in case something bad happens to me,

350
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:55,173
I hope you get this email.

351
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,440
You’re probably hurting from everything that happened,

352
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,906
and afraid to approach me and your mama.

353
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:06,006
If I were in your position, I’d probably feel the same way.

354
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:11,340
I understand that you had to go away and
be alone for a while.

355
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,440
But, of course,

356
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,106
I worried to no end. I had to look for you.

357
00:24:19,106 --> 00:24:24,106
It saddens me every time you texted me
at the hospital asking for forgiveness.

358
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:29,340
I already told you that it’s not your fault.

359
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,006
Maybe, you really need to hear me forgive you.

360
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,806
OK, I forgive you, Cairo.

361
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:40,440
I hope you forgive yourself, too.

362
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:44,206
Take care of your Mama for me.

363
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:49,773
Don’t forget to bring her favorite camellias
on our anniversary.

364
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,506
I want you and your brothers to love each other.

365
00:24:54,106 --> 00:25:00,740
And always remember, that I love you very much,
no matter what.

366
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:03,040
Love, Papa."

367
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:05,706
Crap.

368
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,173
I said I wasn’t going to cry anymore.

369
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,306
It’s okay to cry, baby.

370
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:14,940
Stop that, baby.

371
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,406
You’re starting to look yummier.

372
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:18,406
You’re crazy.

373
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,773
Where are you going?

374
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:25,906
I’ll just wash my face. Wait.

375
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,340
Baby.

376
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,506
According to the news, they might lift the lockdown soon.

377
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,940
I hope it’s true. We can finally meet!

378
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,340
Baby.

379
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:41,906
Baby.

380
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:44,873
What’s taking you so long? I miss you already.

381
00:25:45,106 --> 00:25:46,573
Baby!

382
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:47,573
Baby!

383
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:50,073
Is that better?

384
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,606
Yes. You’re still cute.

385
00:25:52,606 --> 00:25:53,606
You talk too much

386
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:55,331
Let's play a game?

387
00:25:55,978 --> 00:25:56,978
Game.

388
00:26:02,573 --> 00:26:04,373
Did you change your username? I can't see it. 

389
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:07,440
Oh yeah. I have a new account.

390
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
What's your username?

391
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:10,606
GavsBaby.

392
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:20,540
Gav's...Baby?

393
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:24,506
You're really my baby now?

394
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:26,573
And I'm also your baby?
