00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,533
Hi, Gav.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,600
How are you?

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,600
What’s up?

4
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:09,666
Nothing.

5
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:12,066
I just have no one to talk to. 

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,200
It seems everyone is busy.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,233
Is this OK?

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,900
I understand.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,900
Sorry, I thought…

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,466
Anyways, bye—

11
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:27,366
Wait.

12
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:29,100
Terrence, wait.

13
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:39,533
Are you OK?

14
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:41,500
I guess. 

15
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:44,000
Not as OK as I used to be.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,466
Like most people nowadays. 

17
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,233
I’m just looking for someone to talk to. 

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Is it OK?

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,300
OK.

20
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:05,866
Gav,

21
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,233
thank you.

22
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:08,900
And sorry again.

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,500
You already said sorry.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
We’re OK now.

25
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:16,166
Besides, we’ve been friends before
any of this happened.

26
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,533
- Thank you, Gav.
- Stop it.

27
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,500
Don’t make this weird. 

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,133
So what’s up?

29
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:24,100
Is anything troubling you?

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,566
What do you want to talk about?

31
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:27,700
Nothing, really. 

32
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,400
I just wanted to chat,

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,400
for my own sanity. 

34
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:33,600
You know how it is here. 

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,933
My parents and I don’t really talk.

36
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:39,033
All they care about is business. 

37
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:42,400
And I don’t see my siblings often.

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,033
At least you have someone there with you.

39
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:48,033
Sorry. I’m so insensitive. Sorry.

40
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:49,933
Stop saying sorry.

41
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:54,533
So what made you write that comment
on Pearl’s post? You were furious.

42
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:55,900
Furious?

43
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, it was in all caps.

44
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:00,766
It’s nothing.

45
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:01,766
Whatever it is,

46
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:04,533
I’m sure you can talk about it
with Cai and Pearl.

47
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,466
Unless…

48
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,700
it’s about Cai?

49
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,033
Yeah.

50
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:14,966
I wanted to talk to Pearl but
she’s busy with her new career.

51
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,766
And her love life.

52
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,500
I’m all alone here in the house.

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,000
I’m just here if you want to talk about it.

54
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:26,866
But I’d understand if you can’t.

55
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:35,300
Cairo and his family are leaving.

56
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,166
They’re moving to Bukidnon.

57
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,133
But you’ve talked about it?

58
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Yes.

59
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:45,900
I told him I’ll move there as well. 

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,900
Nothing has to change. 

61
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,733
That’s great.

62
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:51,800
I’m sure about my feelings for Cairo.

63
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,000
I love him. 

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But-

65
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:56,733
But?

66
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,733
I can’t help but worry.

67
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,933
I still have fears.

68
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:14,433
There’s this smartass.
He will be his neighbor in Bukidnon. 

69
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,100
I trust my baby.

70
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,900
But that smartass, know-it-all punk?

71
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,700
- I don’t trust him at all.
- Wait.

72
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,700
You’re  jealous?

73
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,033
You weren’t like this before.

74
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:31,133
I guess this crisis is affecting everyone.

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,933
Probably.

76
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,066
A piece of unsolicited advice

77
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:38,566
from someone who ruined all of 
his relationships…

78
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:42,800
I think it will help if you 
communicate your feelings to Cai.

79
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,033
But I don’t want him to think that 
I don’t trust him. 

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,633
Moving away soon.

81
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:04,166
Awww. You’re really leaving?

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,933
Why?

83
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,166
You like my food?

84
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,166
Yes, baby.

85
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:30,066
I love watching you eat.

86
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:33,166
You know baby, packing is so stressful.

87
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,166
Look.

88
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,733
I can’t seem to get anything done.

89
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,733
Why didn’t you eat dinner with your brothers?

90
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,666
You’re on speaking terms, right?

91
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:46,200
But who will eat with you?

92
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,766
Look at you, baby.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,833
You really know how to charm me.

94
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,266
Idiot.

95
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,933
I’m not trying to charm you. 

96
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Wait.

97
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,633
Are you crying?

98
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,666
No. 

99
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:08,633
I’m just touched by what you said.

100
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,633
This is your fault.

101
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,133
Baby…

102
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,400
Are you sad, baby? 

103
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,133
Wait…

104
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,533
Don’t get used to this. 

105
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:45,733
I think you need a hug.

106
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:47,533
Here.

107
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,866
Thank you, baby.

108
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,666
There.

109
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:57,233
I hugged you back.

110
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,400
Are you OK?

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,933
I remembered my grandma

112
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,300
while I was cooking.

113
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:14,066
I just realized

114
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:16,400
how quiet the house is. 

115
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:21,266
This lockdown is taking too long. 

116
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:28,166
I’m just happy to hear that you 
like eating with me.

117
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,600
It’s the least I can do.

118
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,066
I don’t have a way with words, baby.

119
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:36,433
I don’t know how to make you smile,

120
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,700
the way you make me smile.

121
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,200
It’s easy to make me smile, baby.

122
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,233
Here we go.

123
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,633
I haven’t said anything yet.

124
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,933
OK.

125
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,233
Tell me.

126
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:53,700
It’s easy to make me smile, baby…

127
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:57,233
Come take a bath with me.

128
00:06:57,233 --> 00:07:00,366
I thought so.

129
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,300
You’re so annoying.

130
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:08,933
Seriously, baby…

131
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:12,233
I hope this pandemic ends soon.

132
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:19,233
There are rumors that another 
lockdown might be imposed here 

133
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,133
because of positive cases.

134
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:24,300
Baby, please be careful.

135
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,333
I don’t go out, baby.

136
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:30,400
Besides, those are just rumors.

137
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Just be careful, OK?

138
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:33,900
Yes, baby. 

139
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,500
I’m not leaving the house.

140
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:42,033
I want to be safe when I take you 
to the airport.

141
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:45,366
You’re taking me to the airport?

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,933
Of course.

143
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:50,666
It’s a promise.

144
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:52,666
Great.

145
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,466
I’ll get to introduce my fan to Mama.

146
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:57,466
Your fan?

147
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,133
Don’t ask.

148
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,566
You’ll find out soon.

149
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,333
Baby, let’s go.

150
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:06,566
Baby.

151
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:10,233
Baby, come join me.

152
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,233
Baby!

153
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,700
Please…

154
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,600
Baby! 

155
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,900
Baby, come on!

156
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,633
Baby!

157
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,566
Join me!

158
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:37,233
- Just fold the collar down.
- What’s the next step?

159
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:40,766
Then fold the sleeve in the middle.

160
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:41,566
Let me see, baby.

161
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,566
Is this correct?

162
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:43,333
That’s it.

163
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,333
Fold it in three sections.

164
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,766
- It’ll give you more space.
- One. Two. Three.

165
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:50,400
- There.
- OK?

166
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,000
Bye bye.

167
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,700
Ssob, I just came from the city hall.

168
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,700
According to them,

169
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,233
it’s important to secure travel passes.

170
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,366
You’ll also need medical certificates. 

171
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:14,533
You’re also required to undergo a swab test.

172
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,533
Is that so?

173
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:18,466
OK I’ll tell Mama.

174
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:22,400
And ssob, upon arrival here,

175
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,700
you’ll have to stay at a quarantine 
facility for 14 days.

176
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,600
I’ve seen some photos on my timeline.

177
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,933
It’s not bad.

178
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:33,300
It’s not a five-star-hotel.

179
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,233
But it’s decent.

180
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,433
Even better than those in Manila…

181
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:38,966
I’ll send you the link later.

182
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:39,966
Sure.

183
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,200
You don’t seem excited, ssob?

184
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,800
I’m really excited.

185
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,566
How can I be? 

186
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:49,433
It’s just too complicated.

187
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:52,800
Honestly, I’m not ready to leave yet.

188
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Understandable.

189
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,166
You’re leaving so many things behind.

190
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:01,366
Maybe you’re worried about 
leaving someone behind?

191
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:04,433
Yes. 

192
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Gav. 

193
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:11,300
We’ve just gotten really close,

194
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,500
and now we have to be apart.

195
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:14,800
If Gav wasn’t in the equation, 

196
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,566
it would be easier for me to 
accept Mama’s decision.

197
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:20,200
- Are you a new couple?
- Yes,

198
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,066
but it feels like we’ve known each other for so long.

199
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,100
And you just met online?

200
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Yes.

201
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,333
Why do I feel like you’re judging me?

202
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,900
Of course not.

203
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,033
You know, I read some
surprising things about LDR.

204
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,033
Game?

205
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,633
Why are you reading up on LDR?

206
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,966
Are you in an LDR?

207
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:52,266
Wait. I have to go upstairs and get some clothes.

208
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:53,100
Sure.

209
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:57,366
I’m not in an LDR or any kind of relationship.

210
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,966
I read about it because of this pandemic.

211
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,300
We all feel like we’re in an LDR

212
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,233
because of social and physical distancing.

213
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:10,533
The mere fact that we can’t hug
or touch our loved ones,

214
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:12,866
- it feels like an LDR.
- I don’t think that's a fact.

215
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:14,433
It sounds more like an opinion.

216
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:15,433
True.

217
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:19,633
But according to a famous therapist,

218
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:22,266
we need at least 4 hugs a day to survive,

219
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:26,266
8 hugs for maintenance and
12 hugs for growth.

220
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:27,466
Thank you, Teacher Kim.

221
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:29,066
You’re crazy.

222
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:32,033
That’s the problem with 
intelligent people.

223
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:37,266
Don’t let statistics stop you from 
believing in love. 

224
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,800
Wait.

225
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
Baby, I can’t seem to contact you.

226
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,266
Baby, I’m just talking to Wes.

227
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:51,700
He's just giving me an update.

228
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,900
Can I say hi?

229
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,400
Wes, Gav wants to say hi.

230
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,066
Sure. No problem.

231
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,733
OK, thanks.

232
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,300
Hi, baby.

233
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,333
Wesley.

234
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,300
Hello. How’s it going?

235
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
It’s all good.

236
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,700
Am I intruding?

237
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,700
No.

238
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,966
I think I’m the one intruding here. 

239
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,466
I just told him all the 
requirements they’d need. 

240
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,000
We were just chatting.

241
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,433
Chatting?

242
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:23,166
So that’s why. 
I’ve been trying to call my baby.

243
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,266
I didn’t know you were just chatting.

244
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,900
Have you been calling me for long?

245
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,000
Sorry about that.

246
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We were having a good time.

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,633
It’s OK, baby.

248
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,500
I just miss you.

249
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,866
Idiot.

250
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,966
We were just talking this morning.

251
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:37,966
I know.

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,033
Hey, master.

253
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:45,066
Take all the time you need 
with the requirements.

254
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,633
They’re not in a hurry. 

255
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,633
Sure.

256
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,100
Anything you say.

257
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,866
If you want… 

258
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:53,666
Crap!

259
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,533
Are you OK?

260
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:02,200
Yeah. Good thing it’s cold. 

261
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,700
Ssob, I remember the time

262
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,433
your grandma asked you to serve coffee?

263
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:08,400
You broke a mug.
Your grandma was really pissed.

264
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,566
Idiot.

265
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:13,866
Don’t remind me.

266
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,566
What are you doing?

267
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:23,133
Sorry.

268
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,833
It feels sticky.

269
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,966
Baby!

270
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:36,100
You too?

271
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:40,600
It’s hot. It’s the rainy season, 

272
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,000
but for some reason it’s hot.

273
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:53,700
- Whatever.
- Baby...

274
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,533
Wesley, do you still have anything 
to discuss with my baby?

275
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,533
We’re done. 

276
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,466
Look at ssob. He’s so cute when he blushes.

277
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:06,866
My baby’s really cute.

278
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:09,266
I’m so lucky I’m the one he loves.

279
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,266
OK.

280
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,733
Good for you.

281
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,466
Master, can I ask a favor?

282
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:18,233
Can you stop calling my baby ssob?

283
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,366
Sorry.

284
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:21,766
I didn’t know it’s an issue. 

285
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,500
I’ve always called him that way

286
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,666
since we were kids.

287
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,433
Don’t read meanings into it. 

288
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,400
You talk too much.
Just answer yes or no.

289
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,766
Hey wait…

290
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:37,066
I think my mom is trying to call me.

291
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:38,900
Wes, thanks again. 

292
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:40,233
Baby, 

293
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:42,633
let’s just talk later. 

294
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,166
I’m ending the call. Bye.

295
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:57,600
Baby, what time are you calling?

296
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,366
I’m just waiting.

297
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,500
I have lots of tea to spill.

298
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,700
You’re not ready.

299
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,566
I’m so glad we’re chatting again.

300
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:16,700
Excuse me? Am I the only one 
who’s excited?

301
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,633
You can’t even pretend to be 
excited for me?

302
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:22,800
Is this about your love life, Pearl?

303
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,166
Forget it. You just killed my 
excitement.

304
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,000
You said you were going to call me.

305
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,000
I was busy.

306
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,100
Besides, we’re chatting now.

307
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,300
What’s happening?

308
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,600
Are you having an LQ?

309
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,866
Maybe you were having too much of a good time.

310
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:40,200
What’s your problem?

311
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,200
Wesley is just my friend, Gav.

312
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,566
Gav?

313
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:45,566
I’m just Gav now?

314
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,900
You like saying ssob better than baby?

315
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,566
This is pointless.
I’m not having any of this. 

316
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,933
Wait a minute. Who’s Wesley?

317
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:57,733
That smartass who looks like an alien.

318
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,066
Oh my God.

319
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:03,100
Do I smell jealousy in the air? 

320
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,566
Gavreel Mendoza Alarcon is jealous?

321
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,666
He’s been acting crazy.

322
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,300
There’s nothing to be jealous about.

323
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,833
He knows he’s my only baby. 

324
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,233
Did you hear that, Gav?

325
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,266
I know that, baby.

326
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,700
But I don’t trust that idiot.

327
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,200
It’s obvious that he likes you.

328
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
What?

329
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,766
No, no, no.

330
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:25,600
He has no feelings for me.
We’re just friends.

331
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,766
Wait, baby boy.

332
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:30,066
I haven’t met Wesley.

333
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,133
But sometimes you can be naïve.

334
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:37,266
It took you awhile to believe that 
Gav was crazy about you.

335
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,533
Well what do you want me to do?

336
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,166
- Stop talking to him?
- Up to you.

337
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:45,800
Why are you asking me?

338
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,766
I don’t know.

339
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:49,300
Unbelievable. Talk it over like 
adults please.

340
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:53,833
A-W-K

341
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:54,833
ward….

342
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,066
awkward.

343
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,333
Seriously?

344
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,966
I thought I was the star of the night.

345
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,233
I ended up being the referee again.

346
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:08,900
Stop it you drama queens!

347
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,666
Baby…

348
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:19,500
Yes, my baby?

349
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:22,966
Is it possible…

350
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,166
Wes has this idea…

351
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,933
Baby, what are you doing right now?

352
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:37,266
I’m thinking of you.

353
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,233
Yeah, right.

354
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:48,900
Baby, let’s not fight please.

355
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:53,533
We’re not fighting.

356
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:59,200
Promise, baby. I’ll behave.

357
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:05,566
When did you ever behave?

358
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,000
Ouch.

359
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,033
You’re so annoying.

360
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,533
But you love me.

361
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,900
Of course.

362
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:28,433
Some people can’t just mind their 
own business.

363
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:31,466
Come on, Gav. 

364
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:33,966
Stop picking on him.

365
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,100
Terrence?

366
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,000
Wow that sounds serious.

367
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,466
Is that for someone in particular?

368
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:43,966
How did you guess?

369
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:46,600
Joke. Half joke.

370
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,000
Well, my advice remains the same:

371
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,900
communicate better.

372
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,666
Good advice. Thank you!

373
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,233
Anytime.

374
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:58,933
Anytime?

375
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:03,100
So you two are close? Nice.

376
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,633
Baby…

377
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Don’t call me baby.

378
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:20,400
It doesn’t mean anything.

379
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,133
Really?

380
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,200
Then why are you calling?

381
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,000
We were just talking.

382
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,133
So you’re talking now?

383
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,366
For how long?

384
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:36,200
I thought we’ve already forgiven Terrence?

385
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,100
Yes. 

386
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,766
But it doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten 
what he did.

387
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:43,766
- Besides he never said sorry to me.
- What?

388
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,500
He said sorry to both of us.

389
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:47,900
He said sorry to you.

390
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,633
Then he asked me to take care of you

391
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,166
Where’s the apology there?

392
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,166
Baby.

393
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,166
We’ve talked about this.

394
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,666
You even told me you found his apology sincere.

395
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,066
His apology to you was sincere.

396
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,766
- Why are you defending him?
- I’m not defending him.

397
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,466
You’re defending your action.

398
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:10,800
Baby please.

399
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,933
- What?
- We just talked. OK? 

400
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,200
I didn’t have anyone to talk to.

401
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,533
Besides, you agreed to unblock him.

402
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:25,400
Well if you can talk to Terrence, 
then I can talk to Wes.

403
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,633
Is this about that smartass?

404
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:28,866
No.

405
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:31,166
But I don’t want to feel guilty when I’m talking to my friend.

406
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,700
He doesn’t just see you as a friend.

407
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,533
You don’t see how he looks at you.

408
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:38,066
But I do.

409
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:40,500
What about Terrence?

410
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,333
- He still likes you, doesn’t he?
- Why are we talking about Terrence again?

411
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,266
Why can’t you answer my question?

412
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:47,333
- Admit it, I’m right.
- Sure. You’re always right anyway.

413
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,333
Always.

414
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,200
Are we always going to be like this?

415
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,066
What do you mean?

416
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,700
Let’s talk this out. I’m going there.

417
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,433
No. 

418
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,766
It’s not safe.

419
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,933
There are cases in your area.

420
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,966
Don’t be irresponsible, Gav.

421
00:21:09,966 --> 00:21:11,866
I’m going there now.

422
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,100
Don’t be stubborn.

423
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,833
What happens when I move to Bukidnon?

424
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,366
Will our fights get worse?

425
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,800
What are you trying to say?

426
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:23,366
Nothing.

427
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:25,900
What? 

428
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:28,133
What?

429
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:30,133
You think it’s not going to work?

430
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:33,800
I didn’t say that.

431
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:35,433
But that’s what you’re trying to imply.

432
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,300
This is pointless then.

433
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,200
Are you breaking up with me?

434
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:48,633
You think I’m that shallow?

435
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:50,300
That I’ll easily give up?

436
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,100
Clearly, you don’t trust me at all.

437
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,233
I trust you. But not your friend. 
We’ve been over this already.

438
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,233
Precisely.

439
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,233
He’s my friend.

440
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,300
My friends are an extension of who I am. 

441
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,266
If you can’t accept them,
then how can you accept me?

442
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:06,466
So how can you tell me I can’t be 
friends with Terrence?

443
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:08,633
Don’t throw this back at me.

444
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:10,933
You know what he did to us.

445
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:13,166
But I’ve forgiven him.

446
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,533
Not all friends have to be perfect 
and a math genius like your friend.

447
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,000
Gav!

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,600
Why are you suddenly like this?

449
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,533
You’ve become so insecure.

450
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:26,966
Me? I forgot, I'm always wrong.

451
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:29,866
You're always right even if
I’m the one hurting. 

452
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:30,866
Admit it.

453
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,833
Sometimes you can be 
inconsiderate of my feelings.

454
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,366
Do you know what you’re saying?

455
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:43,066
-I forced myself out of my shell for you. 
-You’re always dismissing me.

456
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:46,100
-To accommodate you in life. 
- You don’t think my emotions are valid.

457
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,900
-Do you hear yourself? How am I  inconsiderate?
-And now you’re calling me insecure?

458
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,300
You know what-

459
00:22:58,066 --> 00:22:59,700
Forget it!
