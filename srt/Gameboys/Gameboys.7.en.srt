1
00:00:02,866 --> 00:00:05,833
Why are you quiet?

2
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,400
You don’t know?

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,033
Just answer yes or no.

4
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:16,600
Just say that you like him and I will stop pursuing him.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,500
But if you’re not into him,

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,400
then I will do everything to win him back,
even if he says he’s over me.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,666
- Terrence, stop it.
- No!

8
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,600
Let’s hear it from the man of the hour. 

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,433
Cairo, do you like Gav?

10
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,366
Yes or no?

11
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:42,033
I said stop it, Terrence.

12
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,300
Cairo’s answer is not important.

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,233
I’ve made a decision.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Bye.

15
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:02,066
What did Cai say? Did he confess his feelings? 
Oh my God.

16
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:03,066
No.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,566
What do you mean ‘no’?

18
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,466
I interrupted him before he could go on.

19
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:08,966
I worried what he was going to say. 

20
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:10,533
What if he said no? 

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,600
You know him. He’d rather die than admit anything. 

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,133
Oh. My. God.

23
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:19,100
Is this real? Gavreel Alarcon panicked? 

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,600
Where’s the witty and confident Gav that I know?

25
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:26,633
Admit it, you’re afraid of being rejected.

26
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,733
Of course. I got nervous. 

27
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,866
He doesn’t think like most of us.

28
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:35,766
I wish I was there to see your reaction.

29
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:38,200
This reminds me of when you were still my boyfriend.

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,166
You avoided kissing me. You had so many excuses.

31
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,366
- You said you respected me too much. 
- Can we not talk about that-

32
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:50,300
I said: screw that, you can respect me but
you can ravage me too.

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,300
I remember how panicked you looked.

34
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,333
Love you, babe. 

35
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:01,200
Isn’t it good that we can laugh at our past?

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,766
You’re the only one having a good laugh.

37
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:04,533
Sometimes I want to strangle you. 

38
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:09,566
Why didn’t you tell me that Terrence
was the reason why Cairo was upset with me?

39
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:13,366
Now it’s my fault again?

40
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,233
I may be a gossip but I don’t meddle in your affairs.

41
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,633
I wanted Cai to tell you himself. 

42
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,766
It’s not my place to tell you.

43
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:21,766
You have a point.

44
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:25,366
I don’t know what got into him. 

45
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:28,700
Well I’m glad that you cleared everything with Terrence.

46
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,266
That should stop that jerk from bugging you.

47
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:35,666
Don’t forget our date tomorrow at 8 pm.

48
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:37,233
OK.

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Ma.

50
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,066
Cairo, have you had lunch? 

51
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:52,666
Just fry some hotdogs or bacon. 
I’ll be cooking dinner tonight.

52
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,433
We already had lunch.

53
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,133
Ma, where are you? Paris is looking for you.

54
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,800
I’m at your auntie’s old condo. 

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Your papa will quarantine here when he comes home. 

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,700
That’s why I have to clean it.

57
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,300
Papa’s coming home?

58
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,966
Your papa is coming home. 

59
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:15,000
I believe he’s coming home soon. 

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,733
So you should clean the house too. 

61
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,666
Your Papa hates mess and clutter.

62
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:25,933
After his quarantine, he will come home straight away.

63
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,733
OK, Ma.

64
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:28,733
Bye.

65
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,600
"You are invited to Pearl's Virtual Party."

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,433
"The party starts tonight at 8 pm."

67
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,733
You started without us again.

68
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:17,866
How many drinks have you had?

69
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:20,333
Shut up. This is just my first.

70
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,933
Didn’t we agree to meet at 8 pm?

71
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,800
- Sorry, Pearl.
- You’re so late!

72
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,633
It’s really my baby’s fault. 

73
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,533
He didn’t want to stop our game until he won.

74
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,866
Maybe he just wanted to spend more time with me.

75
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:35,800
- Shut up. You just got lucky.
- There you go arguing again. Stop it.

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,933
Wait. Cai… did you cut your hair?

77
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:41,566
You really prepared for this.

78
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:44,466
- Very good.
- My baby’s so good looking, isn’t he?

79
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:47,133
It’s like this…

80
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,766
Mama said Papa might be coming home soon. 

81
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,666
I’m so happy for you!

82
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,566
He hates seeing us with messy hair. 

83
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:59,500
I  want to make him happy when he comes home.

84
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,133
Now we have a reason to celebrate!

85
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,933
That’s right! And your haircut looks so good on you.

86
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:07,933
Really? My brother did it for me.

87
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,533
Your brother London?

88
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,500
Wow, he really has so many talents.

89
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,733
How do you know he has many talents?

90
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:24,300
I mean, I don’t know. It’s just a guess.

91
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,100
So what’s the occasion, Pearl? 

92
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,733
Wait. It is your birthday? 

93
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:30,766
Gav, why didn’t you tell me?

94
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:33,633
Happy birthday to you…

95
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,500
No, no, no.

96
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:42,366
We’re celebrating your month-sary. Surprise!
Happy month-sary!

97
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:46,966
- Happy month-sary, baby. I think we’ll be forever.
- Stop talking nonsense.

98
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:49,866
You two are teasing me again.

99
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,233
- What’s really going on?
- Nothing.

100
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,933
I just miss dressing up.

101
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,833
And I’m tired of wearing my PJs.

102
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,500
I don’t see any difference.

103
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,266
I hate you.

104
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,266
I just want to celebrate.

105
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:05,933
After the stress that Terrence gave us, we deserve to get wasted!

106
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:10,933
You’re right. We proved that the likes
of Terrence can never break us apart. 

107
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:15,900
It means  our trust for each other is stronger than ever. 
Right, baby?

108
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:18,533
Fabulous! 

109
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:21,566
Trust is the foundation in any relationship. 

110
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:24,533
So are you ready to take it to the next level?

111
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:28,133
- I know I’m so ready for it. Anytime!
- There you go again, Pearl. 

112
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:32,266
Tonight, I just want to celebrate.

113
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,100
So, cheers!

114
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,866
Guys, I just want to dance.

115
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,433
I just want to dance this pandemic away. OK?

116
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:48,433
Huh?

117
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:49,766
Please!

118
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,600
I want you to know 

119
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,566
I’m ready to go

120
00:06:56,566 --> 00:07:00,100
I don’t care if we’re fast or slow 

121
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,900
I want you to know.

122
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,833
That I wanna know.

123
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:07,533
Is it a yes or is it a no?

124
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,400
I can feel

125
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Our love is real

126
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,933
Don’t be afraid to let it show 

127
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,566
I’m for real 

128
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:18,433
So what’s the deal 

129
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:22,500
You know I’ll never let you go 

130
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,466
You’re my kind of love 

131
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:30,833
From the heavens above 

132
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,866
- You’re my kind of love
- So Cai, let’s talk about the elephant in the room… 

133
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,200
We want to know answer, Cai.

134
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:39,966
Seriously?

135
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:41,500
I think you’re drunk, Pearl.

136
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,000
No, she’s not.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,200
You know what? 

138
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,633
- For a change, why don’t we talk about you, Pearl?
- Baby, please answer the question.

139
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:51,200
Me? What about me?

140
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,366
Yeah...

141
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,266
What happened with you and your ex-boyfriend?

142
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,700
What's his name again?

143
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,566
James! That stupid James! I hate him!

144
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:02,166
Your dress is really nice, Pearl. Is that new?

145
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,166
Why? What happened?

146
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,800
You know, Cai, we started out just like you two.

147
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,300
- And?
- I was so excited every time we talked. He seemed caring.

148
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,333
He was witty.

149
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,533
And very good looking, too.

150
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:21,800
Me, being an idiot, agreed to be his girlfriend
even if we hadn’t met in person.

151
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,233
I didn’t think it’s possible to fall in love online.

152
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,566
- Of course it’s possible!

153
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:30,766
- So why did you break up-
- Let’s do a Playfix watch party.

154
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:33,500
- There’s a movie I want to see.
- When we finally met in person...

155
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,033
I couldn’t understand it.

156
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,933
Why? What happened?

157
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,666
Nothing happened. Pearl, you’ve had too much to drink.

158
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,166
- You should rest.
- Shut up, Gav.

159
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:45,600
So anyway, I was so excited to meet him for the first time. 

160
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,533
I even bought a new dress, plus perfume and  makeup.

161
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:52,200
And when we met… I was like…

162
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,333
Wow, he’s gorgeous.

163
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,400
That’s great. So what’s the problem?

164
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,500
The problem is, I didn’t feel any magic.

165
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,066
We had no connection. He’s better inside a computer screen.

166
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:06,033
Why is that?

167
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:08,966
Who knows? We tried to make it work.

168
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,933
We had an LDR. 

169
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:14,066
I thought, maybe we just needed to get to know each other more.

170
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:17,066
But nothing happened.

171
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:22,566
And then I found out he was having an affair! The nerve! 

172
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,633
He should have told me from the beginning so I didn’t have to suffer. 

173
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:31,200
Maybe he’s not the one for you, Pearl.

174
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,966
Not all relationships end up badly.

175
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:36,266
I know this couple, they’re married now

176
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:39,300
Really? Who?

177
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,766
You don’t know them.

178
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:44,200
You’re inventing things.  

179
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,566
If you know them, chances are, I also know them. 

180
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:52,466
Relationships like that don’t work out. Trust me. 
Real talk, guys.

181
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:04,866
But…

182
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,933
You guys can prove me wrong. 

183
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:12,033
Just do your best.

184
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
I’m rooting for you, babes.

185
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,766
"69 real stories from people who met online."

186
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,100
What are you up to this time, Gav?

187
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:53,366
"Online dating success stories from real couples."

188
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:56,066
Does he actually read these?

189
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,133
Hey!

190
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,466
What’s that about?

191
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:06,533
I should just call him.

192
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,400
Crap. Why did you answer?

193
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,566
Of course, it’s my baby calling.

194
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,533
And I didn’t know if it’s an emergency.

195
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,366
Forget it. You just finish your bath.

196
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:32,366
Are you sure?

197
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,366
Sure of what?

198
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,066
Sure you don’t want to watch?

199
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,066
Idiot.

200
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,033
Come on, baby, let’s take a bath together.

201
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,866
I’ve already taken a bath.

202
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:45,766
It doesn’t seem like it.

203
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,633
Okay, not yet. But I’m not joining you.

204
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:52,433
- Next time then. So why are you calling?
- There’s no next time. 

205
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,633
Why did you send me those articles?

206
00:11:56,066 --> 00:12:00,366
Nothing. I saw them in my timeline. 
I thought you might want to read them.

207
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,066
- Do a little research.
- Whatever. 

208
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:05,533
I’m leaving.

209
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:06,533
Okay, baby.

210
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:21,900
I thought you’re leaving?

211
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:26,900
- Oh yeah. My net is lagging.
- Unless you want to stay? 

212
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,800
It’s okay. You can watch.

213
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,100
Shut up. Bye!

214
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,333
Did I really say all those things?

215
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,533
I’m this close to strangling you.

216
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:40,833
Don’t deny it, I’ve been waiting for you
the whole day to wake up.

217
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,433
If you weren’t late, I wouldn’t have gotten that drunk.

218
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:49,066
He asked a question, I answered.
It was my moment to shine.

219
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,300
What if you scared him off? 

220
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,900
Just when things are going good…

221
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,200
Are you sure of that?

222
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,866
You’re such a “potassium.”

223
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,333
Potassium?

224
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,066
It’s my word, meaning “assuming too much.”

225
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:07,466
You’re crazy.

226
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,700
Don’t you think I have a chance with him?

227
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,666
Of course you have a chance, if you ask me.

228
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:19,466
That’s more like it. Be a supportive and positive friend. 

229
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,466
But the question is…

230
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,800
Are you his priority?

231
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:28,433
Baby boy is going through a lot.

232
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:32,400
Cai is not a person you can rush.
I know it’s not your style. 

233
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:33,766
But all I’m saying is, 

234
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:39,266
patience is a virtue, and it will be all worth it.

235
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:42,133
You know what, I like you with a hangover. 

236
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,700
Finally you’re talking sense.

237
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,066
Finally you’re talking sense.

238
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:51,633
Shut up. I hate you.

239
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,866
I find it hard to believe.

240
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:08,866
What?

241
00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:11,333
They’re obviously attracted to one another. 

242
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:16,266
Then they get this one chance to sleep
together and nothing happens? 

243
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,566
They don’t even kiss?

244
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,600
Isn’t it better? It means their relationship is not based on sex.

245
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,466
It only happens in movies.

246
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:29,533
Baby, I’ll remember that. So when we’re finally together in one room…

247
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,166
Shut up.

248
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,200
But you know what…

249
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,866
If I get a chance like that… 

250
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:44,666
When I’m already beside you,

251
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,466
I think I just might cry.

252
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:49,533
You’re so dramatic. Why will you cry?

253
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:50,533
Think about it. 

254
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:53,400
Because of the pandemic,

255
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,466
we were separated from our friends and loved ones

256
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:03,166
We never know when the virus will strike us. 

257
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:10,933
That’s why, if I get the chance to be with you, I’m sure I will cry.

258
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:14,266
I’ll be so grateful if that happens.

259
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:19,433
I’ll just embrace you the whole night.

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,400
But watch out the next day. You’ll be exhausted for sure.

261
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:28,100
Jerk.

262
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,900
Let’s just watch the movie-

263
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:38,300
Wait. My mom is calling.

264
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:41,966
Ma…

265
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,733
Cairo, has your brother arrived?

266
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:47,333
I thought he went to the condo with you?

267
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:51,133
I told him to go home without me.
I’m not done here.

268
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:58,900
Tell London, when he comes to pick me up 
tomorrow, bring  Lysol and alcohol.

269
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,933
He’ll find them in the kitchen.

270
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:01,933
OK, Ma.

271
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,166
- OK. Thank you. Bye.
- Thank you, Ma.

272
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,566
Gav.

273
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:13,766
Sorry. It’s my mom. 
She’s at my aunt’s condo, cleaning.

274
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:16,933
When Papa recovers, he’ll isolate himself there. 

275
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,266
When is your Papa coming home?

276
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,033
Actually, I have no idea. 

277
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:27,566
Sorry, Gav. I have to call my brother.

278
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:29,700
Let’s finish the movie some other time.

279
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,833
Of course. I’m just here. Call me anytime.

280
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,400
OK. Thank you.

281
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,833
Bye.

282
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:44,500
Brother, where are you?

283
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,200
Mama has been looking for you.

284
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,100
I’m here at the parking lot.

285
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:50,733
Are you OK?

286
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,100
I heard some news from a nurse I know. 

287
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,466
Don’t tell mama. I’ll talk to her. 

288
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:01,333
Papa’s not doing well.

289
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,400
- Are we really not allowed to see him?
- Now you’re acting like you’re concerned.

290
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,666
- I didn’t know this would happen-
- We’re in this rotten situation because of your selfishness.

291
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,966
What were you thinking? Why did you do that?

292
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,300
I know it’s my fault why this is happening.

293
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,566
I blame myself every day. 

294
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:24,366
Yes, it’s my fault.

295
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:26,800
I shouldn’t have done that.

296
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,700
It should have been me. 

297
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,600
I know I made a mistake.

298
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:38,333
Believe me, I didn’t want this to happen to Papa.

299
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,966
I didn’t want him to get sick.

300
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:44,900
- I love him so much.
- I know. 

301
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,233
You’re probably his favorite.

302
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:53,233
That’s why even though it could compromise his health, 
he went looking for you. 

303
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:56,033
You didn’t have to run away. 

304
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,666
He’d understand.

305
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:02,900
Even Mama. Even Paris and I. 

306
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,033
We will accept you no matter what.

307
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:11,166
But it was stupid of you to do that.

308
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,033
I’m sorry.

309
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,533
I know it’s not fair to blame you for what happened to Papa. 

310
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:22,900
But we wouldn’t be in this situation if you only talked to us.

311
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,800
I’m really sorry. 

312
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,233
You already know how to drive. 

313
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,900
All you need is a license.

314
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:33,366
Dad.

315
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:38,233
- Why are you taking a selfie? That’s dangerous. Focus.
- Sorry.

316
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:39,233
Eyes on the road.

317
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,800
My dad and I loved toys.

318
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,266
He gave me this robot two years ago.

319
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,566
We also love music.

320
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,633
I wanted to have a vinyl so bad

321
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:55,400
so he bought one for me as a graduation gift
back in high school.

322
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,400
One random gift from dad.

323
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,100
He told me I might look cool
wearing it during my livestream.

324
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,833
I miss you dad. I hope you’re doing OK.

325
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,833
Hi, baby. Have you had dinner yet? 

326
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,233
You want to eat together?

327
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,233
Baby.

328
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,533
Baby, hey.

329
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,533
Is there a problem?

330
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,700
Why are you sad?

331
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,566
It’s nothing.

332
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,566
Really? 

333
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,466
You know, you can tell me. I’m here to listen.

334
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:32,833
Promise, baby.

335
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:39,100
Baby.

336
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,900
It’s like this…

337
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,000
Wait. 

338
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,233
Ma?

339
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:08,000
What’s the matter, Ma?

340
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,100
Cairo… 

341
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,400
it’s your Papa…

342
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,533
he’s gone.

343
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,700
Your Papa’s gone.

344
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:51,633
Cai…

345
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,533
Cairo…

346
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:56,333
Cairo, are you OK?

347
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,533
Cai...

348
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,033
Cai, don’t hang up.
