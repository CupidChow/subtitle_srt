1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,400
Game.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,300
OK. Your timer starts now.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,700
Category is movie.

4
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:08,933
English.

5
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:10,500
It has something to do with us?

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,300
Dumb and Dumber?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Crazy. Is that what you think of us?

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,300
Am I wrong?

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,600
How many words?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,233
Three words.

11
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:23,233
Time is running out.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,100
What’s that? Crazy?

13
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,700
Wait! I know!

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,700
Crazy Beautiful You!

15
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,433
Correct.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,700
I knew it!

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,700
My favorite KathNiel movie.

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,733
Cai, you’re next. Ready?

19
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,633
Timer starts now.

20
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,100
Category is song.

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,233
I Will Always Love You?

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,033
God Gave Me You?

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,533
Crazy In Love?

24
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:57,533
Wow.

25
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:01,033
You really can’t let a moment pass without flirting.

26
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:02,633
Of course.

27
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,433
Because flirting is a blessing.

28
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:05,933
True!

29
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:10,100
- I should know!
- My baby is waiting. Let’s go. Game.

30
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,533
It has something to do with you?

31
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:14,200
I Love You Goodbye?

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,400
Where Do Broken Hearts Go?

33
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,000
Bleeding Love?

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,100
Hey.

35
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,733
How does the song connect to him?

36
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:21,733
Oh nothing.

37
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:23,700
Just random songs on top of my head.

38
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:27,833
What's that?

39
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
This is hard.

40
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:34,200
I know! It’s so obvious.

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,633
Leaving On A Jet Plane!

42
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,900
Correct.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,633
You’re really good at this, Pearl.

44
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:42,633
Of course.

45
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,800
I don’t get it.

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,700
How does the song relate to you, baby?

47
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,600
He never said it relates to him.

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,933
He was just asking you to focus.

49
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,133
OK.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,300
Oh my God! I’m so excited for tomorrow!

51
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,000
Go to bed early, OK?

52
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,933
Sure, Madame.

53
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,733
Can’t wait!

54
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,733
You’re even more excited than us, Pearl.

55
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,500
Hi, baby.

56
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,000
I really love hearing you say that.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Whatever.

58
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,100
You know what I love more?

59
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,500
This!

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Yummy!

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,900
Baby, I’m so excited for tomorrow.

62
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,500
Finally, we’re meeting.

63
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,133
I can’t sleep.

64
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,133
I know.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,400
Are you as excited?

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
I’m okay.

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,100
Just okay?

68
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,133
But you planned everything.

69
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,300
Just making sure you’ll be there this time.

70
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,900
I bet you’re also excited to see me.

71
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,900
Whatever.

72
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:14,133
Anyways, when does your classes start?

73
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,133
Why?

74
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,900
Nothing.

75
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,900
Are you imagining it, too?

76
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,500
What?

77
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,700
You know, after I graduate, I’ll have a job.

78
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,433
After work, you’ll have dinner prepared for me.

79
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:33,400
Then you’ll ask me about my day.

80
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Idiot.

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,933
I won’t just stay at home.

82
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,600
Baby, calm down.

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,100
OK then I’ll stay at home.

84
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,933
And when you get home from work,
I’ll greet you with hugs and kisses.

85
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:47,033
Then I’ll give you a massage because I know how
tired you are.

86
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:48,233
Harder.

87
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:51,800
You’re crazy. Both of us should be working.

88
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,733
See, you’re also imagining it.

89
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,700
No. All I’m saying is, we can both do those things.

90
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,100
Agree.

91
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,733
We can both be working husbands.

92
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:07,033
And at home, we’re also caring and loving husbands.

93
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
You’re thinking too far ahead.

94
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,500
I was just asking when your classes start.

95
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,533
It’s how I am, baby.

96
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:16,533
Baby…

97
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:20,800
we can get married in Taiwan, where they have
marriage equality.

98
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,400
Wish it was true for all.

99
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,833
I’m really so excited for tomorrow.

100
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,233
My baby’s looking real good.

101
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,533
Yeah right.

102
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,533
It’s true.

103
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,500
It’s too early for you to get ready.

104
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,533
I’m going to the hospital first before meeting you.

105
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,400
I hate being late.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,233
Hey, Gav. Be careful, OK?

107
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,733
Yes, baby.

108
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,833
I’m not getting out of the car.

109
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,100
I’ll just deliver the meals for the frontliners.

110
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,400
Pearl will deliver the rest.

111
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
OK?

112
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,400
OK.

113
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,333
By the way, baby—

114
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,333
Gav?

115
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:48,500
Hello, Gav. What happened?

116
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:52,333
Baby, I lost connection. But I’m about to leave.

117
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,333
See you!

118
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,433
You’re taking a nap?

119
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,433
You still have things to do.

120
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:08,000
OK, baby. Get your beauty sleep.

121
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:13,933
Pearl?

122
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:15,833
Hey, baby boy!

123
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,100
Do you know what time it is?

124
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,900
We’ve been calling you.

125
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,533
Crap. I overslept.

126
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:29,000
Gav told me you were talking until 3 am.
Look what happened.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
Wait, where is he now?

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,900
He’s at the hospital. I’m on my way.

129
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,033
OK, I’ll be there.

130
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,500
Wait.

131
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Your hair’s a mess.

132
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,800
And your shirt is all wrinkled.

133
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,400
Wash your face first.

134
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,000
Crap, you’re right. Wait.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
OK.

136
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,300
I’m leaving, I promise.

137
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,633
It’s OK, baby.

138
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:53,033
You changed your shirt.

139
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:56,300
Relax, baby. I’m still waiting for the second
batch of food.

140
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,433
What I brought was not enough.

141
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:58,300
Really?

142
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,033
Gav, the place will close soon.

143
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:04,800
They’re only letting us in because
Papa knew the caretaker.

144
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
Don’t worry. I’ll talk to him.

145
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,700
Cairo, I’m going to the grocery store.

146
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,000
I’m bringing the car. I’ll be back soon.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,300
Crap.

148
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,600
Baby, why?

149
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,900
My brother took the car.

150
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,233
But I told him I was going to use it.

151
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,233
How annoying.

152
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,100
Do you want me to pick you up?

153
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,300
No. Aren’t you waiting for something?

154
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,933
It will be a hassle for you.

155
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,500
My brother should be back soon.

156
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,433
OK. If he takes too long, just let me know.

157
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,933
I’ll just fetch you.

158
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,900
OK.

159
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,400
Brother, where are you?

160
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,900
Didn’t I tell you I was going out?

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,633
I’m running an errand for Mama.

162
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:59,200
Where are you going?

163
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,500
Gav and I are finally meeting today!

164
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,700
Shucks sorry. I’m near the cashier now,
but the line is long.

165
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,700
What? You’re still not together?

166
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,100
I’m ready to leave.

167
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
But my bother hasn’t arrived yet.

168
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,100
I’ll see if I can book a Grab.

169
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,933
It’s OK, baby. Just let me fetch you.

170
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:25,733
I’ll feel bad if we miss the venue.

171
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,500
How sweet.

172
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,000
My baby is so sweet, right?

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,300
What’s sweet about it?

174
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,300
Because.

175
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,800
You want our first meeting to be special—

176
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Oh shit!

177
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:36,800
Gavreel?

178
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Gav, what’s happening?

179
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,100
Baby…

180
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Please don’t joke like that!

181
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Baby?

182
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Baby?

183
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
- Gav, I swear!
- Please.

184
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,700
I really love hearing you call me baby.

185
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,300
Gav, what the hell?

186
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
I hate this.

187
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,500
Everything is a joke with you. It’s not funny anymore.

188
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,633
Hey. It’s not a joke.

189
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:58,400
My tire suddenly gave out. That’s why I dropped
my phone.

190
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,533
See it for yourself.

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,733
There.

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,433
Do you see it?

193
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,900
Thank God, you’re OK.

194
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,600
You got us worried.

195
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,333
I had to pull over first. I’m sorry.

196
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,300
You’re always like that.

197
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,200
You’re making it more difficult for me.

198
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,800
Baby? What do you mean?

199
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,900
You think this is easy for me?

200
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,933
Baby? I don’t understand.

201
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,033
I’ll let you boys talk.

202
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:33,633
Bye.

203
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
What’s up?

204
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,800
Mama wants us to move to Bukidnon.

205
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,500
Why didn’t you tell me earlier, baby?

206
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,000
Isn’t it too soon?

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,500
I was planning to tell you when we see each other.

208
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,200
Is that final?

209
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,900
Won’t Mama change her mind?
When are you leaving?

210
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,800
As soon as we can book a flight.

211
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,433
Once we get a permit from the Bukidnon local office,

212
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:09,800
Mama wants us to move.

213
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,700
She feels safer there.

214
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,533
What about you, baby?

215
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,000
I hate it that I became close to you.

216
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,000
No.

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The truth is,

218
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,700
I’ve already fallen for you.

219
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,500
I’m excited about our plans.

220
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,700
I’m so used to having you around…

221
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,500
talking to you…

222
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,000
snapping at you every day.

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,033
Baby, you can still snap at me every day.

224
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:51,200
Nothing has to change, just let me take care of it.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,933
I know Bukidnon is far away. But I’ll save so
I can see you.

226
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:57,333
I can even move there if you want.

227
00:10:57,933 --> 00:10:58,933
No.

228
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,400
Your life is here.

229
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
I don’t want to be selfish.

230
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
What’s selfish about it?

231
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,200
It’s my decision.

232
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,900
You’re just saying it now. But what happens later?

233
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,800
I’m willing to take a gamble on you, baby.

234
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,700
Please gamble on me, too.

235
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,600
We’re not gambling.

236
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,033
We’re not playing a game.

237
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Gav!

238
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Gav!

239
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,000
What happened to him?

240
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,833
Is he still going?

241
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,533
Are we still meeting each other?

242
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,900
Pearl,

243
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,200
has Gav called you yet?

244
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,300
No. He probably broke his phone during the accident.

245
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,100
Stop worrying.

246
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,600
I wonder where he is now.

247
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,000
Even his car is not cooperating.

248
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,433
Maybe he’s not going anymore.

249
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:04,100
He knows how to change tires, don’t worry.

250
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,500
What if he changed his mind?

251
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,800
Stop it, baby boy. Listen—

252
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,300
What if he doesn’t want to see me, Pearl?

253
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
How will I meet him?

254
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,433
My brother is stuck in line at the grocery store.

255
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,433
I don't have a ride.

256
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,933
He must be angry at me.

257
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:22,433
And disappointed that I'm leaving.

258
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,300
Will you just tell him thank you for everything.

259
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,700
Now, are you done?

260
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,200
Are you finished?

261
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,933
You know what. You’re such a drama queen.

262
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:34,933
You’re meeting him. You have to.

263
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:37,800
Because I’m already on the road.

264
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,300
What do you mean?

265
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,433
I’m on my way. I’ll see you in 10 minutes. OK?

266
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,100
So, freshen up yourself.

267
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,600
No, Pearl. You don’t have to.

268
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,000
I’m embarrassed.

269
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Listen, baby boy. I’m on my way.

270
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,033
Don’t make me drag you out of your condo.

271
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:58,000
Get going. Meet me at the lobby, OK?

272
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,400
OK, Pearl.

273
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
OK.

274
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,333
Bye.

275
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,900
See you.

276
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,000
Finally, with Pearl!

277
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:24,800
We’re almost there!

278
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Pearl, I’m nervous.

279
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,600
It’s only normal.

280
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,133
What if he doesn’t come?

281
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,100
Then he’s an idiot.

282
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,133
What if there’s no magic? Didn’t you tell me—

283
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:39,733
Cairo, my story is different from yours, OK?

284
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,100
Maybe he changed his mind?

285
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,633
Maybe he doesn’t like me anymore?

286
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,933
You’re so dramatic!

287
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,900
Cairo!

288
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:51,533
Oh my God! He’s there! That’s really him!

289
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,700
What do I do?

290
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,733
Stupid. Turn around and face him.

291
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,900
Wait.

292
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,233
Flip the camera. I want to see Gav.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,600
Oh my God! It’s finally happening!

294
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,700
OK, I’m going to leave you guys. Bye!

295
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,033
Thanks, Pearl.

296
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:23,133
I’m proud of you, baby boy. Bye!

297
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,200
Hi, baby.

298
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,133
Hi, baby.

299
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,600
It’s even better hearing it in person.

300
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,500
Yeah right.

301
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,433
But it’s true.

302
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,033
Why are you crying?

303
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:29,700
You’re also crying.

304
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,400
Tears of joy. At last I’m with my love now.

305
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:39,200
Your love?

306
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:45,200
There’s no one else.

307
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,333
Why are you crying even more?
Did I say something wrong?

308
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,500
No. But I’ve proven something…

309
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,300
What? That I’m better looking in person?

310
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,100
Idiot.

311
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
No.

312
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,100
I’ve proven that what I feel for you is real…

313
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,200
I love you, too.

314
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,200
Baby… why are you crying even more now?

315
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,700
This isn’t how I imagined it.

316
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:36,900
I thought you would drive me away.

317
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
You’re crazy.

318
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,600
Didn’t you tell me to take a gamble on you?

319
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,500
I don’t know what’s going to happen to us.

320
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,000
Will this really work out?

321
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,200
Honestly,

322
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,433
I’m afraid.

323
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:02,733
I’ve never felt this way before.

324
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,700
This is so new to me…

325
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,800
But now,

326
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,233
I’m willing to take a risk.

327
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,100
It would be harder for me to lose you.

328
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,600
This the real thing.

329
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
We’re not playing a game anymore.

330
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,000
It’s my turn to ask.

331
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,800
Pass or play?

332
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,300
Play!

333
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,900
Surprise!

334
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,600
What is that?

335
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,600
I know you can’t wait to hug me.

336
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,000
So I made this just for you.

337
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:55,200
Wow. Thank you.

338
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
Don’t worry. I already disinfected it
before you arrived.

339
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,900
What do we do with that?

340
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,133
You can leave the flowers here.

341
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,800
Then insert your hand here.

342
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,300
Put it inside, baby.

343
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Here?

344
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,500
Yes. Just put it inside, baby.

345
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Idiot.

346
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,000
Do it slowly, baby.

347
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,800
Now the other one.

348
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,000
Baby, put it inside.

349
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
You’re crazy.

350
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:25,900
What about you?

351
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,100
I’ll put it inside, OK?

352
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,100
I’ll do it slowly.

353
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:35,333
Game?

354
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,333
G.

355
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,633
OK, that’s enough.

356
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,400
- Wait.
- Enough, baby.

357
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,300
- Just a little more.
- I said enough, baby.

358
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,700
Wait. We haven’t even kissed yet.

359
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,700
Idiot.

360
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,633
Come on.

361
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:12,633
Please?

362
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:14,233
Baby…

363
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:16,000
Please?

364
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But how?

365
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,700
Using this. Let’s try it.

366
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,300
It’s up to you.

367
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,433
Our hearts

368
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:40,100
Are now together

369
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,700
My love

370
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,433
I won’t replace you

371
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:57,233
I can’t wait

372
00:20:57,233 --> 00:21:02,400
For your hugs and kisses

373
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:09,900
My heart is yours

374
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:17,300
Take me along

375
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,800
Now,

376
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm yours.

377
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:32,800
Finally, we're free.
