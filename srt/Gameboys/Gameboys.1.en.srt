1
00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:03,800
Take that!

2
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:07,433
Just give up, Angel2000.

3
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:09,466
You think you can challenge me? 

4
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:11,100
Amateur!

5

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,566
Shoutout to Prime Cruz! Hello! 

10
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,066
What...

11
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:28,233
Is that all?

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,100
Take that. 

13
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,233
And that.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,966
What the— 

15
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,033
Hey!

16
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,033
No!

17
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,600
Wait, wait!

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,633
A newbie just defeated Cai!

19
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:41,766
Angel2000 rocks! Good game.

20
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:43,833
I think the game is rigged.

21
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,233
Cairo just got owned!

22
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:48,300
That’s not impressive!

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,200
It was just dumb luck! I got cheated.

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,266
There’s no way I could lose.

25
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:54,400
Who is Angel2000?

26
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,766
Guys, that’s it for today.

27
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,933
Don’t worry. I’ll arrange a rematch soon.

Alright, guys. See you soon.

33
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,733
Bye.

34
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:36,666
Who is this?

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Gavreel Alarcon...

36
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,266
Angel2000...

37
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:46,833
This is him?

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,600
Hi, Caimazing...

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,366
Good game.

40
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,733
Angel2000?

41
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,766
Hi Caimazing!

42
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,733
I didn’t think you would answer.

43
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:36,033
Hey. You look starstruck.

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,466
Starstruck?

45
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:42,033
It’s your screen lagging.

46
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,533
But your eyes are moving.

47
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,466
Maybe your internet is unstable.

48
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,800
No need to be starstruck with me.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,333
In your dreams.

50
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,233
Why are you shirtless?

51
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,833
Do you find me alluring?

52
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:58,066
Idiot.

53
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:00,566
Why would I find you alluring?

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,400
Do you hate my body?

55
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,600
I didn’t say that.

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,533
So you like it?

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,800
You’re full of crap.

58
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,466
So are you really Angel2000?

59
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,866
The one and only.

60
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:18,466
You lost to me, remember?

61
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:20,200
But you used a female hero.

62
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,333
So?

63
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,133
Are men not allowed to use
female heroes?

64
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:27,133
No. It’s just that you’re not
what I expected. 

65
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:30,666
You didn’t expect a guy
this good-looking to beat you?

66
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,633
You’re good-looking?

67
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:34,966
No, you.

68
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,333
I have a crush on you.

69
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,800
What?

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,666
Nothing. 

71
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,866
You’re cute. But hard of hearing.

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,233
Cut the crap.

73
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:54,200
Let’s talk rematch.

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,300
You just got lucky. 

75
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,733
Give me a kiss first.

76
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:02,233
You want a smack in the face?

77
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:06,166
Relax. It’s just a kiss.

78
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,633
Would you let me see it?

79
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,300
Pervert!

80
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,833
What did you think I was saying?

81
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,966
I don’t care.

82
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:17,133
Get lost. Weirdo.

83
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,033
Hey!

84
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,400
Cai, come downstairs.
Dinner is ready.

85
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,900
I’m not hungry.

86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,733
Suit yourself.

87
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,500
Any update on dad?

88
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,900
We still haven’t heard
from his doctor.

89
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,600
Why don’t you ask mom?

90
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,333
Come downstairs.

91
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,633
I said I’m not hungry.

92
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,166
I sense something.

93
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,333
What is it?

94
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,000
A message.

95
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:54,533
Tell me.

96
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,466
In five years…

97
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:58,300
Yes?

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,033
You will still be single.

99
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,400
What’s up, guys?

100
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,166
I’m heading out to look for food.

101
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,333
One buko juice, please!

102
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,133
Sorry, pressed by mistake.

103
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:02,100
Anyway, good morning.

104
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,866
Let me eat you.

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,833
I mean let’s eat.

106
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,733
Hey!

107
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,933
Hey!

108
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:14,166
Huh?

109
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:21,766
Wow. Thank you for the
heartfelt message.

110
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:22,766
LOL.

111
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,300
Rematch?

112
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,633
Send nudes.

113
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,366
Jerk.

114
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,366
It’s just a joke.

115
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:35,900
Half joke.

116
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,500
What do you want?

117
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,133
Hi grumpy. What, no hi back?

118
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,766
Stop talking nonsense.

119
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,733
All I want is a rematch.

120
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,366
You’re asking for so many things.

121
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:53,233
You’re the only thing I want.

122
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,566
Piss off. 

123
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,100
What a grouch.

124
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,700
And you’re a pervert.

125
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,866
You look nothing like your
username Angel.

126
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:03,466
What about Cairo?

127
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,833
Don’t call me Cairo.

128
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:09,766
Only my family can call me Cairo.

129
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,600
Just Cai.

130
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:16,033
OK Cairo.

131
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,333
You’re really getting on my
nerves, Gavreel.

132
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,033
Sure call me Gavreel.

133
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,233
Others just call me Gav.

134
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:26,266
But I want you to call me baby.

135
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:28,400
Why would I call you baby? 

136
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,266
You’re not an infant!

137
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,500
Soon you’ll be calling me
baby, Cairo.

138
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
In your dreams!

139
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,433
It’s a cute name. How did you get it?

140
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:42,800
My parents have been wanting
to go there.

141
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,566
Cairo, the capital of Egypt, right? 

142
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,333
My older brother is named London. 

143
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,533
Our youngest is Paris.

144
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,633
Cool.

145
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,300
I also want to live there someday.

146
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:59,200
Where?

147
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,400
In your heart.

148
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:04,233
Whatever.

149
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,100
What about your name Gavreel?

150
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,233
It’s the name of an angel.

151
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,733
It’s Gabriel, you idiot.

152
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,800
Your parents spelled it wrong.

153
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,300
No. Gavreel is different. 

154
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,933
He’s the angel of peace. 

155
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,700
Angel of peace?

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,700
You? Really?

157
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,633
You can search it if you like.

158
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,033
I sure will.

159
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,400
See?

160
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,033
OK, my bad.

161
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,200
Your parents did put some
thought into it. 

162
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,400
Not really. 

163
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,866
It’s also the name of the motel
my parents used to frequent. 

164
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:49,100
See?

165
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,566
That’s why your name
doesn’t suit you.

166
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:54,666
It should be Devil2000.

167
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,566
Devil then. 

168
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,833
But I’m your devil.

169
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,133
Whatever. 

170
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:04,466
You talk too much.
Let’s start the rematch.

171
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:08,433
My followers are looking
forward to it.

172
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:11,700
I’ll prove to them that
your winning was just a fluke.

173
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,033
Sure.

174
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,833
But on one condition.

175
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:20,133
Forget it. What for?

176
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:22,566
No rematch then, I guess.

177
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,800
Just joking.
Okay, what’s your condition?

178
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:26,266
It doesn’t matter.

179
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,300
Idiot. Tell me your condition.

180
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,900
Just forget it.

181
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,333
Come on. Tell me. 

182
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,666
You will let me court you.

183
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:46,600
You’re full of crap.

184
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,433
I’m serious.

185
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,266
What?

186
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,533
So?

187
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:55,533
Pass or play?

188
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,466
Play.
