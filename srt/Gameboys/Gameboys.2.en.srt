1
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:13,271
Why is he not answering? Geez.

2
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:34,625
If he has time to shop, then he has time
to answer my calls.

3
00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:39,463
Play a game with me, not with my feelings.

4
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:43,868
Hey, what’s this?

5
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:45,970
No, too cute.

6
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,440
Where are you? Please reply.

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,809
Sounds clingy.

8
00:00:52,276 --> 00:00:54,278
Are you mad?

9
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,581
Demanding. Never mind.

10
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:38,656
Finally!

11
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:41,158
What?

12
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:43,127
What do you mean what?

13
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:46,797
I’ve been calling you for three days.
Are you mad at me?

14
00:01:46,797 --> 00:01:50,034
I was busy. I just came from
the grocery store.

15
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:52,570
Seriously? For three days?

16
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:55,406
Wise-ass. Very funny.

17
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,908
I run errands every day.

18
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:01,679
I’m ready to court you.

19
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:03,514
You chose Play, remember?

20
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:05,283
Play?

21
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:07,718
No, I said…

22
00:02:08,286 --> 00:02:09,687
Pray.

23
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:11,901
I told you to pray every day.

24
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:13,768
You said play!

25
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:18,896
Stop annoying me. Find someone else to prank.

26
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:20,665
I really like you.

27
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:22,633
Why me?

28
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,235
Why not?

29
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:28,039
All is fair in love and war.
Who knows, you might like me too.

30
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:30,274
Nothing wrong with that, right?

31
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:34,612
We haven’t even met in person.
We’re practically strangers.

32
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,581
Then let’s date.

33
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:40,051
You want me to go to your place?

34
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:43,988
How? We’re in a lockdown.

35
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:48,192
You’re far away in Cavite.

36
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,228
After the quarantine then.

37
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:53,864
I’m not letting you court me.

38
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:58,536
Just one date. Consider it like a date
with your fan.

39
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:01,038
Please?

40
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:03,107
Say yes?

41
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,509
I’ll think about it.

42
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:06,644
Yes!

43
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,212
Hey, I haven’t said yes.

44
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:09,580
It’s the same thing.

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,683
Whatever. When is our rematch?

46
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:15,720
I’m just waiting for you.

47
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:17,688
But what happens if you lose?

48
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:20,524
Yeah right. In your dreams, boy.

49
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:22,593
Don’t be too sure of yourself.

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,064
If I beat you, you will leave me alone.

51
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:30,634
You will stop calling me. I won’t ever
hear from you again.

52
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,903
Sure? You won’t miss me?

53
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,939
Yes! 100%!

54
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:38,242
100% sure you’ll miss me?

55
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:41,712
I’m 100% sure I want you to get lost.

56
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,481
Owie!

57
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:48,953
OK but if you lose, you’ll chat with me
for the entire quarantine period.

58
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,589
Fine with me.

59
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:54,692
Let’s do the rematch tomorrow during my livestream.

60
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:58,229
Game. You sure you won’t change your mind?

61
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,233
Absolutely. There’s no way you will win.

62
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,070
Where are you? I told you to hurry up.

63
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:13,411
Just because we completed our quarantine,
you think you can loaf around all day?

64
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,015
Is everything okay?

65
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:20,084
I have to go. Bye.

66
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:22,553
Hey-

67
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:30,828
Tomorrow, I will play the game of love.
Wish me luck.

68
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,303
Angry again?

69
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:41,472
Huh?

70
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,794
Or are you just trying to get my attention?

71
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:50,281
Idiot. I clicked it by mistake.

72
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:53,083
Yeah, right.

73
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:24,315
Give up?

74
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,017
Caimaizing...

75
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:29,386
You’re about to lose!

76
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:31,155
That’s the best you can do?

77
00:05:31,155 --> 00:05:32,389
Shut up!

78
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,258
You’re going down!

79
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:35,626
Die!

80
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,494
No!

81
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:43,834
Piece of cake!

82
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:45,603
Well, well.

83
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:47,468
Don’t be cocky.

84
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:50,068
Is that what you think?

85
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:51,768
Do we have a date-

86
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,034
Shhh!

87
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:55,834
Thank you for watching my livestream.
I’ll see you again next time.

88
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:58,316
And please remember: Be safe.

89
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,534
Bye, guys!

90
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:14,233
Why? You don’t want them to know
that you’re already taken?

91
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,368
Who’s taken?

92
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:19,468
You. I have dibs on you.
You can’t escape me.

93
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:21,034
I am this close to strangling you.

94
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:23,177
Yes, choke me daddy.

95
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:24,301
Idiot.

96
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:28,201
Finally, I made you laugh.

97
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,734
You’re cuter when you laugh.

98
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:32,868
You’re such a player.

99
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,718
I’m not playing you.

100
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:38,068
I just want to cheer you up.

101
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:41,134
You seem sad all the time.

102
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:46,601
Whatever it is, I’m just here for you.

103
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:51,101
Yeah, yeah. I have to go.

104
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:52,734
What, no good night kiss, baby?

105
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:54,368
Kiss your ass.

106
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:55,973
Come on, baby, please.

107
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,868
Pervert.

108
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,568
What is that?

109
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,568
Oh crap.

110
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:34,734
Why do you look so giddy?

111
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:37,868
- Can I see your boxers?
- Piss off!

112
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:39,134
Let me see!

113
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:40,034
You’re so cute.

114
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:44,401
What’s up, guys? I’m dressed to impress.

115
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:48,068
Today we’re eating out.

116
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:52,734
Wait, let me fix my shoes.

117
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:57,101
Hair looks nice.

118
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,401
Yes let’s go.

119
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,734
It’s a prank!

120
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:11,668
Did you really think I was going out?

121
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:14,701
It’s not enjoyable without you around.

122
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:39,401
Hey,

123
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:47,901
thanks for the effort to have this
delivered to me.

124
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:51,231
Why are you treating me to pizza?

125
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,601
Is it your birthday?

126
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:56,268
No. Didn’t I promise to take you on a date?

127
00:08:56,268 --> 00:09:00,901
Well, virtual date for now.
Since we can’t do it in person.

128
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:03,401
I haven’t agreed to a date.

129
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:07,868
You’re already eating and enjoying my pizza.

130
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:11,234
Only because it’s my favorite.

131
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:13,834
I wish I was your favorite.

132
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:17,101
Yours looks delicious.

133
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,501
You haven’t even tasted it yet.

134
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:22,034
You won’t be disappointed.

135
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:25,101
Idiot. I’m talking about your pizza.

136
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:28,401
Right. Pineapple with pizza is my favorite.

137
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,768
Fool. It’s the other way around.

138
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:33,568
Same, same.

139
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,234
Are you alone there?

140
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:39,834
No. But my housemate is on a diet.

141
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,534
What about your parents?

142
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:51,068
They died when I was still a kid.

143
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:56,668
I grew up with my grandma.
But she passed away last year.

144
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,401
Sorry…

145
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:02,134
It’s okay.

146
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:06,201
Are you not sharing the pizza?

147
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:08,634
It’s a lot to eat alone.

148
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:11,834
They’ve already eaten.

149
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:14,334
You don’t eat with them?

150
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:18,434
Not really.

151
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:21,768
Because you prefer my company?

152
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,668
Sure I’ll eat with you from now.

153
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:29,268
Wow thanks.

154
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:32,434
Welcome. Anything for you.

155
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,668
Well why not?

156
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:39,868
I can’t talk to anyone here anyway.

157
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:43,101
Great. It’s a deal then.

158
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,768
I like talking to you.

159
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:48,368
But you have your family there.

160
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:50,734
Why can’t you talk to them?

161
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,834
They’re upset with me.

162
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,368
Why?

163
00:10:58,436 --> 00:11:00,001
Just because.

164
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:05,968
It doesn’t help that my dad is at the hospital,
sick with the virus.

165
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,434
Sorry to hear that.

166
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,568
How is he?

167
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:14,901
Honestly,

168
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,301
I don’t know.

169
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:20,137
We’re not allowed to visit him.

170
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:28,468
I’ll pray for his quick recovery.

171
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:34,001
Cairo, if you need someone to talk to,
I’m just here.

172
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:36,534
Whatever it is,

173
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:40,234
I’m your guy.

174
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:48,634
Yeah, right.

175
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:55,734
Just how far

176
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:59,468
will each smile take

177
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,734
how we feel

178
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,634
for one another.

179
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:10,134
Just how far

180
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,334
will our hearts go

181
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:21,234
For a love that began

182
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:27,268
with just a game.

183
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:46,101
Hi, grumpy.

184
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:48,134
Stalker!

185
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,701
At least your stalker is cute.

186
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,734
Please follow back, idol.

187
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:03,068
Fool.

188
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,401
What?

189
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:19,068
Why can’t you say hello first?

190
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:22,701
OK. Hello, Gav.

191
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,534
That’s better.

192
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:25,834
What are you doing?

193
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:29,401
Just lying in bed.

194
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,135
You’re drenched in sweat.
And shirtless again.

195
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:34,534
You don’t like it?

196
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,834
I like it.

197
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:38,634
I mean, no.

198
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,234
Forget it.

199
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:43,068
I’m in the middle of working out.

200
00:13:43,768 --> 00:13:45,568
So why are you calling?

201
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:48,468
You want me to count your reps?

202
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:50,468
That’s not a bad idea.

203
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:55,258
You’re just pestering me. I’m busy.

204
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,995
You’re just lying down.

205
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:02,401
I’m busy lying down. I’m thinking.

206
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:05,034
Think about me later.

207
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:09,168
Help me count my reps.
Let’s sweat together.

208
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:11,034
Don’t be stupid.

209
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:15,934
No? Maybe I should ask someone else for help.

210
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:18,768
How do I count reps for that?

211
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:20,334
You don’t know how to count?

212
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:23,086
One, two, three, four five-

213
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:24,934
OK, wise-ass!

214
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:27,634
Game.

215
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:36,701
Hey, start counting reps.

216
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,434
Huh? What? Yes, let’s count.

217
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:44,034
Where are you putting your phone?

218
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,068
I want to see you better.

219
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:53,568
One... two... three...

220
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:55,001
Eyes here.

221
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:58,701
You’ll lose count if you’re not looking.

222
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:01,701
OK fine.

223
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:06,468
Four… five…

224
00:15:06,468 --> 00:15:10,034
Sex. I mean, six…

225
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:12,801
Well, well.

226
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:15,468
Shut up.

227
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:20,801
Eight… nine…

228
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:25,701
Hey what happened?

229
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:29,019
Nothing. You just continue working out. Bye.

230
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:03,934
How are you?

231
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:05,768
Cliché.

232
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:07,934
You must be bored.

233
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,768
Nonsense.

234
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:13,834
Are you for real?

235
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:19,001
Cairo, in case something happens to me,

236
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:21,701
just remember papa loves you.

237
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:23,934
Don’t play games too much.

238
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:27,010
Don’t give your mother trouble.

239
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,034
Don’t fight with your brothers.

240
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:42,134
Can’t answer the phone. Trouble talking.

241
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:47,768
Where are you? I can’t find Mama.

242
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:50,668
She’s with me. We didn’t bother waking you up.

243
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:53,168
We’re going to the hospital.
There are papers to be signed.

244
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,834
Brother, what’s happening to Papa?

245
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:58,734
He needs to be intubated.

246
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,034
When Paris wakes up, give him his food.
It’s in the ref.

247
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:08,568
Brother, is Papa going to get better?

248
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,086
I don’t know.

249
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:12,022
I have to go. Mama is waiting.

250
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:13,634
Hey, wait-

251
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:46,268
Where are you? Need to talk.

252
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:00,901
Hi.

253
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:06,601
Sorry, I clicked the wrong number.

254
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:10,334
Wait. You’re looking for Gav, right?

255
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:12,201
I borrowed his laptop.

256
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:15,234
He’s just taking a shower.
Wait, I’ll call him…

257
00:18:16,987 --> 00:18:18,634
Gav…

258
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,868
Gav...

259
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,859
Babe, you have a call.

260
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:28,268
Babe?

261
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,002
What’s your name again?
So I can tell him.

262
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:34,634
Forget it.
