1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,440
OK, guys. One of you gets to play against me now. 

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,000
One on one.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,800
But this time,

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,400
if I lose, I’ll give stuff away. 

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,600
No cheaters, okay?  

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,600
Type your username below.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,240
Who’s up for the challenge?

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,880
Wow. This Terrence Carreon sure is excited.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,000
OK, I choose you. 

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,600
What’s your username? I’ll invite you.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,280
Invite me to your live stream.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,600
Sure.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,520
But no crying if you lose. 

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,440
Don’t come running back to your mom, OK?

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,040
Wait.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Terrence?

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
G?

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,400
What’s your username for the game?

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,200
I’m typing it. Wait. 

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,600
What’s that? 

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,280
GavreelsOnlyLove?

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,600
Is it cheesy? It’s an old username. 

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,040
I haven’t changed it. 

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,440
It’s been a while since I last played.

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,720
Gavreel?

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Yes.

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
The Angel of Peace.

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,000
You know him right?

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Huh? 

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Don’t worry.

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,280
I just want to play.

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Huh? 

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,800
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,000
You know what I’m talking about.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,120
You’re nonsense.

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,800
Go talk to someone else.

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,400
Don’t be like that, guys.

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,400
We’re here to play, nothing more. 

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,440
Who’s next?

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
You hate wearing shirts too?

41
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,533
Goofing around with my best bro.

42
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,520
Are you sure you’re just bros?

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,120
What do you plan to do after this quarantine? 

44
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,240
Let’s do it together.

45
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Huh?

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Sure.

47
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Really?

48
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Where do you want to go?

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
Sure.

50
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
Sure?

51
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
Are we a couple now?

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
All right.

53
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Really?

54
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,400
You’re saying yes? 

55
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,040
We’re officially a couple?

56
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,040
What are you blabbering about? 

57
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,600
You just agreed to be my boyfriend.

58
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,640
You’re delusional.

59
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,080
You seem preoccupied.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,880
Is it about your dad? 

61
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,040
Or something else?

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
No.

63
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,640
I’m just sleepy.

64
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,200
Yeah right. You just want to play a game.

65
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
No.

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,800
- Gav...
- Yes, babe?

67
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,440
Do you know this person…

68
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
Who?

69
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,240
Is there something you want to tell me? 

70
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,040
- Just say it.
- Huh?

71
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,200
Did Pearl say something again?

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
No.

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,680
Don’t listen to her. 

74
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,120
She just likes to gossip. 

75
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Why are you paranoid? 

76
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you hiding something from me?

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Why would I hide anything? 

78
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,400
You want me to strip, so you can see everything?

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is that what you want?

80
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
You want me to?

81
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,840
You deserve each other.
You both like being naked.

82
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,200
What?

83
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Nothing. 

84
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,600
You’re driving me crazy.

85
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
I’m driving you crazy?

86
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Yes.

87
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,240
So you’re crazy for me?

88
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,200
You’re crazy, period. 

89
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,440
Let’s go to bed.

90
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Together?

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Good night.

92
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
Sweet dreams, baby!

93
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,200
Hi, Cai.

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,120
Sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you the other day.

95
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Idiot.

96
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,520
Who are you again?

97
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,320
Huh? What do you mean?

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,720
You don’t remember?

99
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,600
We were supposed to play in your live stream.

100
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,720
Yes. You’re irritating.

101
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Oh OK.

102
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,600
I’m GavreelsOnlyLove

103
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
Lucky you!

104
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,680
Oh really?

105
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,920
Obviously, it’s just a username.

106
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Can we video call?

107
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
You’ve got some nerve.

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
I’m busy.

109
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,600
It’s easier to explain in person than in chat. 

110
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,040
The nerve of this guy.

111
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,600
Now he’s pestering me.

112
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,600
What do you want?

113
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,640
Dude, relax. I come in peace.

114
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,400
What is it? I’m really busy.

115
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,840
This will be quick. 

116
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
It’s about Gav.

117
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,400
I don’t know why he’s bothering me

118
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,800
- You should just talk to him.
- I just don’t want you to have the wrong impression.

119
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Wrong impression?

120
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,200
Maybe I made the wrong move.

121
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,280
I don’t want to cause any trouble for you and Gav.

122
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,080
I saw Pearl’s post, 

123
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,880
and I don’t know what got into me. 

124
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
Maybe I was just curious.

125
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,120
Curious about what?

126
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Are you Gav’s new guy?

127
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,440
What are you talking about?

128
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,600
So… not yet, then? 

129
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
Well, full disclosure,

130
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,720
we used to be together.

131
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,240
But that was a long time ago. 

132
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,800
We haven’t talked since then.

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,120
You and Gavreel were a couple?

134
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Yeah.

135
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,600
But we’re not that serious. 

136
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,440
Well, he wasn’t. 

137
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,640
But I was. So you don’t have to worry.

138
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,200
I’m not worried.

139
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,480
Wow. You’re confident.

140
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,840
I like that.

141
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Not really. I don’t get what you want from me.

142
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,000
Pearl’s post got me really curious.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,200
I thought, okay Gav has moved on.

144
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,600
Good for him. 

145
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,080
So I clicked you’re profile, and saw that you were online. 

146
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
OK.

147
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Hey. 

148
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,880
Why are you looking at me like that? 

149
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,600
It makes sense.

150
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,880
- What?
- You’re so his type.

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What do you mean? 

152
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,680
I don’t think so.

153
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,280
He likes it when the guy is difficult to get.

154
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,400
And I mean that as a compliment.

155
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,680
In the beginning, I used to ignore him,

156
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,800
but he was so persistent.

157
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,840
I didn’t know I could fall for a guy like Gav. 

158
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,600
Wait. Let me correct that.

159
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,080
I didn’t know I could fall for a guy, period. 

160
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,240
He doesn’t stop until he gets what he wants.

161
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you into guys?

162
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,600
Huh?

163
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,640
The thing with Gav is he’s very charming… 

164
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,800
He could charm even a statue.

165
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,800
Imagine a statue falling for Gav.

166
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,680
Believe me, he likes a good challenge.

167
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,720
Challenge?

168
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,000
He would go to all this effort just because he likes the challenge?

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh no. Please don’t take it the wrong way.

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,600
He’s just really persistent.

171
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,040
Persistent? More like annoying.

172
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,920
Yes, but like I’ve said,

173
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,440
he’s very charming. 

174
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,800
So I understand why people fall for him. 

175
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,080
I also fell for his dimples and pizzas.

176
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Pizza?

177
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,480
Yes. It’s his favorite food. 

178
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,200
Anyway, I have to go.

179
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
I hope we’re good.

180
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
OK.

181
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Baby!

182
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,400
Once the lockdown ends, 

183
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,120
we’ll  deliver food to our frontliners in Quezon City. 

184
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,720
We can finally meet, baby.

185
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,320
I’m not allowed to leave the house, unless it’s important. 

186
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,280
Ouch. That hurts, baby.

187
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,000
Am I not important to you?

188
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,200
You’re always making jokes. Be serious for once.

189
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,600
I know I tease you a lot but I’m serious when it comes to love.

190
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Really?

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,800
Then how come you broke up with… 

192
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Who?

193
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
…with Pearl?

194
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,120
We were so young. 

195
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,920
And we’re better off as best friends anyway.

196
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,600
Stop worrying. 

197
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,440
I’m so into you, as Arianna would say.

198
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,120
But you also end up saying  “thank you, next.” Right?

199
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Of course not. 

200
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,200
Why are you so grumpy all of a sudden?

201
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,600
Grumpy? I’m just asking.

202
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,400
Are you still worried about Pearl?

203
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,600
Of course not. 

204
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,800
Pearl is so nice.

205
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
But…

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,520
Did you also treat her to pizza?

207
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,400
You mean, like a date? No.

208
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh. So you just like treating people to pizza.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,200
Not really.
We had a pizza date because it’s your favorite.

210
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,920
And because you’re special.

211
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,000
Whatever.

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,600
Baby, what is this about?

213
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,680
Nothing. 

214
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,400
Anyway, I’ll leave you to finish what you’re doing.

215
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,520
Wait. Don’t leave. Let’s talk more-

216
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,000
Why are you blaming me? 

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,800
We don’t even talk about you.

218
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,600
Why was he so grouchy then? 

219
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
He won’t tell me what I did wrong. 

220
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,400
Are you sure you didn’t tell him anything? 

221
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,200
- You can be chatty sometimes.
- Why is it always my fault?

222
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,440
Maybe you did do something wrong.

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Everything was fine with us until you made him upset.

224
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,240
Excuse me. 

225
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,800
He was upset because of his family situation. OK?

226
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,680
OK, fine, partly because of me too. Happy?

227
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,640
Has the curve been flattened?

228
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
No.

229
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,840
It feels like he has put up a wall that I can’t penetrate.

230
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,280
So are you giving up?

231
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,680
Of course not.

232
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,720
But what can I do if he doesn’t like me?

233
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,200
Try jumping through fire.

234
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Shut up.

235
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,000
Why are you wearing a hat and shades?

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Because it’s so hot!

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Then go inside.

238
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,240
I can’t. I have to disinfect the groceries first. 

239
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,280
You’re such a drama queen.

240
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,200
You’re the drama queen!

241
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,120
For all you know it’s nothing serious. 

242
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,280
You’re overthinking things.

243
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,480
- You think so?
- Yes!

244
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,200
Oh crap. I lost track of what I’m disinfecting.

245
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,800
You’re so annoying. Go away.

246
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
June 26, 2000.

247
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,920
So you’re a Cancer.

248
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,880
That’s why you’re full of contradictions.

249
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Me?

250
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,280
Yes, baby boy.

251
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,120
Cancers are like that.

252
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,600
Affectionate. But you put up a wall.

253
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
You’re afraid to show vulnerability. 

254
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,200
That’s why you’re sensitive.

255
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,800
I don’t believe in that.

256
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,200
This is just a guide. 

257
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,400
You don’t have to take it seriously.

258
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,080
OK, let’s calculate your compatibility.

259
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,640
Good match! Oh my God!

260
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,800
I wish Gav were here! 

261
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
What’s taking him so long at the grocery store?

262
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,520
Wait. There’s more.

263
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,640
"However...."

264
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,200
"...they have to control their mood and temper."

265
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,000
"When hurt, Cancer retreats, and Scorpio bites back..."

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
Bites back?

267
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,840
"...causing trouble in the relationship.”

268
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,400
Bite back? Even if he is the one at fault?

269
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,200
Issue!

270
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,000
No issue. 

271
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,200
But that horoscope is one-sided.

272
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
It only favors Gav.

273
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,040
It’s just a horoscope. 

274
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,800
It doesn’t know what you’re going through.

275
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,840
What’s up?

276
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Nothing.

277
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Nothing?

278
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,920
Okay, if you say so.

279
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,200
But you have to admit, it’s pretty accurate. 

280
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Like a true Scorpio, Gav is very passionate.

281
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Pearl...

282
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,520
Was he this intense when you were still together?

283
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,480
Are we really talking about that?

284
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,200
All I can say is that he never pursued me 
the way he is pursuing you now.

285
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,280
Because he wasn’t into girls.

286
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,720
He was also confused then.

287
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,520
Didn’t you feel betrayed?

288
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,480
He hid the truth from you.

289
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,800
I was hurt at first.

290
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,440
But I thought about his inner struggle… 

291
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,000
Imagine being alone… 

292
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,840
- At least he was honest with me, right?
- It’s absolutely important. 

293
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,320
Honesty.

294
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,240
Tell me the truth. What’s happening? 

295
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,200
Gav thinks you’re annoyed with him about something.

296
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
I’m always annoyed with him. 

297
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,280
Anyway, I have to go now.

298
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,920
Wait.

299
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,120
Let’s see if I’m compatible with the actor Alden Richards.

300
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,880
Bye, Pearl.

301
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,200
Wow he really left.

302
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,440
Now let’s see if I’m compatible with Catriona Gray.

303
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,000
Is he telling the truth?

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,200
Don’t be fooled by his sweet words, 

305
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,480
you don’t know how many people he has hurt with those words.

306
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,800
Hey what’s that about? 
So controversial. Do I know him?

307
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,840
I just read it somewhere. 

308
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,400
Credits to the owner.

309
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,800
Is he throwing shade at Gavreel? Or me?

310
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,000
What?

311
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,720
I didn’t think you would answer.

312
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
I just wanted to say hi.

313
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,320
Why do you call when you’re working out?

314
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Huh?

315
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
I just finished working out.

316
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
Want to play? 

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,520
We didn’t get to play last time.

318
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Sure.

319
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Dark Souls 1?

320
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,840
I don’t know that game.

321
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,280
What do you know?

322
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,640
Actually...

323
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,320
I just want to make friends with you.

324
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Why?

325
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,720
I don’t know. 

326
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Perhaps, 

327
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,400
I see myself in you.

328
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
In what way?

329
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
We’re so different.

330
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,200
You and Gavreel are more alike.

331
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
No way. 

332
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,400
I will never use my grandma to gain sympathy.

333
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
What do you mean?

334
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Forget it.

335
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,680
- You know what? Let’s just play a game. 
- No.

336
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,800
You were saying something about his grandma.

337
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,400
I said forget it.

338
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,920
Tell me.

339
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
OK.

340
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,880
Way back when he was still pursuing me, 

341
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,240
he always talked about his grandma.

342
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,000
It was then that I saw a more caring side of him.

343
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,000
He told me he talks about me to his grandma.

344
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
I was really happy when he said that.

345
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,680
- So what’s the problem?
- Nothing really.

346
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,200
You know I’ve never met his grandma.

347
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,400
He had an excuse each time I asked about meeting her.

348
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,640
- Maybe it just wasn’t possible.
- I thought of that.

349
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,680
His grandma was in the province, while we stayed in Manila. 

350
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,920
But you know what?

351
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,640
I was shocked when his grandma died.

352
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,640
He said he was really heartbroken about that.

353
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,200
Yes he was.

354
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,000
Did you read his post about his grandma?

355
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,240
I was really moved.

356
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,400
Before his grandma died, he never showed any weakness. 

357
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,400
We were just partying and drinking all week.

358
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,920
Party all week?

359
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,640
I don’t think so. 

360
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,080
He was always beside his grandma in the hospital.

361
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,400
Is that what he told you?

362
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Yeah, right.

363
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,800
Probably he was at the hospital each morning, 

364
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,400
but in the evening he was drinking.

365
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,280
Hey, don’t mention this to Gav, OK? 

366
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,600
He’s very sensitive about this.

367
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
OK.

368
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Terrence…

369
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
why did you break up?

370
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,120
If you don’t mind telling me.

371
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,800
It’s a long time ago. 

372
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,880
You know, he courted me for a long time.

373
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,200
When we became a couple, something changed.

374
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,480
Maybe it was just the thrill of the chase.

375
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,000
Maybe we just didn’t click.

376
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,720
But I’m sure it would be different for you.

377
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,080
Hi, baby. I’m trying to call you.

378
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
I have to go. I got things to do.

379
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
Sure. Bye. 

380
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,720
Hi baby.

381
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,080
I’ve been trying to call you. 

382
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,200
You’re probably busy talking to someone else. 

383
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I’m jealous.

384
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,200
It seems like you’re in a bad mood.

385
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,240
What can I do to make you smile?

386
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,200
Why are you courting me?

387
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,600
Because I like you. 

388
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Don’t I always tell you that?

389
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,600
Let’s suppose you get what you what.

390
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
What happens next?

391
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,400
If that happens, I’ll be so happy. 

392
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
I’ll be the happiest man in the world.

393
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,240
You know, every time I discover a new game, 

394
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,120
I just want to master it in every way.

395
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,400
I want to level up fast, especially if it’s a difficult game.

396
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,800
- Baby, I'm not playing games.
- Once you’ve mastered a game

397
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,080
and a more exciting game comes along, 

398
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,240
you forget about it.

399
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,600
- You think it’s what I’m doing?
- Honestly, I don’t know what we’re doing.

400
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,040
Maybe we’re just bored.

401
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,200
This lockdown has made people do crazy stuff.

402
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,400
Hey, that kinda hurts.

403
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,800
I don’t want to hurt you.

404
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,440
I’m just looking after myself.

405
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,120
Are you turning me down, baby?

406
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,600
I don’t know why I allowed myself
to get caught up with you. 

407
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,800
Maybe I just needed a distraction. 

408
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,440
There’s a lot in my mind. My dad… this lockdown…

409
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,400
So that’s what I am to you?

410
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,240
Just a distraction?

411
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,240
Am I not the same to you? 

412
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,480
You were bored and decided to pick on me.

413
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,400
You think I’m that shallow?

414
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,720
I may tease you a lot,

415
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,200
but everything I’ve told you is true.

416
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,720
My feelings for you are true. 

417
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,880
Everything I’ve shown you is true.

418
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
What about your grandma?

419
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What about grandma Cora?

420
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,600
Were you just using her to get me to like you?

421
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,240
How can you say that, Cairo?

422
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,480
I understand why you can’t totally trust me.

423
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
I get that.

424
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,400
But how can you accuse me of using my grandma?

425
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,680
You know that I will do everything
to prove my love to you.

426
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,000
But I will never use her,

427
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,600
or my most painful experience, just to fool you.

428
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,600
- Sorry. I don’t what know what got—
- What do you want to happen, Cairo? 

429
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,000
You want me to stop courting you?

430
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,240
Stop whatever it is we have going on?

431
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
OK.

432
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,400
You don’t have to say it.

433
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,920
I will never bother you again.

434
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,040
Goodbye, Cairo.

435
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,440
Gav-
