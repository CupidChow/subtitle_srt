00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:04,766
Thank you for participating in our donation drive. 

2
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:07,600
This will help a lot of our frontliners.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,933
Thank you also to those who sent their condolences.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,400
My family and I are doing better each day.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,533
But it might take a while before
I do another livestream.

6
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:24,100
Hope you guys understand.

7
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:28,166
Anyways, as promised, I’ll give a shoutout
to some of you. 

8
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,933
Later, I’ll be giving away skins…

9
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:34,766
or maybe diamonds. I’ll just surprise you.

10
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:36,566
Alright let’s go.

11
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,333
Shout out to

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,333
Jen Mauricio.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello, Nestor Abrogena.

14
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:47,000
Hi, Kristian Palma and Prince Ralph Malanum. 

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,433
Who else?

16
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:49,633
Mine!

17
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:53,033
Looks like someone wants to get noticed.

18
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:54,800
Hey, Angel2000.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,966
Mine? You mean “me”?

20
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,766
Can Caimazing be mine?

21
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:02,733
Idiot. This is not online selling.

22
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:04,466
Add to cart.

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,333
Don’t pay him any attention, guys.

24
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,566
I mean...

25
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:09,433
“add to heart.” 

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,400
Don’t make me block you, Angel2000.

27
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:18,866
Annoying!

28
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:21,366
OK, game!

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,366
You are such an attention seeker.

30
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:26,500
Even during my livestream.

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,200
Just say it please.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,100
- What?
- Baby.

33
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,833
Didn’t you already call me baby?

34
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,733
- Huh?
- Don’t huh me.

35
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:34,900
Whatever.

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,966
You’re talking nonsense.

37
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:38,733
Don’t deny it.

38
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:41,033
I heard you say it. It’s so clear.

39
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:43,533
You even made it your username.

40
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,066
GavsBaby

41
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:48,766
Oh that.

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,266
It’s nothing.

43
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:51,266
It’s nothing?

44
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:55,000
It’s important! 

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,600
- You’re calling me baby.
- So what?

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,800
I call a lot of things baby.

47
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:03,533
I’m loyal to you, but you have
more than one baby?

48
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:04,533
Idiot.

49
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,666
I call our dog baby. Even my youngest brother. 

50
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:11,166
I also have a nephew I call baby.

51
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,166
It’s not a big deal.

52
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:16,000
If it’s not a big deal,
then why can’t you call me baby now?

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No reason.

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,500
Don’t be shy.

55
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:19,900
Say it, baby. Come on.

56
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,633
Say it with love.

57
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:22,766
Come on, say it.

58
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,166
Don’t be shy. Come on.

59
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,166
I’m not used to it.

60
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,966
- So let’s practice, baby.
- Don’t annoy me.

61
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,166
Maybe I’ll just change my username.

62
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,533
No, don’t do that.

63
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,500
But I’m already your baby, right?

64
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:42,500
I saw that. Don’t pretend.

65
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,066
Whatever.

66
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,900
Don’t give me that smile of yours.

67
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,633
- You know I’ve already fallen for you. 
- I know.

68
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,066
I mean…

69
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:54,833
Now I know what I forgot to tell you. 

70
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:59,866
I’ll just transfer to your account
the donation I got for the frontliners.

71
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:00,866
OK.

72
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:01,866
OK.

73
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:02,866
GavsBaby.

74
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,366
GavsBaby.

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,833
Hi, babes!

76
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:13,733
Terrence sent a video message.

77
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:16,533
Watch first before you react.

78
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:18,366
Don’t worry.

79
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:21,000
I’ll talk to him if you have any violent reaction.

80
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:23,866
Hi Gav.

81
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:27,400
After everything that has happened,

82
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,633
I know now is not the right time
to ask for forgiveness.

83
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,733
But I want to try and make things right.

84
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,733
Pearl is right.

85
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:40,666
What I did was such an asshole move.

86
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,333
I shouldn’t force you to love me back.

87
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:52,166
I thought that if I fought for you,

88
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,066
even if it was wrong, 

89
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:57,800
you’ll see how much I need you.

90
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:03,566
But just because we have a past together
doesn’t mean you’ll choose me.

91
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:06,600
Believe me, Gav,

92
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,166
when I say being with you
was one of the best moments of my life.

93
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
I just didn’t know how to take care of you.

94
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,633
Gav, I’m sorry.

95
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:24,166
I’m sorry for everything.

96
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,966
I know it’s too late,

97
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,300
and you’re happy now.

98
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,633
That’s the most important thing for me.

99
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,133
Cai,

100
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,333
Gav is a great guy.

101
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,033
And I know you know that.

102
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:50,700
So please take care of him.

103
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,466
Stay safe and stay strong.

104
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,033
Bye.

105
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:07,333
Come on.

106
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,500
It’s Zumba time. I’m so ready.

107
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,033
Three… two… one… 

108
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:16,066
Roll it back, roll it back. 

109
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,066
OK, open your legs.

110
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:21,033
Sway your hips to the front,

111
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:22,133
to the side, 

112
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:23,133
to the back.

113
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,933
To the side, to the front.

114
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:28,100
- Let’s repeat, and then we’ll do it faster.
- This is tiring, Pearl.

115
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,366
Stop complaining. OK, switch.

116
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:33,266
We’ve been doing Zumba for only 5 minutes.
How can you be tired?

117
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,766
Why do you drag us into these things?

118
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:36,766
OK, next!

119
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:40,333
Zumba is fun, especially with friends. 

120
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,666
You need this, Cairo.

121
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,833
You do nothing but sit in front of your computer.

122
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,533
You have to exercise.

123
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,400
I do exercise.

124
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Beyonce moves this time.
What exercise is that?

125
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,500
- Nothing.
- Beyonce pump it!

126
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,733
Baby, I think I know what exercise you’re doing.
Let me join you. 

127
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,266
I’ll call you tonight.

128
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,400
- We’ll do it together.
- Perve.

129
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Yuck. You guys are gross.

130
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,333
Why? What were you thinking?

131
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:05,433
I can tell how your mind works now. 

132
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,566
I know what you’re thinking.

133
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:09,866
Then you know you’re the only thing on my mind?

134
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,600
What did you just say?

135
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:15,166
Oh my gosh.

136
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,800
Stop staring at each other like that.
Get a room.

137
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,566
Be a little considerate. Stop making me
the president of all third wheels.

138
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,066
By the way,

139
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,766
- there’s news that GCQ will start next week.
- What’s that?

140
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,400
It’s another form of quarantine, but more relaxed.

141
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,266
Certain businesses will be allowed to operate. 

142
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:43,300
Hopefully, once the curve is flattened,
they will finally lift quarantine.

143
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,566
Great!

144
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:47,100
Who knows, I might finally get to see you.

145
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Yeah right. I don’t believe you anymore.

146
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,666
True. You made us wait for nothing.

147
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,633
It wasn’t my fault.

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,233
OK fine. I’m hitting the shower. Bye, babes.

149
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,233
Bye.

150
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Baby.

151
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:06,100
It’s so exciting.

152
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,533
We’ll be spending more time together
once the quarantine is lifted.

153
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,933
Says who?

154
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:10,933
Me.

155
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,100
Baby, I have so many plans for us.

156
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,300
We’ll be going to so many places.

157
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,333
I don’t like going out.

158
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,733
Seriously? Too bad.

159
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,900
I was planning to take you to Real, Quezon.

160
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,500
It’s beautiful there.

161
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,300
We’ll go surfing.

162
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,333
There’s also water-rafting.
It’ll be fun, baby. Promise.

163
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,833
I’m not into those stuff.

164
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,966
It sounds scary. What if we get into an accident?

165
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:35,800
Baby, don’t be scared, OK?

166
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
I’ll be there with you.

167
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,900
- I won’t let anything bad happen to my baby.
- You’re just saying that now.

168
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Of course not.

169
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,866
I promise. I won’t allow you to get hurt.

170
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:45,700
There’s something I want to try. 

171
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,033
I want to go snorkeling. 

172
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:49,733
It’s fun.

173
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:51,100
But not with you.

174
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,733
Baby, let me go with you! We’ll do it together.

175
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:57,533
Last year, I went snorkeling in Matinloc Island. 

176
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,400
It’s so beautiful, you won’t believe it.

177
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,766
But I went there alone.

178
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:09,800
I promised myself to go back with the love of my life. 

179
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,866
Baby,

180
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,200
once the quarantine is lifted, 

181
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,900
let’s shop for snorkeling gear. 

182
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,733
We’re definitely going there. Just the two of us.

183
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,533
No.

184
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,666
- You might be up to something.
- Promise, I’ll behave myself… 

185
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,600
I’ll behave. Promise.

186
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,433
- But only at the start.
- Whatever. 

187
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:33,100
I already told you I hate going out.

188
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,666
I’m not interested in those things.

189
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:40,333
Real, Quezon.

190
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,666
10 things to do in Real, Quezon

191
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:49,833
It does look like a good place for surfing.

192
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,466
Matinloc, Island.

193
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,233
Wow. It’s so beautiful.

194
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:07,133
But it has a romantic vibe. Really, Gav.

195
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,733
I hope this pandemic ends soon.

196
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,933
Risa?

197
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
Cai…

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,033
Cai, I'm sorry… 

199
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,900
I heard what happened to your dad.

200
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,100
I’m such an idiot.

201
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:33,600
I shouldn’t have done that.

202
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,133
All this happened because of my stupidity.

203
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:44,233
Cai, even if you don’t forgive me… 

204
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:51,800
I just really want to apologize.

205
00:10:52,366 --> 00:10:55,033
I want you to know that...

206
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:59,366
I really regret what I did.

207
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:02,700
Risa, what you did was terrible. 

208
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:05,400
It’s so wrong.

209
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,966
I trusted you as a friend
but you were the first to judge me. 

210
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:16,200
However, what happened to Papa is not your fault.

211
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:21,333
There you go again.

212
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:24,666
I hurt you in so many ways,

213
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:28,433
and you’re still trying to make me feel better.

214
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,000
I know what I did was wrong.

215
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:35,600
It’s so wrong.

216
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,800
And I know it has a consequence.

217
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,933
I lost my best friend.

218
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,166
I lost my best friend.

219
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,100
Cai…

220
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:59,433
I will understand if you can’t forgive me.

221
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,800
I’ll understand.

222
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,100
Maybe not now.

223
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:12,033
But I really appreciate you doing this, Risa. 

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Hi, baby.

225
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,433
Hey, I got what you sent.
Did you receive my delivery?

226
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:18,433
Hi, baby.

227
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Hello?

228
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Hi, baby.

229
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:25,466
I think your internet is lagging.

230
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,466
No.

231
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,833
You’re not answering to “hi, baby.” 

232
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,966
Can’t I get a “hi, baby”?

233
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:31,766
Or a “good morning, baby?”

234
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:32,966
Stop trying to be cute.

235
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:35,266
I’m not trying to be cute.

236
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:37,033
A little affection would be nice.

237
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,033
OK.

238
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:40,533
Hi, baby.

239
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,666
It sounds so dry. 

240
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,533
One more. With feelings, please…

241
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,466
Hi, baby. 

242
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,300
Happy now?

243
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,566
Yes. Super happy. One more?

244
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:53,533
Enough. You might get used to it. 

245
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,366
I’d like that.

246
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:57,233
So, did you get it?

247
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,766
Yes, it’s here. It arrived earlier. 

248
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,933
Why don’t you open yours?

249
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:03,933
Open it.

250
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,733
- OK.
- Please.

251
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,700
I’m sure you’ll like it.

252
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:10,633
What’s this?

253
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,766
Surprise!

254
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:15,866
Is this a prank? What will I do with this?

255
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,233
Don’t be like that.

256
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,866
I’m just thinking of you.

257
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,533
I still can’t see you.

258
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,633
- At least you have something to hug for now. 
- Hug? 

259
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,566
No, this is what I’ll do to it.

260
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:27,966
Ouch! That hurts.

261
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:29,700
It feels like you’re punching my heart.

262
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,266
But thank you, really. It’s soft.

263
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:34,433
I knew you’d like it.

264
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:37,200
You can also kiss it at night.

265
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Kiss?

266
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:45,266
I’d rather do this.

267
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:50,033
But really, it’s soft. I love hugging it.

268
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,300
Sweet. Imagine if it’s me you’re hugging.

269
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,966
No. We have to observe physical distancing.

270
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:58,766
You’re right.

271
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:04,666
So, I’ll settle for hugging this. Surprise!

272
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:10,000
So that’s why you were asking for my photo.

273
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,033
What’s on the other side?

274
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,266
I hate you. Why that photo?

275
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,033
You’re so cute here.

276
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,700
Nice and naughty at the same time.

277
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,500
Perv!

278
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
- Ouch! Hit me baby one more time!
- You’re crazy!

279
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,033
Hey, I’ll open this, OK?

280
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,833
Sure. But it’s really simple.

281
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,633
It doesn’t matter, baby.

282
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,433
Wow.

283
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:41,866
And I thought I was the cheesy one.

284
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:42,866
Cheesy?

285
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:46,700
Then maybe I should take this off.

286
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,666
Well I guess you don't like it.

287
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,133
No, don’t. It’s cute.

288
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:54,633
Definitely cute.

289
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:57,266
Wait. Don’t take it off.

290
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Hey.

291
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:03,633
What are you doing?

292
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:11,700
It’s really nice, baby. Thank you.

293
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:15,066
You’ve given me so many things.

294
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,033
But thank you,

295
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:21,400
especially for being there for me.

296
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,933
You know what I mean.

297
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:26,433
It’s nothing, baby.

298
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:29,100
My gifts are not just material things.

299
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,800
I’ll also give you my heart and soul.

300
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:36,966
- And my body is all yours, baby.
- Yuck. Don’t be gross.

301
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,633
I’m excited to wear this
when we finally meet in person.

302
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,300
If we can only see each other every day.

303
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,000
Every day? Really?

304
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes.

305
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,133
To make up for the days that we’re not together.

306
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,733
Won’t we get tired of each other?

307
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,100
Remember what Pearl said—

308
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,266
Baby, don’t listen to Pearl. 

309
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:58,133
Her ex did not exert enough effort.

310
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,133
And he's a cheater. 

311
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,100
I’m not like that.

312
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:04,466
I’ll drive to see you every day. 

313
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:07,333
If you want, I’ll ask for Mama’s permission.

314
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,633
So you can stay with me. Then, I’m all yours.

315
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,833
Why don’t we just run away?

316
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,933
But Mama might not like it.

317
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,833
Idiot. You’re talking nonsense.

318
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:21,333
Baby, it’s never too early
to start planning our future together.

319
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,133
Cairo, are you in a video call?

320
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:29,700
Please call me afterwards. Thank you.

321
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:33,633
Gav, let’s talk later. It’s Mama. I have to call her.

322
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:34,900
Why? Is she giving us her consent?

323
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Crazy.

324
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,166
She needs to talk to me.

325
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,200
Hi, Ma. Wait.

326
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,866
I’ll just call my brothers.

327
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:46,033
Cairo, no need.

328
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:48,500
I want to talk to you individually.

329
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:50,733
Sure.

330
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:55,733
What’s that? 

331
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,733
Gav’s Baby?

332
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,933
It’s nothing, Ma.

333
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,166
Who’s that?

334
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,900
Nothing, Ma. A fan sent me this.

335
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,800
Oh, a fan.

336
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,733
What a cute fan you have.

337
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:13,966
Ma, what were you going to say?

338
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:16,366
Cairo,

339
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:24,366
I am thinking of moving to Bukidnon
to live with your grandma. 

340
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:28,133
Our savings have been depleted

341
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:31,300
because of your Papa’s hospital bills.

342
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,500
I am thinking of selling our condo.

343
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,400
We can use the money to start anew in Bukidnon.

344
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,433
Your grandma has a banana farm
that she has been asking me to manage.

345
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:52,633
I’ll have less worries if we live there.

346
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,900
Ma, what if I decide to stay here? 

347
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,766
I have only one year to go before I graduate.

348
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:04,200
I can find a job once the lockdown is lifted.

349
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,100
I also make some money by live streaming.

350
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,566
Promise, you won’t have to worry about me.

351
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:13,300
I understand your concern, Cairo.

352
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,466
This is where you grew up and your friends are here.

353
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:22,366
You’re old enough to make a decision for yourself.

354
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:24,466
But son… 

355
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,466
this is a big move for me too

356
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:32,333
and I really need your support.

357
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:38,400
I have no one to depend on but you, my children.

358
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:42,600
And I’m sure,

359
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,466
it would make your Papa sad

360
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:50,233
if we got separated from each other.

361
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,733
I understand, Ma.

362
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,500
Hey guys! It’s your girl, Pearl!
Welcome to my channel!

363
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,633
So annoying!

364
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,433
One more.

365
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:42,400
Hey, guys.

366
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,200
It’s your girl, Pearl.

367
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,866
Welcome to my channel!

368
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:53,166
That’s not it.

369
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,466
I hate it.

370
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:05,533
Pearl, can we do your makeup tutorial
some other time?

371
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,700
But why?

372
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,900
He’s telling me this now?

373
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,666
I already have all my stuff laid out!

374
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,766
Oh my God!

375
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:27,500
Calm down!

376
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,133
Breathe.

377
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,033
Hi.

378
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,966
Oh no.

379
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:48,266
You’re leaving us?

380
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,433
Are you serious? Have you spoken to Gav?

381
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:51,433
Not yet.

382
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,433
Are you telling him?

383
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:55,900
Promise, I won’t drink so I can keep my mouth shut.

384
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Is it final?

385
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,733
Mama’s already decided.

386
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:03,100
- But you don’t agree with her?
- If it were up to me, I’d rather stay here. 

387
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,200
But, of course, I understand why
she wants us to move.

388
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,833
I used to put myself first all the time.

389
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,833
Look where it got us.

390
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,300
This time, I want to focus on my family. 

391
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,300
After what I put them through,

392
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,933
this is the least I can do for Mama.

393
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,800
It’s my duty to help her recover.

394
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,733
I understand. But what happens to you and Gav? 

395
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:27,233
I really don’t know what kind of relationship we have, 
or if it’s even going to work.

396
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:29,100
You have to at least try,

397
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,266
if you want to know if it will work.

398
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,300
You’re afraid you’ll get hurt?

399
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,366
I’m afraid I might be the one to hurt Gav.

400
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:37,600
He’s excited we’ll be seeing each other soon. 

401
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,266
He has so many plans.

402
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,266
I’m excited, too.

403
00:22:43,966 --> 00:22:48,533
But right now, there are more important things
I need to attend to.

404
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,233
I understand. But it’s so sad.

405
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:53,733
Virtual hug?

406
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:54,733
Please.

407
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Baby,

408
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:00,933
Apo Island is also a great place for snorkeling.

409
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:03,533
We’ll swim with the turtles. It’ll be fun.

410
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:05,000
I did some research. 

411
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Jomalig Island is also nice.

412
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,633
It’s no far from Manila. It’s just in Quezon Province.

413
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:10,266
You want to go there?

414
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:12,466
Baby?

415
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:14,233
Baby?

416
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:17,566
Do we have a problem?
You don’t seem excited.

417
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:20,166
It’s nothing.

418
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,866
By the way, when are you bringing meals
for the frontliners?

419
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:27,066
Probably next week, according to Pearl.

420
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,733
- Are you going?
- I think so.

421
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:32,266
Pearl’s food riders will be busy after the lockdown.

422
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:33,000
Why?

423
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,133
Nothing.

424
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:36,600
Just be careful.

425
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,433
Of course, baby.

426
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,533
I need to tell you something.

427
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:45,533
What, baby?

428
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:48,766
I’m all ears. Is this what I’ve been
waiting to hear?

429
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:49,766
No.

430
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:50,766
Ouch.

431
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:52,733
No. I mean,

432
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,066
let’s not talk about it here.

433
00:23:57,066 --> 00:24:00,900
I want to tell it to you...

434
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,800
personally.

435
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:07,633
- What are you saying…
- What I’m saying is…

436
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:11,966
It’s time for us to meet, baby.
