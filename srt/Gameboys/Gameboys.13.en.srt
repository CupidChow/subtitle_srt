1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,833
What’s up with these two?

2
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:08,033
They’re still not talking?

3
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:16,800
Listening to “Lifetime” by Ben&Ben.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,500
What a drama queen.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Just make up already.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,200
Leave Ben&Ben out of this.

7
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,400
Let’s check out baby boy’s drama.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,833
Wow best acting by an emoji!

9
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,133
What a baby.

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,200
Babes!

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,900
What’s up?

12
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,433
What’s going on?

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,100
Still not talking?

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,400
Really?

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,633
SEENderellas?

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,633
Pearl.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,300
Cai.

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,300
Gav.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Pearl, please!

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,133
You’re still on mute!

21
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:36,133
Sorry about that.

22
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:39,000
I don’t care if you get angry at me.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,400
I know I’m crossing the line, but who cares?

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
You’ve been throwing hints at each other.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,133
Why don’t you talk it out?

26
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:47,533
You made me your referee last time.

27
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,600
I might as well do it again.

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,033
OK, let’s go to the bottom of this.

29
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:55,800
I want to know everything from the top.

30
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,200
Oh my God! I’m so witty!

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,700
Admit it. That was funny, right?

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,533
No? You don’t care? Seriously?

33
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:13,433
You still refuse to talk?

34
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,700
You think I didn’t come prepared?

35
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,800
You’re really testing my stalking skills—

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,100
I mean my research skills.

37
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,800
This is just like the tabloid talk show “Face to Face.”
Wait.

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,933
- Pearl, what’s this?
- What are they doing here?

39
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:31,800
- You’re making things worse!
- This is not funny, Pearl.

40
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,600
Are you done? Great.

41
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,100
At least you’re talking now.

42
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,633
You left me no choice!

43
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:43,000
You refuse to tell me the problem.
I had to dig through your social media.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,600
Apparently,

45
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,500
Terrence is involved.

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,900
I also found out about Wesley.

47
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,033
Unbelievable.

48
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,633
I got so busy with my love life,

49
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,100
that I didn’t even notice what’s happening
on earth.

50
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,300
Gav, Cai, sorry.

51
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:03,600
Pearl said you were fighting and
she asked for our help.

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Yup.

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,700
Based on the evidence I gathered,

54
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,700
I’m certain it’s just a misunderstanding.

55
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,400
So I invited them to clear things up.

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,333
It’s a good thing they’re willing to cooperate.

57
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,400
I usually let you guys settle things on your own,

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,900
but this is the longest you haven’t spoken
to each other.

59
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,900
I’m just worried, being the president of
your fans club.

60
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,800
Whatever I can do to help, I’m game.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,033
What do you want us to do?

62
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:34,800
Hopefully we can have a conversation like adults

63
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,000
and fix this.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,400
By the way, thank you,
Wesley for answering my messages.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,600
You’re every bit as cute as your pictures show.

66
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
That’s cute to you?

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,500
I mean, of course, you’re cuter Gav.

68
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,300
You’re my best friend…

69
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,300
but objectively speaking,
you’re also cute Wesley.

70
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,200
Show-off, not cute.

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,700
Gav, if you have something to say,
say it to my face.

72
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,633
- Stop grumbling to yourself.
- Wes!

73
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,033
But you really are a show-off.

74
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,433
How am I show-off?

75
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:09,000
You’re always trying to get my baby’s attention.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,333
You know he has a boyfriend.

77
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,633
- Stop making trouble.
- Gav, stop it.

78
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:12,933
I’m not making trouble.

79
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,933
I’m just helping him out.

80
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,100
Please don’t project your insecurity to me.

81
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,200
Insecure?

82
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,500
Me?

83
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,133
I’m not insecure with you!

84
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:22,533
Just because you’re a math genius,

85
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:23,900
you think it makes people insecure?

86
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
That was just a TV commercial, OK?

87
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,433
I wouldn’t be acting this way without a
good reason.

88
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:29,533
Admit it.

89
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:30,733
You like Cairo, don’t you?

90
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,800
- Baby, we’ve talked about this—
- Admit it!

91
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,933
Gav!

92
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:34,700
Admit it!

93
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,300
Gav!

94
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,900
Well?

95
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,700
Yes!

96
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,100
- If that’s what you want to know-
- See.

97
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,733
But it’s just a happy crush.

98
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:45,333
I wasn’t even planning to tell Cai.

99
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,400
In the first place, I respect your relationship.

100
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,333
Second, I know it will just pass.

101
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,000
Did you hear that, baby?

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,900
See, I was right.
You think you’re always right.

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,600
OK.

104
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,633
That’s a good start.
At least we all got to express our feelings.

105
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:13,500
But please, stop resorting to name calling.

106
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,200
It’s not helping our discussion.

107
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Now who else wants to share their feelings?

108
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Pearl, I think we should let them talk alone.

109
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,000
We’re probably not helping by being here.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,233
Wow.

111
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,233
You should have thought of that
before causing trouble.

112
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:32,400
Sorry, Cai. That wasn’t my intention.

113
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,233
I’ve heard that from you before.

114
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,233
But do you really mean it?

115
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,300
Again, I apologize.

116
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
Gav needed someone to talk to.

117
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,200
I needed the same.

118
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,533
I thought we were okay since you already
unblocked me.

119
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,900
I guess I’ve overstayed my welcome.

120
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,300
Cai, sorry.

121
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:55,100
Sorry but I can’t believe you anymore.

122
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,633
I’m just being honest.

123
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,433
It’s just too soon.

124
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:00,533
You’re meddling in our relationship again.

125
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,200
I wish you thought of that too, baby.

126
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,200
We talk from morning to evening.

127
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,633
We talk when we eat together.

128
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,100
Why do you need to talk to him?

129
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,200
It never crossed your mind
that there are things I can’t tell you?

130
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,800
It’s hard for me to talk about you leaving.

131
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Didn’t we already talk about this?

132
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
I thought you’re OK?

133
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,200
I’m not OK.

134
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:25,300
I’m not OK with you leaving.

135
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,100
Then that wise-ass shows up.

136
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,733
You know I’m jealous,
and you still insist we become friends.

137
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:31,733
What about Pearl?

138
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,400
She’s your ex but it’s not an issue.

139
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,933
Wait. Why is it my fault?

140
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,200
Pearl is not the issue here.

141
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,600
You can say that again.

142
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,100
The issue here is you!

143
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,600
Hey.

144
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,200
You’re arguing like you don’t love
each other anymore.

145
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,633
I think both of you have valid points.

146
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,500
You can work this out.

147
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:53,000
You’ve been through so much.

148
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,400
Are you just going to give up now?

149
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,800
Let’s just talk some other time, Pearl.

150
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,733
I agree.

151
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,200
Hey, wait.

152
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,000
Unbelievable.

153
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:10,000
It didn’t work.

154
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,233
On “Face to Face,” all problems get resolved.

155
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,400
Hi.

156
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,700
By the way, I’m Wesley.

157
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,900
We weren’t introduced formally.

158
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,200
Terrence here.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,800
I wanted to say nice meeting you,

160
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,400
but there’s nothing nice about this situation we’re in.

161
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,900
Yeah.

162
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,600
This meet-cute isn’t cute.

163
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,800
Seriously?

164
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,700
Fixing is my jam.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,733
Sometimes it’s a problem.

166
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:15,400
I have to learn to trust
that people can fix themselves.

167
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,033
Gav, sorry.

168
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,200
You and Cai are fighting again because of me.

169
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,400
It’s not your fault.

170
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,100
He’s just pissed at me.

171
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,500
He knows we did nothing wrong.

172
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,733
He’s just looking for someone to blame.

173
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,533
You know why he’s acting the way he is?

174
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,133
Then just make up already.

175
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,200
I want to.

176
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:39,400
But?

177
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,600
A part of me is wondering
if I made the right decision.

178
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,900
The first time I met him,

179
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,433
all my doubts disappeared.

180
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:49,600
I realized how much I love him.

181
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,433
But seeing his jealous side

182
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,533
makes me realize there’s a lot
I don’t know about him.

183
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:57,533
So?

184
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:01,133
You have the whole lifetime
to get to know each other.

185
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,700
I suppose. I really miss him.

186
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,700
Then what are you waiting for?

187
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,533
Every time we have a problem,

188
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,700
it’s so easy for him to give up.

189
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,200
He forgets everything we’ve been through.

190
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,800
He doesn’t care about my feelings.

191
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,900
Gav, you have to remember
that this is all new to Cai.

192
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,200
He probably doesn’t know how to handle this.

193
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,800
We all know he’s emotional.

194
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,600
But lately, I’ve noticed
you have also become emotional.

195
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,300
This pandemic is not helping.

196
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,200
And that alien-looking smart-ass.

197
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,133
You mean Wesley?

198
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:40,300
He doesn’t look like Cai’s type.

199
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,900
What do you mean?

200
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,133
Now you’re fishing.

201
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,433
You’re the only guy he likes.

202
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,133
That’s why he’s so mad at me.

203
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:49,500
He’s being protective of you.

204
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Maybe.

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,800
But believe me, that smart-ass is after my baby.

206
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,900
As I’ve said, it’s just a crush.
Nothing serious.

207
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,033
Believe me, I wouldn’t go after you…

208
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,800
no offense.

209
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
None taken.

210
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
At least it’s clear.

211
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,700
I won’t say sorry for having a little crush on you.

212
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,100
But I will apologize for provoking him.

213
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,433
It made your boyfriend really mad.

214
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:17,733
You can be short-tempered at times.

215
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,733
This is Pearl’s fault.

216
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,100
She shouldn’t have done that.

217
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,033
Ssob, I like Pearl.

218
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:24,033
She’s fun.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,600
And Terrence seems cool.

220
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,200
Terrence?

221
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,533
Yuck.

222
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:33,000
Stop it.

223
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,100
Anyway, everything is set here in Bukidnon.

224
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,833
I already arranged your quarantine accommodation.

225
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,000
What about on your end?

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,333
My brother is taking care of everything.

227
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,000
We are scheduled for swab testing.

228
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,000
And we’re booking our flight tickets soon.

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
Nice.

230
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,333
So you’re all set.

231
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,300
Have you told Gav?

232
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:04,633
Baby…

233
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,333
Yes?

234
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,333
Wow.

235
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,300
Can you be more cold than that?

236
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Let’s talk.

237
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Yes, baby. I’ve been meaning to ask also.

238
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,100
OK, you want me to call you?

239
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,100
It’s better if we talk in person.

240
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:37,800
OK, baby. I think you’re right.

241
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,733
There’s a quiet place near our condo.

242
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,600
Let’s meet there.

243
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
How do we fix this?

244
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,500
You know I’m leaving.

245
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,100
How come you can’t accept it?

246
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,100
You got it wrong.

247
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:46,333
I’m trying my best to accept it, baby.

248
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,800
But it’s hard.

249
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:52,900
I’m just asking for a little help from you.

250
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,133
Baby, you make me feel so selfish.

251
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,133
I’ve always been here for you.

252
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:03,300
You’re not the only one having a hard time.

253
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,100
Just because I’m the one leaving,
you think it’s easy for me?

254
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:12,333
I want to stay.
But I have to take care of Mama first.

255
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:15,633
Baby, I know that.

256
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:18,033
If you do, then why are we fighting?

257
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:21,300
We’re fighting because you refuse
to understand my point.

258
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,400
I’m always here to reassure you when
you’re jealous or hurt.

259
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:28,300
But me?  I have no right to be jealous.

260
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,833
I have no right to be hurt.

261
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,400
It’s too much, baby.

262
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:38,200
Can’t you baby me for once?

263
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,400
Reassure me?

264
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,700
OK, Gav.

265
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:48,900
You want to talk about me leaving.

266
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
Then let’s talk.

267
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,033
Wow.

268
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,200
Can you be any more sincere?

269
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Crap.

270
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
What?

271
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,633
I said, crap!

272
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:03,600
Just turn me into a robot.
And make me say what you want to hear.

273
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:05,933
You insist it’s my fault.

274
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,800
The truth is, it’s your jealousy that’s
causing the problem.

275
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,900
You just want me to stop being friends with Wes.

276
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,500
It’s not happening Gav.

277
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,900
Being in this relationship

278
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,700
doesn’t give you the right to dictate
who I should be friends with.

279
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,733
Tell that to yourself.

280
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:23,300
Maybe you’ll stop questioning my
friendship with Terrence.

281
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
That’s different.

282
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,933
To you it’s different.

283
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,800
We’re going in circles, Gav.

284
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:40,600
Maybe this was a bad idea.

285
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,733
It just made our fight worse.

286
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,800
I thought that if we met,

287
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,400
we’d be able to solve our issues.

288
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,000
I thought so too.

289
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,300
Cairo, where are you?

290
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,200
I need help packing the kitchen.

291
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,233
- I’ve been looking for you.
- Ma…

292
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,900
Are you at the parking lot?

293
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,233
Ma,

294
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:21,833
the world didn’t stop.

295
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:24,433
Are you drunk?

296
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:27,600
Come up here, or do you want me to fetch you?

297
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Look Ma, time didn't stop.

298
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,300
And the world still keeps on turning.

299
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:44,000
I thought that by meeting him
we’d be able to solve our problems.

300
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,833
But it didn’t work.

301
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,500
There’s no more music.

302
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,100
There’s no more magic.

303
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:56,000
Did you break up with your fan?

304
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,200
I’m the one washing your
shirts and pillow cases.

305
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,433
You think you can hide anything from me?

306
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,900
We didn’t break up.

307
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,633
Not yet.

308
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,300
But it looks like we’re headed there.

309
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,200
We’re always fighting.

310
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,200
I’m not sure if we can handle an LDR.

311
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,700
And this pandemic isn’t helping.

312
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,500
It’s like the world doesn’t want us to be happy.

313
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,633
Leave the world out of this, son.

314
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:46,400
Have you forgotten

315
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,300
that your dad and I started out
on a long distance relationship?

316
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,700
He was working as a seafarer,

317
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,500
while I was still living in Bukidnon.

318
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
We were like that for 5 years

319
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,233
until we decided to settle down in Manila.

320
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:04,033
We didn’t see each other often.

321
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:06,200
And social media hasn’t been invented yet.

322
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,333
What was that like, Ma?

323
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,233
You just wrote letters to each other?

324
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,200
Excuse me.

325
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,500
We had a landline telephone back then.

326
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,100
Anyway,

327
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,433
my point is,

328
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:23,233
if you truly love each other,

329
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,533
distance shouldn’t be a problem.

330
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:31,233
But you really need to make an effort.

331
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:36,800
You have to nurture your love
for each other every day.

332
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,700
When the time is right,

333
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,400
your love is right.

334
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,633
Thank you, Ma.

335
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,400
It makes me feel a little better.

336
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:55,100
Now, come up here.

337
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,100
Promise you won’t kill me?

338
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,933
Stop it, Cairo.

339
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:07,333
Come up here and we’ll drink together.

340
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,900
Really, Ma.

341
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,733
Please remind your mom to bring
the documents with her.

342
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,833
Travel pass, medical certificate,

343
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,433
and the results of your swab tests.

344
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:53,233
My brother’s on it.

345
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,233
Stop reminding me.

346
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,500
Just making sure.

347
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,033
Does Gav know?

348
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,900
You didn’t tell him?

349
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,533
I don’t think I can say goodbye to him.

350
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Are you sure?

351
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,133
Cairo, that can wait.

352
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:22,533
We still have stuff to load.

353
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,700
OK.

354
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,333
I have to go.

355
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,100
Talk to you later.

356
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,300
See you soon.

357
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,400
- Pearl.
- Gavreel! Did you just wake up?

358
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,033
Yes. Why?

359
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,333
Were you drinking?

360
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,200
We just had our swab test.

361
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
I hope you didn’t go out last night.

362
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
No.

363
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,333
I was home drinking alone. Why?

364
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,033
Baby boy is on his way to the airport.

365
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,533
You’re not taking him to the airport?

366
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,300
Didn’t you talk about this?

367
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,700
Cairo’s leaving?

368
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,400
Idiot. That’s what I’ve been telling you.

369
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,533
Why didn’t he tell me?

370
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,100
How would I know?

371
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:08,233
What if he doesn’t want me there?

372
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,433
Maybe he doesn’t want me to see him leave?

373
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,800
So what?

374
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,900
I have to respect that.

375
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,500
I’m sure this is also difficult for him.

376
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,600
Sure?

377
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
It’s up to you.

378
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:41,200
Hey wait. Gavreel!

379
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,033
I have to see my baby.

380
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:46,400
I’m going after him.

381
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,233
I don’t care if he gets mad.

382
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:52,200
I can’t let him leave without patching things up.

383
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,833
He needs to hear how much I love him.

384
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:56,933
OK, best actor John Loyd Cruz.
Calm down.

385
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,933
Now get changed.

386
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
Move! Go!

387
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,600
Me too.

388
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,400
I forgot. I’m not the one going to the airport.

389
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,933
Pearl!

390
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,100
What?

391
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,633
What if I don’t catch him in time?

392
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:29,633
- Stop acting cute if you want to catch him!
- I don’t think I can handle it.

393
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:30,233
Don’t be stupid.

394
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,733
We can always book a flight.

395
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:35,433
We’ll go after him. We’ll find ways.

396
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:39,100
What if he doesn’t like me anymore?

397
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:42,033
Idiot.

398
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:48,500
Baby boy!

399
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,033
That’s him! He’s there!

400
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,833
Flip the camera. I want to see him!

401
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,433
I think I’m going crazy!

402
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:11,433
Hey Gav. Go get your man!

403
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,733
Love you, Pearl.

404
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:15,533
Love you. Bye!

405
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,233
Baby.

406
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,300
Did you really think I would just give up, baby?

407
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:47,933
Baby, please don’t cry. You’ll make me cry.

408
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,733
I won’t cry.

409
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,833
Everything you said was true.

410
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,500
I can be inconsiderate.

411
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,233
I got used to you always putting me first.

412
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:06,633
- No. I overreacted.
- See? You’re doing it again.

413
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,433
It’s difficult for me to leave…

414
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:15,633
but it never crossed my mind that
it’s also difficult for you.

415
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:18,233
Maybe even more so.

416
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,000
Sorry, baby.

417
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,400
I was selfish.

418
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:32,033
Look, I didn’t even bring flowers for you.

419
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,900
I’m sorry too.

420
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,700
I was unreasonable.

421
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,533
Please baby, don’t ever give up on us.

422
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:45,400
Breaking up won’t solve anything.

423
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,800
I’ll never agree to it.

424
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,833
That’s why I’m here, baby.

425
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,933
Cairo, are you and London on your way?

426
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:58,233
Yes we are.

427
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,600
I’m just waiting for your aunt.

428
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,500
She’s dropping me off at the airport.

429
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,600
Ma…

430
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,333
What’s the problem?

431
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:13,100
I’m just really sad, Ma.

432
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:17,900
You understand why we’re moving
to Bukidnon, right?

433
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,333
Yes, Ma.

434
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,833
I just don’t want to experience life with so many what ifs.

435
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,100
You know what I mean?

436
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,400
I hate this pandemic.

437
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,300
OK.

438
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,000
We don’t yet have a buyer for the condo.

439
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:53,533
If you want you can stay there with your fan.

440
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:54,533
Gav.

441
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,300
His name is Gavreel Alarcon.

442
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,100
But son,

443
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,200
I can only give you a week.

444
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,100
Settle what you have to settle.

445
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,000
I won’t stop worrying until our family is complete.

446
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,600
I understand, Ma.

447
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:12,300
Thank you.

448
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,100
Ma, I love you.

449
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,533
I love you too, son.

450
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,133
You’re not leaving?

451
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,233
We won’t be apart anymore?

452
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:27,100
I’m only here for a week.

453
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:32,200
I have to be with Mama,
and help her start anew.

454
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,633
But for now…

455
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,733
the important thing is I’m here.

456
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,233
Baby,

457
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,800
didn’t you hear what I said?

458
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Why are you still crying?

459
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,000
I’m happy.

460
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,933
But I’m also embarrassed by how I behaved.

461
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:03,433
I reacted that way because

462
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,700
I’m afraid of being abandoned again.

463
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,700
You know my story.

464
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,400
I was so young when my parents died.

465
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,300
And then my grandma also left me.

466
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,600
I’m terrified of losing you, baby.

467
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,400
I don’t think I’d be able to handle losing you.

468
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,800
Baby, I will never leave you.

469
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,600
I won’t allow it to happen.

470
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:34,533
I’m still a little overwhelmed
because this is so new to me.

471
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,500
But one thing I’m sure of is that
I love you, baby.

472
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:44,500
I will fight for our love,

473
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,833
wherever I go.

474
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,600
You’ve really gotten good at charming me, baby.

475
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Idiot.

476
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,700
Baby,

477
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:03,033
I’m sorry if you felt I didn’t trust you.

478
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,500
I’ve kept you to myself too much.

479
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,400
What?

480
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,800
Don’t be cheesy.

481
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,200
I’m also selfish when it comes to you.

482
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,733
Is that true, baby?

483
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,033
Yes,

484
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:16,733
my annoying baby.

485
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,400
I love hearing you say that.

486
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,200
Wait.

487
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,133
Does this mean you will be staying with me?

488
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,600
Just like a married couple.

489
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Idiot.

490
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:33,733
I’m just sleeping over.

491
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,200
It’s a good thing I changed my sheets.

492
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,800
You’re sleeping on the floor, idiot.

493
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
It’s OK.

494
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,900
As long as we’re together.

495
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
I’ll remember that.

496
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,500
What’s that, baby?

497
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,433
You also had a swab test, baby?

498
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:02,400
We’ve been delivering free meals to hospitals.

499
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:05,500
Pearl’s dad had all the volunteers tested.

500
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,533
For everyone’s safety.

501
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,000
That’s great.

502
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,200
We’re both negative.

503
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,200
It only means one thing, baby.

504
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,800
Idiot. What are you doing?

505
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,200
Baby…

506
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:29,200
Our hearts

507
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,200
now beat as one

508
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,900
My love

509
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:40,500
no one can take your place

510
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:50,200
I can’t wait

511
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,300
for your kiss and embrace

512
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:02,933
My heart is yours

513
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:10,100
Take me along

514
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,700
Now,

515
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,300
I'm yours

516
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,500
Finally, we're free.

517
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:50,200
Now

518
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,033
Yummy.

519
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,500
Eat me. I mean, let’s eat.

520
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,400
Don’t be naughty.

521
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,100
Why? Can I take a bite?

522
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,233
One bite?

523
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:27,900
Say aaah.

524
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,700
Aaaaah.

525
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,900
That’s not fair.

526
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,133
We can’t share our food.

527
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:37,900
But we already kissed.

528
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,633
It doesn’t matter.

529
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:42,000
Just eat your food.

530
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Baby, you told me you’re a great cook.

531
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,900
What did you cook for me?

532
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,700
Well…

533
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,300
pizza is a special thing for us, right?

534
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,933
Special? But we’re always eating it.

535
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Don’t be like that.

536
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,100
I’m just joking.

537
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,500
The pizza is delicious. Thanks.

538
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,800
You’re more delicious.

539
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,700
It’s more delicious when I eat with you.

540
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,700
Really?

541
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Whatever.

542
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,300
Why? Stop teasing me.

543
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:36,000
You want a kiss?

544
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,800
A long one.

545
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,300
Pearl.

546
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,833
How did you get in?

547
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,400
I used to live here, remember?

548
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,000
Baby…

549
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,733
social distancing!

550
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,700
Really? Excuse me.

551
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,600
We both did a swab test and
we’re negative.

552
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,300
I’m so clean.

553
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,100
Unlike you.
Who knows what you’ve been doing?

554
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,500
She’s negative.

555
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,033
Pearl!

556
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,000
Baby.

557
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,600
What?

558
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,133
We’ll eat first, Pearl.

559
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,600
Pearl!

560
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Be serious, Pearl.

561
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,033
Let’s dance the pandemic away.

562
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:48,500
- Baby.
- Baby boy, join us.

563
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,200
You two look silly!

564
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,633
I love this song! Let’s go!

565
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:59,533
- Go baby boy!
- Join us.

566
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:08,800
I can’t stop

567
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,900
I can’t resist

568
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Wondering what this is about

569
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,533
I'm confused

570
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:21,833
Are you for real?

571
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:25,000
I admit

572
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,033
You’ve won me over

573
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:28,733
It's annoying

574
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:31,000
You’re just lucky

575
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,400
Did you trick me

576
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,000
Into falling for you?

577
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,200
Don’t ever think

578
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,133
I fall in love easy

579
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:52,700
My heart can be choosy

580
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,900
But your voice is magic

581
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,000
And I’m enchanted

582
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I surrender

583
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,033
You’ve won me over

584
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:09,533
My heart is yours

585
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,133
Good night.

586
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:13,800
Good night, baby.

587
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:15,333
It’s cold.

588
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,100
Hey.

589
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,000
Mama had a talk with you, remember?

590
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Stop it.

591
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Go to sleep.

592
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,300
- Baby you want me to tell you bedtime stories?
- Hug this pillow instead!

593
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,400
Hug it.

594
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,333
You’re so mean to me, baby.

595
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,700
Just stay on your side, baby. OK?

596
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,900
I’m sleepy, baby. Stop being annoying.

597
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,433
- Go to sleep. Good night.
- OK good night.

598
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,600
- Baby, please!
- What do you want for breakfast, baby?

599
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,633
You’re so annoying!

600
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,400
You want me to cook eggs?

601
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,433
- Here cook this!
- Hotdog?

602
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,500
Crap!

603
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,633
I saw that, baby.

604
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,333
Idiot.

605
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
What do you want to do, baby?

606
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
It’s up to you, baby.
