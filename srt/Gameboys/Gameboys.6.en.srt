1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,266
What's on your mind, Cai?

2
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:09,966
This is so annoying!

3
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,100
"Saying sorry to someone you love is hard.

4
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:27,100
But it’s easier than losing someone you love
for not saying sorry."

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,166
Why should I say sorry?

6
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,233
I miss you, baby. 

7
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:43,600
I’m sure you miss me too.

8
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,700
Admit it.

9
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:48,700
Of course not.

10
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,633
Why would I miss you?

11
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:07,400
So annoying!

12
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:15,900
"How many times have you gotten 
your heart broken?"

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,766
Once.

14
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,066
But it might happen again.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,866
"What is the sweetest thing 
you’ve done?"

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,533
I became a gamer.

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,800
"Who’s your crush?"

18
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,933
- Pearl.
- Hey! What happened?

19
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:46,933
Huh?

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,366
Oh don’t act like you don’t know.

21
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:54,166
OK. It’s my fault. 
I wasn’t thinking straight.

22
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:57,233
Maybe you should tell that to him.

23
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:59,900
I’ve been calling him, Pearl. 
He’s not answering.

24
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,366
Gav can be a baby sometimes.

25
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:03,800
Tell me what happened.

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,033
If it’s his fault, I’ll go to his house and kick his ass.

27
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,533
- I said something stupid.
- Tell me already. 

28
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,900
I’m about to watch “Crash Landing On You.”

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,000
It wasn’t intentional. 

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,166
I told him he was using...

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
...his grandma’s death to get close to me.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,433
Oh my God! How could you say that?

33
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:32,300
Unbelievable. 

34
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,400
I’d smack you on the head for saying that.

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,933
He’s very sensitive when it comes to his grandmother.

36
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:40,433
He locked himself in the house for months after her death.

37
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:42,700
That’s why I moved in with him temporarily.

38
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,533
So he was telling me the truth?

39
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,933
I don’t know exactly what Gav told you, OK?

40
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:50,300
But he would never lie about his grandmother.

41
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:51,966
Wait a minute.

42
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:53,933
Why did you even think that?

43
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,733
Well… 

44
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,500
It was Terrence. He mentioned it to me.

45
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,033
Terrence?

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,266
How do you know that idiot?

47
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:09,466
He saw me in the photo you posted.

48
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:11,300
He reached out to befriend me. 

49
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,666
Cairo. There’s a lot I want to tell you.

50
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,700
Why would you believe Terrence over Gav?

51
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,866
I don’t want to meddle and make matters worse.

52
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,166
It’s up to you if you want to reconcile.

53
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:32,433
But you two are really cute together.

54
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,766
I stan for CaiReel. 

55
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:36,066
And now

56
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,833
my CaiReel heart is breaking.

57
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:41,800
What should I do?

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,166
I have suggestions, but it’s not my place to tell you.

59
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,333
Do think I should say sorry?

60
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,300
You hurt his feelings, didn’t you?

61
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,400
I know. 

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
I really feel guilty. 

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,133
You should.

64
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:02,700
Whatever your decision is, 
I’ll support you, OK?

65
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,266
I have to go. CLOY is about to start. Bye.

66
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:08,333
Thank you, Pearl.

67
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:09,800
Bye.

68
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,800
"Have you kissed a girl?"

69
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,033
Yes. And I liked it.

70
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,500
Up or down?

71
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,966
Of course, up.

72
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,300
Who wants down, down, down?

73
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,033
Slow or fast?

74
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:38,033
I like to start slow...

75
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:41,133
and then fast, fast, fast!

76
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,566
Hey. What’s up?

77
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,666
What happened to you? 

78
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:55,166
You look miserable. Did you miss me that much?

79
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,266
I just woke up.

80
00:04:57,266 --> 00:05:00,400
What's so important that you have to disturb me?

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,633
So now I’m disturbing you?

82
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:04,500
You used to call this a booty call.

83
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Idiot.

84
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,633
So what is this about?

85
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:07,633
Why?

86
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,666
Can’t I just say hello?

87
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,766
Of course you can. 
It’s just that I don’t feel well today.

88
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:15,866
Are you OK? Do you want me to go there?

89
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,033
No. I just need to sleep.

90
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,033
Is that so? 

91
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,333
Did you get my delivery? 

92
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,133
Did you send this?

93
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:32,233
I thought it came from Pearl.

94
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,566
You haven’t touched it. 

95
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,066
Was it delivered too early?

96
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:39,633
I don’t like sweet stuff. 

97
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
But thanks.

98
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,300
Gav,

99
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,933
- I miss you⁠—
- I really have to go and rest.

100
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,166
Okay then. 

101
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,200
- Get well soon, love.
- Bye, Terrence.

102
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,833
"What’s the most difficult thing to admit?"

103
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:05,133
When I know I’m wrong.

104
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,266
"What’s one thing you regret?"

105
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:14,733
No comment.

106
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,566
"Do you like someone?"

107
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:23,766
Next!

108
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,233
"You have been invited to a super secret party.

109
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:34,366
If you accept the invitation, click the link. 

110
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:38,833
If you decline, block the one who is victorious."

111
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,700
Wow. This looks fun

112
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:43,200
Click the link, of course.

113
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:48,100
"Only you can see this post.

114
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,300
In order to be accepted to the party,

115
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,133
you need to find the hidden message."

116
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,133
Oh.

117
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:56,166
So it’s a game. 

118
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,166
But where’s the message?

119
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,833
This is probably from Victorious.

120
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,300
"The party is exclusive to my friends."

121
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,833
OK I get it.

122
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,866
What's this about?

123
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:24,300
What am I looking for?

124
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:28,400
This is not a clue.

125
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,933
First come, first served.

126
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,600
First come, first served?

127
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,133
First picture? This one?

128
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,666
But where’s the hidden message?

129
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,666
Let’s G? 

130
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,766
What is this? G, what? 

131
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,233
G, where? 

132
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,766
G... Gee...

133
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:55,366
Gee?

134
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,366
Oh… 

135
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,866
Gee-mail.

136
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,600
"Congratulations! 

137
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,300
You’re one step to making it to the party.

138
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,600
If you still want to join the party,

139
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,900
reply yes."

140
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:34,033
Yes!

141
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,666
Let me greet you with hello

142
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,066
Please don’t be annoyed

143
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,066
When you speak, 

144
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,300
I’ll try to be nice

145
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,933
But sometimes you are too much

146
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,166
I’m not used to this attention

147
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,366
You calling me, and courting me

148
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:03,366
I feel nervous,

149
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,700
butterflies in my stomach

150
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,266
Stop grinning

151
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:08,833
Please listen

152
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,200
and grant my wish

153
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,600
Accept my apologies

154
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,166
I admit I was wrong

155
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,500
I lost, I made a mistake

156
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,166
I said the wrong things

157
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,033
I’m not making an excuse

158
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:26,400
But I wonder if I’m enough

159
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,266
I’ve seen people leave

160
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,666
It makes me want to disappear

161
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,066
I know I should trust you

162
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:36,233
I’ll try to be better

163
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,666
I promise not to commit 

164
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,133
the same mistakes

165
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:44,000
You light up my world

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,966
You’re the reason I wake up

167
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:48,433
I messed up, please don’t end what we have

168
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:51,000
I want to make everything right

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,066
So angel of peace

170
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:55,466
Please forgive me.

171
00:09:55,466 --> 00:10:00,833
This game we play is what connects us to each other.

172
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,133
Angel of peace

173
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:05,566
Please accept my apologies

174
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:11,500
This game we play is what connects us to each other.

175
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,366
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,500
Why did you change your clothes? 

177
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,033
You were so cute in your costume.

178
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,766
You’d just make fun of me. 
Like what you’re doing now.

179
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:26,766
Hey.

180
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:29,500
You’re saying sorry but you’re not looking at me.

181
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,466
How would I know if you’re sincere?

182
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,633
Wasn’t that sincere enough for you?

183
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,466
Look at you.

184
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,900
Apologizing and being grumpy about it. 

185
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,366
You haven’t even said sorry.

186
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:42,500
I’m not good at saying sorry.

187
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,166
It’s not about being good at it. 

188
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,600
I’m sorry then. 

189
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,833
I’m sorry.

190
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:55,633
I shouldn’t have said those things.

191
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,633
I shouldn’t have doubted you
and your story about your grandma.

192
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,166
Sorry, I was wrong.

193
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,000
It won’t happen again.

194
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,100
What?

195
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,200
Can’t you forgive me?

196
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,866
No.

197
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:26,200
No, I cannot resist you.

198
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:29,500
If you hadn’t called, I would have.

199
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Really? 

200
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:33,666
So we’re okay?

201
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,666
Give me a kiss first.

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,966
You’re so annoying!

203
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,833
I missed annoying you, baby.

204
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,400
You didn’t talk to me for days.

205
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,066
I was upset at first. 

206
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,566
I’m sensitive when it comes to my grandma.

207
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:52,733
The next day, my stomach was also upset. 

208
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,100
I must have eaten something bad. 

209
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,866
That’s why I couldn’t answer your call.

210
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,366
- All the while I thought…
- You thought what? 

211
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:02,866
That I would disappear from your life completely?

212
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:04,433
You’re too much.

213
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,033
You’re a dork.

214
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:07,700
So why an angel?

215
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,466
I thought I was the angel.

216
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:11,200
I’m not dressing up as a devil.

217
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:13,000
It’s so not me.

218
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Of course.

219
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,966
But if I’m the angel of peace, what angel are you?

220
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,700
I don’t know. 

221
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,200
Any ideas?

222
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I know! 

223
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,766
What?

224
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,766
Angel of mine.

225
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,833
Dumbass. 

226
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,966
Is there such a thing?

227
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,433
Yeah. Like the song.

228
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,000
Monica’s version.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,366
You’re so cheesy.

230
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,033
That’s why you like me. 

231
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,400
How does your rap go again?

232
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,233
Come on!

233
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,700
Stop it. You can’t even get it right.

234
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,633
And what gives you the idea I like you?

235
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,566
You don’t have to say anything.

236
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,266
Your actions say it all.

237
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,133
You assume too much.

238
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,833
I missed you, baby.

239
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,333
Idiot. 

240
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,600
"What’s one thing you can do for love?"

241
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,900
Anything, and everything.

242
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,833
"Have you cheated on someone?"

243
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,366
Never.

244
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,833
Are you bitter and unhappy?

245
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,833
Absolutely not.

246
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:53,466
What’s up, Terrence? What’s the emergency?

247
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,633
Just Terrence? So formal. 

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,933
Can you just call me love? 

249
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,633
Just like old times.

250
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:01,966
- Are you drunk?
- Not yet.

251
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,200
You know I have a high tolerance for alcohol.

252
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,000
Are you and Michelle having problems?

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,300
Michelle and I are over, for a long time now.

254
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,633
Really. So what's the problem?

255
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,033
You.

256
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,166
Me?

257
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,666
Yes, you. 

258
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:17,266
I miss you.

259
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:19,266
Terrence, can you hear what you’re saying-

260
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:22,166
Wait, before you say anything… 

261
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,133
I’m adding someone to this call.

262
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,733
Cairo? Terrence, what is this about?

263
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:36,500
Am I supposed to be here?

264
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,400
- I think I’m disturbing you two.
-Guys, relax. OK?

265
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:43,366
I just want us to have a talk.

266
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,233
Wait. Why is Pearl here?

267
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,300
I consulted her

268
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:52,066
if I should accept your invitation.

269
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,500
Why?

270
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,466
I wasn’t sure about your intentions.

271
00:14:57,466 --> 00:15:00,066
I guess she’s just concerned. 
She wants to keep me company.

272
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,700
Sure, why not? The more, the merrier.

273
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,200
Wait, Gav’s here?

274
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:09,633
Hi.

275
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:11,066
So what is this about? 

276
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:13,600
Are you having a threesome? 
Am I getting in the way?

277
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,066
I actually just wanted to apologize to Cai.

278
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:19,033
Apologize? 

279
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21,166
- Why? Do you know each other?
- Yes.

280
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,833
He’s the one who told me the story about your grandma.

281
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,166
He told me a lot of lies. 

282
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,933
- I’m so stupid to believe him.
- Why, Terrence?

283
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:32,866
I thought you wanted to be friends again, 
that’s why I started talking to you.

284
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:36,100
- You just wanted to cause trouble.
- I think you have a lot to talk about.

285
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,500
I’ll just leave.

286
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:38,566
Baby, please stay.

287
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:40,033
Baby? 

288
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,166
How sweet.

289
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,800
Is that the reason why you can’t call me ‘love’?

290
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:48,966
Sorry, I don’t want to be mean.

291
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:50,633
But you’re a cheater.

292
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:55,033
- And you expect Gav to still call you ‘love’? The nerve!

293
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:57,200
Screw this!

294
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,433
I made a mistake, OK?

295
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,866
I messed up.

296
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,533
Gav,

297
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,666
leaving you was the worst decision I ever made. 

298
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,400
And I’m sorry. 

299
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,900
Gav… 

300
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,133
come back to me, love.

301
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:28,400
Please.

302
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,033
Is he for real?

303
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:32,933
This is crazy. Just like a KDrama.

304
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,533
Terrence, I’ve forgiven you long ago.

305
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:41,533
You left me for Michelle, when I was at my lowest
because of grandma’s death.

306
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,500
But I tried to get past it.

307
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,566
I respected your decision.

308
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:50,366
Now I’m asking you to respect my feelings for Cairo.

309
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:52,933
Are you officially a couple?

310
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,066
We will get there. We’re not in a hurry.

311
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:57,666
What do you see in him? 
He’s just a passing fancy.

312
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,833
A hobby you’ll forget about soon enough.

313
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,833
Gav…

314
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,066
We’re more compatible. 

315
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:06,566
We like the same things. We like going to the same places.

316
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:08,100
And for fuck’s sake, 

317
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,066
we even used to have the same taste in women.

318
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Our bond is much deeper.

319
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,233
Unlike that skinny lizard!

320
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,666
Me? A skinny lizard? 

321
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,666
What about you, you slimy, needy frog!

322
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,166
At least I’m no fame whore.

323
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,000
How is Cairo a fame whore?

324
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,133
Come on! He’s always live-streaming for attention!

325
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,333
I’m a gamer, you idiot. 

326
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:31,933
You’re pathetic. 

327
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:34,766
Begging for attention from a person
who doesn’t want you.

328
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:36,933
- You’re a jerk!
- And you’re a moron!

329
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:41,033
Hey, calm down!
What’s this, a virtual cat fight?

330
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:43,533
The world is stressful enough right now.

331
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:45,866
Why can’t you discuss this calmly?

332
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:48,500
You’re just too desirable, Gav! 

333
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,366
I’m out of here.

334
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:52,500
I want to stay and gossip, 

335
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,333
but you guys should fix this on your own.

336
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,833
No more swearing, okay? You’re better than that.

337
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,466
Bye.

338
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,166
Gav…

339
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,166
can’t we just get back together again?

340
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,100
I’m so stupid for letting you go.

341
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:12,600
I don’t care if I look like a fool…

342
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,933
Love, please… come back to me.

343
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:16,800
We’re done, Terrence.

344
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:20,066
I’m never coming back to you.

345
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,166
How can you even like this guy? 

346
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,633
He’s so grouchy.

347
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:25,300
Only to you.

348
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,000
He can be grumpy at times.

349
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:28,933
Say what?

350
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:32,300
But he’s also caring.

351
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,766
Especially with his family.

352
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:37,000
We’ve known each other for a short time,

353
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,033
but I’ll stand by him against anyone. Even you.

354
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,333
You’ll fight for him?

355
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,600
Will he also fight for you?

356
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,700
And in the first place… does he even like you?

357
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,733
Why are you quiet?

358
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:53,600
You don’t know?

359
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,566
Be honest now.

360
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:58,166
Just answer yes or no.

361
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:03,366
Just say that you like him, 

362
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:05,200
and I will stop pursuing him.

363
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,066
I will stop bothering you.

364
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:15,666
But if you’re not into him, 

365
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:23,366
then I will do everything to win him back,
even if he says he’s over me.

366
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,300
- Terrence, stop it.
- No.

367
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,200
Let’s hear it from the man of the hour. 

368
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,400
Cairo, do you like Gav?

369
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,466
Yes or no?

370
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:46,666
Is there hope for us

371
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:52,900
Now that he wants you back

372
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:57,566
I’ll give my heart

373
00:19:57,566 --> 00:20:01,666
And my life for you

374
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:08,266
Just to see you happy
