1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,680
Karan.

2
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,520
How did you know it was going to rain ?

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,560
They say Karan is really beautiful.

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,200
So, you know her?

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,880
She's the same person I told you about.

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,640
She's the same person I told you about.

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,200
Doctor Kaomesa that I've been searching for.

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,560
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,400
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,560
Yay !

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,440
I don't want to see you
in another danger.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,480
So, I'm driving you back to your dorm.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,360
Karan !

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,080
Did you drive me to my dorm ?

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,560
I didn't see you last night.

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,400
So...

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
I have a case.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,880
I gotta go.

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,400
The incident 7 years ago

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,920
You were really my life-saver, right?

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
I wasn't imagining or dreaming things, was I ?

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,720
Karan, answer me.

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,800
I'm asking if you were the one
who saved me from all of this !

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,960
Yes.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,640
It was me who saved you.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,479
I helped treating your amputated arm.

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,360
I pulled you back onto the curb,
so that you wouldn't get hit by that car.

28
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,000
And it was me...

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,039
...who asked you not to commit
another suicide, but what is this ?

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,360
Why are you doing this today ?

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,680
Don't you love yourself, extern ?

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,120
That's why you came up here ?

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,919
But why...

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,040
Why do you have to pretend
like we don't know one another ?

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm afraid.

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,480
Afraid ?

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,800
I'm afraid that when I'm close to you....

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,600
...you'd be in danger.

39
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,880
Kliao Khluen!

40
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,480
But please believe me,

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,720
That everything I have done....

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,720
...was all because you're special to me.

43
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,680
How is it going, Doctor Kliao Khluen ?

44
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,320
I'll get to be in the surgery ward tomorrow !

45
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,600
How about you ?

46
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,200
I'll rotate to the ped ward.

47
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,800
Aw, really !?

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,640
You'll be a pediatrician now !

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,080
That's good. It's what you like.

50
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,720
You'd lo ve the surgery ward as well,
wouldn't you ?

51
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,480
It's what I've been waiting for !

52
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,720
Are you going to the ped ward today ?

53
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,120
Me too.

54
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,240
Really ?

55
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,320
We get to be in the same ward again !

56
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Tell him you like him.

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,560
I actually have loads of urgent tasks
I need to do.

58
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,440
You two sit and chat here.

59
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,120
See you at our dorm.

60
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,120
Bye!

61
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
Go back to our dorm safely, bestie.

62
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,320
- See ya.
- Okay!

63
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,280
Do you want to take a seat ?

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,240
Okay.

65
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,600
It's so nice today.

66
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,720
It's so quiet in the ward.

67
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,640
Do you believe in what they say ?

68
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,400
That if it's a nice, quiet day,

69
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,000
you never mention it.

70
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,040
Or else, it's going to be hectic !

71
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,680
I don't think that's relevant.

72
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,680
It's going to be what it's going to be.

73
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,880
I don't think it depends on what you say.

74
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,840
Right ?

75
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,560
Are you... alright?

76
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,960
Oh, yes, I'm alright.

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,000
And, about last night.

78
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,520
Thank you.

79
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,240
For taking care of me.

80
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,720
And I'm sorry, too.

81
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,520
For causing troubles.

82
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,600
No problem at all.

83
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,520
If there's anything, you can talk to me.

84
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,040
I'd be more than happy to help.

85
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,760
Thank you.

86
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,120
I need to go now.

87
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,920
Excuse me.

88
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,680
See you later.

89
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,040
Bye-bye.

90
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,840
Karan.

91
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Help me with this case.

92
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,920
Let’s talk in the break room.

93
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,560
Okay.

94
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Okay, I will let them know.

95
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,240
Thanks.

96
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,080
Of course.

97
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,120
Alright, everyone.

98
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,560
Hello, professor.

99
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,120
As today is my birthday,

100
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,520
I'd like to invite you all
to join the dinner with me.

101
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,880
Extern, Doctor Kliao,
if you're free, please join me.

102
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,320
Thank you.

103
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,400
Please allow me to see
if I'll be able to make it.

104
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,920
- Of course.
- Thank you.

105
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,000
- See you tonight, everyone.
- Yes, sir !

106
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,120
See you.

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,600
How do you go there ?

108
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,240
I'll grab a driver down here.

109
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,760
Like a taxi ?

110
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,920
Probably, yeah.

111
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Yeah...

112
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,400
I'm leaving. See you later.

113
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,440
Probably a taxi, too.

114
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,280
I didn't bring my car this morning.

115
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,360
By the way.

116
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,440
Is Karan going ?

117
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,920
- Karan ?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,240
I don't think so.

119
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,080
But if Fiet is invited,
I think Karan would go.

120
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,679
- Really ? Let's ask him, then ?
- Let's do that.

121
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,559
- She'd go.
- Let's ask him.

122
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,559
- Okay.
- Please ask him for me.

123
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,960
- Will do.
 - Excuse me.

124
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,400
Where is the dinner party tonight ?

125
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,120
- Hello !
- Hi, Doctor Kliao !

126
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,680
Have you got here a while ago ?

127
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,840
- A while ago. The food is all here.
- Come on. Let's eat.

128
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,800
Where's Professor Dech ?

129
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,200
- Over there. Say hi to the birthday boy.
- Okay.

130
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,440
- Okay, I'll be back here.
- Sure.

131
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,000
This is really good.

132
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,960
Hello, professors ! Hello.

133
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,640
- Hi Kliao !
- Happy birthday !

134
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
Thank you so much.

135
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,520
Please order whatever you'd like
to eat and drink !

136
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,480
Will do ! Thank you so much.

137
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,680
Please excuse me.
I'll sit with them over there.

138
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,640
- Make it like home.
- Thank you.

139
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,680
- I'm back!
- Come on, let's eat!

140
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,160
- That looks so yummy.
- It is yummy.

141
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,600
By the way, how did you guys get here?

142
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,360
I took a Ka Poh taxi here.

143
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,840
- That's not what I meant, Chai.
- Oh?

144
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,120
I meant, how did you know about
Doctor Dech's birthday party ?

145
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, he sent me a DM.

146
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,800
He asked me to join his birthday party.
So, here I am.

147
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,800
- Seriously ?
- Yeah, that's why I'm here.

148
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,880
Chai, I'm asking for real.
Are you and Doctor Dech.... dating ?

149
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,640
- I have the same question.
- Am I right ?

150
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,480
- Are you serious ?
- Oh my goodness !

151
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,840
- No!
- Oh ?

152
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,960
I've been working here for eternity !

153
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,560
Whose birthday party ever it is,
I'd always show up !

154
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,040
- But you look cuter than usual tonight.
- She's right.

155
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,920
Thank you, take 200 baht here.

156
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,320
That's stingy !

157
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,200
- That's all I have !
- Okay...

158
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,840
- How about you, Doctor Ay ?
- Yes ?

159
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,600
How did you know about this dinner ?

160
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,760
Doctor Dech was also my professor.

161
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,480
I had classes with him long ago.
And I know his....

162
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,000
Like, his son....

163
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,720
- He...
- ....was a friend of yours.

164
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,840
They were classmates.

165
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,280
That's it. That's all it was.

166
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,280
- But Doctor Dech's son is so handsome !
- So handsome !

167
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,160
Like an angel !

168
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,600
I haven't met him.

169
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,080
- I am a little older than him, or else...

170
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,000
You're a lot older than him !

171
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,600
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes. You're almost a century old.

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,400
Yes ?

173
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,400
Who are you looking for, Kliao ?

174
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,160
What's going on ?

175
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,200
Are you waiting for someone to arrive ?

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,840
No !

177
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,280
No, I'm just thirsty.

178
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,520
- Oh, so you'd like to order a drink.
- I was going order a drink.

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,080
Excuse me !
Can I get a glass of water, please ?

180

00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,080
I had a leg-amputated patient today.

358
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,040
I had a leg-amputated patient today.

359
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,080
He still had a phantom pain.

360
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,880
I tried to help him
exactly how you helped me.

361
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,000
But seemed like it didn't work at all.

362
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,600
Not everyone can be treated
with that method.

363
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,240
But I feel horrible for him, Karan.

364
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,080
I truly understand his feelings.

365
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,840
It feels like...

366
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,600
It....

367
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,040
Can you help him ?

368
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,880
By turning back in time
before he loses his leg ?

369
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,880
Just like how you helped me.

370
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,640
Please, Karan ?

371
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,440
I'm sorry.

372
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
I don't think I can turn back time
to save him.

373
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,600
I got to go. I have an appointment.

374
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,640
But why, Karan ?

375
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,240
Why ? I don't get it.

376
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,720
You are a doctor, and you can save him.

377
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,760
Why would you choose not to help him ?

378
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,280
Tree ?

379
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,720
You just say things without thinking.

380
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,240
You want her to help you here and there.

381
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,000
Tree !

382
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,640
You know nothing.

383
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,320
Karan lost her time of living
just to save you.

384
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,240
Tree, stop now.

385
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,600
Karan !

386
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,560
Ten years.

387
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,200
It's ten freaking years.

388
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,960
That's how much of her life was taken.

389
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,520
Ten years gone, just to save you.

390
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,480
You're such a trouble maker.

391
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,720
Tree, talk with me outside.

392
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,600
Why did you say that to Kliao Khluen ?

393
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,840
Because you need to tell her
what you have to lose.

394
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,800
So that she'd leave you alone.

395
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,960
But.... but...

396
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,080
I don't want you to lose any other thing.

397
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,240
You told me that turning back time
hurts like your soul being ripped out.

398
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,200
Doesn't it hurt like being through hell ?

399
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,640
Then why would you let this woman
to keep hurting you over and over ?

400
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,240
But you know

401
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,360
what I have done...

402
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,240
all of these things for.

403
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,480
[ Ten years. ]

404
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,080
[ Ten freaking years. ]

405
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
[ That's how much of her life was taken. ]

406
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,280
[ Ten years gone, just to save you. ]

407
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,880
[ Karan, about today in your office, ]

408
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,040
[ I'm so sorry. ]

409
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,800
[ I really had no idea that
you lost your life time because of me. ]

410
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,240
[ Tomorrow is your day off, right ? ]

411
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,360
[ Talk to you then. ]

412
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,360
[ I'll pick you up in the morning. ]

413
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,840
I am so sorry, Karan.

414
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,800
I really didn't know...

415
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,719
...that you helping me that day...

416
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,320
...causes you to lose your own time.

417
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,480
So, you think,

418
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,360
that I, being a doctor,

419
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,760
having an ability to manipulate time,

420
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,840
to see the future,

421
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,239
means that I must be able
to save everyone ?

422
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,520
No,

423
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,520
I...

424
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,320
I am sorry. I did not realize this.

425
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,080
Do you know,

426
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,160
that I'd use it with someone
who means a lot to me.

427
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,000
And the person is you,

428
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,560
Kliao Khluen.

429
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,800
Hey, what's up ?

430
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,600
[ Where are you, Kliao ? ]

431
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,120
I'm out to grab some food.

432
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,120
[ Do you remember the guy
who suffocated  you at the hospital ? ]

433
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,400
[ That prisoner just broke out and about. ]

434
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,720
[ And he said to you that he'd come at you ? ]

435
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,120
Just a second.

436
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,360
Say again ?

437
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,560
[ Guess what, the guy who committed a crime
 at my apartment 7 years ago ]

438
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,360
[...is the same jailbreaker who choked you ! ]

439
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,160
How did you know about this ?

440
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,360
I met the former juristic person worker
at the hospital today.

441
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,560
She remembered me. We had a talk,
when the news on jail breaking appeared.

442
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,840
And she said that was the one who killed
the son of the MP in my apartment back then.

443
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,920
Kliao, do not go back
to our dorm room alone tonight.

444
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,640
Kliao, do not go back
to our dorm room alone tonight.

445
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,280
Because I'll be on night shift.

446
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,200
Maybe you should go home tonight
for your safety ?

447
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,400
It's okay.

448
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,760
Don't worry. I can be safe by myself.

449
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,800
I'll see you soon.
Please take a good care of yourself.

450
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,920
Wow, your apartment feels really nice.

451
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,600
My mom bought it for me.

452
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,920
It's gorgious.

453
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,800
Do you want some water?

454
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,200
Thank you.

455
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,920
[ At 11:30 today, there was a report
on an unexpected event. ]

456
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,280
[ When a prisoner broke out
of the Central Prison. ]

457
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,880
[ His name is Awach Dereklop, ]

458
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,800
[ Charged with a homicide case 7 years ago. ]

459
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,160
[ If you remember this news not so long ago, ]

460
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,280
[ when a prisoner charged into
and attempted to suffocate a doctor, ]

461
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,120
[ This jailbreaker is the very same person. ]

462
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,280
[ Police urge you to call 191
if you see him or have information. ]

463
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,440
Uncle Wach.

464
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,280
Do you know him ?

465
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,040
I'm a friend of your father.

466
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,240
Yes.

467
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,880
He's a friend of my father.

468
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,880
When I was a kid, my father
took him to our home quite often.

469
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,560
But...

470
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,040
I have no idea why Uncle Wach would...

471
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,760
Maybe you should stay here for a while ?

472
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,600
So that you can be safe.

473
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,120
Actually,

474
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,040
I have no idea what is going on.

475
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,720
It's okay, Kliao.

476
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,080
I will never let you be in danger ever again.

477
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,640
But...

478
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,800
If you help me more.

479
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,240
Will you lose more of your time ?

480
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,720
I don't want you to be...

481
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,080
If it's not safe for you,

482
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,520
Whatever it takes,

483
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,400
I'd do it.

484
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,960
Whatever it takes.

485
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,720
I will save you.

486
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,520
Let me look after you.

487
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,720
I love you, Kliao.

488
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,960
Do you want to stop ?

489
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,240
No, I want to be yours.

490
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,880
Kliao, are you alright ?

491
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,320
Why are you blushing ?

492
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,160
I'm...

493
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,680
I'm alright.

494
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,760
Then why don't you look me into my eyes ?

495
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,480
I don't know either.

496
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,960
Or...

497
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,840
Is this your first time ?

498
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,440
Well...

499
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,280
I haven't had this before.

500
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,560
I've never been in a relationship before.

501
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,760
Have you had this with anyone ?

502
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,760
Of course.

503
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,880
Karan !

504
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,360
With Tree. When we were kids.

505
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,840
What a relieve.

506
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,480
Don't do this with anyone else, okay ?

507
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,400
You green-eyed monster.

508
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,960
Why do you have to pretend
like we don't know one another ?

509
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,760
I'm scared.

510
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,480
Scared ?

511
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,480
I'm scared that when I'm close to you,
you'd be in danger.

512
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,400
In danger ?

513
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,840
What do you mean ?

514
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,960
What puts me in danger when I'm close to you ?

515
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,440
I had a vision.

516
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,280
That you'd be shot.

517
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,200
I'd be shot ?

518
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,000
I'll be shot in my bride dress, right ?

519
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,240
What did you say ?

520
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,680
I had a dream about it.

521
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,520
But...

522
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,640
Will I really be shot ?

523
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,080
It will happen in reality, Karan ?

524
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,600
Not possible.

525
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,080
Whatever it takes,

526
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,560
I'll never ever let that happen.

527
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,120
But I want to be with you.

528
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,920
Until we find out who the shooter is,

529
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,520
we better keep this distant.

530
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,360
I bought a new lipstick.

531
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,840
Would you like to try it ?

532
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,280
Thank you for being my smile.

533
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,520
Karan, what's wrong ?

534
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,960
But if I don't go,
people'd be in danger because of us.

535
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,120
No !

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,880
I can't let you go out there !

537
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,320
Are you ready to die ?

538
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,600
I'm not going to stop.
And nothing can stop me !

539
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,320
You did it to me,
and this is what you get from me.
