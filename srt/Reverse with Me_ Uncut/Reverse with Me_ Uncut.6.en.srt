1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,720
Stop it.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,960
Stop it.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,000
You think I have a chance to turn back ?

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,120
I wonder if this had happened
to your family. If your wife and kids die,

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,080
Would you still be licking the boots ?

6
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,960
I just reversed back in time.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,680
What ?

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,440
Do you trust me, Kliao ?

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,640
Awach, the jailbreak prisoner is on his way
to the hospital to commit a crime.

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,000
The patient is male, 45,

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,959
with penetrating chest injury

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,840
with thoractic aortic injury.

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,560
Time of death: 02:00.

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,360
From now on, there's nothing
you should worry about.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,920
It's over.

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,480
If you hadn't seen that vision,

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,760
I wouldn't be here now.

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,760
There he comes ! Hurry !

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,680
Sir !

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,480
Please give us an interview !

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,160
How is the case going, sir ?

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,200
Well,

23
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,440
It goes according to the plan.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,120
The alleged offender has been arrested.

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,400
Who is the offender, sir ?

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
The offender is....

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,880
Is who, sir ?

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,840
Please answer the question.

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,200
Say it if you dare !

30
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,680
Tell them how you've ruined my life.

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
If it wasn't because of you,

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
I wouldn't be like this !

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,880
Sir ?

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,840
You'll get what I get !

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,560
One day you'll be ruined like I am !

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,000
Sir ?

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,680
Sir ?

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,880
Please answer our questions.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,479
I'll give you the answer later. Excuse me.

40
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,080
Sir !

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,000
But, sir, we need the answer.
Please stay for the interview ? Sir ?

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,000
You can't enter. Sorry. Sorry.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,880
Government compound, madam.

44
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,880
Ooh, Mr. New Superintendent is home.

45
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,079
How was your day ?

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,280
Have some water.

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,400
You don't look very happy.

48
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,880
Is something bothering you ?

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,680
I issued the warrant to arrest the MP's son.

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,400
But Wach went too far.

51
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
Awach, your subordinate ?

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,800
Hi, dad.

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,840
Hey, Fong.

54
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,079
How was school today ?

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
I had a math test today.

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Here !

57
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,600
I got 6 out of 10 !

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,320
Six out of ten.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,400
Not too bad.

60
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,120
Keep studying, okay ?

61
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,160
Get an extra class after school if you have time.

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,440
Yes, dad.

63
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,920
I better find a tutoring place myself.

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,720
[ The assailant has been identified as Awach]

65
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,800
[Sentenced for homicide.]

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
[It is one of the most terrifying murders.]

67
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,960
[Awach, the convicted murderer, assaulted the victim,]

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,720
[...and subsequently hanged him with a rope]

69
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,600
[...as a suicide cover-up.]

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,200
[Forensic team, however,
found a drop of blood on the floor belonged to Awach.]

71
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,960
[A warrant to arrest was issued immediately.]

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,680
[Soon after, the officers found
and arrested the convicted murderer in a resident]

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,720
[In Kanchanaburi province]

74
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,040
[where he rented to evade the arrest.]

75
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,800
[It is reported that Awach
was in a manic episode at the time of his arrest.]

76
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,120
[You'll get what I get!
You'll be ruined like I am one day!]

77
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,080
[ If it wasn't because of you,
I wouldn't be like this! ]

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,960
So, the offender is Awach ?

79
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,800
That's what keeps me anxious.

80
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,440
The second you got promoted
as a superintendent,

81
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,960
You get such a big, important case.

82
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,040
Plus, he was your subordinate.

83
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,840
It will be okay, honey.

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,000
Poor him, though, actually.

85
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,600
He shouldn't have done this.

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,200
Hey Kliao !

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
Where are you going ?

88
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,160
Don't you want to sit and hang out with me ?

89
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm going to study upstairs.

90
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,720
It's too loud to focus on anything here.

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,440
Let her study.

92
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,760
She is really focused on studying these days.

93
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,840
She just wants to be a doctor out of nowhere.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,600
She wanted to be a singer a month ago.

95
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,000
It's good being a doctor.
If you had followed what I told you long ago,

96
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,440
Now you believe me, right, Kliao ?

97
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,840
How could being a singer be good for you ?

98
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,040
I want to be a doctor because I want to.

99
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,760
It has nothing to do with you.

100
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,920
And you should stop planning,
stuffing things down other people's throats.

101
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,040
Look at Fong.

102
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,120
He never gets to do what he wants.

103
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,600
How would other careers feed you ?

104
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:57,320
A student like you should focus on studying
for your better future.

105
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,040
Hey, guess what ?
- What ?

106
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,560
I got to touch Tree's hand the other day !

107
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,280
He was so cute !

108
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,320
I know ! Tree is super cute,
and my bestie here is over the moon.

109
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,960
You're right. I'm over the moon !

110
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,400
Oh, how I miss him.

111
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Anyway,

112
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,040
How are you and Karan doing ?

113
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,800
Well...

114
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,520
I'm not telling you.

115
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,520
Are you hiding a secret from your bestie ?

116
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
Hey, so,

117
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,280
Do you think you'll be really okay with dating a woman ?

118
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,400
I mean, I'm not judging you or anything here, but...

119
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,400
I haven't seen you open up to a man yet.

120
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,920
In our freshmen year, that guy was after you,
but you ignored him.

121
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,520
You only looked for Doctor Kaomesa.

122
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,240
I think....

123
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,320
Maybe a man can fulfill you better ?

124
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,560
But why ?

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,360
Why do I need to open up to men first ?

126
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,840
Well...

127
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,880
How can you be certain
that you'd prefer women for the rest of your life ?

128
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
I don't know about that.

129
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,880
But I think that's irrelevant
to whether it'd be the forever thing or not.

130
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,040
Why am I being asked if I've been opened up to men ?

131
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,560
Why...

132
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,160
Why aren't straight couples like you two

133
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,640
being asked if you have opened up
to those with same sex as you ?

134
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,080
What if I ask you,

135
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,440
"Have you considered having a same-sex relationship ?"

136
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,080
"She might get along with you better than Tree."

137
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,080
How would you feel if I ask you so ?

138
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,920
I get it now.

139
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,360
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,360
No one would feel okay being asked that question.

141
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,160
I'm so sorry, okay ?

142
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,080
I apologize.

143
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,720
Apology accepted, Miss Meow.

144
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,880
But my next crepe is your treat.

145
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,320
Of course ! How many would you be able to eat ?

146
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,520
I'm going to have one every day.

147
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,760
Until we graduate ?

148
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,800
Oh, Kliao.

149
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,640
Have mercy. I still need to eat lunch.

150
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,720
I'm just kidding.

151
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,840
[Fongsamut: Kliao.]

152
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,920
[Kliao, I need to talk to you.]

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,200
[It's urgent. Come and see me please.]

154
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,760
[Can I go to see you now ?]

155
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,960
[See you at the cafe.]

156
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,240
Hey,

157
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,400
I need to go see my brother.

158
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,080
- See you later.
- See you.

159
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,840
Kliao, how have you been ?

160
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,960
I've been busy.

161
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,160
Influx of patients.

162
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,840
You haven't been home lately.

163
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
I said I've been busy.

164
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,120
It looks like you're mad at me.

165
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,080
Have I done something wrong ?

166
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
No.

167
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,960
You didn't do anything.

168
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,600
Since you started your internship here,

169
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,120
You haven't really been home.

170
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,760
And...

171
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,760
You haven't really talked to me.

172
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
What brought you here today, Fong ?

173
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,760
Did you know dad has been sick ?

174
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,080
What's wrong with dad ?

175
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,520
Chest pain

176
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,600
For days.

177
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,760
It has been worse and worse.

178
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,200
It'd be great if you could pay him a visit.

179
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,400
I think you better bring him to the hospital.

180
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,440
His favorite child like you can take him here easily.

181
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,680
He wouldn't come no matter what I say.

182
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,520
Can't you go home and visit him ?

183
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,040
It doesn't help if I go home.

184
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,240
- Take him to the hospital for a check-up.
- But you're a doctor.

185
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,840
You can help your patients.

186
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,800
How come you refuse to help your own father ?

187
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,360
Because you're being like this !

188
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,320
That is why dad is mad at you.

189
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,200
Is something bothering your mind, Kliao ?

190
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,040
Well,

191
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,200
I saw Fongsamut today.

192
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,600
He said...

193
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,440
dad doesn't feel well.

194
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,520
He's been experiencing chest pain frequently.

195
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,240
Has he taken him to see a doctor ?

196
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Not yet.

197
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,120
He wouldn't.

198
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,960
So, Fong asked me to go home and give dad a check-up.

199
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,400
It's better to take him to the hospital for a check-up.

200
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,640
I have told Fong that, actually.

201
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,800
But Fong said dad wouldn't come.

202
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,440
No matter how he tried.

203
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,720
So, I think...

204
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,240
I will take some time off to go back home.

205
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,760
In case I manage to take him to the hospital.

206
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,000
If you don't want to go home all by yourself,

207
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,880
let me go with you.

208
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,680
I also want to meet your family.

209
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,320
Well, my family is...

210
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,880
I know.

211
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,160
I will be in every step of your life.

212
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,280
And we will get through all of these together,

213
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,560
remember ?

214
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,040
After your shift tomorrow, let me pick you up ?

215
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,920
Okay.

216
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay.

217
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,640
Kliao, what are you doing ?

218
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,080
I'm writing a song, dad.

219
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,200
Why don't you do your homework and study after school ?

220
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,800
The exam day is approaching, isn't it ?

221
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,920
I just want to take some time of to do other things.

222
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,120
Don't you talk back at me.

223
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,200
Non-sense stuff like that can't help you pass any exams !

224
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,400
Kliao !

225
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,360
What are you wearing ?

226
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm wearing normal clothes, dad.

227
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,400
Why don't you wear some proper clothes like others do ?

228
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,280
People would say your parents never look after or teach you.

229
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,920
You only care about the others' feelings.
How about my feelings ?

230
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,040
Here's your birthday present, dad.

231
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,720
How did you manage to buy this ?

232
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,760
I...

233
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,040
I did a part time job.

234
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,120
As a night time singer again ?

235
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,400
What are you doing ?

236
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,480
Why don't you focus on studying ?

237
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,600
How many times have I told you not to work at that bar ?

238
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,320
Do you have any idea how dangerous that is ?

239
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,480
Don't you ever...

240
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,000
...sing with your friends again.

241
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,600
Kliao !

242
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,160
Come back and talk to me, Kliao !

243
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,800
Oh, you're back !

244
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,920
Oh, yes, mom.

245
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,800
And... a friend is here.

246
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,640
Hello.

247
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,280
- Hello.
- Oh.

248
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,520
She's a doctor at surgery ward.

249
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,600
Perfect ! Would you two like to help me in the kitchen ?

250
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,400
Dad is about to arrive. Let's go.

251
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Sure

252
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,560
Eat, eat, eat.

253
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,160
Thank you, mom.

254
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,480
- Is that enough ?
- It's enough.

255
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,480
How have you been, Kliao ?

256
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,200
How is your study ?

257
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,480
It's been draining me out a little.

258
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
I just started the surgery ward.

259
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,720
So, I need to learn a lot about surgery.

260
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,480
I guess it's been rough for you.
That's why you haven't been back home.

261
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,560
Oh, Kliao,

262
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,520
Remember we talked about getting dad a check-up ?

263
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,240
Hey, Fong.

264
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,880
I told you I'm fine.

265
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,360
No need to make it fuzzy with any check-up.

266
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,480
I had chest pain because of the lack of sleep.

267
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Okay.

268
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,080
Is that your new friend, Kliao ?

269
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,160
Yes.

270
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,040
Karan is a doctor at the ward.

271
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,240
Hello.

272
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,880
You two are probably very close that you brought her here.

273
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes, we're close.

274
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,720
I usually consult things with her.

275
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,040
It's great that you two are friends.

276
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,280
I've seen young people these days being homosexuals.

277
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,960
How could that be good ?

278
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,040
Why can't it be, dad ?

279
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,800
Because I have seen a lot.

280
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,920
Those homosexuals ? They don't last long.

281
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,880
And for those who want to build a family,
it should not happen at all.

282
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,640
How do you tell which relationships would last or not ?

283
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,080
And if I prefer women, it wouldn't hurt anybody.

284
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,040
Kliao.

285
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,760
Will you ever stop talking back to me ?

286
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,720
And will you ever stop bossing around other people's lives ?

287
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,040
I'm not a kid.

288
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,120
What I want to do, who I want to like, it's my business.

289
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,360
Calm down, Kliao.

290
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,200
Dad just wanted to share his view.

291
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
Honey, let's eat.

292
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,840
Hey, calm down. Let's have dinner. Come on.

293
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,400
Look at her.

294
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,880
Does she listen to what I say ?

295
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,120
The things I've been telling her are all for her own good !

296
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,720
You really did it all for my own good ?

297
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,720
If it's for my own good,

298
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,600
have you ever asked me once,

299
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,560
if I'm happy about it ?

300
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,960
Or if Fong is happy about it ?

301
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,000
You keep bossing around other people's lives

302
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,320
and cause troubles for them !

303
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,680
In the end,

304
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,760
it all comes back to harm your family.

305
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,920
What are you talking about, Kliao ?

306
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,000
Do you remember Uncle Wach ?

307
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,840
Wach, your old friend ?

308
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,720
You know what ?

309
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,400
He broke out of jail, and he was targeting to kill me !

310
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,800
And do you know why ?

311
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,320
To take revenge on you for ruining his life !

312
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,360
You know who saved me ?

313
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,600
It was Karan, not you !

314
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,720
I almost died because of you !

315
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,160
Kliao !

316
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,760
You better not talk
about things you don't really know about, Kliao.

317
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Everything I have done

318
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,400
..was to let you have a better life !

319
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,320
Dad, Kliao, calm down.

320
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,040
A better life ?

321
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,440
How dare you say "a better life"?

322
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,680
You didn't even realize when I almost died !

323
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,280
How could you say that ?

324
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,080
This is why I never want to come home !

325
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,840
- Kliao !
- No!

326
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,040
Kliao, are you okay ?

327
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,400
You better calm down, sir.

328
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,920
It's not your family's business. Leave it.

329
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,840
Calm down.

330
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
That was enough.

331
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,280
No matter how angry you are,
you should never lay your hand on her.

332
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,040
Let's go, Karan.

333
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,480
Kliao !

334
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,960
Kliao.

335
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,480
If you step your feet out of here,
make sure you never return !

336
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,160
- Dad !
- Honey ! Honey !

337
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,840
- Honey ! Honey !
- Dad !

338
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,000
Honey, hey, hey !

339
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,760
Dad !

340
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,120
Mr. Tanapoom's family, please !

341
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,840
That's me.

342
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,560
This is the prescription note. Please pay at room number 12.

343
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,240
- Yes, thank you.
- Sure.

344
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
- Chai ?
- Oh, Kliao !

345
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,840
How is it going in there ?

346
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,120
The ER has been restless !
Dr. Ay has been running everywhere today.

347
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,480
- Is there anything I can help with ?
- Uh...

348
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,960
That'd be wonderful. Let's go.

349
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,400
Wait here, okay ?

350
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,840
Arrest. Start CPR.

351
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,880
Pause for now.

352
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,040
PEA EKG. Continue CPR.

353
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,800
An IV of adrenaline, 1 mg., please.

354
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,760
An IV of adrenaline, 1 mg.

355
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,960
Two full minutes of CPR.

356
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,800
No vital sign. PEA EKG. Keep doing CPR.

357
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,360
Two full minutes of CPR.

358
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,960
Checking vital sign.

359
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,800
Vital sign detected. ROSC.

360
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,480
Take a deep breath, please.

361
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,280
Doctor,

362
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,240
What's wrong with me ?

363
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,880
You're having myocardial ischemia

364
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,240
We'll need to have catheterization and a stent implantation.

365
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,920
As an initial treatment,
I'll prescribe some chewable aspirin

366
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,760
and a nitroglycerin sublingual tablet
to relief your chest pain.

367
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,120
Dad, how are you feeling ?

368
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Kliao.

369
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
I'm...

370
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,160
- Dad ?
- Sir ?

371
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,840
- What's going on, dad ?
- Vital sign check now, please.

372
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
It hurts.

373
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,360
- Dad ?
- Sir...

374
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,080
- It will be okay, Kliao.
- Excuse me.

375
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,880
Pericardial fusion with cardiac tamponade.

376
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,880
Load the IV - normal saline 500,
and prepare for pericardiocentesis.

377
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,480
Please consult with CVT for me.

378
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,600
Noted.

379
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,400
Dad ?

380
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,600
How are things going in here ?

381
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,840
Hello, professor,

382
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,680
this is a case of an acute inferior wall MI
with RV infarc, with free wall rupture.

383
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,800
He will be given normal saline 500 mg., initially.
We're preparing pericardiocentesis.

384
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,960
- Would you like to see ?
- Yes, sure.

385
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Okay.

386
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,440
Let's have the OR set for him now

387
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,960
- And explain to his family for me.
- Yes, professor.

388
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,240
Thank you.

389
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,000
Male patient, 60.

390
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,560
Acute inferior wall MI
with RV, and free wall rupture.

391
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,320
Okay, the plan is to operate the Median Sternotomy
to CAVG with RV repair.

392
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,440
Scalpel, please.

393
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,600
- Forceps.
- Forceps.

394
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
- Electrocautery, please.
- Suction tube.

395
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Kliao

396
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,080
Kliao

397
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,840
Karan,

398
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,920
- Please stop using your power to save me.
- Kliao.

399
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,040
Kliao.

400
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,360
Kliao Khluen, don't.

401
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,760
Kliao Khluen !

402
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,760
Kliao Khluen !

403
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
Anyone, help !

404
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Anyone, please help !

405
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Karan

406
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,680
Karan

407
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,080
Karan !

408
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,760
Kliao

409
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,160
Huh ?

410
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,040
It's been three days.

411
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,960
Why is dad still unconscious ?

412
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,160
He'll be okay.

413
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,800
He probably needs a rest now.

414
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,960
I suppose you are still mad at him ?

415
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,120
For things he had done to you ?

416
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,720
I don't like how he treats you either.

417
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,360
I really get it.

418
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,280
I get it why you never want to go home.

419
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,880
And you know what ?

420
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,199
Dad deeply cares about you.

421
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,400
Like, with uncle Wach,

422
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,000
Once he knew uncle Wach broke out of prison,

423
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,719
He demanded mom and I...

424
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,320
..to never leave home.

425
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,639
He also had his subordinates
to keep their eyes on you at the hospital

426
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,480
It's my fault.

427
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,679
I've been acting immature.

428
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,720
I'm sorry about the music school, too.

429
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,280
I'm sorry for not being by your side.

430
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,920
Even though you were on my side.

431
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,680
It's all good now.

432
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,000
It's actually so long ago.

433
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,480
Also,

434
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,040
I haven't really been home.

435
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,520
And actually, thank you, Fong

436
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,000
For taking care of dad and mom instead of me.

437
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,720
I need to admit it, though.

438
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,000
That I was hurt from what dad did.

439
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,720
I thought he only cares about you.

440
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,720
But I get it now.

441
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,280
I'm so happy you came home.

442
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,800
I'll go check.

443
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,280
Can I talk to you ?

444
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,600
Sure.

445
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,240
Your dad is safe now.

446
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,000
The surgery went well.

447
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,320
Thank you so much, Karan.

448
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,520
Kliao.

449
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,880
I saw the vision of our wedding again.

450
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,760
The shooter is still out there.

451
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,360
Another important clue is...

452
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,040
The person wears a medical gown.

453
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,280
Which could mean that he is a doctor.

454
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,720
I thought...

455
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,080
After uncle WAch's incident, it would...

456
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,040
From now on,

457
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,000
I beg you to be extra cautious.

458
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,760
Never trust anyone, okay ?

459
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,280
And if there is any tiny abnormality,

460
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,600
You need to tell me immediately, okay ?

461
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,760
Yes, Karan.

462
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,720
Please check on your father.

463
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,240
I'm going back home to pack up some things.

464
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,640
And I'll come to see you.

465
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,480
Okay.

466
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,440
I'm going to get mom.

467
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,280
Okay.

468
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:25,480
[Punyaweth Hospital:
Surgery]

469
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,560
- You're heading out ?
- Yeah.

470
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,960
Just finished an operation.

471
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,480
I'll see you tomorrow.

472
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,480
I heard that when you bleed,

473
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,480
You won't be able to reverse time ?

474
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,520
The fact that you're pursuing for happiness,

475
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,280
It's not just about school, is it ?

476
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,920
I'm sorry.

477
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520
I'm sorry.

478
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,640
I'm here to save you.

479
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,760
What about you, Karan ?

480
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,560
Do you believe in time reversal ?

481
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,920
Kliao !

482
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,640
Karan, please don't reverse time to save me anymore.

483
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,800
Karan, stay awake. Please stay awake.
