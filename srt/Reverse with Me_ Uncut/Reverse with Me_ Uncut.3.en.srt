1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,280
Abdomen pain brought her here,
right, Nurse Chai ?

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,920
She’s had that for three days now.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,000
Kliao !

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,000
What’s going on ?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,400
That was Doctor Kaomesa.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,759
You needed to be calmer, you know?

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,120
No matter how the patients treat you.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,120
Got it?

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,440
Chai, can I ask you something ?

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,040
The doctor who came in
and helped me this afternoon, is she…?

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,320
Oh, Doctor Karan !

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,960
Stop !

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,840
Stop !

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,480
I remember you

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,920
Step back !

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,560
Are you okay ?

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,040
Thee, are you okay?

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,880
Karan.

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,000
Kliao !

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,120
Kliao !

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,600
Kliao How are you feeling ?

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,440
Are you hurt ?

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,800
Oh, I can see handprints !

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,640
Does it still hurt if I touch here ?

25
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,479
Dr. Meow !

26
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,039
Yes?

27
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,440
Calm down !

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,600
Dr. Ay has given her a check-up
and wrote down in her H&P.

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,720
Nothing we should worry about.

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,240
And this is the hospital.
Keep your voice low.

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,520
Sorry, Chai.

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,720
Kliao, are you alright?

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,000
I’m okay

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:04,920
So

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,960
What happened, exactly ?

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,880
[ Stop ]

37
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,800
[ Stop ]

38
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,080
I’m not sure either.

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,560
I might look like someone he knows.

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,800
It’s probably nothing.

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,680
Let’s go home.

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,520
Actually,

43
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,920
Actually,

44
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,520
Well, I need to take another shift.

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,560
My ward mate is taking a sick leave.

46
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,200
It has to be my shift.

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,200
No problem. I’ll go by myself.

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,920
Are you sure ?

49
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,720
Let me see how you stand.

50
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,079
I’m fine !

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,360
I’m leaving.

52
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,200
Bye !

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,520
Bye.

54
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,000
Text me when you get home.

55
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,640
Okay.

56
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,240
Hello ?

57
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,440
Kliao, where are you? How’s the walk?
Are you surrounded by the reporters?

58
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,600
I heard the reporter are flocking up
in front of the hospital.

59
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,000
I took the way on the back.

60
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,360
I’m on the fountain detour.

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,960
[ Mom: I have your brother moved to your room.]

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,600
[ It’s more convenient for him. ]

63
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,880
Hello ?

64
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,960
Are you still there ?

65
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,560
Kliao, are you alright ?

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,120
Hey, I'm walking back to our dorm now.

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,240
Okay, walk safe.

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,000
Text me when you get there.

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,440
Okay.

70
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,840
Karan.

71
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,760
How did you know it was going to rain ?

72
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,560
You're walking back home, right, extern ?

73
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,120
Take the detour on the back,
to the fountain.

74
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,040
Reporters are flocking up
waiting for you at the front exit.

75
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,880
Yes, thank you.

76
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,920
Here.

77
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,840
You better have it.

78
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,240
Thank you.

79
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,120
Karan, about this evening
in the ER...

80
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,000
Be better prepared for the next ones, extern.

81
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,960
In order to deal with the patients.

82
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Yes.

83
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,600
Thank you so much for lending me a hand.

84
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,440
Actually, Karan, I have...

85
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
See you around, extern.

86
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,840
Kliao ?

87
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,159
Kliao Kluen ?

88
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,000
Miss Kliao !

89
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,960
Huh ? What's up ?

90
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,040
Where has your mind wandered to ?

91
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,880
Nothing.

92
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,480
I was going to ask about yesterday.

93
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Have you had any trouble with anyone?

94
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
I have zero idea.

95
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,800
I don't know what happened.

96
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,360
I don't get it either.

97
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,960
Do you know the guy ?

98
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,920
How do I know him ?

99
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,280
I haven't seen him before.

100
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,320
Probably it's the effect from the Rahu
in my horoscope.

101
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,880
I probably look like someone he knows.

102
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,920
Fortunately,
you took the back path last night.

103
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
It was so hectic in the front.

104
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,760
Incidents, reporters, patients.

105
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,080
Speaking of that....

106
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,280
How did Karan know it was going to rain ?

107
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,640
Who ?

108
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,560
Karan from the CVT ward.

109
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,600
Karan CVT, the Frozen Face of the OR ?

110
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
What ? You met her ?

111
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,680
I have never seen her before.

112
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,000
I heard she's always in the OR.

113
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,960
How did you meet her ?

114
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,520
They say Karan is really beautiful.

115
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,200
But she's cold and really strict.

116
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,560
That's how she's called
the Frozen Face of the OR.

117
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Hold on.

118
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,880
So, you know her ?

119
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,240
Well...

120
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,480
She's the same person I told you about.

121
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,080
Doctor Kaomesa that I've been searching for.

122
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,240
What ?!

123
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,560
Are you serious ?

124
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,280
I'm serious !

125
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
I thought you were being imaginative.

126
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,680
and in love with the on in your dreams.

127
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,000
Meow !

128
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,800
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,920
Who'd think that your Doctor Kaomesa would be...

130
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,920
But, seriously ?

131
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,880
Karan is Doctor Kaomesa ?

132
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,720
I haven't met Karan at all.

133
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,600
That's why I didn't know
her real first name.

134
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Or else, you'd have met her long ago.

135
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,200
I first met her in the ER.

136
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,680
She came in to help me with my case.

137
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,480
But....

138
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,800
She has got such cold eyes.

139
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,880
Were you complimenting her or what ?

140
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,280
- You know what ?
- Huh?

141
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,560
I want to see her again.

142
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,480
Can you help me with that ?

143
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,280
Hmm...

144
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,680
I heard....

145
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,000
that Fiet, Thee's big brother,
is a good friend of Karan.

146
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,240
What would you like to know ?

147
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,720
I can ask Thee for you.

148
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,560
Pretty much everything.

149
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,600
Her shifts, her operaion time table.

150
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,360
Where she lives, what she does,
what she likes, what she dislikes.

151
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,320
And...

152
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,160
...that if she's taken.

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,680
That's so many things.
Maybe you should ask her yourself?

154
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,960
You asked if she's taken...

155
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,560
If she's not taken, would you make a move ?

156
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,760
Stop it.

157
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,720
Isn't it great ?
Now you have topics to talk to Thee.

158
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,200
Right ?

159
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Yes, mom.

160
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,800
Kliao, happy birthday.

161
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,000
I wish you a joyous life.

162
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
It's Fongsamut's birthday this Sunday.

163
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,800
Please come back home for the birthay party.

164
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,400
Same party as your brother
like the other years.

165
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,200
I miss you

166
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,080
Yes, mom.

167
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,360
Oh, actually...

168
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,320
I won't be able to go this Sunday.
I have shifts to cover.

169
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,400
Oh, yeah?

170
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,000
Honey,

171
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,840
Kliao won't be able to come on Sunday.
She has shifts to cover.

172
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,960
Whatever.
She doesn't really come back home anyway.

173
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,440
[ 2 years ago ]

174
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,240
Fong, have you told dad ?

175
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,800
What do you think ?

176
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,800
I think...

177
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,520
...you can tell him.
You're his favorite child anyway.

178
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,960
Dad should be fine with that.

179
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,720
You're already accepted
in your medical school.

180
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,440
Can't you ask him for me ?

181
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,520
What's up with you two ?

182
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,840
Kliao, Fong, come on, let's have some cake.

183
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,200
I'm craving for some cake now. Come on !

184
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,320
- Yes, mom.
- Yes, mom.

185
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,720
Come on.

186
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,800
Come, come, I'm hungry.

187

00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,480
What brought you here, Karan ?

368
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,760
I found you half conscious in the bathroom.

369
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,960
I don't want to see you
in another danger.

370
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,080
So, I'm driving you back to your dorm.

371
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,160
What did you say ?

372
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,880
"Another danger"?

373
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,320
So, seven years ago, you did....

374
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,880
Kliao Kluen !

375
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,200
Kliao Kluen !

376
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,160
Kliao Kluen, stop !

377
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,240
Kliao Kluen !

378
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,480
Kliao Kluen !

379
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,360
Anyone, please help.

380
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,720
Anyone, please help !

381
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Help ! Anyone !

382
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,040
Oh, you're still in last night's outfit.

383
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,440
You probably weren't very drunk last night ?

384
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,360
Have you cleaned up our room ?

385
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,920
I got back just now.
How could I clean up anything ?

386
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,000
Din't you do it ?

387
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,880
I thought you were drunk-cleaning.

388
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,520
Are you kidding me ?
I couldn't even walk straight.

389
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,960
Kliao, I'll need to check on Thee.

390
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,560
He got so drunk last night.
I want to know how he's feeling now.

391
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,280
How did you get here last night ?

392
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,200
I called you several times,
but you didn't answer.

393
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,200
Karan drove me here last night !

394
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,680
Are you serious ?

395
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,600
When you walked in this morning,
did you see Karan on her way out ?

396
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,560
I think I saw her car parked
right outside the surgery building.

397
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,440
Shiny silver Aston Martin.
It can't be anyone else's car but hers.

398
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,880
I'll be back.

399
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,719
Where are you going to, Kliao ?

400
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,800
Karan !

401
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,800
I'd like to return the unbrella to you.

402
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,159
So...

403
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,840
Last night...

404
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,520
Did you drive me to my dorm ?

405
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,880
What are you talking about ?

406
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,600
We met last night.

407
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,560
And didn't you drive me back to my dorm ?

408
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,120
I didn't see you last night.

409
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,600
I have a case in the next 10 minutes.

410
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,400
I gotta go.

411
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,000
I can tell she lied.

412
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,200
What are you doing up here, extern ?

413
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,320
What about you ?

414
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,920
What are you doing up here ?

415
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,960
- I thought you had a surgery case.
- I aske you first, extern.

416
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,840
You actually know what I'm here for.

417
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,680
Haven't I told you ?

418
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,440
That no matter what happens...

419
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,320
Don't even think to end your life ever again

420
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,240
I'm doing this because of you.

421
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,400
You're acting as if we haven't met.

422
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,840
You've been so cold to me.

423
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,960
And you've been avoiding me.

424
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,160
That's why I need to do this.

425
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,120
Because whenever I'm in danger,

426
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,920
You'd always show up.

427
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,200
Ow...

428
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,080
No matter how cruel this world is to you,

429
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,560
Please remember,

430
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,800
That there's always someone who loves

431
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,600
and deeply cares about you.

432
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,880
Just like this time.

433
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,640
Is it because you thought I was in danger ?

434
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,480
That brought you up here ?

435
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
That's why I thought....

436
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,480
This should be the best way....

437
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,800
That allows me to see you once again.

438
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,840
And do you think this is a good way ?

439
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,080
If there was an accident
and I fail to save you, what'd we do ?

440
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,240
The incident 7 years ago was real, right ?

441
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,960
You were really my life-saver, right ?

442
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,160
I wasn't imagining or dreaming things ?

443
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,360
Karan, answer me.

444
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,080
Am I right ?

445
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,040
Were you the one who saved me ?

446
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
I got crashed by a car
my arm had to be amputated.

447
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,040
I got shot and fell of the rooftop.

448
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,760
Were you the one who saved me ?

449
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,600
I'm asking if you were the one
who saved me from all of this !

450
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,040
Happy birthday.

451
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,480
No.

452
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,640
Fiet an Karan are, like, best friends ?

453
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,080
Doctor Fiet and Doctor Karan
have been besties from their school.

454
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,480
They are inseperable. These homies hang out,
like two peas in a pod.

455
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,480
I don't think
I can turn back time to save her.

456
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,000
- You'd ask her to fix this and that...
- Tree!

457
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,840
Because you know nothing !

458
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,960
[ Do you remember the guy 
who squeezed your throat at the hospital ? ]

459
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,200
[ That prisoner just broke the prison. ]

460
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,720
I'll never let you
be in another danger every again.
