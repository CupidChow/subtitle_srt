1
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,200
Karan.

2
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,200
Could you pass me a hanger, please ?

3
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Here, mommy.

4
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,080
Thank you

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,360
Could you pass me another one ?

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,759
Karan, can I…. ?

7
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,680
I look like a doctor, mommy.

8
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
It is cute on you !

9
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,840
Do you want to be a doctor ?

10
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,640
I don’t know yet, mommy.

11
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,680
I think… one day you will know

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,600
What you want to be.

13
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,079
Mommy, and how do I know what I like ?

14
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,240
When you do something

15
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,400
That makes you happy.

16
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,640
Happy…

17
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,400
Have you ever dreamt of someone ?

18
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,240
Someone you haven’t met before,

19
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,400
But you keep seeing them…

20
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
… in your dreams.

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,560
Home sweet home, sweetie.

22
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,960
Why didn’t you buy me
a stuffed animal today, daddy ?

23
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,960
Kleo.

24
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,880
Don’t be weepy.

25
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,120
Well.

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,880
I’d like to take a vocalist class.

27
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,160
Why would you take a class like that ?

28
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,520
It’s useless for you.

29
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,160
Someone you feel bad for when she’s in tears.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Kleo! That’s your name ! It’s on the list !

31
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,160
Your name is on the list ! Look !

32
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,320
What’s the first thing
medical student Kleo Kluen wants to do ?

33
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,079
She’d love to have medical student Meow
to eat Moo Kata with her !

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,680
Someone you’re happy for when she smiles.

35
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,840
Continue CPR.

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,960
Pulse measured. Patient ROSC.

37
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,560
And someone who inspires you,

38
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,120
Who has kept you….

39
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,640
Waited for the day you meet.

40
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,640
Tree !

41
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,080
Tree !

42
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Karan !

43
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
You are bleeding !

44
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,120
Oh, no !

45
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,760
Mommy ! Karan is bleeding !

46
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,920
I don’t know what’s going on !

47
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,159
It’s okay. It’s all good.
Karan is fine, don’t you worry.

48
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,240
-Waew ! Waew, come up here please.
- Yes !

49
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,040
Please watch Mai Tree for me.

50
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:49,880
Let’s go !

51
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,640
Come with me.

52
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,200
Mommy, something weird happened.

53
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,400
I saw Mai Tree ran in and broke the vase.

54
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,000
And when she did again, it wasn’t broken.

55
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,480
Or maybe I was imagining things.

56
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,200
For now, I think we should
clean your wound first.

57
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,560
Let’s go. Watch out.

58
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,080
Does it hurt a lot ?

59
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,760
I have something to tell you.

60
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,480
My side of family has inherited
an ability to manipulate time.

61
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,159
From time pausing and time reversal,
for generations.

62
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,200
But there are a few conditions
of time reversal.

63
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,520
When we bleed, we won’t be able
to use the ability temporarily.

64
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:57,600
Another key condition is,

65
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,400
At the time of time reversal,
the person you touch

66
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,160
travels through time with you
while the memories stay with them.

67
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,560
I need to make sure you know that this power…

68
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,440
…is extraordinary.

69
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,160
So, do not use it to interfere

70
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,120
with anyone’s life and death.

71
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,680
Using time reversal power
to change the future,

72
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,080
Can affect things in the future.

73
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,960
So, it’s important not to use
it just for fun, okay ?

74
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,440
Mommy.

75
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,120
Now I know what I want to be when I grow up.

76
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,600
What do you want to be ?

77
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,800
I want to be a doctor.

78
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,280
You’re not going to ask why?

79
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,480
Why would you want to be a doctor ?

80
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,280
I don’t know if it’s weird,

81
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,960
but I keep dreaming about a female doctor.

82
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,080
I frequently see her in my dreams,
and also last night.

83
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,520
In my dreams, she works so hard
to help her patients, mommy.

84
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Keep seeing her…

85
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,560
…makes me want to save people like she does.

86
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,800
Frequently dream about her ?

87
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,080
I’m not sure why.

88
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,440
But I’ve heard that some of our ancestors

89
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,039
Could see future incidents
through their dreams.

90
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,120
It’s called visions.

91
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,039
See the future ?

92
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,320
Visions ?

93
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,840
In the future,
you might meet her in real life.

94
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,640
Really ?

95
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,280
I would love to meet her !

96
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,440
[ Emergency ]

97
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,320
Doctor.

98
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,000
First responders reported an incoming accident case.

99
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,400
Noted.

100
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,480
We'll be ready for it.

101
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Kleo Kluen !

102
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,760
Kleo Kluen !

103
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,960
Karan.

104
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,640
Please stop using your power to save me.

105
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,320
Kleo Kluen ! Wait !

106
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,120
Hey, Kleo Kluen !

107
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,800
Kleo Kluen !

108
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,680
Anyone, help !

109
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,920
Help, please !

110
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,720
Help ! Call an ambulance !

111
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,080
Dr. Karan ?

112
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,080
Are you alright ?

113
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,600
Dr. Karan, are you okay ?

114
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,200
Dr. Karan, are you okay ?

115
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,640
I’m fine.

116
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,280

You’re exaggerating it.

126
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,720
If I was exaggerating it,
so are the people on social media.

127
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,320
How is my make up ? Do I look cute ?

128
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,200
You seem very determined
to look extra cute today.

129
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,280
Because I’m seeing Thee today !

130
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,720
What a handsome guy.

131
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,160
Been handsome since the orientation

132
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,160
…to today we are working in wards.

133
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,200
He looks so clean as if
he takes a bath 10 times a day.

134
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,960
Elegant, quiet, smart,

135
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,800
And he’s a bit shy.

136
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,920
Exactly my type !

137
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,640
If I see him today,

138
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,880
I don’t know if I’ll be able to act normal.

139
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,240
Looks like someone is so nervous.

140
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,880
You already can’t act normal now.

141
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,760
But we really need to pack up and go.

142
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,600
We’re going to be late.

143
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,000
Hurry up!
I won’t wait if you take any longer.

144
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,120
Okay ! I’m coming !

145
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,880
So.

146
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,960
Do I look any different today ?

147
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,520
- Yes, you look totally different.
- How ?

148
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,040
- My make up ?
- Different hair and make ups.

149
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,200
Well, I need to be prepared.

150
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,800
I even put lip gloss on. Can you tell ?

151
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,960
Do I look any fresher ?

152
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,120
Any fresher than the matte ones ?

153
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,160
I got to go.

154
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,080
Kleo.

155
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,600
Could you walk me to the ward today ?

156
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,200
What ?

157
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,880
Please ?

158
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,480
Are you crazy ?

159
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,680
You want me to go on 7th floor with you…

160
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,640
…when my ER is 7 steps away ?

161
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,680
I’m seeing Thee today. I’m nervous !

162
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,440
Please.

163
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,080
Please walk me there.

164
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,400
What’s this all about ?

165
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,720
You woke up so early
to do your hair and wear makeups.

166
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,360
Where’s that confidence ?

167
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,200
Come on, just once, please, Kleo ?

168
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,880
Please!

169
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,160
You know I freak out when I get nervous.

170
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
Fine.

171
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,200
How do you think the surgery ward
would be this time?

172
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,920
Why are you so worried ?

173
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,760
Well, last time I was there, it was so cruel.

174
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,920
Professor Dech was there, making it worse !

175
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,680
And you think the ER would be kind to me ?

176
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,680
It’s not different from yours.

177
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,520
True. ER would be as horrible.

178
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,880
Keep going !

179
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,880
Kleo

180
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,840
Kleo

181
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,000
Kleo !

182
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,960
What’s going on ?

183
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,840
That was Doctor Kaomesa.

184
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,520
What Kaomesa ?

185
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,640
That was Dr. May.

186
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,840
The famous pediatrician of this hospital.

187
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,600
You remembered a wrong person.

188
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,000
Really ?

189
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
Are you alright ?

190
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,800
And you’re still looking
for your Dr. Kaomesa ?

191
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,480
I’m not giving up.

192
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,359
I know I’ll see her one day.

193
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:07,640
Yeah.

194
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,160
I’ve got your back.

195
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,560
But should we get in the elevator ?
The door is about to close.

196
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
Hold on !

197
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,160
Hi Thee !

198
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,280
Hi.

199
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,560
Are you going to the surgery ward, Thee ?

200
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,480
Yeah.

201
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,800
I’m assigned to the surgery ward.

202
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,080
Oh…

203
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,560
That’s so nice.

204
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,000
Have you had breakfast ?

205
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,680
There is a coffee shop
with bakery in front of the ward.

206
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,520
You are holding a cup of coffee.

207
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
I had my breakfast.

208
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,440
Oh… um…

209
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
That’s good.

210
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,520
No need to walk me there anymore.

211
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,760
See you after work.

212
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,960
Can you believe her ?

213
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,920
- Chai, can I see the record?
- Yes, sure.

214
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,640
I have finished with the tasks
with my patients.

215
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,680
And I’m getting some coffee.
Would you like anything?

216
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,160
I’d like an Oliang please !

217
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,960
I don’t think they have Oliang there, Chai.

218
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,320
Aw…

219
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
Should we leave the drinks aside for now ?
Incoming patient.

220
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,280
Yeah.

221
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,160
What brought him here ?

222
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,200
Tachypnea, dropped stance.

223
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,720
Red zone, red zone.

224
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,080
Adjust the stretcher up, please.

225
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,400
Doctor ! There’s another patient
with abdomen pain out here !

226
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,600
Kleo, I need you on it, please.

227
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,880
- Sure !
- Thank you

228
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,240
Calm down, take a deep breath. Deep breath.

229
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,160
Abdomen pain brought her here,
right, Nurse Chai ?

230
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,680
She’s had that for three days now.

231
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,600
I’m Doctor Kleo, 6th year medical student.

232
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,120
Which part of your stomach does it hurt ?

233
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,240
All of it !

234
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,880
Lay on your back, please.
- On your back.

235
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,920
It hurts so badly.

236
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,040
- Excuse me, I need to lift the shirt up.
- Excuse me.

237
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,120
Make it faster, can you ? Ow !

238
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,240
Let me check over here.

239
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,000
Argh! You ***

240
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,440
- It hurts !
- Please don’t move.

241
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,640
It’s your hand that hurts me !

242
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,680
It hurts ! What have you done !?

243
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,080
Don’t you have any better doctor ?

244
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,680
How unfortunate I am !

245
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,760
Doctor Kaomesa.

246
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,800
I’ll take this case.

247
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,080
Have you had a bowel movement today ?

248
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,680
I’ll need to press here.

249
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,080
These symptoms can indicate many things--

250
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,280
Infection, food poisoning...

251
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
You’ll be sent to the x-ray department.

252
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,400
Okay.

253
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,840
I’ll need lab test on her UA, UBT,
and FOBT please.

254
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,400
Yes, doctor.

255
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Extern.

256
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,280
Follow me.

257
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,440
Doctor Kaomesa,

258
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,680
Call me Karan.

259
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,400
Yes, Karan.

260
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,680
Extern

261
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,600
You needed to be calmer, you know?

262
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,960
No matter how the patients treat you.

263
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,880
For any situation beyond your control,
call the staff right away.

264
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,200
Got it?

265
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,720
An Yong !

266
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,880
Where has your heart wandered to ?

267
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,000
No where.

268
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,640
And what are you doing here ?

269
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,400
I’m putting on my lipstick !

270
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,520
They said I look as pale as a paper.

271
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,800
You already look amazing.

272
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,600
Really ?

273
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,400
Those patient transporters say the same.
I’m sick of them.

274
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,120
Do you remember the patient
from this afternoon ?

275
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,160
-Yes?
-The x-ray result is out: bowel obstruction.

276
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,880
Has she had the CT scan ?

277
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Doctor Ay has sent her there.

278
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,280
Chunks of hair were found !

279
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,120
Doctor Ay diagnosed her
having the Rapunzel syndrome.

280
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,880
Rapunzel syndrome ?

281
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,080
Is that when patients
pull out their hair and eat it ?

282
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,520
Exactly.

283
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,440
I have only read about it in books.

284
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,080
Never expected
to encounter one in real life.

285
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,400
Yeah, the OR is set for that.

286
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,720
That’s good.

287
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,280
Um, Chai, can I ask you something ?

288
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,880
The doctor who came in
and helped me this afternoon, is she…?

289
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,480
Oh, Doctor Karan !

290
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,280
You know Doctor Karan ?

291
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,000
Only her name.

292
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,320
Karan is my fellow.

293
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,320
Her nickname is...

294
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,960
the Frozen Face of the OR

295
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,880
Doctor Ay, you also talk
behind people’s back, don’t you ?

296
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,040
So, is she… taken?

297
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Uh oh !

298
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,840
Is someone having a crush on her ?

299
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,920
I can tell !

300
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,160
You wouldn't ask if you weren't.

301
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,480
No, no. You said…

302
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,000
…that she is the Frozen Face of the OR.

303
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,600
So, I wondered.

304
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,760
Ah.

305
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,160
Was that your first time meeting her ?

306
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,760
That must be tense.

307
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,040
Be chilled. Relax. It’s fine.

308
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,760
Take it as a welcome event here.

309
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,920
- Just chill.
- Yeah.

310
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,320
It’s a special welcome event, though.

311
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,560
Because you’re welcomed by a CVT doctor,

312
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,240
Who is stunning and smart,

313
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,120
But is also frigid cold.

314
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,280
Brrr, I’m freezing !

315
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,120
It’s unusual, though.

316
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,000
Doctor Karan doesn’t really
come in to the ER, normally.

317
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,520
Right.

318
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,960
I have been working here for years.

319
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,600
And I’ve never seen
Dr. Karan in the ER at all.

320
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,440
Not sure what had brought her there.

321
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,560
Probably the coldest wind
from the highest mountain range

322
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
....in the world brought her there.

323
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,560
- Really ?
- Positive !

324
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,680
- It’s so cold !
- Freezing !

325
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,480
But I have never really seen her there.

326
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,560
Yeah, today was the first time.

327
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,360
That’s unusual.

328
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,440
Right.

329
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,480
How do I look with these lips ?

330
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,520
- Freaking red now. That’s enough.
- Okay.

331
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,920
You’d scare off the patients.

332
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,720
Can I put some on ?

333
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,040
Doctor, are you sure?

334
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,240
It’s fine. Let me try some.

335
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,160
Nah ! It's a waste.

336
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,560
Come on, just a little.

337
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,720
[ Miss. ]

338
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,200
[ Yes. ]

339
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,200
No matter how cruel this world is to you,

340
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,280
Please remember .

341
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
That there’s always someone who loves.

342
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,520
And cares about you.

343
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,120
Give me your hand, Kleo Kluen.

344
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,680
I’ll prove it to you.

345
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,560
That you are truly deeply loved.

346
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,920
From now on.

347
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,520
Please don't even
consider harming yourself again.

348
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,840
And take a good care of yourself.

349
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,040
Extern, follow me.

350
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,120
Extern.

351
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
You needed to be calmer, you know ?

352
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,800
No matter how the patients treat you.

353
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,480
For any situation beyond your control,
call the staff right away.

354
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,040
Got it ?

355
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,120
Hey ! Stop !

356
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,280
Stop !

357
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
I remember you

358
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,600
Stop !

359
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,200
Step back !

360
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Let go of her !

361
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,200
When I get out.

362
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,440
You’ll be dead !

363
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,200
Are you okay ?

364
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,440
You alright ?

365
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,040
Please take her to the ER

366
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,160

400
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,360
I’m not sure either.

401

00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,040
- Yeah?
- They look so real and feel so real, for real!

548
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,640
I'm shooting an arrow at your heart.

549
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,880
**Basic life support equipment everywhere**

550
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,080
And... action!

551
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,200
Good. That's great. Just great.

552
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
It's how Thee sees you.

553
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,840
But it's going to be in a slow motion.

554
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,120
**Appear, and stop a man's world.**

555
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,040
- That's the feel. Thats the feel.
- Flip your hair.

556
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,240
The audience would see that
you bring the light to Thee's world.

557
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,080
She's so cute walking in.

558
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,960
**Filming**

559
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,800
**Shine bright like a diamond**

560
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,960
You got a twin today.

561
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,040
**Karan has a twin sister today**
Yes, we have a stunt here.

562
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,200
She's going to be in the building jump scene
where she will dive down.

563
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,000
Okay
(Hello)

564
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,440
This would be confusing to the crew.
**Already, for a cameraman**

565
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,240
Just right. Exactly the same.

566
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,480
**She is another me**
Like a goat an a sheep.

567
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,560
Bahhh

568
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,320
A bit too white.

569
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,640
Ready? 3-2-1 Action.

570
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,000
**That's the move, doctor.**

571
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,360
**Such pros**

572
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,280
- Kliao? Kliao?
- Huh?

573
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,480
(Stunned by the move.)

574
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,960
**And these content creators...**
10-20-30-40

575
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,000
- I go by car.
- I go by boat.

576
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,840
- I go by boat.
- I go by an elevator.

577
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,280
10-20-30-40
**How fun being stuck in an elevator.**

578
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,040
Hang on, please!

579
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,600
Hi, Thee.

580
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,560
Hello.

581
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,480
(My heart is pounding hard in here)

582
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,840
Are you going to the surgery ward, Thee?

583
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah, I'm in the surgery ward now.

584
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,760
Aw, that's so nice.

585
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,640
**Someone is happy for her riend, boss**

586
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,680
**Dr. Karan in work mode**
Can I pick this doctor?

587
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,080
**The more she focuses, the hotter she is**

588
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,320
Which one looks better: The one on the monitors or you here?

589
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,680
Can't you see, though?
**You can tell by looking at me**

590
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,760
You're even more attractive in person.

591
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,320
(I know, right?)

592
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,560
(Scared for real)
That really scared me.

593
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,360
Hey, stop!

594
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,640
Stop it!

595
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,120
- Stop!
- Cut!

596
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,360
No, Kliao Khluen!

597
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,640
You're not going to help her?

598
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,920
**Meaw, come and save your bestie**
She's being strangled down here.
