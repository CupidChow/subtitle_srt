1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,760
Do you think you'll be really okay with dating a woman ?

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,400
Those homosexuals ? They don't last long.

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,040
I'm not a kid.

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,800
What I want to do, who I want to like, it's my business.

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,240
Kliao !

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,600
If you step your feet out of here,
make sure you never return !

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,320
- Honey ! Honey !
- Dad !

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,360
Dad !

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,400
The shooter is still out there.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,640
The person wears a medical gown.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,080
Which could mean that he is a doctor.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,880
I heard that when you bleed,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,880
You won't be able to reverse time ?

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,560
8 January 2017

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,960
Hello?

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,320
Are you asleep?

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Yeah.

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Not anymore.

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,039
We're picking you up. We have just left home.

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,360
Yeah, okay.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,400
I'll hurry up and pack up.

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,640
- You must be excited for this vacation.
- Of course.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,920
It's all planned by my little brother.

24
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,800
How can I not be excited?

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Hey, Tree.

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,640
I hope you remembered to bring my swimwear?

27
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,720
Of course, don't worry about that.
You'll be ready to dip in tomorrow.

28
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,200
- It's going to be fun.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,680
Sorry, I asked you to pick me up this late in the evening.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,520
- Now we have to travel at night.
- It's fine.

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,280
Dad is a good driver.

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,160
You can come out to the front of the hospital.

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,720
- We'll be there in 15 minutes.
- Okay, see you.

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,880
Doctor, there is an incoming road accident case.

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
Okay.

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,600
Let's be prepared.

37
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,920
15 January 2017

38
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,200
- Have fun at work, son!
- I will, dad!

39
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,120
Fiat, you're booked for your next days off.

40
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,040
- I'll plan the next trip.
- Noted!

41
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,960
- Call us if there's anything, honey.
- Yes, mommy.

42
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,440
- Dad, drive safe!
- Sure, will do.

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,120
Bye, see you!

44
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,640
Emergency! A patient is on the rooftop!

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,080
- What? Let's go!
- Is he jumping off?

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,080
Hurry!

47
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,800
Hey, Karan!

48
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,360
Kiddo, calm down! Please don’t do it.

49
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,240
Leave me alone! Go away!

50
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,000
I have nothing left.

51
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,880
Kliao Khluen

52
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,560
Let’s not think about those painful stuff.

53
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,280
No one knows how I feel!

54
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,000
In this cruel world,

55
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,000
There are many people who love you.

56
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Give me your hand, Kliao Khluen.

57
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I’ll prove it to you.

58
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,520
That you are....

59
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,120
...truly deeply loved.

60
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,760
Hey, Karan!

61
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,480
Extern!

62
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,560
A patient needs you.

63
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,600
15 January 2017

64
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,600
8 January 2017

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,920
Emergency

66
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,760
Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom!

67
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
What happened to my mom?

68
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,159
Mom!

69
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,800
What happened to my mom?

70
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,159
Mommy?

71
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,600
Dad!

72
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,880
Dad! Wake up!

73
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,640
- Wake up, dad!
- Stay out, please.

74
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,560
Wake up! Dad! Wake up!

75
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,520
Wake up, dad!

76
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,640
- Dad! Dad!
- EKG---

77
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,040
Dad!

78
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,720
Tree!

79
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
8 January 2017

80
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,600
11 January 2017

81
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Fiat.

82
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Tree.

83
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,039
You're conscious.

84
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,280
How are you feeling?

85
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm okay. I'm okay.

86
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,440
Where are dad and mom?

87
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,440
Are they next door?

88
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,040
They're in other rooms?

89
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
Listen to me, Tree.

90
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,160
Dad and mom are gone Tree.

91
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,720
Dad and mom...

92
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,240
...are no longer with us.

93
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,560
Fiat, don't lie to me, okay?

94
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,720
Don't be kidding about this.

95
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,320
Are they next door?

96
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,640
Are dad and mom right next door?

97
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,560
Don't you lie to me like this?

98
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,120
- Fiat, where are our parents?
- Dad and mom are gone, Tree!

99
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,320
- Where is dad?!
- Our parents are gone!

100
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,000
- I said don't lie to me!
- Listen, listen! They are gone, Tree!

101
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,680
Are dad and mom okay?

102
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,000
I shouldn't have asked them to go to the beach...

103
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,680
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

104
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,360
- No, Tree.
- I'm so sorry.

105
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,120
- It's no one's fault.
- I shouldn't have ask them to go to the beach.

106
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry, Fiat.

107
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,600
11 January 2017

108
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,960
12 January 2017

109
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,240
It's alright, Tree. It's not your fault at all.

110
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Tree, listen to me.

111
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,160
It might sound kind of weird, but...

112
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,520
I feel like we've gone to the beach already.

113
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,640
Do you remember?

114
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,280
Tree, I hope you remembered to bring my swimwear?

115
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,480
Of course, don't worry about that.

116
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,360
- Have fun at work, son!
- I will, dad!

117
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,680
Fiat, you're booked for your next days off.

118
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,840
- I'll plan the next trip.
- Dad.

119
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,080
- Drive safe!
- Sure, will do.

120
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,680
Bye!

121
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,360
We took photos together. Just a sec, Tree.

122
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,200
Where are they?

123
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,640
Hold on, Tree. We did took photos!

124
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,040
Tree.

125
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,200
I believe that our parents are not dead yet.

126
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,080
But it's like...

127
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,120
Something took us back in time.

128
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,720
We have traveled back in time, Tree.
We have gone to the beach that day.

129
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,720
You, dad, and mom picked me up at the hospital.
Remember?

130
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,880
We really did, Tree. You need to remember it.

131
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,120
Tree, we have been to the beach!

132
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,280
I'm serious, Tree! Recall it!

133
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,600
We have been to the beach.

134
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,040
We took photos! Recall it!
We have traveled back in time!

135
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm serious, Tree. We can bring our parents back.

136
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,120
Do you believe me?

137
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,680
We went to the beach already, Tree.

138
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,800
Tree!

139
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,760
Tree, calm down.

140
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,040
- Yes, doctor.
- He is in panic. Please get his doctor in charge.

141
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Tree!

142
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,640
Calm down. It's okay.

143
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Excuse me.

144
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,280
Let me see.

145
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,880
I think he's having an acute stress disorder.

146
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,680
If it lasts longer than one month,

147
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,880
We might need to consult with a psychiatrist.

148
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,680
To receive a PTSD assessment.

149
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,200
Yes, professor.

150
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,640
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

151
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,560
Don't even consider harming yourself again.

152
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,120
From now on, take a good care of yourself.

153
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,400
Your name is on it! It's there!

154
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,320
- ♫ Right here waiting, waiting for you ♫
- Are you still looking for Dr. Kaomesa?

155
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,480
7 years later
12 January 2017
18 May 2024

156
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,960
No one knows how I feel!

157
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,960
Hey, stop!

158
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,960
- Hey! Hey! Stop!
- Here you are...

159
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,280
Hey, hey hey!

160
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,680
Let go!

161
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,440
- Are you alright?
- Doctor?

162
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,600
Are you okay?

163
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,000
- Let's take her to the ER first.
- Sure, doctor.

164
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,480
- Easy.
- Dr. Kliao Khluen

165
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,120
Let's go to the ER?

166
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,760
Kliao Khluen?

167
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,760
Can I have one hot latte with…

168
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,640
A piece of croissant, please?

169
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,160
- One hot latte and a croissant?
- Yes.

170
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,480
Excuse me, I’d like two pieces of croissants.

171
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,080
This time, listen to me first.

172
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,960
I've got evidence.
I'll prove that we have traveled back in time.

173
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,080
Fiat, seriously, please stop.

174
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,760
Can we stop talking about this?
I thought you asked me here for an important matter.

175
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,160
Listen to me.

176
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,480
Please?

177
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,400
You know Kliao Khluen the extern, right?

178
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,000
Why? How does she have to do with this?

179
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,880
Kliao Khluen is the one who can give us the answer

180
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,800
The answer? The answer of what?

181
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,680
Of the fact that we have traveled back in time, Tree!

182
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,160
Fiat, please, stop talking about this!

183
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Okay.

184
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,920
If you don't want to talk about this,

185
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,360
I'll just prove it to you.

186
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,040
18 May 2024

187
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,680
26 May 2024
So, last night...

188
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,880
Did you drive me back to my dorm?

189
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,240
What are you talking about?

190
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,960
We met last night.

191
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,760
And didn't you drive me back to my dorm?

192
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,760
I didn't see you last night.

193
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
I have a case in the next 10 minutes.

194
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,880
I gotta go.

195
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,760
The incident 7 years ago was real, right?

196
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,560
You were really my life-saver, right?

197
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,680
I wasn't imagining or dreaming things?

198
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,040
Right, Karan?

199
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,760
Answer me!

200
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,480
Were you the one who saved me?

201
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,960
I got crashed by a car
my arm had to be amputated.

202
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,920
I got shot and fell off the rooftop.

203
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,680
Were you the one who saved me?

204
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,080
I'm asking if you were the one
who saved me from all of this!

205
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,400
Yes.

206
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,920
I was the one who turned back in time to save you.

207
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,920
I was the one who healed your arm.

208
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,720
26 May 2024

209
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,200
28 May 2024

210
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,800
Karan

211
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,920
Help me with this case, would you?

212
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,000
- Let's talk in the break room.
- Okay.

213
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,960
It's this case I need your help with.

214
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,880
Male patient, 63.

215
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,400
Underlying Triple Vessel Disease

216
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,920
DM, and dyslipidemia.

217
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,360
S/P CABG Day 1

218
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,800
Post op: Frequent short run VT.

219
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,760
I've sent the report to the cardiology ward.

220
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,280
Is there any problem with intra-op?

221
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,720
Well, not really a problem.

222
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,400
Just a little bleeding.

223
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Have you done the elyte post op?

224
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
I have!

225
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,320
So, please take care of this case for me.

226
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,240
And then, you just take the case?

227
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,320
Just because you're lazy?

228
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,760
- It's not that much. And I've been busy.
- Yeah, right.

229
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,120
When the lab results come out, I'll keep it K4 Mg2 for you.

230
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,520
Thank you.

231
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,400
Is there anything else?

232
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,240
I need to go to the OR.

233
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,720
See you later.

234
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,160
Hey,

235
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,560
Do you know that extern in our ward?
Her name is....

236
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,880
...Kliao Khluen?

237
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,120
Not personally.

238
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,440
Just wondering.

239
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,080
I saw her kind of waited for you.

240
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,440
I think she is probably interested in you.

241
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,800
You're just imagining things. I'm leaving.

242
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,880
♫ That you are the one I've been searching for. ♫

243
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,800
That's my girl! That's my girl!

244
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,320
Great job!

245
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,040
Kliao sings really nice, don't you think?

246
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,920
Of course she does! She's a singer.

247
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,720
- Are you her fan?
- Seems like it.

248
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,480
I am her fan.

249
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Oh, yeah,

250
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,440
I watched a series the other day.

251
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,760
It was about...

252
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,760
...someone who could turn back time.

253
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,840
- Have you seen it?
- Nope.

254
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,640
- Here.
- Hey,

255
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,920
- That's interesting.
- The plot is like...

256
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,280
The protagonist turned back time to fix things in the past.

257
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,720
It's so addictive. I've watched 3 episodes.

258
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,640
How about you, Karan?

259
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,400
Do you believe in time reversal?

260
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,320
But who knows, right?

261
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,400
Maybe one day, that would be possible for you.

262
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,440
How would that be possible?

263
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Even science can't do that yet.

264
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,840
By the way, why don't you drink tonight?

265
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,080
You don't really come out to drink very often.

266
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,040
I'll have to drive.

267
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,560
Well, leave your car here.

268
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,120
I'm leaving. I got some things to do.

269
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,080
28 May 2024

270
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,040
30 May 2024

271
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,920
So, what's up?

272
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,560
Why are you back here eating with me today?

273
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,800
I'd like to ask for your advice.

274
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,880
What is it about?

275
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,080
I'm in the surgery ward now.

276
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
There was a CVT case.

277
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,840
And....

278
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,400
No matter how much I read,
nothing makes sense.

279
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,520
I did some researches, reading studies.

280
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,760
I still don't get it.

281
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
And also,

282
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
the professor puts so much pressure on me.

283
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,680
I don't think I can continue.

284
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,840
You're an extern now, aren't you?

285
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Huh?

286
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,760
You'll graduate in no time.

287
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,960
Be patient, would you?

288
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,480
I really can't do this, Fiat.

289
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,960
I can't keep going any more.

290
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,960
I don't even want to leave my dorm to the classes.

291
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Tree

292
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,920
You're not happy with your life these days

293
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,480
It's not because of the classes you take.

294
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,000
But it's on what happened to our family!

295
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,920
How many times have I told you?

296
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,920
Will there be any day you stop with these horseshits?

297
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,920
Care more about the others' feelings.

298
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,600
30 May 2024

299
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,280
2 June 2024
Surgery
From now on, there's nothing you should be worried about.

300
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
It's over.

301
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,400
Thank you so much, Karan.

302
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,840
If you hadn't seen that vision,

303
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,480
I wouldn't be here now.

304
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,280
Thank you again for protecting me.

305
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,680
Luckily, I saw that vision first.

306
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,680
Because if I get injured and bleed,

307
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,000
Time reversal would be impossible.

308
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,840
Why?

309
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,600
If you're injured and bleed,

310
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,880
why can't you reverse the time?

311
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,040
It's a condition.

312
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,920
I don't know why either.

313
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,320
But it has always been like that.

314
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,560
Tree.

315
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,360
I know you'd call me crazy.

316
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,360
But I've found it.

317
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,960
I've found the prove that we have reversed back in time.

318
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,480
2 June 2024

319
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,920
8 June 2024
- You're heading out?
- Yeah.
Just finished an operation.
I'll see you tomorrow.

320
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,960
Kliao.

321
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,640
Kliao, Kliao.

322
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,480
Kliao, pick up the phone.

323
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,120
Oh, Kliao, please be safe.

324
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,920
Fiat.

325
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,520
Why did you do this to me?

326
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,480
Calm down.

327
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,000
It's getting even more exciting for you.

328
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,640
Do you remember this voice?

329
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Kliao?

330
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,120
Where did you take her to?

331
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,560
Kliao Khluen is fine.

332
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,360
She is untouched.

333
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,760
What do you want?

334
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
I now want you, Karan.

335
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,360
Come to the abandoned house,
at the end of the road, behind the hospital.

336
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,440
Within 30 minutes.

337
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,320
Don't tell anyone, and come alone.

338
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,200
If you try to get tricky,

339
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,680
Get ready to say goodbye to Kliao Khluen.

340
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,480
Fiat.

341
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
Fiat.

342
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,040
Fiat.

343
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Tree.

344
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,400
Come see me.

345
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,280
I'm at the abandoned house
behind the hospital.

346
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,320
With a friend of yours.

347
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Kliao Khluen.

348
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,720
What does she have to do with this?

349
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,320
What the heck are you doing?

350
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,000
Let's get this over with.

351
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,360
Earlier than I expected.

352
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,640
- Kliao.
- Huh?

353
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,400
Stop right there.

354
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,560
Fiat.

355
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,480
What the hell are you doing?

356
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,400
Why are you doing this?

357
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,960
What do you want?

358
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,680
You're a doctor.

359
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,360
Have you lost all of your ethics, Fiat?

360
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,720
You questioned the medical ethics in me?

361
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
What about you?

362
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,080
Do you even have the ethics of being a human?

363
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,320
Huh?

364
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,360
You are a murderer.

365
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,440
You killed my family.

366
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,800
Do you remember?

367
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,160
What are you talking about?

368
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,600
Pretending to be innocent, eh?

369
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,000
You must be wondering how I know.

370
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,160
That night, on the rooftop,

371
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,960
when she was about to jump off it,

372
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,720
I happened to come back in time with you two.

373
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,280
And it was my family...

374
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,560
...who died instead of her!

375
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,040
Mom! Mom!

376
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,480
Get up, dad!

377
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,080
You knew all of this?

378
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,360
I've always known.

379
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,360
I've always known the thing in my head is real.

380
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,200
And that you can turn back time.

381
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,600
I'm sorry, Fiat.

382
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,120
I'm sorry!

383
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,600
The only thing I want...

384
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,960
...is not your apology.

385
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,400
But I want my family

386
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,920
Who died because of you!

387
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,280
You need to turn back to 7 years ago

388
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,320
And bring back my family.

389
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,960
Don't you even play any tricks on this!

390
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,160
Because no matter how many times
you turn back time,

391
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,960
I'd still do the same!

392
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,840
- No!
- Do you want to try?!

393
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,560
- Karan, don't. Don't!
- Shut up!

394
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,880
Karan.

395
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,280
Karan, don't turn back to save me any longer.

396
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,920
Don't. Don't lose more time of your life because of me.

397
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,800
I beg you.

398
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,040
So many conditions.

399
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,760
I don't give a shit.

400
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,880
Turn it back for me.

401
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,840
So that I can have them back!

402
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,320
No! No, Karan. Don't!

403
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,880
Don't!

404
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Do it!

405
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,600
Sure.

406
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
No!

407
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,719
I'll try.

408
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
Fiat.

409
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,120
I really can't go back.

410
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,360
It just gets worse and worse.

411
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,440
There are children, too, Fiat.

412
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,720
Kids would die.

413
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,360
And they have nothing to do with this!

414
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,840
B*tch, you're lying to me!

415
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
You can do it. You just don't want to!

416
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,360
How come you could help her?

417
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,640
But not me?

418
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,280
My parents died.

419
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Have you even seen me as your friend?

420
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,920
Huh?

421
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,800
I wish I could, Fiat.

422
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,880
But it was not a lie.

423
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,960
I wish I could go back to save your parents.

424
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,080
But I really can't, Fiat!

425
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,560
Please put the gun down.

426
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,840
What does Kliao has to do with this?

427
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,920
Please... Please let go of her.

428
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,880
Kliao.

429
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Tree.

430
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,760
Fiat, what are you doing?

431
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Tree, I can prove it now.

432
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,960
Karan has the time-reversal ability!

433
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Nobody has time-reversal ability, brother.

434
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,640
- Tree!
- Will you ever get over this shit?

435
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,120
Listen to me!

436
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,520
They really can do it. They are demons!

437
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,200
They killed our parents!

438
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,200
Our parents died, Fiat.

439
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,760
They are no longer with us.

440
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,600
- Do you hear me?
- You hear me out!

441
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,600
- They can turn back time!
- No one can turn back time!

442
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,600
There is no way to bring them back,
don't you get it?

443
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
- Tree! Listen!
- Don't you get it!?

444
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,920
- Do you hear me!?
- How many times have I told you!?

445
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,120
- Tree...
- I said they are dead....

446
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,240
Listen!

447
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Tree

448
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,560
Tree!

449
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,600
They are dead.

450
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,080
Do you see what you have done?

451
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,520
Huh? Do you see?

452
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,480
My family is  like this...

453
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,640
because of you, Karan.

454
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,120
Fiat,

455
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,120
I'm sorry.

456
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,280
But please don't be like this.

457
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,720
Fiat, please don't do this.

458
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,960
If I can't be happy,

459
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,200
then so can't you.

460
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,720
Stop it!

461
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,240
Don't cause any more deaths.

462
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Tree

463
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,080
Tree!

464
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,720
Do you believe me now?

465
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,600
They are demons!

466
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,080
They killed our parents, Tree.

467
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,520
They killed our parents!

468
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,720
Karan! Karan! Karan!

469
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,400
Karan! No!

470
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,840
- Karan!
- Karan, no.

471
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,400
Karan, no, no.

472
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,040
Karan, don't sleep yet. Karan, stay awake.

473
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,080
Karan, listen to me.

474
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,800
Meow

475
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,040
Hey,

476
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,920
Have you heard about Doctor Karan?

477
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,200
No, what's going on?

478
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,000
Last night, Doctor Fiat stabbed Doctor Karan.

479
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,720
- ...in the resting room!
- What? doctor Fiat?

480
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,800
Right!

481
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,240
The surgery war was hectic!

482
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,200
- That sounds so scary.
- Yeah!

483
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,040
How could Doctor Fiat do such thing?

484
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,080
I thought they were best friends.

485
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,160
- That's right! I don't get it either.
- Oh, hey!

486
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,360
What's the talk about? You two look kind of stressed.

487
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,920
It's about Doctor Karan, of course.

488
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,240
To be honest,
it's hard to know what Doctor Fiat was thinking.

489
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,880
What was his motive?

490
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,600
Yesterday,

491
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,560
I was in the ER, right?

492
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,960
I saw Doctor's Fiat little brother got admitted.

493
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,000
I heard he drank some bathroom liquid cleaner.

494
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,520
And he choked on it, down to his lungs.

495
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,400
- He's probably in ICU now.
- Sounds scary.

496
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,080
Is that true, Doctor Ay?

497
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,080
And you know what?

498
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,520
After he stabbed her,

499
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,280
They all went for a talk at the abandoned house
behind our hospital!

500
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,520
And there were police officers!

501
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,880
- It has gone way too far!
- Seriously.

502
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,720
And you know what? One more thing.

503
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,200
Doctor Fiat has some connections.

504
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,000
So, he was cleared and bailed out already.

505
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,640
Excuse me. I'm here to see Tree, my brother.

506
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,240
Which ward is Mr. Chaowalit in?

507
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,480
- Just a moment, Dr. Fiat.
- Sure.

508
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,400
- He's in ICU 2.
- Thank you.

509
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,080
What is this all about, Dr. Ay?

510
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,840
I don't know.

511
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,920
But as far as I concern,

512
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,440
I'm not sure which direction
his career would go from now.

513
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,800
Why the hell are you here?

514
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,320
Calm down, Fiat.

515
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,240
I'm here to help you.

516
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,800
I'm sorry.

517
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,160
I can't save your family.

518
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,960
Because every time I turn back time,

519
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,040
the outcome and consequences get worsened.

520
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,160
Just like what happened to your family.

521
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,560
If it was you that night who fell off the rooftop,

522
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,000
I would turn back time to save you
without thinking twice as well.

523
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,920
I apologize.

524
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,320
For causing your pain.

525
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,120
But there's a way to save Tree.

526
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,720
We can save Tree from this.

527
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,600
I'm such a terrible big brother, right, Tree?

528
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,160
I'm so sorry.

529
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,360
Please come back to me.

530
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,520
10 June 2024

531
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,160
8 June 2024

532
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,200
Tree?

533
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,880
Do you want to grab some dinner with me?

534
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,760
Nothing.

535
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,960
Kliao.

536
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,360
Dad.

537
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,360
How are you feeling?

538
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,600
I'm good now.

539
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,040
Kliao.

540
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,720
Are you drained out?

541
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,000
I'm all good.

542
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,800
It's doctor's duty, dad.

543
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,360
Are you drained out being my daughter?

544
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,480
I'm sorry, Kliao.

545
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,120
Sorry for not being good enough.

546
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,000
For forcing you all these times.

547
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,600
Actually,

548
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,920
I just wanted you to have a great life.

549
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,320
But I forgot

550
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,440
that what I think was great

551
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,880
was not the best for everyone.

552
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,640
My actions have caused you great suffering.

553
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,280
And torn our family apart.

554
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,920
But now,

555
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,560
Now I see.

556
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,040
That the path you have chosen

557
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,800
has brought you happiness.

558
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,040
I'm sorry, Kliao...

559
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:13,360
...that I'm a terrible father for you.

560
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,080
That's not true at all, dad.

561
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,120
You're not a terrible father for me at all.

562
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,680
I get it now.

563
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,520
I know how much you care about me.

564
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,520
I've also been too determined.

565
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,200
There were times I didn't listen to you.

566
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,840
I'm sorry, dad.

567
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,240
I'm sorry, too, Kliao.

568
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,160
You don't need to be sorry at all.

569
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,640
You did nothing wrong.

570
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,360
Kliao.

571
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,520
When you need to recharge,

572
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,520
please come home.

573
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,840
Have dinner with mom and I.

574
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,080
And also,

575
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,440
I...

576
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,760
I want to hear you sing.

577
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,920
Yes.

578
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,640
Yes, dad.

579
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,440
Thank you so much.

580
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,360
- Daddy?
- Hm?

581
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,640
If so,

582
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,320
Can I ask one thing from you?

583
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,720
Yes.

584
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,440
Please don't force Fong.

585
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,480
I want him to choose his own path.

586
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,640
Please, daddy?

587
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,760
Okay

588
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,960
I love you most, daddy.

589
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,480
I love you, too, Kliao.

590
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,520
Next week, my moms are coming to visit us.

591
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm worried about our financial status.

592
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,880
Our families are so different.

593
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,600
Your family is really rich.

594
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,880
While I'm just an average girl.

595
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,040
Do you remember when you asked me

596
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,040
...what happiness is?

597
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,960
Whenever you feel your heart is heavy,

598
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,040
I want you to remember
that I'll always be by your side.
