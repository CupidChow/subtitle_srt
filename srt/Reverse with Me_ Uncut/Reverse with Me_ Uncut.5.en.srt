1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,880
Are doctor Fiat and doctor Karan
really, really close ?

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,200
Have been besties from their school.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,040
- Two of them against all odds...
- Whoa !

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,600
What kind of person is Karan, exactly, huh ?

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,120
Fiat and I...

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,480
We're just best friends.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,640
I hope you don't overthink, extern.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,680
I had a leg-amputated patient

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,400
Can you help him ?

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,040
By turning back in time
before he loses his leg ?

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,240
You want her to help you here and there.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,440
Karan lost her time of living
just to save you.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,920
You're such a trouble maker.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,240
I am so sorry, Karan.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,760
I really didn't know...

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
...that you helping me that day...

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,480
...causes you to lose your own time.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,520
that I'd use it with someone
who means a lot to me.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,680
Do you remember the guy
who suffocated  you at the hospital ?

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,840
That prisoner just broke out and about

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,560
Do not go back
to our dorm room alone tonight.

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,600
If it's not safe for you,

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,160
Whatever it takes.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,520
I will save you.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,600
What's up?

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,200
Bank, where are you?

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,160
I'm driving!

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,760
It's my birthday!

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,880
Why do I need to
keep calling, asking you to come?

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,720
I'm coming, asshole.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,759
My dad was at home, shit.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,759
It took me a while to come out seamlessly.

33
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,039
Oh, you son of Mr. MP.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
He had time to stay home, too?

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,280
He's on the news every single day.

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,520
Hm, just leave my dad's business alone,
scum bag.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,960
Hurry! Everyone else is here.

38
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,800
If you don't get here in 30 minutes,
it's your treat tonight!

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,000
What the fuck?

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,800
Alright, I got it.

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,160
See you.

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,320
Oh shit!

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,360
Excuse me.

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,680
Please do not enter.
This is crime scene.

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,440
That's my wife and my daughter.

46
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,560
You said we'd meet at home.

47
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,640
Why did you leave me like this?

48
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
You said we'd meet at home.

49
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,000
I bought a new lipstick.
Would you like to try it?

50
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,440
It looks great on you.

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,880
Thank you.

52
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,680
For being the reason that makes me smile.

53
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,240
Hold on! Wait for me please!

54
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
Oh! Dr. Kliao, hello!

55
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,920
Hello, Chai.

56
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,400
Oh, Dr. Karan, hello!

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,560
Have you just got off your shift?

58
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:04,040
Yeah, the ER today was SOOOOOOO horrible.

59
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,120
But it's as horrible as a usual ER, you know.

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,640
By the way, are you two...

61
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,520
...having an afternoon shift together?

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,120
Yes?

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,040
Yes.

64
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,160
Feeling awkward?

65
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,200
Karan!! Are you making fun of me?

66
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,360
You had to get up early with me this morning.

67
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,880
Are you tired?

68
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,120
Not at all. I want to get up
and see you every morning!

69
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,920
Same here!

70
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,920
Have a great day at work, doctor.

71
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,960
You, too. Doctor Kaomesa.

72
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,720
I'm... going.

73
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,720
Um, yes, okay.

74
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,200
Bye!

75
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,520
Something smells weird with these two.

76
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,960
Buddy, are you okay?

77
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,520
Why are you crying by yourself here?

78
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,080
Tree?

79
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,160
Is he a patient?

80
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,400
I found him crying all by himself.

81
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,360
I don't know what happened.

82
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,560
How did you get here, big boy?

83
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
Let's sit up there.

84
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,200
Okay? Yes.

85
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,799
Good job.

86
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,120
It'll be alright.

87
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,440
Take some time and breathe.

88
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,920
[Sighs]

89
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,400
You're doing great.

90
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,000
Everything will be just fine.

91
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,800
You're good at this, Meaw.

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
I didn't know why he cried.

93
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
So, I wasn't sure how to calm him down.

94
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,640
Hey, Miw, here you are!

95
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,640
Your mommy and the doctor
are looking for you.

96
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,160
Thank you so much, doctors.

97
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,360
Let's go see your mommy?

98
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
I don't want to go.

99
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,760
I don't want the injection. It hurts.

100
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,120
Aw, it all will be okay.

101
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Let's go play back there.

102
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,440
Miw, buddy, are you a good boy?

103
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,200
I am.

104
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,520
A good boy listens to the doctor.

105
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,880
So that you'd feel better enough
to go play with your friends.

106
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,320
And today, we have
a little reward for brave kids!

107
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
Would you like to have that?

108
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,920
Okay, let's go with Miss Nurse there.

109
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,960
Great job!

110
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,440
Tree.

111
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,200
When you encounter a depressed person,

112
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,480
You don't always need to understand
all of the sadness they feel.

113
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,000
Perhaps, a sad, depressed person...

114
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,960
...might need only someone
who's always be present alongside them.

115
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,040
Who listens to them, who gives them a hug.

116
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
That's all.

117
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,960
Keep smiling.

118
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,800
I'm happy to see that you're happy.

119
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,360
I don't really know...

120
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,320
...what happiness is.

121
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,200
There must be something that makes you happy.

122
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,000
It's been a long time.

123
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
Well...

124
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,240
What about things that make you
feel comfortable with? Is there any?

125
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,400
There is, actually.

126
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,960
I'll show you after we finish
with visiting the patients.

127
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,600
Are you tired?

128
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
Nope.

129
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,040
- Because you got me?
- Ooh...

130
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,760
A nurse just walked past us.

131
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,920
She showed no concern.

132
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,640
I'm actually filled when I'm with you.
I'm not hungry at all.

133
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,160
You're exaggerating it.

134
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,680
What would you like to eat?
I'll get it for you.

135
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,160
What would you like to eat?

136
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,760
I want to eat what you eat.

137
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,200
Hm... I want to eat many things.

138
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,400
Somtam, spicy salad,
grilled chicken, and fried eggs.

139
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,080
Which would you like?

140
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,400
Let's have all of those.

141
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,240
I'm easily impressed by a big eater.

142
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,000
Wow...

143
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,600
I didn't realize our workplace
has a view like this.

144
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,600
I like hanging here by myself.

145
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,880
Want to try sitting down?

146
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,440
When I sit here,

147
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,520
Things that feel heavy,

148
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,160
Become light.

149
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,720
It feels nice up here.

150
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,120
I love it.

151
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,520
There is no one up here.

152
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And...

153
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,280
It's nice and quiet.

154
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,240
I actually know...

155
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,480
..that I'm not very nice.

156
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
You probably know that.

157
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,520
I don't think...

158
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,840
...I could look after anyone.

159
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,760
Not even myself.

160
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,480
Is something bothering your mind?

161
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,840
It's what you asked me...

162
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,960
...what happiness is.

163
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,800
I have no answer for that.

164
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,800
And I don't remember...

165
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,480
...the last time I was happy.

166
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,440
Sometimes, it's like,

167
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,480
My happy hormones just disappeared.

168
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,520
I have done all the things
they say would help.

169
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,040
But I haven't got any better.

170
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,000
And that makes me think...

171
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,520
...if I should just disappear.

172
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,240
Or stop feeling things.

173
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,160
That could be my type of happiness.

174
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,960
This sunlight, the skies,
and nice surroundings like this...

175
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,720
Do you think this is beautiful?

176
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,160
It is beautiful.

177
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,280
I'm glad you're talking to me like this.

178
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,040
But I'm not sure...

179
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,600
How much I can get how you feel.

180
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,960
But I'm really happy...

181
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,280
And I... would love to have you
talk to me like this more.

182
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,760
Was that good?

183
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,560
Nice and filled! I'm ready to work.

184
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,880
A late-night shift like this,

185
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,840
Try to get some time to rest.

186
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,680
Same to you.

187
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,520
On your night shifts like this,
would you have time to see me?

188
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,360
CVTs in surgery ward have their hands full

189
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,200
It's hard to have a real free time.

190
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,200
But when I have a free slot,
I'll go and see you, okay?

191
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,560
Okay!

192
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,800
And...

193
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
You go first.

194
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,560
I just wanted to ask you out
for our breakfast tomorrow.

195
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,680
I was going to mention that, too.

196
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,800
Let's go.

197
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,480
What should we have tomorrow?

198
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,320
What should we have?

199
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,560
- What would you like?
- We ate so much today.

200
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,520
Are you making fun of me?

201
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,400
Come in.

202
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,480
What are you doing, Dr. Karan?

203
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,840
I'm observing an x-ray result.

204
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,600
- Are you having a break?
- Nah.

205
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,000
We're just taking turns to break.

206
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Come here!

207
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,720
Anything special meal
you'd like to eat tomorrow?

208
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,040
I'll go fetch it for you.

209
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,680
Nope.

210
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,360
I don't want to drain you out.

211
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,400
It doesn't drain me out.

212
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,200
I want to do it for you.

213
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,360
Are you tired?

214
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,960
Do you want to rest up?

215
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
In this room?

216
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,360
Can I?

217
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
Of course.

218
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Don't you know that I am...

219
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,440
...the most fearsome Doctor Karan
of this hospital?

220
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,080
That's really scary!

221
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,960
I'm super strict.
Aren't you intimidated?

222
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,560
How strict?

223
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
I don't know.

224
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,200
It's okay. I will just go back to
Externs' Resting Room.

225
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,800
Okay, that's good.

226
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,080
I don't want to leave.

227
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,680
Right? The break is too short.

228
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,960
But I can't keep staying here.

229
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,880
Well, try to rest a lot.
So that you have energy to work.

230
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,760
Focus on your tasks.
If there's anything, you can call me.

231
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Okay!

232
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,160
Then I'm going.

233
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,840
See you.

234
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,960
Did you forget something?

235
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,760
I'm leaving. Bye!

236
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,160
At 11:30 today, there was a report
on an unexpected event.

237
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,400
When a prisoner broke out
of the Central Prison.

238
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,000
His name is Awach Dereklop,

239
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,040
Charged with a homicide case 7 years ago.

240
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,480
If you recall this news not so long ago

241
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,600
when a prisoner charged into
and attempted to suffocate a doctor,

242
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,800
This jailbreaker is the very same person.

243
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,760
Hello?

244
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,320
If you hang up,

245
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,640
There will be
a shooting rampage in the hospital.

246
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,800
Come out to the parking lot in the back.
There's only my truck around.

247
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,480
If you don't come, or if you tell anybody.

248
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,120
Everyone in the hospital...

249
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,080
...will be dead.

250
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
No!

251
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,960
I can never let you go!

252
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,280
That's not possible, Karan.

253
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,520
Kliao.

254
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,920
Where is Kliao Khluen?

255
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,760
I said, where is Kliao Khluen?

256
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,600
- Kliao.
- Karan?

257
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,800
What's going on, Karan?

258
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,960
Listen carefully.

259
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,880
I had a vision of you being harmed.

260
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,720
Me? Being harmed?

261
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,680
That's right.

262
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,760
Do you trust me?

263
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,480
I do.

264
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,080
Doctor Karan, how can we help you?

265
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,400
I have an emergency case.

266
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,720
We need your help.

267
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,200
Sorry for bothering you.

268
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,160
But our hospital is now under a threat.

269
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,360
I'd like to see the CCTVs.

270
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,640
What would you like to see?
Do let me know.

271
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,720
The hospital now
has a jailbreak prisoner among us.

272
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,960
Please step over here, doctor.

273
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,320
Where did you see the guy?

274
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,360
No.

275
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,360
Not at this moment.

276
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,520
Karan, in the vision you saw,

277
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,960
if I don't go,
there will be many casualties?

278
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,080
No.

279
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,880
I can never let you go!

280
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,240
But if I don't go,
everyone will be in trouble because of us.

281
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
There.

282
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,000
It's that truck.

283
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,440
You're finally here.

284
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
Are you ready to die?

285
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,360
Calm down.

286
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,040
What have I done to you?

287
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,880
Why are you doing this?

288
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,240
You probably don't know...

289
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,000
..what you daddy had done to me.

290
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,720
If he had helped me that day...

291
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,680
...it wouldn't be like this!

292
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,280
Excuse me.

293
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,720
Sorry, you can't get in. It's a crime scene.

294
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,840
- Stay out here.
- They're my wife and my daughter!

295
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,840
Dao...

296
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,960
You said you'd see me at home.

297
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,320
This is not true! This is not real!

298
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,120
- Please let go off her.
- Dao!

299
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,960
Let go, sir. Let go.

300
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,160
Sir!

301
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,520
Hey.

302
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,160
I'm so sorry for your loss.

303
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,680
Where is the driver who killed my family?

304
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,960
I'm going to arrest him!

305
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,160
We haven't caught him yet.

306
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Wach.

307
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,360
I think...

308
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,000
You should focus on taking care
of their funerals.

309
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,880
For this case,

310
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm on it.

311
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,280
Okay?

312
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,240
Take it easy.

313
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,720
Be strong, brother.

314
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,160
Show the way, please.

315
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,440
The next day

316
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,360
Excuse me.

317
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,800
Did you see the accident here last night?

318
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,560
Well, thank you.

319
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,000
Excuse me.

320
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,000
There was an accident here last night.
Have you witnessed it?

321
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,080
I didn't see it.

322
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,520
Thank you.

323
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,560
Yes. Yes, sir.

324
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,440
I'll take a good care of this case, sir.

325
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,120
Yes.

326
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,680
Goodbye.

327
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,240
Sir.

328
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,000
I found the evidence on my family's case.

329
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,360
Please let me take this case myself.

330
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,160
Take a seat.

331
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,360
Wach.

332
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,440
Let me be honest with you.
Let me take care of this case.

333
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,199
Is it because this scumbag
is MP Nop's son?

334
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,800
Is that why I can't interfere?

335
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,239
You know it by heart...

336
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,000
...how hard cases like this can be.

337
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,560
But they are my wife and my daughter!

338
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,000
You have a family.

339
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,800
Why can't you understand?

340
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,560
Wach!

341
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,239
What does my family have to do with this?

342
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,360
Look, this is the police's matter!

343
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,680
You family doesn't have to face
what I'm going through.

344
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,080
You can say whatever you want.

345
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,960
- You always look over other people's heads.
- Wach!

346
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,440
If your wife and children die,

347
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,960
What would you do?

348
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,440
What happened is an accident to your family.

349
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,920
Leave others' families alone!

350
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,280
To sum this up, you leave this case alone.

351
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,520
It's an order from the above.

352
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,080
And if you don't stop, you'd be in trouble.

353
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,280
Let me handle this myself.

354
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,640
I'm not going to stop!

355
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,160
And nothing can stop me!

356
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,200
Wach!

357
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,880
I told you it's an order!

358
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,600
You selfish, follow that selfish order.

359
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,400
I quit!

360
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,640
Wach! Don't you do anything stupid!

361
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,760
The accident to your family...

362
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,920
...is horrible enough!

363
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,640
Don't dig your own grave any deeper.

364
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,280
Accident, you say?

365
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,840
Right. This shit didn't happen
to your family.

366
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,840
You can vent out whatever you like.

367
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,400
I wonder. I wonder if this had happened
to your family. If your wife and kids die,

368
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,640
- Would you still be licking the boots?
- Wach!

369
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,160
If you talk about my family like that again,

370
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,680
- I warn you.
- I don't give a shit!

371
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,480
And remember this.

372
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,440
Remember...

373
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,760
...how you treat me today.

374
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,200
Because one day,

375
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,200
you will face this fate, too.

376
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,720
Wach!

377
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,200
Wach!

378
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,560
Get on the couch.

379
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,360
Please don't do this. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it.

380
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,840
You're saying you didn't mean it?

381
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,960
Huh?

382
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,120
If you didn't mean it,
why didn't you stop and help them?

383
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,960
I was in shock.

384
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,200
I didn't know what to do. I'm so sorry.

385
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,160
You're apologizing now.

386
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,160
It means nothing.

387
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,520
Get up there.

388
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,960
I said get up there!

389
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,880
Please, brother.

390
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,720
My dad is an MP. My family has lots of money.

391
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,360
Whatever you want, they can give it to you
if you spare my life, please.

392
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,240
It's because of your father's MP chair
that I have to do this.

393
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,160
And the only thing I want...

394
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,760
...is the lives of my wife and kid.

395
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,560
You think you can give them back to me?

396
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
Huh?

397
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,720
Can you?

398
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,200
I didn't mean it. I am so sorry.

399
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,040
I really didn't mean to.

400
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,600
Hasn't my family compensated you?

401
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,520
Maybe it wasn't enough, bro?

402
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,080
I can just ask my dad
to increase the amount for you, bro.

403
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,720
I don't want your family's money!

404
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,520
Just say the amount.
My dad can give it to you.

405
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
- Twenty, thirty million.
- Shut the fuck up.

406
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,160
Stick your head in there.

407
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Do it!

408
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,120
You think you can run away from me?

409
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,400
What happened is an accident to your family.

410
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,680
Leave others' families out of this!

411
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,760
This shit didn't happen to your family.

412
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,960
You did this to me.
One day, you'll face this fate, too.

413
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,640
Sergeant, call an ambulance.

414
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,320
Sergeant, find evidence.

415
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,880
Commands, we need an ambulance.

416
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,440
There was a terrifying homicide case.

417
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,480
Police discovered the lifeless body
of a young man,

418
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,200
identified only as 'Nueng,' an alias,
hanging from the neck inside an apartment

419
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,000
In the police report, Nueng was charged
with vehicular homicide.

420
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,480
Resulting in two deaths.

421
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,240
The victims were the wife and child
of Mr. Awach Direklop.

422
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,360
Police now believe that this case

423
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,600
may have been the motive
for Awach to commit murder Nueng (alias).

424
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,000
As revenge to his family.

425
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,040
Now that your father...

426
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,560
... doesn't even care shit about my family.

427
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,640
He should now feel the suffer...

428
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,520
...of losing his loved one.

429
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,960
But if you are out killing people now,

430
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,600
you would be no different
from that young man.

431
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,720
The fuck are you talking about?

432
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,840
Actually,

433
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,760
What happened to your family...

434
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,080
...was an accident from reckless driving.

435
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,920
But you...

436
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,080
...you are about to kill
an innocent person.

437
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,960
You're talking as if that vermin
was a good person.

438
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
Huh?

439
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,520
He is just a murderer.

440
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,960
So, you wanted to be a murderer, too?

441
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,080
Stop it.

442
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,320
Stop it.

443
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,800
I'm at this point.

444
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,320
You think I have a chance to turn back?

445
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,160
Huh?

446
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,040
But if you kill me now

447
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,040
nothing would get better anyway.

448
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,720
Do you want to die for your girlfriend, huh?

449
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,760
This is useless.

450
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,120
I'm just going to shoot you right here.

451
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,440
And I'm going in there to kill her anyway.

452
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,480
- Kliao.
- Karan?

453
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,280
Karan, are you okay?

454
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,120
- I just reversed back in time.
- What?

455
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,360
That means you've seen what happened?

456
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,160
Do you trust me, Kliao?

457
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,000
There's still time.
I'm going to tell you about it soon.

458
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,240
- Okay.
- Let's go.

459
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,880
Yes.

460
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,480
Awach, the jailbreak prisoner is on his way
to the hospital to commit a crime.

461
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,280
He is armed.

462
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,480
He is wearing a black jacket,

463
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,240
a grey t-shirt,

464
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,640
and a black cap.

465
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,440
Yes, I remember.

466
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,000
It's a black pick-up truck,
license plate: KM 6466.

467
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,720
Please hurry.

468
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,040
Yes.

469
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,320
I'll be there in 5.

470
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,280
The shooter is now a red case.

471
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,280
I need to give him a surgery.

472
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,760
Okay.

473
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,320
The patient is male, 45,
with Penetrating chest injury

474
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,520
with thoracic aortic injury.

475
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,640
Forcep, please.

476
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,040
Time of death: 02:00.

477
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,000
Poor him, though.

478
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,320
This is so unfair.

479
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,960
If my dad had helped him back then,

480
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,800
Uncle Wach would not have
his end of life like this.

481
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,680
My dad is manipulative over everyone's life.

482
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,680
Without asking or explaining anything.

483
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,680
I think I understand Uncle Wach's feelings.

484
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,600
Because when I saw myself
losing you in my visions,

485
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,280
It was so hard to take.

486
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,240
Karan, if....

487
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,000
There is anything from now on,

488
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,760
can I ask us to hold hands,
and get through all the obstacles together?

489
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,480
Karan.

490
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,440
So, in the vision of our wedding,

491
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,840
the shooter would be Uncle Wach, then?

492
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,120
I think so.

493
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,960
From now on, there's nothing
you should worry about.

494
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,160
It's over.

495
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,000
Thank you so much, Karan.

496
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,960
If you hadn't seen that vision,

497
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,280
I wouldn't be here now.

498
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,040
Thank you again for protecting me.

499
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,440
Luckily, I saw that vision first.

500
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,360
Because if I get injured and bleed,

501
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,000
Time reversal would be impossible.

502
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,440
Why?

503
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,400
If you're injured and bleed,

504
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,480
why can't you reverse the time?

505
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,880
It's a condition.

506
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,760
I don't know why either.

507
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,080
But it has always been like that.

508
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,240
I don't think we should fix anything
in the past.

509
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,360
Because whenever we change the past,

510
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,120
there are always consequences
to such actions.

511
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,360
Those non-straight couples,

512
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,120
they don't last for long.

513
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,600
I went back there because of you, dad.

514
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,520
No vital sign. PEA EKG.
Keep doing CPR.

515
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,080
Kliao Khluen!

516
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,360
Kliao Khluen!

517
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,360
I heard that when you bleed,

518
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,400
You won't be able to reverse time?
