It's said that our favorite songs hold a secret someone.

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,840
Just like this song I wrote 7 years ago.

3
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,240
I didn’t even know why I longed for someone so much when I wrote it.

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,360
Today, I now realize who the person in the song is.

5
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,160
It made me want to see her again.

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,079
That was beautiful.

20
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,720
Maybe you should try having a debut tomorrow.

21
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,079
You’re exaggerating it.

22
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,640
Maybe you should go for this. Be a doctor,
because you’re so good at energizing people.

23
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,240
I’m not exaggerating it. You have such a beautiful voice.

24
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,040
I’m so backing you to become a singer.

25
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,080
Thanks.

26
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,440
But what song was that? I have never heard it before.

27
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,280
It is so heart-clenching I almost cried.

28
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,080
I wrote it myself.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
Whoa…

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,960
Why did you write such a sad song?

31
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,240
Are you looking for someone?

32
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,800
What was your inspiration?

33
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,079
Hm…

34
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,560
I just jotted it down. Didn’t mean it.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,520
But it felt so desolated and alone when I wrote it.

36
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,680
As if something went missing from me. Something I need to find.

37
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,760
I didn’t even know why I felt that way.

Can we do a green one instead? I don’t have that much.

How come I can still feel it?

121
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,560
I have moved it. I have moved the arm

122
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,600
I can still feel my fingers moving.

123
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,000
Mom, I can feel I have my hand.

124
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,200
And I’m moving my fingers.

125
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,760
Probably the phantom limb syndrome.

126

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,160
Please.

131
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,360
Please bring back my arm.

132
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,320
Mom! I can still feel it.

133
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,520
How come when I move, it....

134
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,120
Kliao Khluen! Stop it, Kliao Khluen!

135
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,840
From now on, you need to accept the reality!

136
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,120
I need to accept that you don’t have that arm any longer!

137
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Hey! She just woke up and she’s terribly scared!

138
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,360
Mom, mom! I’m…

139
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,560
She just gained her consciousness. There’s no doubt she’s horrified!

140
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,840
And why did she become like this, huh!?

141
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,800
If she didn’t come home late and had listened to us,
she wouldn’t be like this!

142
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
She keeps making us worried sick!

143
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,360
Can’t you calm down?

144
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,880
Ouch.

145
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,880
Ow…

146
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,240
Are you alright?

147
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,560
My arm is in pain, doctor.

148
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,280
Could you tell me more about it?

149
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,760
It feels like someone is squeezing my hand really hard.

150
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,240
From the scale of 1 to 10, how painful is it?

151
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,840
About 8.

152
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,760
You still feel like someone is squeezing your right hand, correct?

153
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,320
Yes, I can feel it.

154
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:55,400
In that case, could you help me with one thing?

155
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,400
Sure.

156
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,400
Please sit up.

157
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,720
Ow…

158
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,760
Pardon me.

159
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,200
How does it feel on your shoulder?

160
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,800
It doesn’t hurt but I can feel it.

161
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,480
How about here?

162
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,440
Ouch.

163
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,440
It’s painful.

164
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,360
So painful as if it’s squeezed by a very strong hand.

165
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,640
Now, please close your eyes for me?

166
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,240
Yes.

167
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,440
You can open your eyes.

168
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,240
Take a deep breath.

169
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,120
Look at yourself in the mirror carefully

170
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,040
and answer my questions.

171
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,000
What is this part I’m touching?

172
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,720
My shoulder.

173
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,440
What about this area?

174
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,480
My arm.

175
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,599
Can you feel my hand on your elbow?

176
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,960
Yes, I can.

177
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,480
And when I move down here,

178
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,680
Do you know which part of your body I’m touching?

179
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,520
Not anymore.

180
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,920
That’s right. You shouldn’t feel my hands.

181
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,160
Because you have now lost your lower arm from your elbow downward.

182
