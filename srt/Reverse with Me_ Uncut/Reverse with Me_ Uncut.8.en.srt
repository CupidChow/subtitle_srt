1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,000
The incident 7 years ago was real, right?

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,800
You were really my life-saver, right?

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,480
Yes.

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,040
Do you remember this voice?

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,320
Stop right there.

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,120
You need to turn back to 7 years ago

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,600
I really can't go back.

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,320
It just gets worse and worse.

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,720
There are children, too, Fiat.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,040
If I can't be happy,

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,480
then so can't you.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,360
Tree!

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,000
Do you believe me now?

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,880
They are demons!

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,600
I'm such a terrible big brother, right, Tree?

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,720
I'm so sorry.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,320
We can save Tree from this.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,800
It's been a long time since our last visit here.

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,960
The kids are all grown up. I miss them.

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,759
Mom! Mommy!

21
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,160
How did you get here ?

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,120
You said you'd call me when to pick you up.

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,880
- It's a surprise.
- Too surprising.

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,800
I missed you moms so bad.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,240
Did you miss me ?

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,560
Of course we did !

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,080
Your mommies miss you more than anything !

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,639
Looking for the doctor ?

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,000
She got called in for an emergency case.

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,760
She'll be back soon.

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Okay.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,120
We'll see her soon. Very soon !

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,240
I think we should get in there.

34
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,640
It's so hot here we'll all be burned.

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,079
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go.

36
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,520
1 week earlier.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,040
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

38
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,520
Cheers ?

39
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,120
Okay

40
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,480
So...

41
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,960
Which branch you'd like to specialize in ?
Have you thought about it ?

42
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,720
- I'm still considering on that, Karan.
- Hm...

43
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,160
Dr. Kliao is still considering, yeah ?

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,640
Maybe... pediatrics ?

45
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,040
Kids probably like you.

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,079
Nah...

47
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,400
That's for Meow.

48
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,320
I don't want to take her patients.

49
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,520
If so, what field of doctor would you like to be ?

50
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,080
What about being a surgeon ?

51
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,360
Like you.

52
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,120
Surgeons are extremely busy, Kliao.

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,519
We barely have any time left for anything.

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,680
Half of the surgeons are probably single.

55
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,760
But you're not single, Karan.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,880
Because you got me.

57
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
And you say you don't have time ?

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,040
- You do have time for me, don't you ?
- Well,

59
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,520
Actually,

60
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,280
I don't.

61
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,440
But...

62
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,800
I can always make time for you.

63
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,080
Should we eat ?

64
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Yes.

65
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,320
I want to present this salad.

66
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,960
You made this yourself ?

67
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,120
Yes.

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,800
Is it good ?

69
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
Stop staring at me !

70
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,920
Okay.

71
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,000
Cheers ?

72
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,800
Next week ?

73
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Okay, see you then.

74
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,120
I'll have a surprise for them.

75
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Later, bye.

76
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,400
Next week, my moms will come visit us.

77
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,080
That's such a surprise.

78
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,080
Is there something in your mind ?

79
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,880
Well, I...

80
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,160
I'm just worried.

81
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,000
Worried ?

82
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,480
About what?

83
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,120
Well,

84
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm worried about...

85
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
...our financial status.

86
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,120
Our families are so different.

87
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,880
Your family is really rich.

88
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,920
While I'm just an average girl.

89
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,920
I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.

90
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,200
Don't worry about any of those stuff.

91
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,200
What I love is you, Kliao.

92
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
It has nothing to do with any social position.

93
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,360
Just be yourself, be the one I love.

94
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,720
I believe that my moms will love you like I do.

95
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,679
Everyone in my family will love you.

96
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,520
Because I love you.

97
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,120
Don't worry about it.

98
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
Good girl.

99
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,160
Are you excited ?

100
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,560
- Karan !
- Karan !

101
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,760
We've missed you, oh.

102
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,920
Hi !

103
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,320
We've missed you.

104
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,160
How long have you got here, mommies ?

105
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,760
Just a moment ago.

106
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,200
This is Kliao Khluen,

107
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
mommies.

108
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,400
Welcome, sweetie.

109
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,720
Hello, mommies.

110
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,440
Hello.

111
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,600
Are you tired, doctors ?

112
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,440
No, no. Your daughter is super tough.

113
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,640
- Right ?
- You guys are here !

114
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Mai Tree !

115
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Have you eaten anything ?

116
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,880
We're here to cook.

117
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,760
Are you all hungry ?

118
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
- You must be.
- I'm starving.

119
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,200
Should we go cook ?

120
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,040
Please stay for dinner tonight ?

121
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,760
- Yes.
- Let's go.

122
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,600
Is there anything I can help you with ?

123
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,640
Could you, Kliao, get me 5-6 eggs for me, please ?

124
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,920
Sure.

125
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
Can I have this bowl ?

126
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,240
Would you like me to crack them ?

127
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Yes, please, all of them.

128
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,680
I'm cooking special omelet for us.

129
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,640
It's Karan's favorite.

130
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,080
Okay.

131
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,120
Did someone mention me?

132
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,680
Yes.

133
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,560
Actually, tonight,

134
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,360
You are the guest of our family.

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
Maybe you should sit down and relax ?

136
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,640
I'll cook for you.

137
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,600
I'll go wash my hands, then.

138
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,440
I told you she's cute.

139
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
She's adorable !

140
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,680
I think maybe you can sit out with me.

141
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,880
Let them cook here.

142
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,880
Okay ? Let's sit with me.

143
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,480
- Okay.
- Let’s go.

144
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,240
Into the bowl

145
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,680
Let's eat! All her food is yummy.

146
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,880
I put my all in this today.

147
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,680
This looks so great.

148
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,720
Thank you for having me.

149
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,360
Wanna has brought the veggie dish.

150
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,440
Is there anything else you'd like to eat, Kliao ?

151
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,200
This is a lot already, Karan.

152
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,080
What about you, Mai Tree ?

153
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,760
Nah

154
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,080
Let sit and eat, Karan.

155
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,840
You're such a great cook, mommy.

156
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,120
Hey, what about me ? I cooked, too.

157
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,520
You are the best, Karan.

158
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,480
- Someone's favorite special recipe of omelet.
- Me, me.

159
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,240
Here you go.

160
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,280
It's been a long time we haven't eaten together.

161
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,520
Wan, share some food in the pot
with the village's security guy,

162
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,400
- And take some for yourself.
- Thank you, madam.

163
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,200
- Here you go, Mai Tree.
- Thank you, mommy.

164
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,080
Oh, how we miss Thai food.

165
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,800
I missed the food you cook so bad !

166
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,560
I wish you could stay here longer.

167
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,320
- Sure, for how many years ?
- How long?

168
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,280
Can you do ten ?

169
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,880
- Oh!
- Ooh, we still need to work.

170
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,840
- Ten years ?
- We miss you.

171
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,040
- Let me know if you want these.
- Okay.

172
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,320
Mommies,

173
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,600
It's her who I've been seeing in my visions.

174
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,680
That she is my bride.

175
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,680
And she is surely...

176
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,600
...going to be my future bride.

177
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,480
The dishes here are getting too sweet now.

178
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,520
Let's eat.

179
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,520
Let's eat. Someone here can no longer wait to eat !

180
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,800
- Can I get some stir-fried veggies, please ?
- Of course !

181
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
I'll wait and see your person.

182
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,080
But when ?

183
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,200
Next patient, please.

184
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,720
Would you like me to go in there with you ?

185
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,800
I'll go with you, okay ?

186
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,920
Sorry for keeping you waited.

187
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,440
It didn't take long.

188
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,160
Thank you.

189
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,200
Can I say something ?

190
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,480
I actually have been having a soft spot for you.

191
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,120
Hold on, please !

192
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,040
Hi, Tree.

193
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,720
Good job.

194
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,400
It's okay.

195
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,400
Breathe slowly.

196
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,319
You're doing great.

197
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,800
It'll be alright.

198
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,720
You're good at this, Meow.

199
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,640
The sunset, the sky, and this nice feels....

200
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,520
Do you think it's beautiful ?

201
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,440
It is beautiful.

202
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,040
What ? Why are you staring at me ?

203
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,960
Don't....

204
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,680
You were just kidding me.

205
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm serious.

206
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,320
It's just...

207
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,040
There were many things that stopped me
from telling you.

208
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Like my family issue,

209
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,000
and the sickness I'm having.

210
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
Sometimes it makes me think...

211
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,120
...that I don't deserve
a relationship with anyone.

212
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,480
And maybe I shouldn't bring anyone
down to suffer with me.

213
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,000
Do you remember...

214
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,160
The other day that you asked me...

215
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,440
What my happiness is ?

216
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
I got the answer for you.

217
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,480
This.

218
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,880
This is my happiness.

219
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,360
Then, I will be your happiness forever.

220
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,680
I'm so happy today.

221
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,360
I love you, Karan.

222
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,800
I love you a lot, too.

223
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,960
You know, we should have met earlier.

224
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,280
So that we could have more happy times together.

225
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,560
We shouldn't have wasted time.

226
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
It's just you didn't know.

227
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,520
Actually,

228
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,560
I've always been beside you.

229
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,560
Every time you appeared in my dreams,

230
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,920
I wait for you.

231
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,520
For the day we can spend
the rest of our lives together.

232
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,520
Even though we were far apart,

233
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,800
both place and time,

234
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,240
But I turn back time over and over.

235
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,360
Just to be able to take care of you.

236
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,080
And see your smiles.

237
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,200
It has taught me

238
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,720
who I wanted to spend my life with.

239
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,240
No matter how many thousands, tens of thousands,

240
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,160
or millions of times I turn back into,

241
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,960
I always want you to keep in mind...

242
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,960
...that time can't erase my love for you,

243
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,320
Kliao Khluen.

244
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,360
♫ When will you show up? ♫

245
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:16,080
♫ Right here waiting, waiting for you. ♫

246
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,640
♫ For the fateful day
when our paths will cross. ♫

247
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,040
♫ The moment our eyes meet, ♫
♫ and I'll know instantly. ♫

248
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,640
♫ That you are the one
I’ve been searching for. ♫

249
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,520
Karan ?

250
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,120
I don't want to see you cry.

251
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,840
I only want to see your smiles.

252
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,320
Because they can tell me

253
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,360
that you are having a good time.

254
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,080
When something bothers your mind,

255
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,920
Please remember

256
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,440
That I will always be by your side.

257
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,200
Please let me take care of you
for the rest of our lives.

258
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,920
Will you marry me,

259
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,120
Kliao Klhuen ?

260
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,720
Yes !

261
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,280
♫ For the fateful day
when our paths will cross. ♫

262
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,760
♫ The moment our eyes meet, ♫
♫ and I'll know instantly. ♫

263
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,440
♫ That you are the one
I’ve been searching for. ♫

264
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,440
♫ That you are the one
I’ve been searching for. ♫

265
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,440
You look so happy today, Kliao !

266
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,200
I'm over the moon !

267
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,520
You are gorgeous.

268
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,520
Do you think my necklace is too small ?

269
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,000
You are perfect from head to toes.

270
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,720
I'm excited

271
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,280
- Hey!
- I can tell.

272
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,360
- Kliao!
- So beautiful!

273
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,720
You are so beautiful today !

274
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,080
So are you girls !

275
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,520
I believe you.

276
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,000
Thank you for coming.

277
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,120
- You're becoming a bride !
- I'm so excited !

278
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,640
Okay, okay.

279
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,080
Thank you for coming.

280
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,080
Spotless.

281
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,200
- Oh, your hands are cold !
- I'm nervous.

282
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,040
Wow !

283
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,000
Look at this beautiful bride.

284
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,960
You've got the bride glow.

285
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,000
- Super excited !
- I'm excited for you, too !

286
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,600
- No! Nope! Don't!
- Again ?

287
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,440
Don't start or we all are going to cry.

288
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,720
I just feel like we are growing apart.

289
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,760
What are you talking about ?
I'm just getting married, not leaving you !

290
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,480
- Don't leave our band, okay ?
- That''ll never happen !

291
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,120
You can't leave me either.

292
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,160
- Of course.
- I'll grow old with Edge of Universe.

293
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,040
- We love you, Kliao.
- Thank you.

294
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,800
I love you all, too.

295
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,720
Oh sure.

296
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,360
Let's take some photos.

297
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,760
Do I look good ?

298
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
You do !

299
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,240
Ready ?

300
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,720
One, two, three !

301
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,880
- How come it's awkward taking photos with you ?
- What ?

302
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,960
Do you want to see the photo ?

303
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,720
Wow !

304
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,320
I'm taking this one.

305
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,520
Of course.

306
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,640
- ???
- You guys...

307
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,880
- That's so cute.
- We'll be outside now.

308
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,440
- Keep smiling, you beautiful bride.
- Okay, see you out there.

309
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,560
- Get ready
- Nope !

310
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,760
I won't !

311
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,720
See you there.

312
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,440
See you.

313
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,720
- Look ! I'm so nervous.
- Here, come and sit down here.

314
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,160
If you're unsure, come and check.

315
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,760
You really have the bride glow !

316
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,560
Beautiful bride.

317
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,960
Hello.

318
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,280
How are you feeling, Kliao ?

319
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,800
- Mom.
- Let me see !

320
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,520
Oh, my daughter is so beautiful.

321
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,720
I love you, mommy.

322
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,280
I love you, too, Kliao.

323
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,000
Kliao,

324
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,800
Congratulations.

325
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,800
You're damn beautiful today.

326
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,920
Thank you.

327
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,680
Don't cry !

328
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,480
I don't want you to be in tears.

329
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,080
It's tears of joy.

330
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,400
Don't cry.

331
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,000
Dad is here. Let them talk.

332
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,800
Dad...

333
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,600
I...

334
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,880
I love you, dad.

335
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,520
I love you too, Kliao.

336
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,000
From now on, you'll live such a happy life.

337
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,720
I see it.

338
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,640
I see how much Karan loves you.

339
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,920
Wishing both of you a lifetime of happiness

340
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,960
Thank you, dad.

341
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,240
Take a great care of yourself.

342
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,800
Karan and I will visit you often.

343
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,080
Um, excuse me.

344
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,040
Mai Tree said Fiat is here.

345
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,760
And it's now time for the bride to be ready.

346
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,000
Actually, that's right.

347
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,239
Please excuse me.

348
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,719
I wet your suit a little.

349
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,280
My baby is emotional today.

350
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,880
No more crying.

351
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,120
- Dad.
- Come on, honey.

352
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,440
- Give me a hug.
- Of course.

353
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,000
Here comes the bride !

354
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,080
Just like me when I was younger !

355
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,600
Hello, everyone !

356
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,240
Thank you so much for saving this date for us !

357
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,320
This is the best day of my life !

358
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,840
And I'd like to thank Karan for everything.

359
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,480
So, I'd like to sing for her, Karan,
my dearest person in the whole world.

360
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,960
♫ I wonder how it would be ♫

361
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,560
♫ If I haven’t met you ♫

362
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,720
♫ How lonely it’d be if I was still alone ♫

363
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,080
♫ No idea, but you probably agree ♫

364
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,760
♫ how blessed it is we have met. ♫

365
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,080
♫ Trust the road ahead. ♫

366
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,960
