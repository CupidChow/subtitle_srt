Why didn't you come earlier?

spend the night outside.

thinking about city planning.

It's better not to disturb him.

With such a lovely cousin like me,

You are much more reliable than these two.

What's with you?

What are you wearing?

144
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,360
It was my fault

145

to put you in danger yesterday.

146

I'm here to apologize.

Please forgive me.

Who dressed you?

It's so ugly.

Get out!

Hit me.

Let go of me.

157
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,630
Let go!

158

Get out quickly!

159
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,600
If you don't, I'll really hit you.

By the way,

161
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,730
did Yunxi

162
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,120
show any murderous intent last night?

163
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,290
No.

164
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,560
She even saved me.

165
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,860
Actually,

it's getting harder and harder

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,030
to figure out what she is up to.

168
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:12,900
Let's do it this way.

169
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,050
Keep a close eye on her

170
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,020
and try to figure out her intentions.

171

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,660
a secret room for hiding people?

177
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,270
The kitchen and the Eastern courtyard

178
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,380
are connected to the underground water source and pond.

179
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,870
So these rooms are not suitable for secret rooms.

180
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,210
People often go to the garden,

181
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,270
so it's unlikely Jiang Chaoxi

182
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,340
would have the secret room here.

183
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,500
Only the Western courtyard.

184
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,470
Stop there.

185
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,390
Up in front

186
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,500
is where Young Master usually trains.

187
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,330
Outsiders are not allowed to enter.

188
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,910
Guards, I'm sorry.

189
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,230
I wasn't paying attention

190
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,290
and got lost.

191
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,270
Leave.

192
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,470
Sorry.

193
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:27,910
Yunxi?

194
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,260
Yunxi, my good friend.

195
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,260
Yunxi.

196
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,060
Yunxi.

197
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,550
Pepper.

198
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,910
Help me taste

199
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,020
my newly-developed dessert.

200
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,520
This is made with eggs only.

201
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,930
Pepper.

202
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,620
I've just finished my meal. Not hungry now.

203
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,630
Yunxi.

204
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,030
The imperial kitchen's monthly promotion assessment

205
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,420
will begin soon.

206
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,800
If I fail again,

207
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,620
I'll be kicked out of Young Master's Mansion.

208
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,890
Help me taste it.

209
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,620
You really can't eat any more?

210
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,580
Pepper.

211
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,540
Don't be discouraged.

212
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,600
What we lack in ability,

213
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,180
we can make up for with strategy.

214
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,660
How?

215
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,620
We could just buy the dessert.

216
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,650
Why bother making it ourselves?

217
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,860
You say you are craving flower pastry,

218
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,540
but you really want to go down the mountain to play, right?

219
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,750
We are trapped in the mountain every day.

220
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,320
I'm bored to death.

221
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,420
Yun'er,

222
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,780
didn't we agree

223
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,740
to go down the mountain once a month?

224
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,440
I don't understand

225
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,180
why we are trapped in the mountain.

226
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:23,910
Brother,

227
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,390
do you have any secrets

228
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,320
that haven't told me?

229
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,350
Fine, Yun'er.

230
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,530
Tomorrow,

231
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,740
I'll make an exception and take you down the mountain.

232
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,210
Okay?

233
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,980
We can finally go down and play tomorrow.

234
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,520
Here.

235
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,950
I once ate a kind of flower pastry.

236
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
It was stuffed with fresh flowers in season.

237
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,010
The pastry skin was soft and sweet.

238
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,320
It also left a fragrance in my mouth.

239
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:51,850
Okay.

240
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,160
Let's make flower pastry.

241
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,760
It sounds delicious.

242
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,410
But

243
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,200
where can we get the fresh flowers?

244
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,700
We can't even leave

245
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,350
the Young Master's Mansion.

246
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,120
I have an idea.

247
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,220
Yunxi,

248
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,690
do we really have to go this far?

249
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,910
Do you want to stay?

250
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,620
Yes.

251
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,420
Let's go.

252
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,220
What's wrong?

253
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,450
I just ran into the pillar.

254
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,180
Why do I see two of you?

255
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,460
What a time to drop the ball.

256
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,340
It seems

257
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,310
I'll have to proceed alone.

258
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,290
I'll pick the flowers for you.

259
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,690
Put your foot here, your arm here,

260
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,890
and lift up your butt.

261
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:02,930
See?

262
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,060
One, two, three.

263
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,520
Do you understand?

264
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,600
Do you understand?

265
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,710
Your skin is red and fur is bright.

266
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,020
You must be like your brother, Ham.

267
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,900
Fat but not greasy.

268
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,220
If I roast it with honey,

269
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,360
it must be delicious.

270
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,790
Be good.

271
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,850
Once I'm done with my errand,

272
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,960
I'll come and get you.

273
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
Flowers,

274
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,750
I'm doing this

275
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,840
for my good friend.

276
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,170
Don't be angry.

277
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,630
Otherwise, the flower pastry

278
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,490
won't taste good.

279
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:47,960
Come on.

280
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,310
I'll send you

281
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,190
where you should go.

282
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,460
This should be enough.

283
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,550
If I don't stop now,

284
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,680
I might be discovered.

285
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,150
Yunxi is really out of line!

286
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,520
I will kill her!

287
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,880
Young Master.

288
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,190
Listen.

289
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,420
Don't try to stop me.

290
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,200
Nothing you say now will help.

291
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,900
I've worked so hard

292
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,030
raising my pig for two years.

293
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,340
How dare she eat it?

294
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,930
Not even a bone left.

295
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:39,790
No matter what,

296
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,730
I won't let her off.

297
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,770
Young Master, you misunderstood.

298
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,070
Young Master.

299
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,160
Why are you back?

300
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,480
I think

301
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,430
I acted without class just now.

302
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,960
Let's try again.

303
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,630
Okay.

304
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,190
Forget it.

305
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,570
Yunxi is still useful to me.

306
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,040
I'll let her live for now.

307
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,740
Then, I'll kill her

308
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,710
after the Cangyue city construction is completed.

309
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:12,870
When did you

310
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,060
become so weak-minded?

311
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,560
It's not manly at all.

312
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,700
What are you talking about?

313
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:18,980
I can't punish her,

314
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,800
but I can't punish you.

315
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,900
Master.

316
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:35,990
There's news.

317
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,350
What?

318
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,750
Have you found Luo Hexuan?

319
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,820
Not yet.

320
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,680
But our men

321
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,420
found this.

322
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,140
What is this?

323
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,480
The drawing style

324
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,300
of these buildings

325
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,810
is very similar to

326
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,760
Luo Daoan's.

327
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,580
Really?

328
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,310
Where did you get it?

329
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,980
I bought it from a craftsman

330
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,110
called Qian Duojin.

331
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,190
I got Song Qing to inspect it.

332
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,930
Although the Luo family members' styles

333
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,060
are not exactly the same,

334
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,150
they are very similar.

335
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,750
Besides,

336
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,830
even Song Qing

337
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,250
can't draw with such mastery.

338
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,620
I'm afraid only Luo Hexuan,

339
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,360
Luo Daoan's descendant, could do this.

340
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,250
Do you think

341
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,010
Luo Hexuan could have drawn this?

342
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,430
Even if he didn't draw it,

343
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,100
he must have something

344
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,320
to do with it.

345
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,680
Do not miss this chance now that we have clue.

346
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:25,830
Let's

347
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,590
send someone

348
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:28,850
to capture

349
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,510
Qian Duojin.

350
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,420
Yes.

351
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,100
Wait.

352
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,400
No.

353
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,720
If Luo Hexuan

354
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,040
catches wind of this,

355
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,610
we'll be in big trouble.

356
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,480
You are right, Master.

357
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,500
How about this?

358
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,740
Figure out

359
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,800
a way

360
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,380
to lure out

361
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,520
the mastermind

362
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,680
without alerting anyone.

363
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,330
Yes.

364
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,420
By the way,

365
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,120
how is it going

366
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,020
with the Young Master?

367
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,200
Don't worry, Master.

368
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,790
There will be news soon.

369
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,589
-Bacon! -Bacon!

370
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,270
-Let's go. -Bacon.

371
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,010
-Go up. -Go up.

372
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:08,980
Bacon.

373
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,470
This way.

374
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,319
-Over here. Bacon. -Let's go.

375
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,410
Let's go.

376
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:11,839
Go.

377
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:12,819
Go up.

378
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:13,960
Come on.

379
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,230
Don't make our Young Master angry.

380
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,859
Listen.

381
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,369
If you don't want to be the last hope

382
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,410
of Young Master's Mansion,

383
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:20,420
I will

384
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,329
fulfill your wish,

385
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,240
and let you be with Ham in heaven.

386
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:23,940
Bacon.

387
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,760
Go up.

388
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,280
Up.

389
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,329
What are you doing?

390
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,320
Who allowed you to kick my piggy?

391
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:29,860
I...

392
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,930
No cross,

393
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,370
no crown.

394
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:36,860
Bacon.

395
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,880
All right.

396
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,980
Come out.

397
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,140
Out!

398
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,260
Bacon, come out!

399
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,380
Bacon!

400
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:46,860
Bacon!

401
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,950
As a pig in Young Master's Mansion,

402
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,940
you can't be so contentious.

403
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,260
Another chance. Follow my order.

404
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,620
Bacon.

405
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,330
What?

406
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,530
Young Master.

407
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,700
We found out the truth.

408
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,110
Come, have a seat.

409
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,920
According to my research,

410
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,360
Bacon went wild

411
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,620
because it was bitten by the Dian Bug.

412
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,040
Dian Bug?

413
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,540
Wait.

414
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:13,630
Don't worry.

415
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,890
It is unconscious.

416
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,230
Ridiculous!

417
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,180
Who in the world

418
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,530
is trying to kill my piggy?

419
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,860
I will kill him.

420
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,070
I don't think anyone would spend this much effort

421
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,160
to harm a pig.

422
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,750
What do you mean?

423
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,590
Young Master,

424
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,310
don't you think

425
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,860
you have a smell?

426
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:39,810
Smell?

427
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,330
No.

428
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,480
I take a bath every day.

429
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,110
Sorry, Young Master.

430
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:51,970
I need to take a shower.

431
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,200
Not this.

432
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,290
I think it's a special incense.

433
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,660
I may have smelled

434
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,100
something like that on Bacon.

435
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,760
If I'm not mistaken,

436
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,000
the murderer wants to hurt you.

437
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,690
Because Bacon

438
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,760
smells like you.

439
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,500
Then, it was scratched by accident,

440
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,760
attracting the bugs

441
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,590
and causing the bite.

442
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,100
Impossible.

443
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,470
I work hard

444
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,390
for Cangyue City every day.

445
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,020
There's no time for me to wander around

446
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,640
and make trouble.

447
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,430
Why would anyone want to hurt me?

448
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,340
Young Master.

449
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,730
our priority

450
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,020
is to find the person who brought this bug.

451
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,070
Young Master, it must be that girl.

452
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,040
No wonder she was sneaking around

453
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,740
in the garden last night.

454
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,120
I'll kill her now.

455
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,540
Wait.

456
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,140
The offender doesn't want to kill someone.

457
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,240
Bitten by this bug,

458
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,050
in the worst case, the person would go crazy

459
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,700
and get into a convulsion.

460
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,260
But that person can be recovered after half a month's rest.

461
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,800
The reason Bacon died

462
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,380
is that it is too small

463
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,460
to resist the toxin.

464
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,040
After going crazy,

465
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,920
it crashed into a rock and died.

466
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,690
Fine.

467
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,500
How dare anyone insult me like this?

468
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,310
In the end,

469
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,840
I have chosen the wrong person.

470
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,230
Although I have eaten many pastries,

471
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,600
this flower pastry

472
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,150
is really delicious.

473
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,140
But why is this flower pastry

474
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,600
smaller than the others?

475
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,220
Perhaps you don't know this.

476
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:31,960
This is

477
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,540
specially made for the Young Master.

478
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,830
The size of his mouth is more than two cun.

479
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,990
And my flower pastry

480
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,820
is one cun in size.

481
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,080
According to the Lu Ban Ruler,

482
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
one cun corresponds to wealth,

483
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,560
which implies an auspicious blessing.

484
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,310
So he can eat one pastry in one bite.

485
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,790
How do you know

486
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,860
the size of the Young Master's mouth?

487
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,530
Have you forgotten what I do for a living?

488
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,210
I can measure the size with my eyes.

489
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:50,980
I only need one look.

490
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,710
This time,

491
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,260
I'm sure you will pass the test

492
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,210
and continue staying at the Young Master's Mansion.

493
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,500
Not only do I want to stay here,

494
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,430
but I also want to become the exclusive pastry chef

495
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,370
of the Young Master.

496
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,610
As the saying goes,

497
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,950
when one gets to the top, all his friends get there with him.

498
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,080
I won't forget you.

499
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,600
Okay.

500
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,100
Come.

501
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,660
Have one.

502
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,310
Arrest her!

503
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,050
What are you doing? Let go of me!

504
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,600
Yunxi!

505
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,150
Let go of her!

506
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,670
Where are you taking me?

507
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,540
Let go of me!

508
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,830
Brother Wuyan.

509
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,770
I'm not disabled.

510
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:31,570
It's inconvenient for you

511
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,370
to drag me like this.

512
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,870
How about let me walk by myself?

513
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,310
What do you think, Brother Wuyan?

514
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:37,990
Up.

515
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,000
There's no need for this.

516
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,130
We are all workers in this mansion.

517
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:41,990
Show me some respect.

518
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,940
After all, I am the surveyor

519
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,790
invited by the Young Master...

520
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,190
Is Yunxi

521
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,740
working for my uncle or not?

522
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,000
She tries to assassinate and poison me one moment,

523
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,630
and saves my life the next.

524
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,950
I can't tell

525
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,820
what she wants.

526
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,100
But I...

527
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,060
Young Master.

528
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:03,910
Here she is.

529
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:04,650
Go.

530
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,630
Take off your clothes.

531
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,520
What is going on?

532
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,480
Why is he asking me to take my clothes off just as I arrived?

533
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,870
Looks like she is immobilized.

534
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,300
I can tease her.

535
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,100
Why are you so close?

536
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,460
Go away!

537
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,520
Help!

538
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:33,850
Young Master.

539
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,120
I didn't see anything.

540
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,270
I forgot to mobilize her.

541
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,070
Then free her.

542
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,950
Young Master, please.

543
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,750
Please.

544
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,060
Take off your clothes.

545
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:52,660
Jump in.

546
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,370
Young Master,

547
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,340
although you are

548
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,160
full of energy now,

549
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,920
you can't be this hungry.

550
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,940
I'm the surveyor you hired.

551
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,090
I don't offer other services.

552
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,140
You don't want to jump in?

553
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,860
You talk too much.

554
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,030
How dare you molest me!

555
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,580
Yunxi,

556
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,750
although this anesthetic

557
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,510
can relieve the pain,

558
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,830
it contains Angelica Dahurica.

559
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,500
That herb has a heat nature.

560
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:48,790
After taking it,

561
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,080
you may have symptoms

562
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,840
such as nosebleeds.

563
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,000
Don't worry.

564
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,500
Thank you, Dr. Qi.

565
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,670
Bad time for a nosebleed.

566
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,800
Young Master.

567
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,140
The weather is dry.

568
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,310
The inner heat is strong.

569
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:01,650
So...

570
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,070
Stop looking.

571
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,120
Stop!

572
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,570
Why are you still looking?

573
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,000
Stop!

574
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,470
Young Master!

575
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,430
Let me wash

576
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,770
your filthy mind.

577
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,780
You don't think

578
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,830
I have a crush on you, do you?

579
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,170
I dare not.

580
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,230
Young Master, you are as noble as a dragon in the sky.

581
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,780
I'm as humble as a caterpillar on the ground.

582
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,590
How dare I dream of your partiality?

583
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,100
You are quite self-aware.

584
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,900
Do you know

585
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,140
why I arrested you?

586
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,650
Watch out!

587
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,860
What are you doing?

588
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,730
What is this?

589
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,580
Do you want to die?

590
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,560
The Dian bug hasn't come to after being exposed to this drop of blood.

591
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:12,880
Don't tell me...

592
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,510
You're not the murderer?

593
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,730
Murderer?

594
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,330
What murderer?

595
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,020
This is a Dian bug.

596
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,150
It feeds on its master's blood,

597
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,230
and obey its master's order to harm people.

598
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,060
It is in his dormant state now.

599
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,380
But,

600
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,650
once it meets its master's blood,

601
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,650
it will be awakened.

602
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,300
Young Master,

603
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,170
you can't wrong people like this.

604
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,620
A well-behaved person like me

605
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,160
devotes all my passion and youth

606
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,010
to you and Cangyue City.

607
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,260
How could I raise a bug for murder?

608
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,390
Then

609
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,200
why were you sneaking around

610
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,110
in the garden last night?

611
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,540
If I say I went to pick flowers,

612
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,320
will you believe me?

613
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,100
What do you think?

614
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,180
Do you think I should believe

615
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,080
you just picked flowers last night?

616
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,990
Young Master.

617
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,790
I swear

618
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,690
I'm not the master of the Dian bug.

619
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,890
Even if you are not its master,

620
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,770
you still have something to do with it.

621
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,300
Do you dare to say

622
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,780
you have never

623
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,230
had the thought

624
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,130
of killing me?

625
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,100
I...

626
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,840
You know I train my piggy

627
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,150
in the garden every day.

628
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,650
Last night, you brought this bug to...

629
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:24,990
Where is it?

630
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,750
All right.

631
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,180
I...

632
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,220
How dare you say

633
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,850
you didn't raise it?

634
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,810
No, Young Master. I'm innocent.

635
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,690
I really didn't.

636
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,360
You're innocent?

637
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,590
Then where is the bug?

638
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,680
There!

639
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,430
Young Master!

640
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,030
Young Master!

641
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:49,910
Young Master, are you okay?

642
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,030
You can't die, Young Master.

643
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,480
Help!

644
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,760
Young Master.

645
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,830
Wake up!

646
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,810
Young Master.

647
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,770
How dare you hurt Young Master!

648
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,370
Get up!

649
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,470
Not me. It's the bug.

650
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
Go get Dr. Xian.

651
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,780
He knows that bug.

652
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,120
Right.

653
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:05,700
You are right.

654
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,640
You must be fine.

655
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,050
I haven't found my brother yet.

656
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,050
Young Master, what's wrong?

657
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:18,690
Young Master!

658
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,020
Young Master, say something.

659
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,570
Why am I stiff

660
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,340
and unable to move?

661
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:24,980
It must be that bug.

662
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,400
I shouldn't have been careless.

663
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,690
But I didn't expect Yunxi

664
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,440
to be so concerned about my safety.

665
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,170
It seems like she really cares.

666
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:34,940
Young Master,

667
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,390
do you want me to kill her?

668
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,520
-Wait. You can't kill me. -Wuyan, you idiot!

669
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,230
I can help detoxify him.

670
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,960
If we wait here for Dr. Xian,

671
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,960
I'm afraid Young Master's life will be in danger.

672
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,820
Stop talking nonsense.

673
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,730
This bug bite

674
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,560
can't kill people.

675
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,100
That's right.

676
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,450
It can't cause death.

677
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,310
But if the poison is too strong,

678
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,460
Young Master will be paralyzed

679
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,480
for the rest of his life.

680
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,450
If we don't treat him,

681
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,130
he will become a fool.

682
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,890
Really?

683
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,530
Yunxi, you are really good at making up stories.

684
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,230
Of course.

685
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,210
If you don't believe me,

686
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,200
you can have a try.

687
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,050
But by then,

688
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,220
if Young Master really becomes a fool,

689
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,940
you're the one responsible.

690
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,330
Wuyan,

691
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,500
don't believe her.

692
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,300
How about

693
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,910
you let me help detoxify Young Master first?

694
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:15,950
If I fail,

695
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,930
you can kill me then.

696
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,260
Fine.

697
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,730
If you can't cure Young Master,

698
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,570
not only will you die,

699
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,790
but everyone in the Jianjia Alley

700
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,750
will die with you.

701
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,200
Wuyan, you fool.

702
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,020
Can't you tell she's lying?

703
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,150
Yunxi, do you really know how to treat it?

704
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,790
Oh no.

705
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,230
Not here.

706
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,660
Which acupoint did brother say

707
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,510
has the effect of detoxification?

708
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,870
Wuyan,

709
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,390
Young Master wants you to leave.

710
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,200
He's angry.

711
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:15,990
Get out.

712
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,950
Anger will accelerate the flow of toxins.

713
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,510
How would you bear

714
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,560
-this responsibility? -Okay, I'll go out.

715
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,420
Wuyan.

716
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,740
Don't go. Wuyan.

717
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,410
Don't be nervous.

718
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,220
I'll treat you with acupuncture.

719
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,210
It won't hurt.

720
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,500
Relax.

721
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,880
Doesn't hurt, right?

722
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,890
If it doesn't hurt, it means I got the right acupoint.

723
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,820
This one hurts?

724
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,460
Pain means I got the wrong acupoint.

725
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,350
Which acupoint is it?

726
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,720
Yun'er,

727
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,090
this set of acupuncture

728
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,000
can be used for detoxification.

729
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,840
You must remember them.

730
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,250
Although it can't cure

731
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,040
the poison of heartburn,

732
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,420
it can be helpful.

733
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,450
How can I remember so many acupoints?

734
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,990
There is a way to remember.

735
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,620
Look.

736
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,560
This Zhubin acupoint

737
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,480
is between the Taixi acupoint and the Yingu acupoint.

738
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,860
It's seven fingers' width away from Taixi acupoint.

739
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:10,370
Five cun.

740
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,670
The distance between them is five cun.

741
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:12,950
You're so smart.

742
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,150
Let's take a look at the pubic region.

743
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,500
It's below the navel.

744
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,380
Three cun.

745
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:22,930
Young Master.

746
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:23,880
I'm sorry.

747
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,320
But this is for your own good.

748
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,180
Young Master.

749
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,080
Hang in there.

750
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,590
This is the last one.

751
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,190
This is the Sishencong acupoint.

752
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,860
It's a little difficult to find this one on the head,

753
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,660
but don't worry.

754
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,010
I will be more careful.

755
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,640
Finally done.

756
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,190
Young Master,

757
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,660
you were pale

758
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,540
because of the poison.

759
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,340
Now you're glowing

760
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,330
and look much better.

761
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,060
I have saved your life.

762
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,250
Listen,

763
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,720
your heartbeat is so strong.

764
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,920
Wuyan.

765
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,670
Open the door quickly.

766
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,020
Please.
