This is

the map of Lord Zhang's Hot Spring Villa.

7
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,460
Here.

8
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,979
If we dig down forty or fifty meters,

9
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,060
we can definitely find the mouth of the hot spring.

10
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,210
This is the map

11
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,250
of Master Liu's tomb.

12
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,180
The graveyard must be

13
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,650
in the southeast of the city.

14
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,230
The land is on the dragon whiskers.

15
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:04,960
Although it's feeble,

16
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,650
it still can get some dragon aura.

My name is Luo Xiyun.

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,600
I was born with the poison of heartburn，

19
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,590
and I have experienced many changes in the world.

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,070
I disguised myself as Yunxi for the last eight years

21
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,360
and lived secretly in Jianjia Alley.

22

With the ancestral skill of mapping,

23
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,750
I've become the most popular folk cartographer

24

in Cangyue City.

25
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,579
No wonder that the roof is sinking.

26
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,030
The proportion of the roof is wrong.

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,950
The ratio of the upper cornice and the eave column

28
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,180
should be three to ten.

29
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,000
Otherwise, it won't be stable.

30

The master of Cangyue City has an order.

31

for the whole Cangyue City

34

The project concerns the foundation of

35
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,610
Cangyue City in future generations.

36
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,750
Each shop

37
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,730
should strictly follow the city's construction policy.

38

70
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,780
to measure the length of Imperial Street

Yes.

This is the Water Dragon from Prince Kang's Mansion.

80

He's just

81
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,480
an ignorant playboy.

82
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,810
He's good at playing with pigs and dogs.

83
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,040
He's good at playing around.

84
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,480
He doesn't know anything about construction.

85
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,890
It's just that the Master of Cangyue City

wants to secure his position as the young master,

Brother, it's an emergency.

101

104

Say something.

105
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,290
This pig.

106
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,000
It's full of treasures.

107
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,100
For example, the spine

108
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,110
can be stewed.

109
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:20,690
Yes.

110
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,530
You can have a sauerkraut stewed pork bone.

111
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,470
and have aftertaste in your mouth.

112
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,820
The liver and kidney can be fried.

113
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:29,810
Anyway,

114
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,400
you can cook it in so many ways and all of them are delicious.

115

Get off.

116
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,170
Awesome!

Ready!

119

You're the best.

must belong to my Kun.

Shut up.

You are cheating!

148
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,320
I am holding the competition,

so I can make the rules.

150

Come on.

152
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,760
It's flying!

Run!

You...

160

Who are you?

161
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,550
Do you know it is the death penalty

162

to assassinate me?

163
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,000
Someone who wants to kill you.

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,190
by accident.

346
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:03,790
Fine.

347
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,240
Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

348
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,640
I'll help you kill him.

349
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,490
If I fail,

350
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,410
it's worth it to die for you.

351
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,860
Don't do anything stupid.

352
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,010
Fine.

353
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,320
I am the assassin.

354
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,500
But it's all a misunderstanding.

355
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,020
I didn't mean to kill him.

356
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,370
I just want to

357
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,490
marry him.

358
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,580
Marry him!

359
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,840
Rumor has it that the Young Master is going to get married.

360
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,860
The girl saved three times by him

361
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,030
will be his destined wife.

362
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,380
So,

363
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,310
I want to creat a dangerous situation

364
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,530
for myself

365
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,330
so that he can save me.

366
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,340
Why do you want to marry the Young Master?

367
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,010
I...

368
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:38,900
I...

369
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,310
Isn't it good to stay in our Jianjia Alley?

370
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,420
Yes, it's good.

371
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,610
That's exactly why I want to marry

372
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,370
the most promising man

373
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,970
in Cangyue City.

374
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
I can use my marriage

375
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,100
in exchange for a bright future

376
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,690
for everyone in Jianjia Alley.

377
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,760
After all, wealth is coming out of danger.

378
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:56,970
Alright.

379
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,620
Let's not talk about this.

380
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,050
Look

381
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,050
what I prepared for you.

382
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,870
Do you like it?

383
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,750
I knew it.

384
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,100
Xiao Qing

385
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,160
looks the best in this.

386
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:14,900
Stop.

387
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:23,890
Young Master.

388
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,820
The Imperial Street is a bit strange today.

389
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,520
It seems to have a murderous vibe.

390
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,660
Young Master, I'm here!

391
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,830
Help!

392
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,980
Young Master!

393
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,300
Young Master!

394
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,140
Young Master.

395
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,550
I think they're all here for you.

396
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,070
It's all because of my charm. Let's go.

397
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,990
Hurry up.

398
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,460
Let's go.

399
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,700
Young Master.

400
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,860
Young Master.

401
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:53,800
Aunt.

402
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,770
My goodness.

403
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,490
This...

404
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,040
So much money?

405
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,860
Aunt,

406
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,230
take this money

407
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,860
to improve the food quality

408
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,870
for everyone.

409
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,910
Don't be so stingy.

410
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,380
When I was young,

411
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,530
I ate too many radishes and vegetables,

412
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,970
and I was always starving.

413
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,640
Yunxi,

414
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,210
you hid so much money.

415
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,430
And it took you so long to take it out.

416
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,620
Aunt.

417
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,660
What's wrong with me giving you the money?

418
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,740
If you had taken it out earlier,

419
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,060
I could buy you some expensive tonics.

420
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,510
And maybe your weak body

421
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,540
have long been cured.

422
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,700
Yunxi,

423
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,560
are you sick again?

424
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,660
I'll go...

425
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,740
I'll go find Dr. Qi.

426
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,400
Yunxi, it's fine.

427
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:49,820
Come.

428
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,430
Yunxi.

429
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,050
Dr. Qi is here.

430
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,070
Yunxi,

431
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,589
I'll go cook.

432
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:09,500
Xiao Qing.

433
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,690
Yunxi.

434
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,660
Come and boil some water for me.

435
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,220
Thank you for your time, Dr. Qi.

436
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,349
You don't have to say thanks.

437
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,750
Yunxi,

438
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,329
you used the strong medicine

439
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,560
to suppress the poison of heartburn in your heart again, right?

440
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,820
How many times have I told you?

441
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,010
It can relieve pain,

442
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,260
but it just fights fire with fire.

443
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,240
Those medicines will only deepen the toxin in your heart

444
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,730
and make your poison flare-ups more frequent.

445
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,240
How long can I live?

446
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,780
One year tops.

447
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:41,970
Or

448
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,770
only six months left.

449
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,210
That's enough.

450
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,670
Father,

451
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,170
because of that love for three rescues,

452
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,550
the whole city's girls

453
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,500
are waiting for me to save them.

454
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,600
What should I do?

455
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,510
Just choose one and marry her.

456
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,730
Everyone will be happy.

457
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,900
Do you think I'm you?

458
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,690
I mean,

459
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,600
getting married now will distract me

460
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,390
and hold me back,

461
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,780
affecting the construction of Cangyue City.

462
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,330
It's fine.

463
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,150
So that you won't say

464
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,130
I always force you in the future.

465
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:14,970
Besides,

466
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,260
you can't even

467
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,240
read the map.

468
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,420
I can learn!

469
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,370
Who dares to teach you now?

470
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,180
Nonsense.

471
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,210
Cangyue City is full of talents.

472
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,580
People from other cities

473
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,700
are also lining up to teach me.

474
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,910
You don't have to worry about that.

475
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,270
Now I've made up my mind.

476
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,820
I will do my best

477
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,260
to build Cangyue City

478
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,520
till my heart ceases to beat.

479
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,790
Well I don't have to sacrifice my life.

480
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:41,900
Fine.

481
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,240
I'll give you one more chance.

482
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,700
Really?

483
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:48,730
I don't believe

484
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,400
I can't teach you a lesson.

485
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,770
You must keep

486
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,670
this jade comb.

487
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,590
Brother!

488
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,530
Yun'er, run!

489
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,300
Brother.

490
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,660
I will kill Jiang Chaoxi

491
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,860
to avenge you!

492
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,660
Wonderful.

493
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,510
Chicken is chicken, and duck is duck.

494
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,070
The monkey is wearing a flower.

495
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,400
This painting is honored to have been verified by you.

496
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,360
Its value will be greatly increased.

497
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:04,580
By the way,

498
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
have you found Luo Hexuan?

499
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,830
Master,

500
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,740
We haven't found anything

501
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,180
about him yet.

502
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,590
Rest assured, Master.

503
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,910
This time, during the demolition and construction of the city,

504
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,130
we can count all households.

505
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,980
As long as Luo Hexuan is in Cangyue City,

506
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,660
we will find him.

507
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,710
It's been eight years.

508
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,650
I've been waiting for too long.

509
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,290
Those who obtain the Fengchi will live forever.

510
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,530
As long as we find Luo Hexuan,

511
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,390
we can find Fengchi.

512
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,810
This is

513
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,860
my lifelong pursuit.

514
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,000
Master,

515
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,280

Could it be that Luo Hexuan and his sister

Let me ask again.

688
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,240
we can't construct without mapping.

689
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,860
What should we do to draw a map?

690
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,810
According to the map of Yugong,

691
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,260
there are six elements to making maps.

692
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,460
Ratio, accuracy, milage,

693
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,380
level, slope, and tortuosity.

694
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,330
I prefer mapping to scale.

695
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,250
More precise.

696
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,810
Keep her.

697
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,380
Thank you, Young Master.

698
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,670
Congratulations on entering the second round.

699
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,630
As a surveyor,

700
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,880
one needs not only

701
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,620
professional skills,

702
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,620
but a healthy body.

703
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,900
Let's begin.

704
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,350
Let me see

705
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:53,960
your strength.

706
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,790
You can try to lift

707
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,570
the most weight you can bear.

708
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,630
Who lifts the highest can stay.

709
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,840
Come on! Come on!

710
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,300
I'm afraid

711
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,170
I can't beat them.

712
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,550
It seems that I need to pull some tricks.

713
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,500
What are you doing?

714
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,100
Young Master,

715
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,650
the most important thing for me

716
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,780
is to shoulder the responsibility

717
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,700
to help you build Cangyue City.

718
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,220
You see.

719
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,270
This responsibility

720
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,570
is so heavy.

721
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,120
Fine.

722
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,010
I like what you said.

723
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,330
Stay.

724
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,140
Thank you, Young Master.

725
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:45,950
Young Master.

726
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,200
Who threw it?

727
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,580
Did you throw it?

728
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,100
Young Master.

729
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,760
Bad news.

730
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,300
There are water snake caves under Dongze Lake.

731
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,580
So the foundation of the Ancestral Temple is unstable.

732
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,750
Lord Song sent me to ask you

733
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,530
how to deal with it.

734
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,070
Why are you asking me

735
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,040
how to deal with it?

736
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,260
Just build the temple

737
00:27:59,290 --> 00:27:59,840
in another place.

738
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,570
Young Master,

739
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,810
the Ancestral Temple worships the ancestors of the Jiang family.

740
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,630
We can't simply change the site.

741
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,800
Trees move to death; people move to life.

742
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,670
Maybe they'll thank me

743
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,920
if we change the site.

744
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,980
Go burn some incense

745
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,990
and tell my ancestors that they're moving.

746
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,310
Young Master.

747
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,030
Didn't you promise Master

748
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,270
to do things well?

749
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,670
To move ancestral graves,

750
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,680
isn't it too careless

751
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,950
if we just burn some incense?

752
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,230
You're right.

753
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,370
I was careless.

754
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,310
You!

755
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,440
What's your name?

756
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,430
Yunxi.

757
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,110
how will you find the water snake caves?

758
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,320
Please wait a moment.

759
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,250
You'll know soon.

760
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,980
Human beings and all things are in symbiosis.

761
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,970
To build houses and the city,

762
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,050
in addition to understanding the environment and feng shui,

763
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,870
you should also know

764
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,040
the features of nearby plants and animal habits.

765
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,010
If you want to know

766
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,170
where the water snake caves are,

767
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,430
the easiest way

768
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,940
is to ask the water snakes.

769
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,690
Ask them?

770
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:09,860
Look at the water.

771
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,710
Aren't you just feeding snakes?

772
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,060
The west of the lake

773
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,490
is about 17 meters away offshore.

774
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,020
The buoy is moving now.

775
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,280
It means there is no water snake cave there.

776
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,310
You are really smart.

777
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,160
Of course.

778
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,620
I've been smart since I was young.

779
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,610
Your trick. Draw a snake out of its hole.

780
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,520
I've already thought of it.

781
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,910
I was just testing your ability.

782
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,400
So, we can lay the foundation of the Ancestral Temple

783
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,190
20 meters away

784
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,870
from the west shore.

785
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,010
Are you sure this is the right distance?

786
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,590
My eyes are the ruler.

787
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,860
If you don't believe me,

788
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,770
you can ask someone to measure it.

789
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,500
I just

790
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,560
praised you a little.

791
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,020
And you want to create an opportunity

792
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,960
for me to save you?

793
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,470
-Young Master, I... -Don't worry.

794
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,000
I'll give you a chance later.

795
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,440
Here.

796
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,420
Yes.

797
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,010
Look here.

798
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,500
Okay.

799
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,750
This is a construction site.

800
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,330
How dare he bring a woman here for fun?

801
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,680
He is really an useless young master.

802
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,290
Lord Song.

803
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:22,600
Lord Song!

804
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,720
He's here.

805
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:25,690
Oh my god.

806
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:27,670
Here.

807
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,030
Here's your chance.

808
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,630
Seize it.

809
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,270
Young Master.

810
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,540
How's your ride, Young Master?

811
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,690
You came in person.

812
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,840
You should tell me ahead of time next time,

813
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,190
so that I can welcome you.

814
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,570
I don't need it.

815
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,640
I and my beauty

816
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,830
just feed the fish,

817
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,900
and we find out

818
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,680
where the water snake caves are.

819
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,990
Listen.

820
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,750
Just lay the foundation

821
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,840
20 meters offshore

822
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,510
to the west.

823
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,040
No, Young Master.

824
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,610
What is the ground

825
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,150
for laying the foundation there?

826
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,580
What ground?

827
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,850
My words are the ground.

828
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,790
Don't you forget to mention

829
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,580
how hard I work for the temple

830
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,830
in front of my father

831
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,620
and my uncle.

832
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:27,820
Understood.

833
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,070
-Understand? -Yes, yes, sir.

834
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,560
Yes.

835
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,160
Okay, you may leave.

836
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:30,470
Okay.

837
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,160
Be careful.

838
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,580
Young Master is here!

839
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,460
Cheer up!

840
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,180
Hurry up.

841
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,060
Hurry up.

842
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,430
Don't stand in my way.

843
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,340
This way.

844
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,830
Hurry up.

845
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,280
Hurry up!

846
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,190
Hurry up!

847
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,700
I'm going over there.

848
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,220
Alrighty.

849
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,320
Young Master.

850
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,550
The job I applied for

851
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,540
is a surveyor to assist you,

852
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,760
not a beauty who plays with you.

853
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,520
Tell me.

854
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,840
What is your purpose

855
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,300
of approaching me?
