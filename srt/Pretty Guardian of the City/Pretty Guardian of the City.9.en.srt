you've been guarding for a day and a night.

Why don't you take a rest first?

177
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,050
I'll stay here for you.

Wake up.

187
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,580

you are not allowed to die.

191

Are you feeling unwell?

205
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,870
Does it still hurt?

Are you hungry?

Let me feed you some soup.

What's wrong with him?

211
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,420
Could it be that the Hot Night Incense

that you were hopeless,

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,010
I ate something wrong when I was young,

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,260

Are you really going to sleep here?

259

You even gave up your own room.

260

care about Miss Yunxi.

262

You talk too much.

just because she is poisoned?

271
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:01,590
Back then,

272

273

She's only been here for a few days.

283
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,100

284
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,720

00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,290
Fine.

286

I'm a man and she's a woman.

287
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,540
It's not wrong to like someone.

288
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,170
The Young Master's room is really comfortable.

289
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,070
He really knows how to enjoy the life.

Why are you here?

294
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,320
I came here

295
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,910
on the pretext of sending snacks.

296
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,910
Yunxi, I heard that you were dying.

297
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,110
I was so worried.

298

Luckily, you are fine.

299
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,780
The bed is really soft.

300
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,400
I slept here last night.

301
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,380
Yunxi,

302
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,580
I really envy you.

303
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,950
You envy me for being sick?

304
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,810
What I envy is that Young Master likes you.

305
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,830
You have no idea.

306
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,760
Young Master

307
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,270
drove Miss Fengyi away for you.

308
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,270
While you were in a coma,

309
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,819
Young Master was going crazy.

310
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,329
He even stayed by your side all day.

311
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,369
Really?

312
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,790
Of course.

313
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:12,819
You see,

314
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,220
Young Master likes you.

315
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,069
And Tang Qing risked his life for you.

316
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,500
What happened to Qing?

317
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,930
He risked his life?

318
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,260
Don't you know?

319
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,890
In order to

320
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,950
beg Young Master to save you,

321
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,940
Tang Qing broke into the Planning Room.

322
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,930
So he is imprisoned now.

323
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:27,690
Yunxi.

324
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,180
Although I like her very much,

325
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,590
but rushing to see her

326

at this early hour

327
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,420
will make me seem too eager.

328
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,230
But

329
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,900
since she's not well now,

330
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,640
I should visit her.

331
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,560
Young Master.

332
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,180
You...

333
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,830
You still haven't recovered.

334
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,850
Why are you running around?

335
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,020
Did you imprison Qing?

336
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,260
You came here at this early hour

337
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,810
for Tang Qing?

338
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:20,810
Young Master.

339
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,230
Qing broke into the Planning Room

340
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,860
only because he was desperate to save me.

341
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,380
Please spare him this time.

342
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,910
No matter what his reason was,

343
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
it doesn't change the fact

344
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,710
that he broke into the Planning Room

345
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,460
and even used the swords there.

346
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,640
I can't spare him.

347
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,020
But...

348
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,420
You are this worried about him?

349
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,700
Of course.

350
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,010
He is my little brother.

351
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,750
So please

352
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,540
help me out this time.

353
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,740
He's really just a little brother to you?

354
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,930
If you don't want to help,

355
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,420
then forget it.

356
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,680
I heard that Dr. Xian is also here.

357
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,770
I'll ask him for help.

358
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,370
Stop there.

359
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,960
Go back and rest.

360
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,760
I'll bring him to you.

361
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,620
Really?

362
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,260
Thank you, Young Master.

363
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,860
I just went to deliver breakfast

364
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,030
to Dr. Xian.

365
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,600
He's really gentle.

366
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,660
What's the use of being gentle if he has a poor fate?

367
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,240
Among all of the sons,

368
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,350
he's the least favored.

369
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,250
Our Young Master is the best.

370
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,230
He is the biological son of the Lady of Cangyue City.

371
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,540
He also has the formidable Commander Xiao

372
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,210
as his uncle.

373
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,530
That's true.

374
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,890
But I heard

375
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,040
that Dr. Xian and Miss Nangong Siyan

376
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,030
are mutually in love.

377
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,020
If they get married,

378
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,170
he might...

379
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,550
Miss Nangong Siyan

380
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,070
can only marry our Young Master.

381
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,660
I wonder

382
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,820
who will become our Young Master's wife,

383
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,100
Miss Nangong Siyan

384
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,720
or Miss Fengyi.

385
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,910
Miss Yunxi.

386
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,770
Dr. Xian.

387
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,160
Let's go.

388
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,500
Don't mind

389
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,470
what they said.

390
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,400
They were just being honest.

391
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,810
There are times when I'm unhappy,

392
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,960
but they are never because of others' judgments.

393
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,670
You are much tougher

394
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,030
than you look.

395
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,110
All these years,

396
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,270
Siyan

397
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,110
is the only thing holding me together.

398
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:29,820
That's good.

399
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,260
By the way, Dr. Qi,

400
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,790
thank you for keeping my condition

401
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,500
a secret.

402
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,850
Don't worry.

403
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,050
But I'm afraid the only antidote

404
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,400
for the poison in your body

405
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,950
is Fengchi,

406
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,580
as per the rumors.

407
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,060
I'm afraid I'm not lucky enough.

408
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,090
Don't give up so easily.

409
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,130
Okay.

410
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,100
Let's work hard together.

411
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,140
I'll work hard to stay alive.

412
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,470
You'll work hard to hold on to

413
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,630
your determination and happiness.

414
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:00,700
Okay.

415
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,740
By the way, Yunxi,

416
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,580
do you notice

417
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,550
that the Young Master

418
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,380
treats you differently?

419
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,390
You have no idea.

420
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,070
Because of you,

421
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,340
Young Master chased Miss Fengyi away.

422
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,310
While you were in a coma,

423
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,880
Young Master was going crazy.

424
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,450
He even stayed by your side all day.

425
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,850
Yunxi, don’t think too much.

426
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,690
I'm just a useful city surveyor to Young Master,

427
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,140
nothing more.

428
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,270
Young Master needs me

429
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,420
for the construction of Cangyue City.

430
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,560
That's why he treats me differently.

431
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,460
Young Master.

432
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,400
How is Yunxi?

433
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,290
Did she relapse?

434
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,340
She's very fine.

435
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,670
You should worry about

436
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,500
yourself instead.

437
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,080
Thank you for saving Yunxi.

438
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,410
I’m at your disposal.

439
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,570
You can't stay here anymore,

440
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,410
but I admire

441
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,200
your bravery.

442
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,400
How about this?

443
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,110
How about I recommend you

444
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,020
to the Supervision Army?

445
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,650
Supervision Army?

446
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,980
Supervision Army...

447
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,340
No thank you.

448
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,610
Listen carefully.

449
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,610
I'm suggesting the Supervision Army,

450
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,610
where people are dying to get into.

451
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,210
I know.

452
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,700
But it's too bad,

453
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,850
I just want to stay by her side

454
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:39,820
and protect her.

455
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,540
Don't you think about

456
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,350
your future?

457
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,230
My future

458
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,490
is about guarding

459
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,180
and protecting her for life.

460
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,170
Fine.

461
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,260
Okay.

462
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,620
You're not going?

463
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,770
Then stay in prison

464
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,530
for the rest of your life!

465
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,670
Young Master.

466
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,220
He has no ambition.

467
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,430
He's not a man.

468
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,170
Yunxi definitely wouldn't like

469
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,800
someone like him.

470
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,880
Are we going back like this?

471
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,850
Then what? Do you want to live here?

472
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,950
But if we don't bring Tang Qing back,

473
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,460
I’m afraid it won't be easy

474
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,330
to deal with Miss Yunxi.

475
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,380
Yunxi.

476
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,020
Qing.

477
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,640
Are you okay?

478
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:48,690
What are you doing?

479
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,070
I'm fine.

480
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,430
Don't you know men and women shouldn't be too intimate?

481
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:55,970
Yunxi,

482
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,600
you haven't fully recovered yet.

483
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,580
I told you to rest.

484
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,780
Why are you still running around?

485
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,020
Are you sick again?

486
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,060
I'm fine.

487
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:03,770
Look.

488
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,330
I'm full of vigor now.

489
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,870
I'm more than fine.

490
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,610
Young Master, thank you

491
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,780
for bringing Qing back.

492
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,060
Qing,

493
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,510
you mustn't have eaten well the past few days.

494
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,790
I asked someone to leave some food for you.

495
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,420
Let's go eat.

496
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,340
Young Master,

497
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,490
I know you've been busy with work lately.

498
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,100
Qing and I will disturb you no longer.

499
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:24,700
Fine.

500
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,200
Nice one.

501
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,140
Why are you so impulsive?

502
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,100
Didn't I tell you

503
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,680
repeatedly

504
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,080
to always take care of yourself first?

505
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,170
I said I would protect you.

506
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,530
I don't need your protection.

507
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:38,930
Besides,

508
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,950
I should be the one protecting you

509
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,810
as your older sister.

510
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,640
I'm not your little brother,

511
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,620
nor do I want to be one.

512
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,460
How did he become

513
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,570
as temperamental as Jiang Chaoxi?

514
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,470
He is around Jiang Chaoxi too much.

515
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,660
Young Master.

516
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,020
Young Master.

517
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,100
I drew some maps for the commercial market

518
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,360
in the North of the city.

519
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,120
Please take a look.

520
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,250
No need.

521
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,890
The Planning Room has submitted a report

522
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,540
to build the commercial market in the South of the city.

523
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,040
It was also approved at the meeting hall.

524
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,150
The South of the city?

525
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,510
It's obviously more suitable in the North.

526
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,770
Besides,

527
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,180
what about the people

528
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,600
of 16th Lane, Seventh Street?

529
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,790
We have prepared a resettlement site

530
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
for them outside the city.

531
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,540
Also, every household

532
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,320
will receive a settlement fee.

533
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,880
Outside the city?

534
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,020
They've really become

535
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,060
the abandoned child of Cangyue.

536
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:34,930
Yunxi.

537
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,390
Don't worry about this matter.

538
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,000
Focus on recuperating first.

539
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,580
Fine.

540
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,220
I'll take my leave.

541
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,540
I told you

542
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,720
you can stay here as long as you want.

543
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,900
What's the rush?

544
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:08,980
I can't

545
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,810
stay here forever.

546
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,860
Besides,

547
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,260
didn't Young Master

548
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,230
emphasize that

549
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,380
men and women shouldn't be too intimate?

550
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,660
You can leave if you want.

551
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,750
This is a good opportunity

552
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,430
to get his jade token.

553
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,500
It can't be missed.

554
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,840
Now that I think about it,

555
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,220
this house is spacious and comfortable.

556
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,720
It's suitable for recuperation.

557
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,970
I will stay another night.

558
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:43,900
Fine.

559
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,180
Have a good rest.

560
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,570
I'm going back to my study.

561
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,280
There's a bug!

562
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,220
A bug?

563
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,180
Where is the bug?

564
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,180
Where is it...

565
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,960
Have a good sleep.

566
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,040
Yunxi,

567
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,250
what if the Young Master wakes up

568
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:54,960
and blames you?

569
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:55,700
Don't worry.

570
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:56,830
I coated the silver needle

571
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,140
with the liquid of the hallucinogenic jimsonweed.

572
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,550
It will just feel like a good night's sleep

573
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,690
in dreamland for him.

574
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,340
This is it.

575
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,960
Okay.

576
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,040
Brother.

577
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,610
Brother!

578
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,220
Brother!

579
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,620
Brother!

580
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,930
I'm Yun'er.

581
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,520
I've finally found you, brother.

582
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,530
Yunxi, we can’t stay here for long.

583
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,580
We’d better

584
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,330
take your brother away now.

585
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,330
My brother has been in a coma for eight years

586
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,440
and he's still alive.

587
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,470
Jiang Chaoxi had to have

588
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,710
taken good care of him.

589
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,550
So I want to stay here

590
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,260
and find a way to help my brother gain consciousness,

591
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,150
and also find out

592
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,420
what happened back then.

593
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,300
I clearly saw

594
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,840
Jiang Chaoxi kill my brother.

595
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:38,770
But Yunxi,

596
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,530
the longer we stay here,

597
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,380
the more dangerous it will be.

598
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,460
After so many days together,

599
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,020
I realize that Jiang Chaoxi

600
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,230
is not a cruel menace.

601
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,040
As long as we act carefully,

602
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,230
we'll be fine.

603
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:54,750
Brother.

604
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,170
Don't worry.

605
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,970
I will get you out of here.

606
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,220
Why did I have such a dream?

607
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,790
Why is there a blood stain?
