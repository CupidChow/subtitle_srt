00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,100
They

172
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,540
would never do such a thing.

173
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,330
Your Highness,

174
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,010
I intended

175
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,130
to keep these things from you forever.

176
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,740
Miss Nangong

177
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,380
has been very close to Young Master recently.

178
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,860
She visited Young Master's mansion alone many times.

179
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,910
There have been rumors in the city.

180
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,880
I'll go ask Siyan about it.

181
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,190
Jewelry for sale!

182
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,040
Take a look.

183
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,400
The girl just now is quite hot.

184
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:40,940
Really?

185
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,290
Not bad.

186
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,090
Stop!

187
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,270
What the heck?

188
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,540
You can't bump into someone and just walk away.

189
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,560
Apologies.

190
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,080
It's you!

191
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,080
Dr. Xian, right?

192
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,790
Dr. Xian,

193
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,790
everyone says you're humble and polite.

194
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,500
But look at you.

195
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,030
You bumped into me and are giving me dirty looks.

196
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,990
Maybe Dr. Xian is in a hurry

197
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,880
to treat someone's wife.

198
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,390
You got in his way.

199
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,610
Of course he's giving you dirty looks.

200
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,740
Stop!

201
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,130
Move.

202
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,260
Are you angry?

203
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,970
Don't consider yourself superior

204
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,840
just because you're the Master's son.

205
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,960
Your mother was just a maid.

206
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,470
Have you taken yourself as a Young Master?

207
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,300
You want to fight with us?

208
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,130
We don't have the balls

209
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,180
to fight someone as fragile as you.

210
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,110
What if you get hurt and blackmail us？

211
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,020
You should die

212
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,340
and reincarnate as a stronger man.

213
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,520
Get lost!

214
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,610
Stop! Stop!

215
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,020
Spare me!

216
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,300
Spare me!

217
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,390
Spare me!

218
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,690
Please show me mercy, Dr. Xian.

219
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,380
Spare my life!

220
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,700
I'm a jerk.

221
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,490
I'm a jerk.

222
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,180
Please spare my life, Dr. Xian.

223
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,340
Spare my life!

224
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,600
Please.

225
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,070

Why are you

so cruel to me?

Fate Tree,

00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,910

248
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:15,830

♫Let's preserve the most beautiful moment♫

252
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,020
He bullied

253
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,270
the powerless supervision guards

254
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,470
just because he's the Master's son.

255
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,860
He presumed too much.

256
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,300
The guards' family

257
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,060
submitted complaints to me.

258
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,580
They want me to do them justice.

259
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,050
Even if I want to help Xian,

260
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,830
I can't prevent

261
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,100
rumors from spreading.

262
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,180
As his mother,

263
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,340
you can criticize or punish him

264
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,460
for his mistake.

265
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,700
It's not difficult.

266
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,869
The blunder

267
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,510
Xi'er made

268
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,300
is what we should be fretting over.

269
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,579
The whole city

270
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,710
is talking about the night

271
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,859
he spent with Miss Nangong.

272
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,660
Miss Nangong's reputation is ruined.

273
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,540
The construction of the city will soon be completed.

274
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,619
Nangong Shi's granddaughter

275
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,180
really knows how to seize the opportunity.

276
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,110
Xi'er has always disliked

277
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,410
us mentioning his marriage.

278
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,650
Why should I bother him?

279
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,470
When you tried to make a match

280
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,740
between Fengyi and Xi'er,

281
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,430
you didn't seem to be afraid of annoying him.

282
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:44,750
Forget it.

283
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,520
You think I don't know

284
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,610
what you think?

285
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,340
Anyway,

286
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,140
Xi'er's marriage

287
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,020
can't be postponed anymore.

288
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,340
As I said,

289
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,830
give both of these two girls

290
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:56,840
to him.

291
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,420
Whoever gives birth first

292
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,700
will be the first lady.

293
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,120
I don't think anyone dares to have an opinion.

294
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,540
It's quite sweet.

295
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,330
By the grace of God, here is Master's edict.

296
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,260
Xiao Fengyi is gentle, kind, honest, sincere

297
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,410
and good-looking.

298
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,890
Nangong Siyan

299
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,250
is talented and elegant.

300
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,540
These two girls are waiting to get married,

301
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,450
and are excellent in talent, appearance and conduct.

302
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,300
I hereby bestow marriage to Young Master Jiang Chaoxi.

303
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,020
You shall get married on a good day.

304
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:31,830
In the future,

305
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,660
whoever gives birth first

306
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,200
will be the first lady,

307
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,840
and the other will be the second lady.

308
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,240
You shall manage the family together

309
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,580
with Young Master.

310
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,820
It's the luck of the people in Cangyue.

311
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,380
Congratulations, Young Master.

312
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,760
Congratulations, Young Master.

313
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,810
Thank you.

314
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,090
Jiang Chaoxi.

315
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,780
Where is Yunxi?

316
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,450
Where is Miss Yunxi?

317
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,070
You must know it

318
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,050
better than anyone, Mr. Fusheng.

319
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,750
Last night, she held you

320
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,660
to bill and coo.

321
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,830
But now,

322
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,650
you ask us where she is?

323
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,980
That's not necessary to look around.

324
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,570
You can't escape from here,

325
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,880
and Jiang Chaoxi won't be able to find you.

326
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,980
Since Commander Xiao wants to see me,

327
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,290
you can ask me to go to your mansion.

328
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,510
Why are you making such a fuss?

329
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,900
Stop playing dumb.

330
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,000
I didn't bring you here

331
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,360
to treat you to a meal.

332
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,320
Give me the white jade comb.

333
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,030
The white jade comb?

334
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
What are you talking about?

335
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,270
Commander Xiao, if you want a comb,

336
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,460
you can buy one on the street.

337
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,370
Why did you ask me for it?

338
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,060
You know it clearly.

339
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,100
What I want

340
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,480
is the white jade comb

341
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,610
which you take with you.

342
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,220
It's the key to the Fengchi.

343
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,980
I advise you

344
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,000
not to be unperceptive

345
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,220
like your father

346
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,650
and your brother.

347
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,990
What?

348
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,300
My white jade comb

349
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,120
is the key to finding Fengchi.

350
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,780
I wouldn't know if you didn't tell me.

351
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,760
Unfortunately, you're late.

352
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:23,930
That white jade comb

353
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,190
has been sent to Young Master

354
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,240
as a token of love.

355
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,290
Why don't you let me go?

356
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,410
I'll ask Young Master for it

357
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,410
and send it to you.

358
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,210
Do you think I'm stupid?

359
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,540
But the white jade comb

360
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,580
is really not with me.

361
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,390
Didn't Pepper search for it

362
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,420
just now?

363
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,380
How about this?

364
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,020
Let Pepper go back

365
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,350
and steal it again.

366
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,620
Anyway, she is quite familiar with

367
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,420
the Young Master's Mansion.

368
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,070
It seems that you really think I'm stupid.

369
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,370
If so,

370
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,380
Jiang Chaoxi

371
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,780
will know directly

372
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,980
that you are in my hands

373
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,060
and he will come to save you.

374
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,730
Then what do you want to do?

375
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,940
Why don't you just use me

376
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,700
to threaten Young Master

377
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,480
and ask him to hand over the white jade comb?

378
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,980
I think with his love for me,

379
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,150
he will definitely agree.

380
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,380
Jiang Chaoxi.

381
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,670
I told you at first

382
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,850
if you didn't love Yunxi anymore,

383
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,710
you should give her back to me.

384
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,740
What did you say?

385
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,110
You promised me

386
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,220
that day would never come.

387
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,520
It's only been a few days.

388
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,950
How can you let Yunxi down?

389
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:18,530
Tang Qing.

390
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,630
How dare you!

391
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,620
How do you know

392
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,140
I'm the one who betrayed?

393
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,190
You are not the one?

394
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,230
You are not the one who spent the night

395
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,630
alone with Nangong Siyan in the tavern?

396
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,360
Aren't you the one

397
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,060
who gladly accepted the marriage given by Master?

398
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,580
Today,

399
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,620
I will seek justice for Yunxi.

400
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,620
Tang Qing.

401
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,150
Our priority is to find Yunxi.

402
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,540
We must unite and focus on one goal.

403
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,100
Don't create more troubles.

404
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,540
Yunxi is weak now.

405
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,770
If anything happens,

406
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,210
she won't be able to hold on.

407
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,060
If anything happens to Yunxi,

408
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,850
I won't forgive you.

409
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,780
Yunxi is rational,

410
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,030
so she won't leave without saying goodbye.

411
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,750
I'm afraid

412
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,580
she has met someone bad.

413
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,280
Yunxi.

414
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,370
Someone bad...

415
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,690
Oh no.

416
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,260
Lord.

417
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,760
I have something to report.

418
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,290
Go ahead.

419
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,170
Master ordered

420
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,280
to marry Miss Fengyi and Nangong Siyan

421
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,760
to Young Master at the same time.

422
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,950
How did he react?

423
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,650
Young Master has received the decree.

424
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,220
It seems that

425
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,880
you overestimated yourself.

426
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,470
Get over yourself.

427
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,460
You're missing.

428
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,290
Instead of looking for you,

429
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,840
Jiang Chaoxi accepted the wedding

430
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,200
with joy.

431
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,540
Are you stupid?

432
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,500
Tell me quickly.

433
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,880
Where is the white jade comb?

434
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,920
I told you I gave it to Jiang Chaoxi.

435
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,410
To deal with

436
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,570
a stubborn girl like you,

437
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,430
it seems that

438
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,500
we need to use some means.

439
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,570
Steward.

440
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,500
Yes.

441
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,800
-You won't tell me, right? -My Lord.

442
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,330
Yunxi has the poison of heartburn,

443
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,160
so her body isn't as good as ordinary people.

444
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,390
I'm afraid she won't be able to stand a few whips.

445
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,340
If she dies,

446
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,180
isn't there less chance

447
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,820
of finding the white jade comb?

448
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,710
Let me talk to her.

449
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,340
After all, I've been with her for so long.

450
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,580
Fine.

451
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,640
I'll give you some time.

452
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,080
Don't let me down.

453
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:20,880
Yes.

454
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,890
You are really an excellent spy.

455
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,820
Your disguise was perfect.

456
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,180
I used to treat you

457
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,070
as my good friend.

458
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,810
Yunxi,

459
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,410
I advise you not to go against Commander Xiao.

460
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,110
Or it's you

461
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,110
who suffer.

462
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,700
As long as you tell me,

463
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,260
I'll ask Commander to let you go.

464
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,120
You are so naive.

465
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,970
Whether I say it or not,

466
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,280
I'll die.

467
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,860
I can live a few more days if I don't say it.

468
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,860
Search the whole city

469
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,910
and get Yunxi back.

470
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,500
Search!

471
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,090
Yes.

472
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,130
Yunxi! Yunxi! Yunxi!

473
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,680
Yunxi!

474
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,990
Sister Yunxi! Yunxi!

475
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,300
Yunxi! Yunxi!

476
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,340
Yunxi! Yunxi!

477
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,140
Sister Yunxi!

478
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,960
Yunxi!

479
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,180
Yunxi. Yunxi.

480
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,620
How about this?

481
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:25,810
You go this way.

482
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,060
You three go there

483
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,550
and ask around

484
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
if any woman fell into the water.

485
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,540
Go.

486
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,070
Yes.

487
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,120
Yunxi! Sister Yunxi! Yunxi!

488
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,610
Sister Yunxi! Yunxi! Yunxi!

489
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,870
[Nangong's Mansion]

490
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,170
Grandpa.

491
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,050
Siyan.

492
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:45,980
Come here.

493
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,010
Siyan,

494
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,140
Master has issued a decree for marriage,

495
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,140
and Young Master has no objection.

496
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,560
I'm

497
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,480
finally relieved.

498
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,940
I know you don't want to.

499
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,330
But...

500
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:03,660
No.

501
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,380
Grandpa.

502
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,700
I'm willing to marry him.

503
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,930
I'm willing to

504
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,700
follow the arrangement of Master and Grandpa.

505
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,580
Good!

506
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,050
Good!

507
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,860
My dear granddaughter

508
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,410
has grown up.

509
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,620
I'm very pleased.

510
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,780
I'm happy for you.

511
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,780
Father.

512
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,420
I won't marry him!

513
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,260
I will never marry my cousin!

514
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:29,800
Alright.

515
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,050
Stop making noises!

516
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,560
No!

517
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,710
I don't care. I won't marry him.

518
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,090
Enough.

519
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,790
Do you think

520
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,620
I really want you

521
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,650
to marry Jiang Chaoxi?

522
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,720
That's great.

523
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,230
Let's go to Aunt and Uncle

524
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,100
and cancel the marriage.

525
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,310
No.

526
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,530
Are you really stupid?

527
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,140
It's Master's order.

528
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,450
Can you change it easily?

529
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,630
Enough.

530
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,940
Let

531
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,100
me

532
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,160
think about it.

533
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,060
When you're done,

534
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,900
the bridal sedan will be at the door.

535
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,140
Forget it.

536
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,420
I'll go find Cousin myself.

537
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,020
I will ask him to beg Uncle

538
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,980
to cancel the marriage.

539
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:02,900
Stop!

540
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,470
Father!

541
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,100
Listen.

542
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,430
From now on,

543
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,840
you'll stay here

544
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,790
and you are not allowed to go anywhere.

545
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:10,540
Guards!

546
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,820
Father!

547
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,370
What are you doing?

548
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,690
I didn't do anything wrong.

549
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,080
Why won't you let me go out?

550
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,500
What are you waiting for?

551
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,020
Take her back to her room.

552
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,310
No.

553
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,780
Let go of me!

554
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,940
Let go!

555
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,190
No.

556
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,700
Tell me.

557
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:24,980
No.

558
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,030
-My girl! -I'm not getting married.

559
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,710
I'm going to see Cousin.

560
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,170
Lord.

561
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,960
Lady has been engaged to Young Master.

562
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,470
What should we do?

563
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,100
Let me tell you.

564
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,590
Since

565
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,520
Jiang Chaoxi has agreed to the marriage,

566
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,590
that means Yunxi

567
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,470
is not that important in his heart.

568
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,250
If he knows what's good for him,

569
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,610
I may

570
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,160
give him another chance.

571
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,570
Xiao Huasheng.

572
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,940
Give Yunxi back to me!

573
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,550
Young Master, you call my name

574
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,140
very smoothly.

575
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,710
Where did you learn the etiquette?

576
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,290
How dare you speak in a loud voice

577
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,160
in my mansion?

578
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,510
Did you

579
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,180
kidnap Yunxi?

580
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,410
Do you have any evidence?

581
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,860
Don't talk nonsense

582
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,420
without evidence.

583
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,910
I knew you wouldn't admit it.

584
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,580
Since you don't feel guilty,

585
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,140
why don't you let me

586
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,930
search in your mansion?

587
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:23,860
How dare you!

588
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,850
Although you're Young Master,

589
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,140
I am also your uncle.

590
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,260
I will also be your father-in-law.

591
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,030
How can you humiliate me like this?

592
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,180
What?

593
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,570
You dare not let me search?

594
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,690
Search.

595
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,700
You can search.

596
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,380
I can let you

597
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,520
search at will

598
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,100
in my mansion.

599
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,120
But I have to remind you.

600
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,940
What will happen

601
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,610
if you can't find Yunxi here?

602
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,890
Young man,

603
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,020
don't be so reckless.

604
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,170
Especially you

605
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,890
are Young Master.

606
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,450
Every choice you make

607
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,440
will affect

608
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,780
your future.

609
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,570
I advise you not to be impulsive

610
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,810
and do something

611
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,350
you will regret for the rest of your life.

612
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,030
I've already made my decision.

613
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,620
In the past,

614
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,700
for the sake of my mother's upbringing,

615
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:16,940
I didn't blame you

616
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,900
for what you had done.

617
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,300
But you really shouldn't

618
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,060
hurt Yunxi.

619
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,930
Xiao Huasheng,

620
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,610
you'd better pray

621
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,410
I won't find any evidence.

622
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,570
According to Xiao Huasheng's reaction today,

623
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,330
I'm sure

624
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,050
Yunxi is in his hands.

625
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,020
But he didn't hide her in the Xiao's Mansion.

626
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,620
So

627
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,710
Xiao Huasheng must have captured Yunxi

628
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,380
for Fengchi.

629
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,020
For Fengchi?

630
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,590
But how can Yunxi

631
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,730
know where Fengchi is?

632
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,870
If she knew earlier,

633
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,960
why did she bother

634
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,380
to find the map in the Xiao's Mansion?

635
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,050
Yunxi

636
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,330
really gave you the white jade comb.

637
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:19,890
Young Master.

638
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,980
You still don't understand.

639
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,870
This white jade comb is the key

640
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,260
to find Fengchi.

641
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
Yunxi gave it to you

642
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,310
not because she likes you?

643
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,490
What's your relationship then?

644
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,350
Why did she give you

645
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,180
such an important thing?

646
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,210
Luo Hexuan is my confidant.

647
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,700
Of course I treat Yunxi

648
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,930
as my own sister.

649
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,060
I see.

650
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,760
But why did she lie to me?

651
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,220
Even though I misunderstood

652
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,200
your relationship,

653
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,780
she didn't explain it to me.

654
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,810
Well,

655
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,070
you should ask

656
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,940
your good mother.

657
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,270
What did she

658
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,020
tell Yunxi?

659
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,260
For your safety,

660
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,580
the only thing she could do is to leave you.

661
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,380
So she still loves me.

662
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,050
How dare you say you love Yunxi deeply?

663
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,230
You can't even feel

664
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,980
her love for you.

665
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,730
I was too stupid.

666
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,170
I doubted her love for me

667
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,660
and did so many things

668
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,620
to hurt her.

669
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,140
You should leave your confession

670
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,180
to Yunxi.

671
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,190
Our top priority is to find a way

672
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,590
to get her out of Xiao Huasheng's hands.

673
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,660
Since we know it was Xiao Huasheng,

674
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,590
why are we still sitting here?

675
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,890
Bring some men to the Xiao's Mansion

676
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,560
and put a sword on his neck.

677
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,580
I don't believe he won't tell us.

678
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,460
That's right.

679
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,260
Let's go.

680
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,720
Wait.

681
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,280
Xiao Huasheng is cunning.

682
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,260
If we alert him,

683
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,980
it may be bad for Yunxi.

684
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,050
Then tell me

685
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,950
what we should do.

686
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,560
There is someone

687
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,420
who can help us.

688
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,590
Tell me.

689
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,010
Where is the white jade comb?

690
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,490
I...

691
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,240
I don't know.

692
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,220
You're quite stubborn.

693
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,910
Let's see how long you can be stubborn.

694
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,660
Commander.

695
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,580
Yunxi seems to have relapsed.

696
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,460
She really can't stand

697
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,860
a few more hits.

698
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,190
Yunxi,

699
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,270
just say it.

700
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:12,990
As long as you say it,

701
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,060
you won't have to suffer anymore.

702
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,480
I really don't know.

703
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:20,820
Look.

704
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,650
I'll let you taste

705
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,120
all the torture tools here

706
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,000
one by one.

707
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,060
I'll torture you slowly.

708
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:28,990
I'm not afraid that you won't tell me.

709
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:31,850
Steward.

710
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,330
Give her some time.

711
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,300
Don't let her die now.

712
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,870
Yunxi.

713
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,090
Wait.

714
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:52,690
Yunxi.

715
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,700
Yunxi, I'm sorry.

716
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,390
I really treat you

717
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,600
as my good sister.

718
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,310
But

719
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,540
I've been trained

720
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,630
to be loyal to Commander.

721
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,810
All these years,

722
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,020
only you

723
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,380
let me know what friendship is.

724
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:13,630
But I...

725
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,150
But I made you

726
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,140
like this.

727
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,600
I'm really sorry.

728
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,860
I'm really sorry.

729
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,980
I just want to ask

730
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,440
whether Young Master has really accepted the marriage.

731
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,940
Yunxi.
