[Episode 5]

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,350
Brother, what should we do now?

5
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,180
If Master finds out

6
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,210
that I'm not Xi'er's mother,

7
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,380
I'll be finished.

8
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,460
I thought

9
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,390
our plan was foolproof.

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,590
Who'd have known

11
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,990
that Luo Hexuan

12
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,410
would find it out

13
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,889
and use it to threaten me?

14
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,100
He wants to save his father.

15
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:14,980
Then...

16
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,020
Let's release Luo Daoan.

17
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,740
Master

18
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,620
has no intention to kill him anyway.

19
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,610
Release him?

20
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,020
If they hadn't threatened

21
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,380
to expose Xi'er's parentage,

22
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,140
I would consider

23
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,380
letting them go.

24
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,090
But now,

25
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:34,930
the whole Luo family

26
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,140
have to die.

27
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,190
If Master finds out

28
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,310
that we made the son of a commoner

29
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,440
his heir,

30
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,320
our Xiao family

31
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,550
will come to an end.

32
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,350
Young Master, I shouldn't have said that.

33
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,950
He has never treated me

34
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,780
as his nephew.

35
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,579
He just wants me

36
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,060
to be a puppet in his control.

37
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,050
Should we tell Her Ladyship about this?

38
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,160
Even if we did,

39
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,260
my mother would only

40
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,100
say a few harsh words to me.

41
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,080
Never mind.

42
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,980
Our priority

43
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:13,730
is to expedite

44
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,050
the building of the drainage.

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,550
Think about how to persuade

46
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,140
that stubborn old man Nangong Shi.

47
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,130
The painting of an imp's soul?

48
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,750
That's just a round-about way

49
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,940
of calling me an imbecile!

50
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,370
I...

51
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:35,900
You!

52
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,660
You said nothing would go wrong.

53
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,300
Look at how it ended up!

54
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,670
How come he was bitten

55
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,780
but nothing happened to him?

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,710
Your failure makes it impossible for me

57
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,700
to carry out the rest of my plan.

58
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,630
My lord,

59
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,450
I'm confused too.

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,790
How did he

61
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,860
survive the bite?

62
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,470
Something must have gone wrong.

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,170
My lord,

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,420
I went to pay Yun Zhongzi

65
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,130
the rest of the money today.

66
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,460
But he wasn't there.

67
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,900
Has Young Master caught him?

68
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,080
You...

69
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,980
Now it made sense

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,720
why he came here

71
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,900
to make a fuss.

72
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:11,580
My lord,

73
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,380
it's just a gardener's accusation.

74
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,890
We shouldn't be afraid of it.

75
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,920
Even if things go south,

76
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,810
we just need to insist

77
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,200
that someone tried to throw mud at us.

78
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,010
You...

79
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,090
Listen.

80
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,170
Be careful in the future.

81
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,880
If anything goes wrong again,

82
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,140
I'll behead you.

83
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:30,900
Yes.

84
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,860
Seems that I must not

85
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,940
underestimate my nephew again.

86
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:42,950
That's…

87
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,610
[Rule with Virtue]

88
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,040
The study is four meters wide,

89
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,659
five meters long.

90
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,700
It's just a normal study.

91
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,380
Judging from the echo, the wall is about half a meter thick.

92
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,580
I don't think there's a secret room behind the wall.

93
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,850
So weird.

94
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,110
It's not in the study.

95
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,020
It's not in the bedroom either.

96
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,160
Where could it be?

97
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,490
Oh no, it's going to rain.

98
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,370
Jiang Chaoxi will come back soon.

99
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,690
There was no sign of rain.

100
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,900
I didn't even have time to find shelter.

101
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,460
Old books written by grave robbers

102
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,460
said that when rain hits the surface of a hidden chamber,

103
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,450
it sounds like hitting a bronze bell.

104
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,220
Is this fake boulder hollow?

105
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,840
Has Jiang Chaoxi built

106
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,030
the secret room here?

107
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:45,980
Young Master.

108
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,420
What are you doing here?

109
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,950
I'm listening to the rain.

110
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:51,900
Yeah.

111
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,010
I'm listening to the rain.

112
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,220
Listen to the rain?

113
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:54,940
Listen to the rain?

114
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,600
What's interesting about that?

115
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,540
The rain tells stories.

116
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,290
Close your eyes and listen carefully.

117
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,710
Rain falls on the grass,

118
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,560
on the leaves,

119
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,960
and hits the stone wall.

120
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,430
Listen to the lashing rain.

121
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:14,620
It somehow

122
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,020
makes me nervous.

123
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,810
It's said that long long ago,

124
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,240
our ancestors

125
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,620
hunted for a living.

126
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,260
When it rained,

127
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,220
they couldn't go out to hunt.

128
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,340
They got nervous for fear of running out of food.

129
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,190
That instinctive feeling

130
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,850
has been passed down.

131
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:32,730
Therefore,

132
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,690
when we hear the sound of rain,

133
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,789
our hearts

134
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,460
will beat fast for no reason.

135
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,100
Our breath will become uneven.

136
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,950
It just feels like

137
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,630
something good happens

138
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,460
or you meet the one you love.

139
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,180
Young Master,

140
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,010
listening to the rain makes you flush.

141
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,900
Hope it's not because you've caught a cold.

142
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,780
I've flushed?

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,570
I must have caught a cold.

144
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,180
Enough.

145
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,300
Cut the crap.

146
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,260
We can't do the construction without you.

147
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,100
If you catch a cold,

148
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,310
I'll have to find a new surveyor.

149
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,500
Come out.

150
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,300
Take it

151
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:14,370
♫I was once lonely. Whose heart have I broken?♫

152
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,950
♫I pray for the chance to make it up♫

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,930

154

♫Sorry that I failed to keep my promise♫

156
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,380
Greetings, Mother.

157
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,220
Rise.

158
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,310
Thank you, Mother.

159
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,900
I heard that Xi'er has been unwell lately.

160
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,480
You helped him get better?

161
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,660
Mother,

162
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,200
Young Master was bitten by toxic insects by chance.

163
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:20,940
It was not serious.

164
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,180
I just

165
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,390
prescribed detoxifying medicine

166
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,340
for Young Master.

167
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,340
Ansu,

168
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,110
go to the depository

169
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,370
and select something

170
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,510
as the reward to Lady Mo.

171
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,860
Yes, Madam.

172
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,710
Thank you, Madam.

173
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,990
Thank you, Mother.

174
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:47,820
All right.

175
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,450
I need to take a nap.

176
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,790
You two can leave now.

177
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,100
Yes.

178
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,890
Xian'er, why are you unhappy?

179
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,710
We rarely got rewarded

180
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,620
by Her Ladyship.

181
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,790
She gave us something

182
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,570
she didn't want

183
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,060
and called it a reward.

184
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,260
Watch your tongue.

185
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,580
Whatever the reward is,

186
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,240
it means Her Ladyship's appreciation.

187
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,620
We'd be in trouble

188
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
if someone had overheard you.

189
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:27,930
I know.

190
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,940
You're right.

191
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,510
I shouldn't have said that.

192
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,060
Xian'er,

193
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,760
tell me the truth.

194
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,650
Young Master asked you to treat him.

195
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,990
The insect that bit him

196
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,890
wasn't of a normal kind, right?

197
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,060
Right.

198
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,620
Someone wanted Young Master dead.

199
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,780
Then...

200
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:48,440
Don't worry.

201
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,100
I've cured Young Master.

202
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,660
Silly.

203
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,770
I'm not worried about Young Master.

204
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,110
I'm worried about you.

205
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,720
You are my everything.

206
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,620
It's a great thing

207
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,260
that you cured Young Master.

208
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,060
But if you had failed,

209
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,080
Her Ladyship wouldn't be easy on you.

210
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,450
I was just a maid

211
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,990
but won the favor with Master.

212
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,580
Her Ladyship picks on me very often.

213
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,870
I just hope you can

214
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,780
marry a woman from an ordinary family

215
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,150
and live a safe and healthy life.

216
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,780
Mom,

217
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,190
don't think too much.

218
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,670
Being your son

219
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,550
is the happiest thing

220
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,470
in my life.

221
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,480
How is the situation in the city?

222
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,720
Not good.

223
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,420
The rain is too heavy.

224
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,980
The whole city is in water.

225
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,140
Every street is waterlogged.

226
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,790
The city is in a total mess now.

227
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,550
Several buildings collapsed

228
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
and many people got hurt.

229
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,040
The situation has gone so bad

230
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,010
before the rainy season starts.

231
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,250
If we don't build the drainage

232
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,390
as soon as possible,

233
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,060
such tragedies

234
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,220
will happen again.

235
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,950
But the Chairman is firmly against it

236
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,180
because he hates to give Commander Xiao an opportunity

237
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,150
to rake in money.

238
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,680
The Chairman knows

239
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,320
how greedy Commander Xiao is.

240
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,260
The Chairman should look at the bigger picture.

241
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,860
Our people are in hot water.

242
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,790
He is a good official

243
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,990
but he's too stubborn.

244
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,020
In my opinion,

245
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,870
we should let him experience

246
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,660
the plight of the people.

247
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,400
You have a good idea for once.

248
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,550
Experience the plight of the people.

249
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,940
[Construction ahead. Take a detour.]

250
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:26,980
My lord,

251
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,660
the road ahead is under construction.

252
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,580
We need to take a detour.

253
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,780
Construction?

254
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,980
It was fine last night.

255
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,620
Forget it.

256
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,070
Let's take a detour.

257
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,310
Hurry up.

258
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,380
I can't be late for the meeting.

259
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,040
[Construction ahead. Take a detour.]

260
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,340
Hurry up.

261
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,140
Give me a hand.

262
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,970
Why is it still raining?

263
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:10,540
Yeah.

264
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:12,630
Let's go.

265
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,490
Hurry up.

266
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,300
Be careful.

267
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,570
What's wrong?

268
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,530
Why did we stop again?

269
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:19,900
Help me get down.

270
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,340
Be careful.

271
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,150
What happened

272
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,020
to this place?

273
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,730
My lord,

274
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,060
the rain has been too heavy these days.

275
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,890
The water has no way out.

276
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,130
Many houses

277
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,940
collapsed in water.

278
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,880
When will such unbearable life

279
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,060
come to an end?

280
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,330
Stop complaining.

281
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,020
We are not dignitaries

282
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,970
who can do something about it.

283
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,300
Let's go check it out.

284
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:51,540
My lord!

285
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,780
My lord.

286
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,580
My back!

287
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,710
My lord.

288
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,370
My back!

289
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,530
I sprained my back.

290
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,920
My waist is not good.

291
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,740
This...

292
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,620
Look at how well you've done this!

293
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,230
It hurts.

294
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,099
There are many ways

295
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,270
to achieve the goal,

296
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,260
but you chose the dumbest one.

297
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,109
Now things are far from good.

298
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,319
He fell down

299
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,040
and he is completely bedridden now.

300
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,700
My ear!

301
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,200
I didn't mean it.

302
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,190
Who knew that the Chairman

303
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,430
would go to the fields and wade into the water in person?

304
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,660
What a stubborn old man!

305
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,250
He is indeed stubborn.

306
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,900
Right?

307
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,050
Don't digress!

308
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,970
I'm talking about you.

309
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,940
You always do things recklessly.

310
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,720
How can I

311
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,910
rest assured

312
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,620
to hand Cangyue City over to you?

313
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,470
You can also give it to my third brother.

314
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,460
He is more suitable

315
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,160
for the position of Young Master.

316
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,680
Nonsense!

317
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,710
Every time I scold you,

318
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,830
why do you say this

319
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,700
all the time?

320
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,570
No.

321
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,770
You'll piss me off sooner or later.

322
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,720
Xi'er.

323
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,320
I'm saying this for your own good.

324
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,480
You need to be careful now.

325
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,830
If anything untoward

326
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,670
should happen

327
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,540
to the Chairman,

328
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,550
no one will suppress Xiao Huasheng

329
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,660
in the future.

330
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,940
Who will suffer in the end?

331
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,660
It's you!

332
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,050
Yes.

333
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,570
I got it.

334
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,710
All right, Father.

335
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,740
Don't be angry.

336
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,020
From now on,

337
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,740
I will treat the Chairman well.

338
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,460
I swear.

339
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,110
Enough. Enough.

340
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,380
You're not young anymore.

341
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,260
Think about it.

342
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,100
We have a gentleman agreement.

343
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,120
Everyone has to keep this promise.

344
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,710
If you don't,

345
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,620
don't blame me for bringing up the wedding.

346
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,010
By then,

347
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,480
you have to

348
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,630
marry both Nangong Siyan

349
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,460
and Xiao Fengyi.

350
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,140
I was wrong.

351
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,620
I'm sorry.

352
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,930
I'm going to see him now

353
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,940
and apologize to him.

354
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,550
You have to listen to me later on.

355
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,900
Don't always be so...

356
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,120
I'm not done yet.

357
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,780
You...

358
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,840
Is that how you do things?

359
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,780
You just watched him get hurt,

360
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,060
right?

361
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,890
I'm innocent.

362
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,190
I wanted to send two people

363
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,130
to stimulate him.

364
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,510
But I overdid it.

365
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,170
But don't worry.

366
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,410
I've sent someone to inquire.

367
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,980
The Chairman is fine.

368
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,870
He just needs to rest for a few days.

369
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,760
After all, it was me who was thoughtless.

370
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,280
And my father's health

371
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,580
is really getting worse.

372
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,500
I was thinking

373
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,780
why that old man didn't

374
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,720
go to the meeting hall.

375
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,970
He fell and hurt himself!

376
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,010
Nice!

377
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,930
Nice!

378
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,380
Xi'er did this to my liking.

379
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,290
According to the physician,

380
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,430
although his injury is not serious,

381
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,770
the Chairman is old

382
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,580
and needs to rest in bed for a few days.

383
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,580
Why didn't he fall to death?

384
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,890
Now no one is going against me.

385
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,630
At least

386
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,460
I can stay undisturbed for some time.

387
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,870
There's also one less person against me

388
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,010
in the meeting hall.

389
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,790
It seems that I wronged Xi'er before.

390
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,700
Xi'er didn't go against me.

391
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,920
He was just naughty.

392
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,320
How about this?

393
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:43,970
Later,

394
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,520
go

395
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,740
and get some fine tiger bone meal

396
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,520
and send it to

397
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:49,940
Nangong Shi.

398
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,330
By the way, pass on my message

399
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,570
to let that old man rest at home.

400
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,800
Don't wander around.

401
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,140
Leave the rest

402
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,870
to me.

403
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,440
Yes, Master.

404
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,590
Xiao Huasheng!

405
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,770
How dare you hurt Xi'er!

406
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,610
How dare you!

407
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:16,580
Does he really think

408
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,700
I can't do anything to him?

409
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,390
Commander Xiao

410
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,370
went too far this time.

411
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,120
Luckily, Young Master

412
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,870
was treated in time.

413
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,700
Even if such a big thing happened,

414
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,520
he didn't tell me.

415
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,850
When did the gap between us

416
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,980
become so deep?

417
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,540
I guess

418
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,490
Young Master didn't want

419
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,470
to make you worry.

420
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,780
What?

421
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,750
He didn't want me to worry?

422
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,840
All these years,

423
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,070
which of the things he did

424
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,300
was not ridiculous

425
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,490
and annoying?

426
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,840
Commander Xiao is watching so closely.

427
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,460
Young Master acts like a dandy

428
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,270
probably because

429
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,990
he doesn't want to show off

430
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,980
in front of Commander Xiao.

431
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,050
What do you mean?

432
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,750
According to my observation

433
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,690
in Young Master's Mansion,

434
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,170
Young Master may seem to be a dandy,

435
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,110
but he is actually very carful

436
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,150
and prudent.

437
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,270
Although it is Young Master's thoughtlessness

438
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,540
that led to the Chairman's accidental injury,

439
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,540
it's also because he cares about the people.

440
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,650
Xi'er has shown his outstanding ability to govern the city

441
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,930
since he was young.

442
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,950
His brothers

443
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,740
are not in his league.

444
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,350
But I don't understand

445
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,830
why he became more rebellious

446
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
as he grew up.

447
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,500
If what you said is true,

448
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,020
then his perverse behaviors

449
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,990
may be fake.

450
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,300
I was just guessing.

451
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,450
You've been with him for so long.

452
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,610
Did you find anything?

453
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,800
Did you find out

454
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,540
why he suddenly

455
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,740
became like this?

456
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,620
Young Master knows I'm your man

457
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,870
and has been on guard against me.

458
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,330
Although I noticed

459
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,140
something was wrong with Young Master,

460
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,560
I haven't found

461
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,840
any specific evidence.

462
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:20,690
No matter what,

463
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,520
take good care of Xi'er.

464
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,310
Don't let anyone

465
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,890
do anything

466
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,710
in his daily life.

467
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,780
If anything goes wrong again,

468
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,540
I'll punish you.

469
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

470
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,310
Look.

471
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,140
Xiao Huasheng

472
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,400
did it on purpose.

473
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,940
He wanted to take advantage of my injury

474
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,280
to arrogate all the power to himself.

475
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,070
I won't do what he wants.

476
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,610
Come here.

477
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,180
Help me up.

478
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,100
I'm going to the meeting hall.

479
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,150
My back.

480
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,310
My back.

481
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,440
-My back. -Grandpa.

482
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,010
Don't get angry.

483
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,350
Let's put aside

484
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,560
the matters in the meeting hall.

485
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,280
Grandpa,

486
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,140
don't blame me for talking too much.

487
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,660
Building culverts for the sewage system

488
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,290
may be a good thing

489
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,940
for Cangyue.

490
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,190
At least,

491
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,380
the people won't be afraid

492
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,140
of the heavy rain anymore.

493
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,500
As the Chairman,

494
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,490
you got injured because of this.

495
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,500
The inconvenience of the people can be seen from this.

496
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,690
Cangyue

497
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,090
has just been stable for less than ten years.

498
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,790
The people are recuperating

499
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,950
and taxes to the people are reduced.

500
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,790
Our treasury is indeed empty.

501
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,260
Once I nod,

502
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,860
how much silver

503
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,860
will Xiao Huasheng

504
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,960
take this opportunity to embezzle?

505
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
But isn't Chief Inspector the Young Master?

506
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,900
Grandpa,

507
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,180
you should trust him once.

508
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,350
Maybe

509
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,740
he will behave differently.

510
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,090
It's better than that he has nowhere to show

511
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,750
and can only rely on Commander Xiao.

512
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,890
Don't mention him.

513
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,470
Both of them

514
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,200
collude with each other.

515
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,300
They are of the same batch.

516
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:14,660
Chairman.

517
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,020
Chairman.

518
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,700
I'm here to see you.

519
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:20,940
Young Master.

520
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,070
Young Master.

521
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,130
Chairman!

522
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,020
After all this,

523
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,740
you still want to bow?

524
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,890
You're hurting my heart.

525
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:31,540
You...

526
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,910
Slow down.

527
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,130
Young Master, you...

528
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,840
Chairman.

529
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,190
Actually, what happened today

530
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,500
is not what I wanted.

531
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,250
I wanted to show you

532
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,190
the suffering of the people.

533
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,530
Who knows

534
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,060
you would experience it yourself

535
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,880
for the people?

536
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,600
Now

537
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,460
you can only lie on the bed.

538
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,590
This...

539
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,290
This is...

540
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:53,330
You...

541
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:56,540
However,

542
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,970
I admire your righteousness.

543
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,450
No.

544
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,990
I've never seen a person

545
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,470
who did something bad

546
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,650
and came to the door

547
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,230
to admit it like you.

548
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,460
Honesty!

549
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,300
Being honest

550
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,110
is indeed my biggest advantage.

551
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,260
But this time,

552
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,360
it's not entirely my fault.

553
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,890
Think about it.

554
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,470
I finally made up my mind

555
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,580
to do a good job.

556
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,310
I wanted to build a new image

557
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,270
in the hearts of my father

558
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,560
and the people.

559
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,270
I didn't expect

560
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,540
that the first blocker

561
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,800
was not my uncle,

562
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,320
but you who were devoted to the people.

563
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,510
No.

564
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,700
This...

565
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,570
So,

566
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,860
I did something wrong?

567
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,260
You're right.

568
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,680
No, you...

569
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,350
But it's not entirely your fault.

570
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,410
My uncle has

571
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,550
an inescapable responsibility.

572
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,360
His greed

573
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,140
caused your caution.

574
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,030
But we can't waste food because of choking.

575
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:55,960
Then you should

576
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,820
tell me the truth.

577
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,950
Yes.

578
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,480
I do want to tell you.

579
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,670
But in your mind,

580
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,900
my image has been fixed.

581
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,170
If I told you,

582
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,090
you would suspect my uncle and I

583
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,260
would work together to set you up.

584
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,190
We would collude with each other.

585
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,160
No.

586
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,000
I...

587
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,140
Alright, Chairman.

588
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,270
Don't be angry this time.

589
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:17,970
Don't be angry.

590
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,190
We're doing this for the people.

591
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,490
What about

592
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,900
thinking about the culvert again?

593
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,380
Through this incident,

594
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,360
you can understand my purpose

595
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,460
and good character.

596
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,300
If you don't understand,

597
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,670
find out the reason from yourself.

598
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,660
I'm leaving.

599
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,740
Take care of yourself.

600
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,550
I...

601
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,580
I...

602
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,100
[Nangong's Mansion]

603
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,480
Miss.

604
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,460
Mr. Xian

605
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,390
sent this bag of medicine.

606
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,890
He said it was specially made

607
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,860
for Master's waist injury.

608
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,160
Where is he?

609
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,600
He left after giving me the medicine.

610
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,720
Siyan.

611
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,320
You're quite serious.

612
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,520
Nice!

613
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,180
I have

614
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,920
good news.

615
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,350
Nangong Shi has agreed

616
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,490
to build the drainage project.

617
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,580
Pack up.

618
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
Let's go to the field.

619
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,430
Really?

620
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,220
In this way,

621
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,430
the people will no longer

622
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,220
suffer from floods anymore.

623
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,830
Let's go now.

624
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,230
The sun is bright today.

625
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,520
It's a good time for young men and women

626
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,790
to meet romantically.

627
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,830
How about

628
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,730
I ask Xiao Fengyi out

629
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,400
to get them together?

630
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,100
I can get a reward.

631
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,380
How will you build it?

632
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,390
The drawing

633
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,130
is clearly drawn.

634
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,550
Are you stupid?

635
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,030
Hurry.

636
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,220
This way.

637
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,760
Hurry up, you hear me?

638
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,560
This way.

639
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,110
Yes.

640
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,170
I think

641
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,030
this place is in order.

642
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,870
The craftsmen have their own duties.

643
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:35,990
That's right.

644
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,540
I think,

645
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,950
without the supervisors,

646
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,160
maybe the progress

647
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,950
will be faster.

648
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,980
Everyone has his own position.

649
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,110
The craftsmen know skills.

650
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,620
They have their own unique skills.

651
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,060
And the supervisors

652
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,060
are holding

653
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,260
the standard and process.

654
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,220
You should know

655
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,310
that at the construction site,

656
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,790
if the supervisors want to supervise the construction,

657
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,060
lead the craftsmen and command the project,

658
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,840
the cooperation between these two is essential.

659
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,450
Lean them together. Hurry.

660
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,990
Keep working over there.

661
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,620
Understand?

662
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,000
Good.

663
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,830
Good.

664
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,260
The construction size is fine.

665
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,950
I've been curious about one thing.

666
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,610
Why can you tell this size

667
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,220
without using a ruler?

668
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,860
Nothing

669
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,190
but familiar.

670
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,780
Good!

671
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,790
No wonder you even know

672
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,440
the size of my mouth.

673
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,120
Tell me.

674
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,310
What other skills do you have

675
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,460
that I don't know?
