00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,370
You're not the only one.

175
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,060
I think everyone around me

176
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,960
envies me

177
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,300
for having someone as intelligent

178
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:51,970
as Yunxi.

179
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,970
The most exceptional thing

180
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,800
is your loyal affection

181
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,860
for Yunxi.

182
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,300
Of course.

183
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,980
She's my lady.

184
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,250
Who else can I dote on?

185
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,720
How can I make her envy others?

186
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,460
Young Master,

187
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,860
I think the face

188
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,360
can be rounder,

189
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,840
the shoulders wider,

190
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,250
and the mouth

191
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,590
can be longer.

192
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,390
Yunxi.

193
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,240
You are back.

194
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,400
Why do you smell like alcohol?

195
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,420
Did you drink?

196
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:47,960
Miss Nangong.

197
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,700
I have something to tell you.

198
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,700
What...

199
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,320
what's with the change in temperament?

200
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,960
Miss Nangong,

201
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,180
I just came back

202
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,900
from Dr. Xian's clinic.

203
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,840
He's having a hard time right now.

204
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,670
What about how I feel?

205
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,150
He abandoned me so many times.

206
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,260
Every time he had a choice,

207
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,110
he would choose to

208
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,450
abandon me without hesitation.

209
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,790
I just hope

210
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,980
you don't miss the chance

211
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,730
with the right person.

212
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,460
Maybe we weren't

213
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,520
meant to be together

214
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,510
at all.

215
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,710
Are you thinking about me?

216
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,080
Young Master, I'm working.

217
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,440
Please don't disturb me.

218
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,290
What's wrong?

219
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,710
Why are you so unhappy

220
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,760
to see me?

221
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:55,800
Young Master.

222
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,380
Young Master.

223
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,220
Normally, when a woman suddenly becomes hostile,

224
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,050
it is likely because she's jealous.

225
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,420
Jealous?

226
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,940
I didn't do anything.

227
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,900
Don't tell me you are jealous of

228
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,080
my relationship with Nangong Siyan?

229
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,660
Zhu Wen.

230
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,580
Young Master.

231
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,820
Yunxi seems to want something sour today.

232
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,230
Order the kitchen

233
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,640
to add some dishes today.

234
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,180
Vinegar spinach,

235
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,300
vinegar peanuts,

236
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,420
and vinegar jellyfish.

237
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,180
Childish.

238
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,760
Silly girl.

239
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,430
Actually Nangong Siyan

240
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,500
was helping me make this

241
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,480
secretly.

242
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,660
A mini Young Master.

243
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,570
I know you can't stand not being around me for even a moment.

244
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,940
I'm worried

245
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,500
I can't be with you when you miss me,

246
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,730
so I made this.

247
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:05,990
It will accompany you for me.

248
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,780
Take it away. I don't want it.

249
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,120
All right, don't be angry.

250
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,300
Please don't be angry.

251
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,270
I said I don't want it.

252
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,160
You're so annoying.

253
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,530
I didn't do anything wrong.

254
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,480
Why is she like that?

255
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,130
Jiang Chaoxi.

256
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,010
If you don't love me anymore,

257
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,750
your heart won't be broken.

258
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,070
So I'd rather you stop loving me.

259
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,680
Stop right there!

260
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,140
What are you angry about?

261
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,460
What did I do wrong?

262
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,950
I'm not angry.

263
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,340
You're not angry?

264
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,670
Fine.

265
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,700
Look me in the eyes

266
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,570
affectionately,

267
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,590
like you used to.

268
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,710
Jiang Chaoxi.

269
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,930
Can you stop being so childish?

270
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,000
What did I do?

271
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,610
Does seeing me upset you this much?

272
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:47,930
Don't I have

273
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,680
the right to

274
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,140
not want to see you?

275
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:49,740
No.

276
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,820
As the Chief Planner for the city's construction,

277
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,220
you need to show

278
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,310
professionalism and a sense of responsibility.

279
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,080
From now on,

280
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,580
you're not allowed to be apart from me,

281
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,400
not even an inch,

282
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,230
as we go meet

283
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,060
the Cultural Envoys from Ankang City.

284
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,350
[Planning Room]

285
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,540
The Cultural Envoys from Ankang City have arrived.

286
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,960
Greetings, Young Master.

287
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,960
Greetings, Young Master.

288
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,260
Yun'er.

289
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,500
Here.

290
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,150
Hexuan.

291
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,520
Don't move.

292
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,990
There seems to be

293
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,170
something dirty on your face.

294
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,250
-Come here. -Where?

295
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,340
Is it all gone?

296
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,170
A little bit more here.

297
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,990
Brother's face is painted like a cat.

298
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:10,690
Childish.

299
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,300
Come here.

300
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:15,760
Stop it.

301
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,700
You'd better come here.

302
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,790
Come here!

303
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,770
It's Brother Fusheng.

304
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,130
Lord Chu is famous and talented.

305
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,520
I've heard your legendary name.

306
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:24,810
Please pardon me for

307
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,960
the lack of a grand welcome.

308
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,060
You're too courteous.

309
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,550
It is my great honor

310
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,290
to be received by Young Master

311
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,480
during my visit here.

312
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,890
Who is this lady?

313
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,590
I'm Yunxi,

314
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,310
the Chief Planner of city construction

315
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,070
in Cangyue.

316
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,280
I'm Wuyan, the First Guard of Cangyue.

317
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,980
You hired a woman as a planner.

318
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,770
Cangyue is really open-minded

319
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,750
and progressive.

320
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,770
Looks like Brother Fusheng

321
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,150
doesn't recognize me.

322
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,680
Lord Chu,

323
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,060
please come in.

324
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,370
Let's go.

325
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,170
Why are you looking at him like that?

326
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,700
How dare you look at others

327
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,900
like that in front of me?

328
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,100
What's going on?

329
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,580
What's the matter?

330
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,580
Look.

331
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,100
What?

332
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,740
Why are they all the same?

333
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,000
These too.

334
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:32,850
Look at this.

335
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,300
It's the same.

336
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,480
I heard that the construction of Cangyue City

337
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,270
is excellent.

338
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,340
You really deserve that reputation.

339
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,390
These models and maps

340
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,290
are astonishing.

341
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,880
I wonder who made it.

342
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,190
Lord Chu, you have good taste.

343
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,230
The blueprints you see

344
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,500
all come from our Chief Planner,

345
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,630
Yunxi.

346
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,670
Lord Chu.

347
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,220
Look.

348
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,850
It's fine if you just

349
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,600
look at these drawings.

350
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,570
Why are you

351
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,000
staring at our Chief Planner?

352
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,240
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

353
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,530
Miss Yunxi is talented

354
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,360
and beautiful.

355
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,220
I was

356
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,960
a little smitten.

357
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,970
You...

358
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,340
Lord Chu,

359
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,000
you'd better focus on the cultural exchange.

360
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,590
Don't be distracted.

361
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,140
Take a closer look.

362
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,130
The patterns of the eaves gallery on the model

363
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,670
are similar to the safeness patterns

364
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,210
of our Ankang City.

365
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,520
Are they imitating us?

366
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,550
How is this yours?

367
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,550
This is the design of Luo Daoan,

368
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,310
the former Director of the Planning Department.

369
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,130
How is this yours?

370
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,010
Luo Daoan?

371
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,490
No wonder.

372
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,300
It is said that his ancestral home

373
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,530
is in Ankang.

374
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,740
His design is inevitably influenced

375
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,180
by Ankang culture.

376
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,320
Not only buildings.

377
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,820
Since I arrived in Cangyue City,

378
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,250
their living style that I've seen

379
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,590
is heavily reminiscent of

380
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,560
of Ankang culture.

381
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,920
How is that possible?

382
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,670
For example,

383
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,850
people here

384
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,310
like pickled food.

385
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,500
We also have pickles too.

386
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,810
They're obviously imitating us.

387
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,230
Who doesn't like pickles?

388
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,320
Who doesn't?

389
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,550
You might as well say

390
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,700
Cangyue belongs to Ankang.

391
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,750
It's possible.

392
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,370
Possible?

393
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,770
Are you looking for trouble?

394
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,750
How can that be possible?

395
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,340
These all are Cangyue's.

396
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,960
Food and culture

397
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,110
know no boundaries.

398
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,130
There's no need for us to draw the boundary.

399
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,500
As long as it is a way to benefit the people,

400
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,910
we can share and learn from each other.

401
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,860
We seldom come to Cangyue.

402
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,460
Looking at these molds alone

403
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,740
is not enough to know

404
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,250
the essence of their construction.

405
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,120
I wonder if Miss Yunxi

406
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,820
could show us

407
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,660
around?

408
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,490
Of course.

409
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,700
The buildings in the Young Master's Mansion

410
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,520
are very unique.

411
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,760
It's inconvenient.

412
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,060
Do you think my mansion

413
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,050
is a tourist attraction

414
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,380
and can be visited freely?

415
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,140
The other places of Cangyue

416
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,060
are also very unique.

417
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,350
For example, the Frog Tower.

418
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,560
Use a stone to knock the tower,

419
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,090
and it will generate the sound of frogs.

420
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,820
If you are interested,

421
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,930
I can show you around there.

422
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,570
Sure.

423
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,380
Forget it.

424
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,470
I've thought about it.

425
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,080
The journey outside the city is long.

426
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,260
Lord Chu is a guest from afar.

427
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,000
You shouldn't be exhausted.

428
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,230
Let's visit my mansion.

429
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,030
The Young Master's Mansion is the typical building

430
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,810
of Cangyue City.

431
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,570
It uses pillars

432
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
and beam frames.

433
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,870
The parts of these buildings are mainly connected

434
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,380
by mortise and tenon joints.

435
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,180
Even without using

436
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,260
nails and other assisting tools,

437
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,950
the house will not fall down when the wall collapses.

438
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,440
The constructions of our city

439
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,250
are very particular in color.

440
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,370
We often use

441
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,440
some colorful patterns

442
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,520
to beautify the building.

443
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,090
I've learned a lot from this trip.

444
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,100
You are not inferior to men.

445
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,630
I'm impressed.

446
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,960
I'm flattered.

447
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,710
Young Master's Mansion is really suitable to live in.

448
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,310
Not only are the buildings magnificent,

449
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,170
but even these flowers

450
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,780
are blooming and flourishing.

451
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,850
If we use these flowers to make flower pastry,

452
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,020
it must be very sweet and delicious.

453
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,900
I can't help having food cravings again.

454
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,460
To be honest,

455
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,600
I had a brother in my family

456
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,420
who was good at making flower pastry.

457
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,420
I also had a sister

458
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,860
who really liked to eat flower pastry.

459
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,700
Unfortunately, we've been separated for years.

460
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,690
I've been looking for her for a long time,

461
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,520
but I haven't heard from her.

462
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,340
Life passes like a dream.

463
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,420
What's so good about flower pastry?

464
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,060
You are so superficial.

465
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,280
Miss Yunxi is knowledgeable.

466
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,430
I still have

467
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,360
a lot of architectural questions

468
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,150
to ask.

469
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,350
May I visit you

470
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
tomorrow?

471
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,620
Sure...

472
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,740
It's not convenient.

473
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,820
If you have any questions,

474
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,660
you can go to the Planning Department.

475
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,780
Business is business.

476
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,760
Lest people say I haven't made

477
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,750
a clear distinction between public and private interest.

478
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:18,930
Lord Chu.

479
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,510
I'm free.

480
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,780
You can come to me anytime.

481
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,550
Then, I'll

482
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,570
leave now.

483
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,860
See you tomorrow.

484
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,660
What do you mean?

485
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,630
Is he that attractive?

486
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,540
Your eyes were glued to him.

487
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,230
None of your business.

488
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,080
Yunxi.

489
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,650
Don't push it too far!

490
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,530
You're not allowed to see him again.

491
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,510
You wait here with eager expectancy.

492
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,770
Are you waiting

493
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,130
for Chu Yao?

494
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,350
So what?

495
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,020
What do you mean?

496
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,240
You were passionately in love with me the other day,

497
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,790
and now you've transferred your affection to a new one.

498
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,390
Miss Yunxi.

499
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,100
Lord Chu.

500
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,130
Young Master is here too.

501
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,360
I can go with Lord...

502
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,540
I can go with Lord Chu.

503
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,480
We won't bother you, Young Master.

504
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,850
Lord Chu,

505
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,460
this way, please.

506
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,590
How capricious.

507
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,120
Your attitude changed so quickly.

508
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,100
When Chu Yao leaves,

509
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,140
I'll teach you a lesson.

510
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,550
Why should I listen to you?

511
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,720
I'll follow you.

512
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,070
Who are you to decide if I'm bothered or not?

513
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,570
If I listened to all your wishes,

514
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,480
I would lose my authority.

515
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,580
You are an important guest.

516
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,980
I can't be disrespectful.

517
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,430
Young Master.

518
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:50,820
Let me do it.

519
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,090
You're too courteous, Young Master.

520
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,620
Thank you.

521
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,820
No need to be awkward.

522
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,470
You guys continue. Don't mind me.

523
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,710
I'll be here

524
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,620
to serve you two.

525
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,530
I won't disturb you.

526
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,460
The water is sweet.

527
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,910
The tea is green.

528
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,660
It must be the fresh Longjing Tea

529
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,210
picked before Grain Rain.

530
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,880
Not bad.

531
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,730
You have good taste.

532
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,120
Young Master,

533
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,360
please.

534
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:37,900
Are you all right, Young Master?

535
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,280
I am so clumsy.

536
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,070
I'm sorry. Did this tea burn you?

537
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,580
Why don't you go back and change your clothes?

538
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,200
It's fine.

539
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,270
I can cool down.

540
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,350
Cool down.

541
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,680
Young Master,

542
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,330
I'd better take you back

543
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,250
to change your clothes.

544
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,910
Little girl.

545
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,150
Brother Fusheng.

546
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,050
You're still as cute as

547
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,130
when you were a kid.

548
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,100
What are you doing?

549
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,810
I finally caught you.

550
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,070
No more pretending, right?

551
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,930
You're just a playboy,

552
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,860
not the envoy from Ankang City.

553
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,700
Today,

554
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,350
-I must teach you a lesson. -Young Master, you misunderstood.

555
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,300
What misunderstanding?

556
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,860
In broad daylight,

557
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,650
I saw it with my own eyes.

558
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,060
You were throwing yourself at him.

559
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,780
I accidentally fell down.

560
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,880
Lord Chu just helped me.

561
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,270
Fell down?

562
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,140
You surveyors even fall

563
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,420
with such precision.

564
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,100
You fell straight into his arms.

565
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,860
I fell into your arms like this

566
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,000
before, too.

567
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,010
I'm different from other men.

568
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,610
You misunderstood me.

569
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,720
I'm sorry.

570
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,950
But let me say something.

571
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,640
Women will not like

572
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,480
petty men.

573
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,920
It's better than

574
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,050
a libertine like you.

575
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,480
Such a playboy.

576
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,420
It seems that

577
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,790
I should not be here under this circumstance.

578
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,500
I'll leave now.

579
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,680
Little girl,

580
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,870
see you next time.

581
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,380
What did he call you just now?

582
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,220
Little girl?

583
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,770
You guys

584
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,920
are that close already?

585
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,170
Stay out of my business.

586
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,260
I can't.

587
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,870
Listen.

588
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,220
Don't go to him.

589
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,110
You are not allowed to go out

590
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,140
until you finish your work.

591
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,920
Young Master, have some green tea

592
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,660
to relieve your internal heat.

593
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,500
Green tea?

594
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,010
I am cuckolded!

595
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:22,930
Yunxi

596
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,480
has gone too far.

597
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,150
Because I am deeply obsessed

598
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,140
with her,

599
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,550
she acts unscrupulously.

600
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,910
Even in front of me,

601
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,990
she dares to do this with others.

602
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,050
Tell me,

603
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,890
what should I do?

604
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,820
Young Master.

605
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,970
Since ancient times, between men and women,

606
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,630
those who express their feelings first

607
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,540
will get hurt easier

608
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,020
because of their devotion.

609
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,270
Then I swear to God.

610
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,590
I'll never love anyone again。

611
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,220
I'll be myself again.

612
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,550
Young Master,

613
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,330
please think twice.

614
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,960
If God

615
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,180
really hears your wish

616
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,480
and fulfills it,

617
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,260
there will be no chance

618
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,220
between you and Miss Yunxi.

619
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,120
You're right.

620
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,690
Forget it.

621
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,040
Forget it.

622
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,100
Forget it.

623
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,710
I was too emotional.

624
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,030
Please bless the Young Master.

625
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,890
Please bless him.

626
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,900
Actually, I thought about it again.

627
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,060
Yunxi

628
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,830
didn't mean to throw herself in his arms.

629
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,290
It must be Chu Yao's fault.

630
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,820
Besides,

631
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,300
I'm so magnanimous.

632
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,070
How could I lose my temper over such a trivial matter

633
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,230
with the woman I love?

634
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,050
Right?

635
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,410
Let's have some tea.

636
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,330
Not bad.

637
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,440
What a sunny day

638
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,710
with fresh breeze.

639
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,420
It's a good time to tour.

640
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,920
I

641
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
happen to be free today.

642
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,390
I wonder who will have the honor

643
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,000
of going out with me today.

644
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,600
Yunxi, what are you doing?

645
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,830
Don't you hear me?

646
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,460
Yes.

647
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,020
Didn't you tell me

648
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,320
I couldn't go out before I finish my work?

649
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,250
For the sake of your hard work,

650
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,570
you can have a rest today.

651
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,100
You are allowed to take half a day off

652
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:57,800
and go out.

653
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Thank you, Young Master.

654
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,830
You don't have to dress up

655
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,730
to go out with me.

656
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,850
Let's just go.

657
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,790
Who says I'm going out with you?

658
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,470
Who else can you go with?

659
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,580
You want to see Chu Yao again?

660
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,220
So what?

661
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,520
It has nothing to do with you.

662
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,680
You've only met once.

663
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,810
But you miss him so much.

664
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,560
It seems that these people from Ankang

665
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,310
not only want

666
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,740
our history and culture,

667
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,290
but also our women.

668
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,440
Young Master.

669
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,510
I'm free to meet who I want to meet.

670
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,440
Then what about the relationship between us?

671
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,630
Don't come back if you leave.
