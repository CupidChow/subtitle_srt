[Episode 18]

4
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,580
Miss, that's enough. The luggage is too heavy.

5
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,970
Don't just stand around.

6
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,270
Quick! Go get

7
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,420
that pair of porcelain vases

8
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,030
and the silk cloth

9
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,910
my aunt gave me.

10
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,390
Get to work.

11
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,200
We need to rush to the Young Master's Mansion

12
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,470
and donate everything.

13
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,370
That's all I have.

14
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,220
Take them all.

15
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,530
Quick, help me.

16
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,130
Miss.

17
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,470
Do I have to go with you too?

18
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,430
Of course.

19
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:16,960
Well,

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,820
you won't also give me away

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,850
on impulse, right?

22
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,890
If you don't get to work right now,

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,720
I'll really give you away too.

24
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,350
If Lord finds out

25
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,930
I helped you empty the Xiao's Mansion,

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,079
he will

27
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,020
kill me.

28
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,570
Coward.

29
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,710
Have you learned nothing during your time with me?

30
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,300
Can't you learn

31
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,150
to be brave like me?

32
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,770
If you don't want to go,

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,780
I can handle this

34
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,500
perfectly

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,750
by myself.

36
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,360
I don't need anyone else.

37
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,780
Captain Tang.

38
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,950
Why are you here?

39
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,270
I'm here to organize the case files.

40
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,350
How can I bother you

41
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,540
with such a menial task?

42
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,420
Let me do it.

43
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,740
You're diligent and keep a low profile.

44
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,480
Captain Tang,

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,760
you have a bright future.

46
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,300
In the future,

47
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,510
I still need you to look out for me, Sir.

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,560
No problem.

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,240
But

50
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,060
storing all the completed case files here like this

51
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,940
keeps things organized.

52
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,270
If there are wrongful convictions in the future,

53
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,450
it'll be easier to investigate.

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,360
The supervision guards

55
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,340
are very thoughtful.

56
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,530
Let me tell you.

57
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,280
You're too naive.

58
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,700
The Archives Room

59
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,550
is not a place to investigate

60
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,710
wrongful convictions.

61
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,440
This is the place for Cangyue officials

62
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,740
to flaunt their achievements.

63
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,290
There is not a single case file

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,510
of wrongful convictions.

65
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,060
Case files of wrongful convictions

66
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,630
have long been destroyed.

67
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,420
No wonder I couldn't find

68
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,070
any records of

69
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,010
the Luo family's massacre.

70
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,460
There must be something wrong with the case.

71
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,040
Captain Tang.

72
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,070
Bring it here.

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
This way.

74
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,140
This time, I'll prove it

75
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,130
to my cousin.

76
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,210
Then he'll have to learn from me

77
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,650
how to donate.

78
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,200
It's so heavy.

79
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,200
I'm so tired.

80
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,580
You scared me.

81
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,390
Watch where you're going!

82
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,100
Move!

83
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:46,970
What are you doing?

84
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,900
Stop right there! This is a robbery!

85
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,650
Rob...

86
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:51,960
robbery?

87
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,090
That...

88
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,409
that won't do.

89
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,580
Help!

90
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,220
Don't move!

91
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,140
Don't move!

92
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,540
Stop!

93
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,240
I was so scared.

94
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,060
Luckily you came.

95
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,780
I was praying for

96
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,680
my daddy and cousin to come and save me.

97
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,660
But none of them came.

98
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,340
I was so scared, Tang Qing.

99
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,610
All right.

100
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,630
No.

101
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,740
All right.

102
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,940
Why are you dressed so luxuriously?

103
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,470
You are asking to be robbed.

104
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,909
This is all to raise funds for the reconstruction of

105
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,740
Jianjia Alley.

106
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,130
Who knew I'd run into bad guys?

107
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,700
All right.

108
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,220
The bad guy has left.

109
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,220
I still have to patrol.

110
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,210
Go back now.

111
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,750
Don't tell me you think

112
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,950
patrolling is more important than me?

113
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,330
That's not what I meant,

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,880
Miss Fengyi.

115
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,350
I have so much treasure and jewelry with me.

116
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,780
It attracts too much attention.

117
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,330
What if I run into bad guys again?

118
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,950
You have to be responsible for me.

119
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,140
Escort me to the Young Master's Mansion.

120
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,390
Miss...

121
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,000
You're not allowed to refuse.

122
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,560
I will never forget

123
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,740
what I promised you.

124
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,500
But the current situation is complicated.

125
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,140
My mother is in a difficult situation.

126
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,930
If I'm gone too,

127
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,920
there will be

128
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,010
no one left to take care of her.

129
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,240
Siyan,

130
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,480
can you give me more time?

131
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
But things are unpredictable.

132
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,290
Who knows

133
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,560
what will happen next?

134
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,540
I've been feeling uneasy lately.

135
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,630
Don't worry.

136
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,070
My brother promised me.

137
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,600
He won't accept the marriage offer.

138
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,240
But Young Master

139
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,630
is also not free from the control of others.

140
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,580
At this point,

141
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm in a dilemma.

142
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,260
Because of me, you're always worried

143
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,240
and getting thinner every day.

144
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:10,930
Siyan,

145
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,170
I've let you down.

146
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,220
Don't say that.

147
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,050
I understand.

148
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,490
And I know that you truly love me.

149
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,880
But you need to take care of your mother.

150
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,780
Sometimes, you have to do things against your will.

151
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,550
There are many things in our relationship

152
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,550
that are beyond our control.

153
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,480
Don't be so pessimistic.

154
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,220
Eventually, all will be fine.

155
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,390
If things

156
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,340
don't go smoothly,

157
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,060
even if I have to give everything up,

158
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,340
I will elope with you.

159
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,290
Where are my treasures?

160
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,580
Where are my precious porcelain

161
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,310
and antique paintings?

162
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,420
It's...

163
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,090
Speak up!

164
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,100
It's Miss.

165
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,340
She took them to the Young Master's Mansion

166
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,140
to donate.

167
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,340
Donate?

168
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,410
Master, hold on.

169
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,700
This senseless girl.

170
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,650
I've been wise all my life.

171
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,240
How could I have raised

172
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,290
such a silly daughter?

173
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,670
I spent my whole life

174
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,780
collecting these antique paintings

175
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,580
and precious porcelain.

176
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,380
Yet she just gave them away without thought.

177
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,419
All right.

178
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,570
Leave.

179
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,610
Leave quickly.

180
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,990
Yes.

181
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,300
Luckily,

182
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,080
she didn't take the most important one.

183
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,720
I have to move it to another hiding place.

184
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,650
Come and have a look, my friends.

185
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,760
I have brought everything valuable

186
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,720
from the Xiao's Mansion.

187
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,020
I want to show you and my daddy

188
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,210
what is charity.

189
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,580
Cousin,

190
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,380
does uncle know about this?

191
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,250
No.

192
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,790
Why?

193
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,470
Are you going to stop me from donating?

194
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,030
No, no, no.

195
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,690
Well done.

196
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,420
Of course.

197
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,940
Look at my treasures.

198
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,580
They are all valuable.

199
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,270
One should not

200
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,640
be stingy with charity.

201
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,450
I went into the Supervision Army's Archives Room

202
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,380
and searched many times.

203
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,970
But I didn't find the Luo family's case file.

204
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,240
Since we can't find the case file there,

205
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,500
there must be something wrong with it.

206
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,130
Since we can't find any leads

207
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,900
from the Supervision Army,

208
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,680
we need to seek a breakthrough

209
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,340
at the Planning Department.

210
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,150
After all, my father was

211
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
the Director of the Planning Department.

212
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,130
There should be some leads there.

213
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:19,930
Let me investigate this.

214
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,620
Have you found the Swing Painting?

215
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,970
A few days ago,

216
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,380
the Young Master took me to Xiao's Mansion.

217
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,300
I took the chance to

218
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,400
get into Commander Xiao's study

219
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,710
and found a secret room.

220
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,300
But I almost got caught

221
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,530
before I could check it.

222
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,410
Tang Qing.

223
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,670
Tang Qing, where are you?

224
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,270
Qing.

225
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,610
You've been very close to

226
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,800
Fengyi recently.

227
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,040
Are

228
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,040
-the two of you... -No.

229
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:44,820
Stop talking nonsense.

230
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,650
I haven't said anything yet.

231
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:48,950
Fine.

232
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,670
Let's say that's nonsense.

233
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,330
Qing.

234
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,710
You're not young anymore.

235
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,740
You should think about getting married and settling down.

236
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,930
No...

237
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:58,840
Yunxi, you...

238
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,180
I'm leaving.

239
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:04,990
Bye.

240
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,790
That's enough.

241
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,180
You saved Fengyi,

242
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,930
so I must reward you handsomely.

243
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,300
Tell me.

244
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,390
What reward do you want?

245
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:29,860
It was nothing.

246
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,780
But

247
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,300
when she goes out in the future,

248
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,350
it'd be better for her

249
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,380
to have bodyguards.

250
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,990
I don't want bodyguards.

251
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,900
Having people follow me wherever I go

252
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,570
would be so annoying.

253
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,730
Tang Qing.

254
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,640
Why don't you be my bodyguard?

255
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,520
Thank you for valuing me.

256
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,080
But my ambition

257
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,830
lies in the Supervision Army,

258
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,260
where I'll build my career.

259
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,540
You can also build a career with me.

260
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,530
What do you want?

261
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,320
I'll ask my daddy to give it to you.

262
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,190
Right?

263
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,000
I will earn

264
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,620
what I want.

265
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,310
Listen to this.

266
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,060
This young man is so ambitious.

267
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,830
Fengyi,

268
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,660
don't make things difficult for him.

269
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,920
You want a good guard?

270
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:13,970
No problem.

271
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,350
I'll get you

272
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,020
a good one.

273
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,750
No.

274
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,420
Tang Qing.

275
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,470
If you don't want to be my guard,

276
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,900
then be my teacher.

277
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,950
Teach me KungFu.

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,280
Then I won't be afraid of bad guys anymore.

279
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:26,660
Father.

280
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,570
Tang Qing is great at KungFu.

281
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,180
Really?

282
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,860
But it depends on

283
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,360
whether he's willing or not.

284
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,560
Tang Qing, just say yes.

285
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,270
It won't waste your time

286
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,070
or delay your work.

287
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,990
You just need to

288
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,080
spend a little time

289
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,830
teaching me

290
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,950
every day.

291
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:52,620
Let's go.

292
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,120
No time to lose. Start teaching me now.

293
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,040
Miss.

294
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,420
Stop dawdling. Hurry up.

295
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,990
Keep an eye on Tang Qing.

296
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,110
-Refund! -Refund!

297
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,120
[Liaowu Mansion]

298
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,770
Refund!

299
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,200
-Pay up! -Pay up!

300
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,340
Everyone!

301
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:25,990
Everyone!

302
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,650
Please listen to me.

303
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,400
The Young Master is really not here today.

304
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,720
When he comes back,

305
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,560
he will give you an explanation.

306
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,140
Okay?

307
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,990
No.

308
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,150
Don't touch me.

309
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,400
Don't touch me.

310
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,820
You...

311
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:41,770
Step back!

312
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,670
You...

313
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,220
Stop touching me!

314
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,080
How dare you!

315
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,210
Wuyan, what should we do?

316
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
My clinic's entrance

317
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,700
is full of people demanding refunds.

318
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,980
I thought the Young Master's Mansion

319
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,590
would be better.

320
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,610
I didn't expect

321
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,290
the situation here to be worse.

322
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,710
Why don't we refund the money first?

323
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,150
We've spent all the money we raised

324
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,960
to build Futian Institution.

325
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,910
We don't have any money left.

326
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,500
Without refunds,

327
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,390
what else can we do?

328
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,540
You haven't figured out a solution yet?

329
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,780
Last time, you swore that

330
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,090
you'd overcome all obstacles.

331
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,000
Yes.

332
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,870
I was right.

333
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,160
We've overcome the last obstacle,

334
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,490
and now

335
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,640
we're onto the next.

336
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,250
I really want to beat some sense into you.

337
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Don't hit me.

338
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,150
This is not

339
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,220
without solutions.

340
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,080
How about I report about the charity fraud

341
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,110
to the Cangyue tabloids?

342
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,660
People would be enraged.

343
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,740
Then, let's see if they still dare to

344
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,250
-ask for more money... -This is mutual destruction.

345
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,520
Are you trying to

346
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,500
drag me into it too?

347
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,260
Brother.

348
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,020
As for me,

349
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,950
I wanted to

350
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,180
work well with you

351
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,830
and build a good reputation

352
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,540
among the people and the officials.

353
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,390
Then, Father will also

354
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,610
be impressed.

355
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,660
I didn't expect

356
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,940
to lose face

357
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,860
before even earning any money.

358
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,300
Chuxian.

359
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,250
Don't be anxious.

360
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,530
If we work together,

361
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,520
we can definitely turn things around.

362
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,360
It's okay, brother.

363
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,960
If I fail,

364
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll sell my clinic

365
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,500
and pay for some of the refunds.

366
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,980
Chuxian,

367
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,460
you can't sell the clinic.

368
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,170
You can earn more money

369
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,180
by taking in more female patients.

370
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,680
I heard that those noble women

371
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,650
pretended to be sick

372
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,200
and spent a fortune at your clinic,

373
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,180
just to spend more time with you.

374
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,050
I have an idea.

375
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,350
Look carefully.

376
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,650
So handsome.

377
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,280
Your turn.

378
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:51,710
My turn?

379
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,810
How?

380
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,020
This...

381
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,630
It's been two hours.

382
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,430
Yet you haven't learned a single move.

383
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,860
What did I do wrong?

384
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,640
This is how you practiced just now.

385
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,180
When did I?

386
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,540
I wasn't clumsy like that.

387
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,770
Teach me then.

388
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,500
Stand upright.

389
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:25,810
Your hand.

390
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,520
Hand.

391
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,340
My hand.

392
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,420
My hand.

393
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,960
Straighten your arm.

394
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:32,970
Straighten.

395
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,030
Kick.

396
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,160
The other leg.

397
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,680
What's wrong?

398
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,750
I-I-I'm fine.

399
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,390
I'm just too tired from practicing martial arts.

400
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:54,730
Your hand.

401
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,740
My hand.

402
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,050
Straighten it.

403
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,400
Open your shoulders.

404
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,710
Straighten your arm.

405
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,530
Make a fist.

406
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,829
Open up your shoulders.

407
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:17,869
Tang Qing.

408
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,400
You're so handsome.

409
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,319
You're more handsome than cousin.

410
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,920
Don't be distracted. Focus on the practice.

411
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,040
I've been paying attention.

412
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,569
Then have you learned the moves?

413
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,300
What do you think?

414
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,370
I'm good, aren't I?

415
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,410
You can stop practicing.

416
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,410
Do I pass the test so quickly?

417
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,100
Am I a martial arts genius?

418
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,260
Are you practicing martial arts or dancing?

419
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,570
When the robbers see

420
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,450
such sloppy skills,

421
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,180
they will only get more excited.

422
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:58,660
Well,

423
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,180
it's my fault.

424
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,610
I've never learned martial arts before.

425
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,150
Let's practice the basics first.

426
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,440
Deep squat.

427
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,180
I knew something was wrong with him.

428
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,940
He was so eager to

429
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,240
enter my study.

430
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,010
What do you think he wanted?

431
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,700
Tang Qing and Yunxi

432
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,610
were taught by an old beggar.

433
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,860
Their mapping skills are similar

434
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,510
to the Luo's style.

435
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,560
It seems that

436
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,180
they are connected to

437
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,580
the Luo family.

438
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,750
Beggar?

439
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,050
I even suspect

440
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,450
if there was that old beggar.

441
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,760
You mean...

442
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,850
I'm afraid

443
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,610
you've been duped from the start.

444
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,480
That's my fault.

445
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,930
Is there any news from the Young Master's Mansion?

446
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,460
Not yet.

447
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,530
But

448
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,440
Pepper is trusted by Yunxi.

449
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,080
If something is wrong with Yunxi,

450
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,220
Pepper will

451
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,960
find out.

452
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,690
Yunxi

453
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,020
makes me feel uneasy.

454
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,400
She knows mapping.

455
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,340
The techniques she uses

456
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,350
to draw construction plans

457
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,170
and make models

458
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,960
are in the Luo family's style.

459
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,200
Yunxi.

460
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,090
Is she

461
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,970
about the same age

462
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,220
as Luo Hexuan's sister?

463
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,120
She seems to be.

464
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,580
Do you think Yunxi is

465
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,070
Luo Hexuan's sister?

466
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,740
Yunxi.

467
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,520
You know I don't want to see her.

468
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,580
Why did you invite her here?

469
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,540
Didn't we have an agreement

470
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,900
last time?

471
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,000
It's a misunderstanding.

472
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,060
You're such a fence-straddler.

473
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,980
But I can't tolerate a mistake.

474
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,110
I won't be with her.

475
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:35,860
You must choose one.

476
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,680
It's up to you.

477
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,720
Miss Fengyi is reasonable

478
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,500
and not petty.

479
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,800
The past has long passed.

480
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,160
Why do you keep mentioning it?

481
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,970
What you said is pleasant.

482
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,810
Last time you coveted my cousin.

483
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,860
If I hadn't...

484
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,300
Miss, stop arguing.

485
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,410
We are here

486
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,250
for Young Master.

487
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,170
How about let go of your prejudice

488
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,500
and solve the problem?

489
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,380
I'll be magnanimous.

490
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,860
I'll reluctantly agree.

491
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,130
Don't do it again.

492
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,420
I've drafted the invitation

493
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,870
in the name of Miss Nangong

494
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,430
and Miss Fengyi,

495
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,490
to invite all the ladies in the city.

496
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,110
[Invitation]

497
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,670
Does this really work?

498
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,850
Can we really attract these ladies

499
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,400
to spend their money?

500
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,280
One is elegant.

501
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,790
One is dashing.

502
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,830
One is mighty.

503
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,430
Yunxi.

504
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:47,930
That's good.

505
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,080
Are you tired?

506
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,180
It's just a few invitations.

507
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:52,760
I'm not tired.

508
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,230
Why didn't you call me

509
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,380
when you were writing?

510
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,590
Let me give you a massage.

511
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,430
Cousin and Yunxi

512
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,320
really love each other.

513
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,280
You two make a perfect couple.

514
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,600
Why are you all looking at me?

515
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,470
I'm telling the truth.

516
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:34,750
But

517
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,320
I have to warn someone.

518
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,260
I will be

519
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,240
the Lady of Young Master.

520
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,900
Don't waste your time.

521
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,780
Let's take a look at these paintings.

522
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,700
Mr. Chi's appearance lights the city.

523
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,450
[Mr. Chi]

524
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,070
[Mr. Li]

525
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,610
[Mr. Zhao]

526
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,340
Mr. Zhao

527
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,460
is tall and good-looking.

528
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,550
Nice choice.

529
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,400
How can this be nice?

530
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,370
He's not as good-looking as Wuyan.

531
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,780
Not manly at all.

532
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,940
Every man

533
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,270
has their own style

534
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,090
and beauty.

535
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,530
Since it's a beauty show,

536
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,460
we should

537
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,740
accept the beauty

538
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,480
of different styles.

539
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,760
And I've prepared

540
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,130
some starring stars.

541
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,790
Starring stars?

542
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,290
Why don't I know about it?

543
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,360
Don't worry.

544
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,640
You'll know when the time comes.

545
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,750
[Prince Jing]

546
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,930
This is not good.

547
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,580
Too ugly.

548
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,250
Tang Qing looks better.

549
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,380
[Mr. Tang]

550
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,970
[Prince Kang Prince Jing]

551
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,510
[The First Beauty Show in Cangyue City]

552
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,330
Look at this.

553
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,130
This is handsome.

554
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,590
Look at our Young Master.

555
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,490
-Really? -I think he's handsome too.

556
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,070
Right?

557
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,570
Miss Jiang.

558
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,730
Everyone is here,

559
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,350
as well as the Lady of Cangyue City.

560
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
So what?

561
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,740
Can't she wait?

562
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,650
I've shown her enough respect

563
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,160
by coming here.

564
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,380
There's so many people.

565
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,760
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

566
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,320
Greetings, Miss Jiang.

567
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,060
Fengyi,

568
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,090
you're really capable.

569
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,660
To raise money for your cousin to build Futian Institution,

570
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,680
you've invited so many people.

571
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,050
In the future, you must be a significant support

572
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,380
as the Lady of Young Master.

573
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,710
Aunt,

574
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,470
I'm not the only one working.

575
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,780
Everyone works hard.

576
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,180
You don't ask for credit.

577
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,910
You're the most

578
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,970
virtuous and reasonable one.

579
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,660
Mother,

580
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,950
you've forgot to

581
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,180
praise two others.

582
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,160
I heard

583
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,760
Miss Nangong also contributed a lot.

584
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,150
The invitations

585
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,870
to these ladies

586
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,860
were sent in her name.

587
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,930
And Miss Yunxi.

588
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,140
She also put a lot of work into it.

589
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,190
Mingse.

590
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,910
In terms of contribution,

591
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,150
you're thoughtful.

592
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,870
Even more reasonable

593
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,000
than your mother.

594
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,780
Mother, you are busy at

595
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,330
managing the business in the Master's Mansion.

596
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,940
It's inevitable to be weary.

597
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,700
It's normal

598
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,690
to forget something.

599
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,550
As your daughter,

600
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,220
I am expected to remind

601
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,670
and care about you.

602
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,520
You are really observant.

603
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,010
No wonder your father loves you the most.

604
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,920
Father loves every child.

605
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,200
He treats me exceptionally

606
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,640
because my birth mother

607
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,150
is his first wife.

608
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,780
My mother died young.

609
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,510
But my father's love for her is still on his mind.

610
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,100
Dr. Qi.

611
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:56,900
Yunxi,

612
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,710
you should have told me earlier that

613
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,500
we are the starring stars.

614
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,830
Then I could prepare before,

615
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,340
and wouldn't be

616
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,770
so nervous now.

617
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,660
Dr. Qi, don't be nervous.

618
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,320
You are definitely the brightest star

619
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,190
in Cangyue City.

620
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,610
Will there be no accident?

621
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,300
Don't worry.

622
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,820
Miss Nangong is ready.

623
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:20,650
No problem.

624
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,020
You really asked me here just to watch the show?

625
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,820
Don't tell me

626
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,030
you're planning to sell me?

627
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,660
How is that possible?

628
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,830
I'm not willing to.

629
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,630
I just want you

630
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,660
to show your support.

631
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,140
After all,

632
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,500
you are the most elegant

633
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,460
and charming man

634
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,590
in Cangyue City.

635
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,760
Trust me.

636
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,610
Everything is under control.

637
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,880
Coming.

638
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

639
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,370
welcome to the selection

640
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,890
of Top 10 Mr. Cangyue.

641
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,510
Please enjoy the styles of these attractive boys in our city.

642
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,930
-Great! -Great!

643
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:16,980
Look.

644
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,540
It's interesting.

645
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,150
I didn't expect

646
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,700
mother could be so lively.

647
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,150
I'm sure when father sees it,

648
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,450
he would be

649
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,790
a little surprised.

650
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,990
Next, welcome the first handsome man.

651
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,140
Great!

652
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,470
Let's welcome the next one.

653
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,970
He plays the broadsword with mighty power,

654
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,400
as if he can destroy the mountains.

655
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,220
Okay.

656
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,220
Next one

657
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,690
is Guard Tang.

658
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:52,990
Great!

659
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,790
The sword is bright. The spirit is inspiring.

660
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,510
-Bravo! -Bravo!

661
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,890
Let's welcome Dr. Xian.

662
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,580
So handsome.

663
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,750
It's nice.

664
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,550
The sound of the Chinese flute

665
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,400
is lingering and sorrowful.

666
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,710
Ladies, clap your hands!

667
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,860
Great!

668
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,380
Bravo!

669
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,020
Awesome!

670
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,440
Let's welcome the next one.

671
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,770
Who is he?

672
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,440
Have fun!

673
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,560
Who chose him?

674
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,250
He's coming.

675
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,490
Finally, let's welcome the Young Master

676
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,730
to watch this show.

677
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,410
My cousin is so handsome.

678
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,050
Next is the time

679
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,810
for reward and bidding.

680
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,180
This show is supervised

681
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,920
by the government.

682
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,220
The highest bidder

683
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,300
can have a tour of Zhaohe River

684
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,810
with her beloved one.

685
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,980
Now,

686
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,550
let's offer rewards

687
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,250
for your beloved one.

688
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,690
Great!

689
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,940
A carriage.

690
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,740
I'll pay one manor.

691
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,380
I'll pay 50 thousand liang.

692
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,990
Then I'll pay 100 thousand liang.

693
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,590
I'll reward Dr. Xian

694
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,730
a painted boat.

695
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,870
Great!

696
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
Great!

697
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,290
10 thousand liang!

698
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,430
10 thousand liang!

699
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,360
10 thousand liang?

700
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,260
That much?

701
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,810
Of gold.

702
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,630
-Gold! -Gold!

703
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:55,860
Gold!

704
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,380
10 thousand liang of gold.

705
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,980
Gold! Gold!

706
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
Of gold!

707
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,870
Miss! Miss!

708
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:03,840
Hurry up.

709
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,740
Bid.

710
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,690
Miss,

711
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,090
if you spend more than 10 thousand liang of gold,

712
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,240
your father will die of anger.

713
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,500
Yunxi,

714
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,100
I know my father.

715
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,610
If I spend more than 10 thousand liang of gold,

716
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,150
he'll die of anger.

717
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,250
And before he dies,

718
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,020
he'll kill me.

719
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,270
Where does the fatty girl come from?

720
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,220
She is the daughter of the Du family,

721
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,270
the richest family in Cangyue City.

722
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,760
Judging from what happened today,

723
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,870
I'm sure this family will be the support

724
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,140
of Xi'er in the future.

725
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,700
If he wants to be a Master for long,

726
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,140
both power and money are essential.

727
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,790
You have thought a lot

728
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,430
for Xi'er's future.

729
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,730
I didn't expect

730
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,800
you could find another choice this soon.

731
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,550
The show is over.

732
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,120
Although some ladies

733
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,310
can't tour

734
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,510
with a handsome man on the Zhaohe River,

735
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,860
you can't return with nothing.

736
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,580
We've prepared some handmade pillows

737
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,200
and fans with portraits.

738
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,240
Remember to offer your reward.

739
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,070
Why did you bid for Dr. Xian?

740
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,610
I was helping Miss Siyan.

741
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,480
Xi'er.

742
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,730
Mother.

743
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:11,179
I'll talk to you later.

744
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:13,699
Mother.

745
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,060
Why are you here?

746
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,060
Fengyi invited me here.

747
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,340
I didn't expect it to be so interesting.

748
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,870
Look at how happy sister is.

749
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,159
I should have gone to your mansion

750
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,080
and got some treasures or antiques

751
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,540
to supplement our donation.

752
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,340
Sure.

753
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,020
But,

754
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,900
why don't you ask mother?

755
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,460
She's much richer than me.

756
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,659
Tang Qing!

757
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,880
I have bought you.

758
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,790
Isn't it

759
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,739
a surprise?

760
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:51,790
Miss!
