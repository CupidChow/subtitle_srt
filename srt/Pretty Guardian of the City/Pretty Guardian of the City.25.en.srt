Aunt Xu. Uncle Jin.

00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,220
Why are you here?

00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,139
You are getting married.

7
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,320
As your family,

8
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,180
we must come here to add some dowries for you.

9
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,300
Look.

10
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,500
What are these?

11
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,190
These

12
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,950
were picked from the mountain by Baozi and others.

13
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,860
Eat it when you are in the bridal chamber.

14
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,440
It can bring you good luck.

15
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,520
I always tease you.

16
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,950
But now,

17
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,230
you got the chance

18
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:33,990
to tease me.

19
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,579
I must behave well.

20
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,180
When you are getting married,

21
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,340
I will comb your hair.

22
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,670
I must dress you up

23
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,579
beautifully.

Look.

26
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,410
This is a gift for you.

27
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,120
It's made of rare Nanmu.

28
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you like it?

29
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,260
And this.

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,700
I sewed two clothes for you.

31
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,490
It's real silk.

32
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,940
I'm sure you'll like it.

33
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,260
It's true that I like it.

34
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,470
But did you spend all our money

35
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,820
on dowries?

36
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,740
Don't worry.

37
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,830
We don't need money

38
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,900
now.

39
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,710
Once Futian Institution is built,

40
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,260
we'll move there.

41
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,170
It saves us the money to build a house.

42
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,480
Speaking of Futian Institution,

43
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,220
I really want to see

44
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,310
what it looks like after it is built.

45

Uncle Jin.

46
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,650
I am just thinking about

47
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,910
living in a big house,

48
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:31,980
so I'm excited.

49
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:32,940
Excited.

50
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,410
Look at you three.

51
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,070
Why do you look like

52
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,100
we are being apart from each other?

53
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,340
You'v already known

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,329
my condition.

55
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,530
Don't worry about it.

56
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,900
I'm fine.

57

You really don't have to worry about me.

After going through so much,

59
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,540
I've finally figured it out.

60
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,590
There is always a end in life.

61
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,300
Life can be long or short,

62
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,740
just like the flowers bloom and wither.

63
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,020
That's why life is beautiful.

64

Besides,

65
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,240
I met you

66
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,300
when the flower bloomed.

67
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,980
I'm really glad.

68
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,460
So,

69
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,580
I will treat every day

70

from now on

71
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,180
as my last day.

72
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,750
I will cherish

73
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,029
every moment

74
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,970

Men are in charge of the affairs outside and women are in charge of family affairs.

You need to take care of the child at home,

00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,530
Don't regret it.

176
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,440
I won't.

177
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,380
Come here.

178
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,300
Yunxi, I only hope

179
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,720
you can live on well.

180
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,700
Everyone,

181
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,820
the great construction of the city

182
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,490
was finally completed.

183
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,360
Commander Xiao and Chairman Nangong

184
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,230
devoted themselves into the task.

185
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,420
All the officials in the Planning Department

186
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,870
also took their responsibilities.

187
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,460
Good.

188
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,580
You'll all be rewarded.

189
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,890
Thank you, Master.

190
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,140
Master,

191
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,420
Inspector Jiang has contributed a lot

192
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,910
in the whole process.

193
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,010
Should we reward him?

194
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,850
Inspector Jiang did contribute a lot.

195
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,660
But he also made many mistakes.

196
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:55,860
They are even.

197
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,270
So just forget about the reward.

198
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,220
Inspector Jiang,

199
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,420
do you have any objections?

200
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,580
No.

201
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,520
I'll do as you say.

202
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,470
Since the construction of the city

203
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,220
is over,

204
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,390
I should resign from

205
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:09,970
the inspector position.

206
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,600
You're quite carefree.

207
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,030
You think you can be an official if you want to,

208
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,170
and resign it if you don't want it.

209
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,940
Don't forget

210
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,260
I'm the one who gave you the position.

211
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,030
Even if you want to resign,

212
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,570
I should be the one to decide.

213
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,500
This...

214
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,660
Young Master.

215
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,260
Xi'er.

216
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,180
Young Master!

217
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:28,650
Young Master!

218
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,460
Young Master.

219
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,610
Xi'er.

220
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:32,750
Xi'er.

221
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,060
Xi'er.

222
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,270
Young Master.

223
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,820
Call the imperial physician!

224
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:37,970
Call the imperial physician!

225
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,060
Imperial physician!

226
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,260
Brother, think again.

227
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,240
There must be a perfect way to save Yunxi.

228
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,690
You can't drink it.

229
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,340
Yunxi can' t wait any longer.

230
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,060
If I can use my life to gurantee the safety of

231
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,930
the rest of her life,

232
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,160
I'm more than happy to do it.

233
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,650
Why don't you pretend to be poisoned?

234
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,380
I think we can fool

235
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,930
Xiao Huasheng.

236
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,290
He is scheming.

237
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,750
How can he be easily fooled?

238
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,970
If anything goes wrong, we will lose the whole game.

239
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,460
I can' t take risk

240
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:05,980
with Yunxi' s life.

241
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:07,610
So,

242
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,340
father' s expectation

243
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,110
and the future of Cangyue City

244
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,110
depend on you now.

245
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,050
Brother.

246
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:50,900
How is it?

247
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,860
Young Master...

248
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,280
Lord Jiang...

249
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,980
In my heart,

250
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,250
he will always be the young master.

251
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:00,980
Tell me.

252
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,420
Young Master

253
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,900
was poisoned by a rare poison.

254
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,020
Poisoned?

255
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,980
What poison?

256
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,230
Can he be saved?

257
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,580
This poison is strange,

258
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,880
but it's easy to detoxify.

259
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,060
It only needs to add

260
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,070
the blood of his biological parents

261
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,260
into the medicine.

262
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,220
What?

263
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,830
That's easy.

264
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,840
Come on. Take my blood.

265
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,630
-Put it into the medicine. -No.

266
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,060
It's okay.

267
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:27,580
My Lady.

268
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,620
It's just some blood.

269
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,260
Hurry up.

270
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,940
You're a precious person.

271
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,710
I dare not.

272
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,780
If I hurt you,

273
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,980
I will be executed.

274
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,860
This is an emergency.

275
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,890
Why do you still follow the rules?

276
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,460
Come.

277
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:40,940
You dare not?

278
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,700
I'll do it myself.

279
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,740
There's another way.

280
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,990
Her Ladyship is Young Master's mother.

281
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,980
It still works

282
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,180
with her blood.

283
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,980
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

284
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,230
Brother.

285
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,530
I will find your family

286
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,680
and save you.

287
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,360
Why hasn't he woken up?

288
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,320
What's going on?

289
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,400
It shouldn't be.

290
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,370
It's been two hours.

291
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,420
Father,

292
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,910
can I have a look?

293
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,650
Okay.

294
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,040
Father,

295
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,320
judging from his pulse,

296
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,990
it didn't work after he took the medicine.

297
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,740
But you saw it

298
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,500
when I used the medicine.

299
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,410
I used Her Ladyship's blood

300
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,080
as the ingredient.

301
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,290
Nothing was wrong.

302
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,950
The medicine didn't work.

303
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,580
It means your treatment is wrong.

304
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,300
Your medical skills are not good.

305
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,250
I...

306
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,580
Physician Zhao,

307
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,420
it's not a trivial matter to save Young Master.

308
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,390
If anything goes wrong,

309
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,380
your whole family

310
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,120
will be sentenced to death.

311
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,580
Maybe I'm not good at medicine.

312
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,770
The prescription is not wrong.

313
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,110
If it really used

314
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,470
the blood of his biological mother as the ingredient,

315
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,820
there's no reason for my brother

316
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,260
not to wake up.

317
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,590
Xi'er was born

318
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,740
after I was pregnant for ten months.

319
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,620
How could I not be his biological mother?

320
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,980
Your mother took her own life.

321
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,500
You took it out on me, right?

322
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,960
This is your revenge.

323
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,860
You colluded with the physician

324
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,950
to set this up.

325
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:54,740
Mother,

326
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,250
I'm telling the truth.

327
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,860
If father you don't believe me,

328
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,300
just summon all the physicians

329
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,470
in Cangyue City

330
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,590
and ask them to come for treatment.

331
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,620
Please investigate, Master.

332
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,070
It was Xian'er trying to

333
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,690
take revenge and set me up.

334
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,210
Xian'er has always been steady.

335
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,060
He doesn't fight for anything.

336
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,160
Why would he frame you?

337
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,540
This matter is very important.

338
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,020
We must investigate it thoroughly.

339
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,700
Before we find out the truth,

340
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,850
you are grounded in the mansion.

341
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,740
You are not allowed to leave.

342
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,420
Jiang Chuxian.

343
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,340
How dare you betray me?

344
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,440
What are you talking about, uncle?

345
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,670
There's no betrayal

346
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,480
between you and me.

347
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,980
You despicable man.

348
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,030
You pretended to be close to me.

349
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,510
Did you plan to

350
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,650
to frame our Xiao family?

351
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,300
Do you really think

352
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,980
I am willing to

353
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,000
be your puppet?

354
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,640
Who forced my mother to die?

355
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,370
How did your Xiao family

356
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,380
humiliate us

357
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,170
all these years?

358
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:16,930
Have you forgotten?

359
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:20,730
Besides,

360
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,100
how much money did you embezzle

361
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,060
all these years?

362
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,180
I wipe out you, the harzard,

363
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,290
for Cangyue.

364
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,660
Why shouldn't I?

365
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,060
You...

366
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,830
How do you know these?

367
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,380
Where is the evidence?

368
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,580
My brother and I have been working together

369
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,290
for many years.

370
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,390
How could I not know?

371
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,780
I really raised a tiger which became a threat.

372
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,660
It's time

373
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,550
to make you pay.

374
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,310
What a joke.

375
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,790
You're not qualified

376
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,140
to take me down.

377
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,810
I'll kill you today.

378
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,020
Young man,

379
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,460
don't be arrogant.

380
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,150
This game is not over yet.

381
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,940
Sir,

382
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,099
if Commander Xiao escapes this time,

383
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,660
he will surely revenge us double harder.

384
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,280
I won't give him the chance

385
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,359
to get away.

386
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,670
Why did he suddenly get poisoned?

387
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,660
What happened?

388
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,980
Young Master must have been poisoned earlier.

389
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,980
Then the poison only came out in meeting hall.

390
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,510
The physician said

391
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,250
Young Master can only be saved

392
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:36,700
by using the blood of his biological parents

393
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,900
as the ingredient.

394
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,660
Miss Yunxi.

395
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,210
Don't worry.

396
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,130
With Master and Her Ladyship here,

397
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,390
Young Master will be fine.

398
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,350
Young Master is not the biological son

399
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:47,940
of Master

400
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,020
and Her Ladyship.

401
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:49,620
Wuyan.

402
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,470
How dare you say

403
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,780
such a treacherous thing?

404
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,870
How could Young Master

405
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,060
not Master' s biological son?

406
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,250
I want to see Young Master.

407
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,340
He's in a coma.

408
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,940
It won't help even if you go.

409
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,630
Besides, Master has ordered

410
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,290
to investigate it thoroughly.

411
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,220
What' s going on?

412
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,080
Miss Yunxi! Miss Yunxi!

413
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,050
Miss Yunxi!

414
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,560
Master.

415
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,870
I'm innocent.

416
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,650
Xi'er's poison is strange.

417
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,660
It's obvious that someone is behind this

418
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,240
and tries to frame us.

419
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,220
Frame you?

420
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,860
Tell me then.

421
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,530
Who is framing you?

422
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,580
You really impressed me.

423
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,100
I only knew that

424
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,520
you were selfish and domineering.

425
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,780
But I never thought

426
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,650
you dare to meddle the bloodline of Jiang family.

427
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,410
Even if I cut you into pieces,

428
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,050
it won't relieve my hatred.

429
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,420
Master.

430
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,710
Master.

431
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,140
Xi'er is really our child.

432
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,450
Didn't you always say that

433
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,150
he looked like you?

434
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,170
Then why

435
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,540
your blood

436
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,850
could't save him?

437
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,830
Why?

438
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,380
Tell me.

439
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,020
Master.

440
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,110
I just got the news that

441
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,140
Dr. Xian has found the ledger

442
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,180
and surrounded the Xiao's Mansion.

443
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,210
You two have planned for years.

444
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,400
You think you can take control of Cangyue City?

445
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,300
You're daydreaming.

446
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,710
Today,

447
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,980
I'll let you two

448
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,890
to see clearly

449
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,860
how you

450
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,110
lose entirely?

451
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:39,660
Master.

452
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,760
From now on,

453
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,020
we are no longer husband and wife.

454
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,420
You're on your own.

455
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,990
Master!

456
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,460
[Eastern Mansion of Xiao'ao]

457
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,620
-Move! -Jiang Chuxian.

458
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,500
You sinister bastard!

459
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,460
Let go of me!

460
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,380
I'll fight you

461
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,540
to death.

462
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,710
Kneel!

463
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,380
Father.

464
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:31,730
Kneel!

465
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,370
Xiao Huasheng has been captured alive.

466
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,630
And the rest of those who resisted were all executed.

467
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,900
Xiao Huasheng.

468
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,470
All these years,

469
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,280
you think you have hidden your plan very well.

470
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,260
But do you really think I don't know

471
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,250
what you're up to behind my back?

472
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,950
I know.

473
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,700
I turned a blind eye on you

474
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,050
just because your Xiao family contributed a lot

475
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,130
when I built Cangyue City.

476
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,180
That's why I put up with you again and again.

477
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,750
But I didn't expect

478
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,790
that you would mess the royal bloodline.

479
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,560
Xiao Huasheng.

480
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,850
You deserve

481
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,010
what happened to you today.

482
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,880
At this point,

483
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,190
you have no other choice but to tell me the truth.

484
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,590
Whose child is Xi'er?

485
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,030
He is the son of a lowly commoner.

486
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,740
His biological parents were long gone.

487
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,170
Back then,

488
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,170
I found that Wenjun gave birth to a dead baby.

489
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,820
And you had ordered

490
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,120
that whoever gave birth first,

491
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,000
she or Lady Jing,

492
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,300
would be your first lady.

493
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,240
We had no choice

494
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,500
but to do this.

495
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,110
Master,

496
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,510
I'll accept your punishment

497
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,820
no matter what.

498
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,440
In my life,

499
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,090
I have never begged anyone.

500
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,930
Today I beg you.

501
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,450
For the sake of the Xiao family

502
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,880
who has fought for Cangyue for generations,

503
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,090
let Fengyi off.

504
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,220
My kid knows nothing!

505
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,850
Your kid!

506
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,440
What about my kid?

507
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,220
Xiao Huasheng!

508
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,580
You've messed my Jiang family's bloodline!

509
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,030
You embezzled the disaster relief funds and destroyed the evidence.

510
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,400
Even if I kill your whole family,

511
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,460
I won't be able to relieve my anger!

512
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,880
You tell me!

513
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,840
How would I be able to spare your child!

514
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,460
Master!

515
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,870
Fengyi is innocent.

516
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,620
For the sake

517
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,780
of my ancestors

518
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,990
who saved your ancestors

519
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,300
from the pile of dead people

520
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,540
so your ancestor could build Cangyyue City,

521
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,060
please spare her life!

522
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,510
Xian'er!

523
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:14,570
Yes.

524
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,730
Pass my order.

525
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,610
Put Xiao Huasheng in jail

526
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,820
and wait for his execution.

527
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,790
Confiscate the Xiao family's possessions.

528
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,760
All Xiao's relatives and families

529
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,270
will be demoted as slaves and will never be forgiven.

530
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,770
Yes, Father.

531
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,740
Master.

532
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,100
Master!

533
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,030
Master!

534
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,390
Move!

535
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,260
Let my daughter off.

536
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,740
Master!

537
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,500
Master!

538
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,300
Xian'er,

539
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,890
you've done a great job.

540
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,020
I'll leave the rest

541
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,000
to you.

542
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,700
Thank you, Father.

543
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:34,780
Go!

544
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:35,900
Go!

545
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,790
Behave yourself! Go!

546
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:40,780
Go!

547
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:41,780
Behave yourself!

548
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,290
Hurry up and move!

549
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,500
Stop dawdling!

550
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,600
Hurry up.

551
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:47,900
Mr,

552
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,320
is this the Swing Painting?

553
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,430
I don't want to die.

554
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,280
My Lady!

555
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:55,980
Let go of me!

556
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,450
Miss!

557
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,260
Let go of me!

558
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,610
I want to see my cousin!

559
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,720
I want to see my aunt!

560
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,970
My father is so loyal to Cangyue.

561
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,440
How could he corrupt?

562
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,030
Keep it.

563
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,850
Don't worry.

564
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,040
Dr. Xian!

565
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,260
Dr. Xian!

566
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,040
I want to see my cousin.

567
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,540
Please help me.

568
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,340
Give it back to me.

569
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,060
It's mine.

570
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:14,460
Give it to me!

571
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,500
It's mine!

572
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,460
Don't hit my lady!

573
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,600
Tang Qing.

574
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,580
You're finally here.

575
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,080
They bullied me.

576
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,550
They even took Happy away.

577
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,500
Don't be afraid.

578
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,470
I'm here.

579
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:37,490
Dr. Qi,

580
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,950
I want to take Fengyi away.

581
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,190
Commander Xiao embezzled the fund,

582
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,170
and it has concequences for his family.

583
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,540
Xiao Fengyi

584
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,300
is guilty now.

585
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,870
Yunxi also cares about Fengyi very much.

586
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,880
If she sees this,

587
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,700
she will be very sad.

588
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,280
Please let her go

589
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,380
for the sake of Yunxi.

590
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,260
Tang Qing.

591
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,750
You came to save me

592
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,350
just for Yunxi?

593
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,870
We are all worried about you.

594
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,170
And I promised you

595
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,320
that if you helped me find Yunxi,

596
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,720
I'd be yours.

597
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,470
So,

598
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,220
I have to do everything for you.

599
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,900
Since you didn't do it willingly,

600
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,930
I'd rather not accept

601
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,080
your sympathy and charity.

602
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,420
I won't go with you.

603
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,770
Fengyi,

604
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,820
things have come to this point.

605
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,060
Why are you still so capricious?

606
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,940
I said I don't need your pity.

607
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,300
Tang Qing.

608
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,220
According to Cangyue's Law,

609
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,850
she's a slave now.

610
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,130
Moreover, Master has ordered

611
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,540
that the Xiao family will never be forgiven.

612
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,260
I have no right

613
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:30,990
to let you take her away either.

614
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,180
Dr. Qi!

615
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,890
Don't worry.

616
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,710
I will protect her from being bullied.

617
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,130
Thanks a lot, Dr. Qi.

618
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,260
Wait for me.

619
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,480
Please wait for me.

620
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,340
I'll find a way to get you out.

621
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,180
Here, girl.

622
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,700
My girl,

623
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,070
you have to eat something.

624
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,780
Otherwise,

625
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,530
you can't take it.

626
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,420
Brother Fusheng.

627
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,780
I'm so worried

628
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,770
that he would never wake up

629
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,660
like my brother.

630
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,540
Yunxi.

631
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,800
Dr. Qi.

632
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,860
How is he?

633
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,860
He's still unconscious.

634
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:25,980
Slow down.

635
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,860
It was my big brother who asked me to give this to you.

636
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,360
The painting is real.

637
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,950
What's going on?

638
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,110
Third Brother.

639
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,620
After I drink this poisoned wine,

640
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,520
you must get that Swing Painting

641
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,490
from Xiao Huasheng.

642
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,900
Why do you want that painting?

643
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,020
You know

644
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,250
that Yunxi

645
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,320
has suffered from the poison of heartburn,

646
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,620
and she's dying.

647
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,820
Only Fengchi can save her.

648
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,140
And that painting

649
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,180
is the map to find it.

650
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,770
The Swing Painting can lead us to Fengchi?

651
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,250
Yunxi

652
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,260
is running out of time.

653
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,260
I just want her to live

654
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,870
without illness or worry.

655
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,090
When the poison kicks in,

656
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,150
Commander Xiao will have to reveal

657
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,090
the baby switch.

658
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,740
If the Xiao family falls,

659
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,650
my wish will come true.

660
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,580
You must

661
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,640
take good care of Yunxi for me.

662
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,910
So you've already decided

663
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,560
to sacrifice your life

664
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,820
to save Yunxi's life.

665
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,810
Brother, no!

666
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,110
That day,

667
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,160
my brother took the poison willingly.

668
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,180
He told me

669
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:04,880
he would use his life

670
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,550
in exchange for your life.

671
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,080
He set up a trap to reveal his true identity

672
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,700
so you could take down Xiao Huasheng

673
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,310
and get the painting from him.

674
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,760
He risked his life

675
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,820
for my life.

676
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,800
Jiang Chaoxi, you fool!

677
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:23,740
Yunxi.

678
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:24,420
Be careful.

679
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,590
I'm begging you.

680
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,440
Take me to see him.

681
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,300
My brother told me before the accident.

682
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,820
Once I get the map,

683
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,460
I should send you out of Cangyue City immediately.

684
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,660
Now we have the map.

685
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,890
I'll arrange someone

686
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,640
to send you away.

687
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,220
I want to see him.

688
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,460
Please.

689
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,080
Yunxi.

690
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,750
Jiang Chaoxi.

691
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,950
You fool.

692
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,110
Who allowed you to do this

693
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,140
for me?

694
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,260
Do you think I would be touched?

695
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,560
You're too selfish.

696
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,670
You just abandoned me like that.

697
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,510
Without you,

698
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,230
how will I live?

699
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,270
Don't worry.

700
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,160
I won't let you

701
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,660
go alone.

702
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,220
Yunxi, someone is coming!

703
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,220
Father.

704
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,810
Xian'er.

705
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,430
Do you think Xi'er

706
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,440
looks like me?

707
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,290
You dare not answer my question?

708
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,730
Okay. Let me tell you.

709
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,600
Why do I feel

710
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,210
Xi'er looks so much like me?

711
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,400
Look how much his face look like mine.

712
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,050
His mouth.

713
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,140
Nose.

714
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,280
Eyes.

715
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,300
Even his temper

716
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,140
is exactly the same as mine when I was young.

717
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,560
No matter how I see him,

718
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,200
he should be my son.

719
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,090
He is like me in every way.

720
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,250
But he is just not

721
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,920
my own son.

722
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,660
Since this is the case,

723
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,480
he shouldn't

724
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,910
live in this world.

725
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,110
Father.

726
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,380
No!

727
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,330
Master, no!

728
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,340
Why are you here?

729
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,150
Father.

730
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,980
I brought her here to see my brother.

731
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,050
Master.

732
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,190
Although Young Master is not

733
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,260
your real son,

734
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,740
for the sake of the nurturing love you have shown him for over 20 years,

735
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,450
please let him live.

736
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,130
You're so loyal.

737
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,630
It's worthy for Xi'er

738
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,750
to give up his position as Master of Cangyue for you.

739
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,620
I also want to let Xi'er off.

740
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,260
But now,

741
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,510
it has become a end game.

742
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,880
If I don't kill him,

743
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,940
my dignity and prestige

744
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,989
can't be preserved.

745
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,449
Master.

746
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,350
Are dignity and prestige

747
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,520
really that important?

748
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Young Master once said

749
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,630
you taught him

750
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,580
his first word.

751
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,870
The first character he can write

752
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,070
was also taught by you.

753
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,690
Everything in his life

754
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,560
is full of you.

755
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,910
Can you really do it?

756
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,260
Now things are still unclear.

757
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,290
And you want to decide his life and death

758
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,350
solely on the basis of a drop of blood from the Lady of Cangyue City.

759
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,750
Will you really not regret it?

760
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,220
Fine.

761
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,180
I'll give myself

762
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,730
a reason that I won't regret.

763
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,650
Father.

764
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,860
Xian'er.

765
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,810
Feed him.

766
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,020
Yes.

767
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,860
If he takes

768
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,090
the medicine mixed with my blood

769
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,750
and doesn't wake up,

770
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,010
I can only kill him.

771
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,750
Do it!

772
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,530
I'll give him some dignity.

773
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,540
Announce to the public

774
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,550
that the young master died suddenly.

775
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,220
Yunxi.

776
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,470
Jiang Chaoxi!

777
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:19,830
Jiang Chaoxi!

778
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,410
Master!

779
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,120
Your blood can save him.

780
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,300
You saved him!
