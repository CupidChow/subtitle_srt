4
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,460
He must be executed.

5
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,400
How can we let him live?

6
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,380
We can't kill him.

7
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,740
-Kill him. -Don't kill him.

8
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,930
How can we kill him?

9
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,610
That's outrageous.

10
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,550
Kill him!

11
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,610
No!

12
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,940
We can't kill him.

13
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,210
Everyone.

14
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,090
I have something to say.

15
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,890
Master's blood

16
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,960
has woken Jiang Chaoxi up.

17
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,460
It means

18
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,580
his parentage is yet to be confirmed.

19
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,740
I suggest we investigate this case thoroughly.

20
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,260
We must not take an impostor as Master's heir,

21
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,110
but we shouldn't wrong a true heir either.

22
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,320
That's right.

23
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:17,970
Right.

24
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,190
Xiao Huasheng admitted

25
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,690
that Jiang Chaoxi is the son of a commoner.

26
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,970
There's nothing to be investigated.

27
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,090
Only by killing him

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,820
can we warn those of his lot.

29
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:25,860
Yes.

30
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,660
That's right.

31
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,380
We should warn them.

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,270
He should be killed.

33
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,820
We can't kill the innocent.

34
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,730
Master,

35
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,380
I know you're in a dilemma.

36
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,630
I also know the law makes no exception for anyone.

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,300
But you and Young Master

38
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,730
have been father and son for 20 years.

39
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,329
I should not ask this

40
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,820
but can you really bring yourself

41
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,470
to execute Young Master?

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,720
You're not a cold-hearted man.

43
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,040
Please spare Young Master.

44
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,650
I've told the Chairman to investigate this case thoroughly.

45
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,570
I need more time to think about it.

46
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,560
Thank you, Master.

47
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,730
Thank you, Master.

48
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,760
Thank you, Master.

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,820
Thank you, Master.

50
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,660
Are you sure about it?

51
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,600
It depends on

52
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,390
whether Master still

53
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,970
cares about Young Master.

54
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,970
I've asked the eldest daughter

55
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,360
of the Jiang family for help.

56
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,500
But your body...

57
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,380
Yunxi,

58
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,420
our top priority

59
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,460
is to find Fengchi as soon as possible.

60
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,440
Trust me.

61
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,230
Even if Master

62
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,180
hardens his heart to Young Master,

63
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,410
I will risk my life to save Young Master

64
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,620
and escort you two out of here.

65
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,100
You can't delay

66
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,310
the search for Fengchi any longer.

67
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,910
You and Mr. Chu

68
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,700
should set off immediately.

69
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,079
Qing,

70
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,610
stop worrying about me.

71
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,630
How about you and Fengyi?

72
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,320
Since you are so worried,

73
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,430
go find her.

74
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,690
She doesn't need me.

75
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,960
But you need her.

76
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,740
If you didn't love her,

77
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,300
you wouldn't be so worried.

78
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,550
I care for her

79
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,400
because she was such a good and kind friend to us

80
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,870
and helped us a lot.

81
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,230
I simply want to return the favor.

82
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,310
That's all?

83
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,500
I don't want you

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,920
to repeat my mistake.

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,270
I and Young Master went through so much

86
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,820
and wasted a lot of time

87
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,830
before we finally realized what each other meant to us.

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,380
Qing,

89
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,140
thank you

90
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,880
for taking care of me all this time.

91
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,190
Now is the time for you

92
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,550
to be there for the one you care about the most.

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,380
Or you'll regret it

94
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,200
when it's too late.

95
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,590
Miss Yunxi,

96
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,100
Miss Jiang sent a word to you.

97
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,600
Miss, let me do it. Take a rest.

98
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,000
There are so many chamber pots.

99
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,370
I can't let you brush them

100
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,700
all by yourself.

101
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,140
Even I have never

102
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,020
done such chores before,

103
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,060
let alone you.

104
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,970
We're asked to brush chamber pots every day.

105
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,610
The smell is horrible

106
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,440
and our hands are ruined.

107
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,659
You should have left with Guard Tang.

108
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,030
Don't mention

109
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,120
that ungrateful man.

110
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,630
He promised to save me,

111
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,310
but so many days passed

112
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,610
and he's nowhere to be seen.

113
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,100
How could you speak ill of me behind my back?

114
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,730
What are you doing here?

115
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,860
I came to take you away.

116
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,430
I told you.

117
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,550
I don't need you

118
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,620
to pity me.

119
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,710
I won't go with you.

120
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,790
Life sucks!

121
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,940
Even the chamber pots are giving me a hard time as well.

122
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,300
Fengyi.

123
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,909
I'm sorry for what I did.

124
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,640
Can you come with me this time?

125
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,159
No.

126
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,280
Since you only care about Yunxi,

127
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,380
I don't want you

128

Fengyi,

130
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,640
it's not because of Yunxi that I want to save you,

131
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
nor it's because I pity you.

132

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,690
I won't.

172
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:15,090
♫Clearly interested but biased against the one with desire♫

173
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,020
Careful.

174
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:33,700
Here.

175
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,190
It should be here.

176
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,860
Here?

177
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,920
But there's nothing here.

178
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,010
Let's split up.

179
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:52,890
Let's go.

180
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,410
This place looks normal.

181
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,680
Nothing special.

182
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,100
Have we made a mistake?

183
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,020
The Swing Painting led us here.

184
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,240
Fengchi must be here.

185
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,570
Let's look more carefully.

186
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,280
Come here.

187
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,170
There's a flower here.

188
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,640
Look.

189
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:57,760
How is it?

190
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:58,940
No response.

191
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,320
How about this?

192
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,770
Let's hack it open

193
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,760
and see what's inside.

194
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,260
Don't be so violent.

195
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,070
Since the white jade comb is the key,

196
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,070
we just need to find

197
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,090
a keyhole on it.

198
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,520
Let's try again.

199
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,420
How is it possible?

200
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,700
Did we make a mistake?

201
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,090
Let's hack it open.

202
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,410
Fusheng,

203
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,090
it's a mechanism designed by my brother,

204
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,180
so it must be

205
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,910
much more complicated than we think.

206
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,820
Not necessarily.

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,960
When he hid Fengchi,

208
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,520
you were just a little girl.

209
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,980
He must have considered

210
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,890
the possibility

211
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,540
that you were not smart enough

212
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,980
to find what he hid.

213
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,150
My brother is so smart.

214
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,180
As his sister,

215
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,430
I can only be smarter than him.

216
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,370
-It opened. -It opened.

217
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,220
Here it is.

218
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:08,970
Girl,

219
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,180
eat it.

220
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,310
Fusheng.

221
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,950
Your brother must want you

222
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,980
to eat Fengchi.

223
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,200
After all, his biggest wish

224
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,570
is that you can

225
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,970
live a safe and healthy life.

226
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,770
But Brother also needs

227
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,600
to take Fengchi to survive.

228
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,810
I want him to wake up more than you do.

229
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,530
But I don't want

230
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,260
to do anything against his will.

231
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,830
Otherwise, even if he wakes up,

232
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,710
he won't forgive me

233
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,860
or forgive himself.

234
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,460
Don't forget

235
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,630
that Jiang Chaoxi is waiting for you

236
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,250
in Cangyue City.

237
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,910
Do you want him

238
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,510
to spend the rest of his life

239
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,340
missing having you by his side?

240
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,030
We all

241
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,930
wish you

242
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,980
to live a long and happy life.

243
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,550
Yunxi,

244
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,410
Mr. Chu is right.

245
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,540
I'm sure your brother

246
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,230
would want you to be the one

247
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:07,970
who survives.

248
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,700
I see.

249
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,640
Now I can say I'm worth

250
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,080
your brother's trust and fulfilled his wish.

251
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,330
Girl,

252
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,650
you're in the clear now.

253
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,330
Can I take your brother

254
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,920
to visit doctors all around the world?

255
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,600
Maybe someone

256
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,520
has a way to cure him.

257
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,250
Fusheng,

258
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,670
my brother is very lucky

259
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,490
to have a good friend like you.

260
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,310
I thank you on his behalf.

261
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,540
Before I leave,

262
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,220
can I

263
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,140
say goodbye to him alone?

264
00:12:59,330 --> 00:12:59,670
Sure.

265
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,000
Brother, I'm sorry.

266
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,470
Don't worry, Brother.

267
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,300
In a few days,

268
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,550
Father will let you out.

269
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,050
At the end of my life,

270
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,010
I can't help but think of

271
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:38,920
things that I could've done better.

272
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,500
But at the thought

273
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,620
that the person I care about the most

274
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,930
is safe and sound now,

275
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
I feel content.

276
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,580
Xiao Huasheng has been executed.

277
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,820
It's a pity that my mother couldn't see it.

278
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,890
Chuxian,

279
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,350
promise me to watch out for Cangyue City

280
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,070
and protect the people.

281
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,860
-Tell Yunxi… -Jiang Chaoxi!

282
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,370
Young Master.

283
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,010
Jiang Chaoxi

284
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,990
is indeed

285
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,820
Master's son.

286
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,410
His mother is Lady Jing.

287
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,150
I just started working in the Planning Department

288
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,590
when Father sent me

289
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,530
to repair Jingxin House.

290
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,270
I met Lady Jing there

291
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,450
when she just had a difficult labor.

292
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,500
Lady Jing.

293
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,800
Mr. Luo.

294
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,430
Lady Jing said the child's father was Master.

295
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,150
I intended to bring the child to Master

296
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,230
but she stopped me.

297
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,960
She was so disappointed in the Jiang family

298
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,970
that she begged me

299
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,210
to give her son to an ordinary family

300
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,080
so he could live a peaceful life.

301
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,480
Later, I secretly brought the baby out of the Master's Mansion

302
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,820
during the transportation of lumber.

303
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,840
I wanted to give him away

304
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,660
as Lady Jing wished,

305
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,540
but my father accidentally found out

306
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,600
that Her Ladyship

307
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,560
gave birth to a stillborn baby

308
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,030
and Commander Xiao planned

309
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,780
to randomly pick a newborn baby to take its place.

310
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,840
To make sure that your heir

311
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,560
had your blood,

312
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,900
we had no choice but to swap Lady Jing's son

313
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,100
with the baby Commander Xiao had picked.

314
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,740
I thought

315
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,510
I'd bring this secret

316
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,780
to my grave.

317
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,030
But six years later,

318
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,140
my father was framed and put into prison

319
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,100
because he exposed

320
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,500
Commander Xiao's embezzlement.

321
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,220
His life was in danger.

322
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,650
I couldn't think of a better solution

323
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,350
and attempted to use this secret

324
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,360
to threaten Commander Xiao

325
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,410
to release my father.

326
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,120
Unexpectedly,

327
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,700
Xiao Huasheng was so vicious

328
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,850
that he used poison

329
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,830
to kill the whole Luo family

330
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,740
and made it look like

331
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,010
we committed suicide in fear of punishment.

332
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,060
Mother.

333
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:12,780
Mother!

334
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,120
Mother.

335
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,540
I was too concerned

336
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,620
about the negotiation with Xiao Huasheng

337
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,660
and couldn't eat or sleep well.

338
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,290
So I didn't eat the poisoned food

339
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,930
and survived.

340
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,100
But my mother who was about to give birth

341
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,370
wasn't so lucky.

342
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,670
And my sister

343
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,420
was poisoned

344
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,450
before she was even born

345
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,060
and had been suffering her whole life.

346
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,460
Master,

347
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,900
every word I said is true.

348
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,410
Jiang Chaoxi

349
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,240
is indeed

350
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,370
your son.

351
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,550
Xi'er is really my son.

352
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,849
Xi'er is really my son.

353
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,579
Xi'er is really my son.

354
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,560
Master.

355
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,020
Master!

356
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:19,730
Master!

357
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,080
Father.

358
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,680
Xi'er.

359
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,210
Xi'er.

360
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,810
Father.

361
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,710
Father, don't worry.

362
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,600
You will be fine.

363
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,250
I'm fine.

364
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm fine.

365
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,610
Now that you've come back,

366
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,420
I'm fine.

367
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,560
Xi'er.

368
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,390
I'm sorry

369
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,920
for what happened these days.

370
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,110
I always know

371
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,490
you care about me.

372
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,310
I don't blame you at all.

373
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,520
You're broad-minded.

374
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,760
You are indeed my son.

375
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,910
You're talented.

376
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,440
I'm relieved

377
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,000
to leave Cangyue City to you.

378
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,820
Father.

379
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,110
I know

380
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,500
you care about me

381
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,450
and tried your best to train me.

382
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,250
My gratitude is beyond words.

383
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,230
However,

384
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,260
I don't aspire to rule Cangyue City.

385
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,010
To me,

386
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,600
being loved by you

387
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,410
and having the girl I love by my side

388
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,850
makes me happier

389
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,210
than power ever could've made me.

390
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,110
So my third brother

391
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,600
is more suitable than me to rule the city.

392
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,240
I've been thinking these days

393
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,310
that I was wrong.

394
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,990
I'm not a qualified father.

395
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,370
Since you were young,

396
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,160
I've never really understood

397
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,780
what you two

398
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,630
wanted.

399
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,650
Forget it.

400
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,580
After going through so much,

401
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,850
I've figured it out.

402
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,020
As long as you two

403
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,290
can truly be happy,

404
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,310
it is more important than anything.

405
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,380
Let Xian'er ascend to the throne someday.

406
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,790
All right.

407
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,410
I'm tired.

408
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,400
You may leave.

409
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,110
Brother.

410
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,600
You must take good care of Father

411
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,080
and Cangyue.

412
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,040
Master of Cangyue.

413
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,860
♫I was once lonely, whose heart have I broken?♫

414
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,560
♫I pray for the chance to make it up♫

415
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,400
♫Time flies and everything changes♫

416
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,880
♫The mistake can never be fixed♫

417
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,400
♫Sorry that I failed to keep my promise♫

418
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,580
I thought

419
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,630
I would never see you again.

420
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,440
♫Count the sorrows, who help each other in straits with feeble strength?♫

421
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,570
You fool.

422
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,080
From now on,

423
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,220
I only belong to you.

424
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,710
♫There will be a pure place to expel the karma♫

425
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,770
♫Unexpectedly, not until the pomp ended♫

426
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,870
Why are you running around?

427
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,200
♫Can I understand the unforgettable feeling♫

428
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,150
Why did you decide on your own?

429
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,210
♫The hair has been grey, while the destiny can't be seen through♫

430
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,830
I saved you and Brother.

431
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,580
You are the most important two persons

432
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,740
in my life.

433
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,490
♫Luckily, my heart remains the same when all the flowers fall♫

434
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,740
You are more important to me than anything else.

435
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:07,450
♫I've been waiting for you for a thousand years♫

436
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,820
Trust me.

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,340
I will cure you.

438
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,910
♫Dream that we are on the old road we met♫

439
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,980
We'll be together forever.

440
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,470
♫See you gently play the zither♫

441
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,880
No matter how much time we have left,

442
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:20,360
♫Who are you waiting for to make you a pot of tea?♫

443
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,060
let's never be apart again.

444
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,420
I'll go in first.

445
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,810
Have a good chat with her.

446
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,050
Young Master, please wait.

447
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,220
Miss Nangong,

448
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,660
I'm no longer

449
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,720
the young master of Cangyue City.

450
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,650
Just call me Mr. Jiang.

451
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,160
What brought you here

452
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,100
today?

453
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,340
Actually,

454
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,850
I'm here to apologize to Yunxi.

455
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,740
But when I saw her,

456
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,350
I didn't know how to say it.

457
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:44,740
I...

458
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,210
Let bygones be bygones.

459
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,810
Yunxi and I

460
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,370
are ready to leave Cangyue City.

461
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,790
I hope we'll all be fine.

462
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,140
I thought

463
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,170
Yunxi could win your heart

464
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,850
just because she was lucky.

465
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,040
But now I understand

466
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,720
you are willing to die

467
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,310
for each other.

468
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,070
Your love is even stronger than gold.

469
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,790
I wish you a long and happy life

470
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,550
and stay safe.

471
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,410
Actually,

472
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,950
in Third Brother's heart,

473
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,440
you're always the most important person to him.

474
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,540
Now that he has become the legitimate heir,

475
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,220
he will share

476
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,320
the prosperity of Cangyue with you.

477
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,340
It will definitely be

478
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,310
a beautiful story.

479
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,780
Don't worry, Young Master.

480
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,750
I will do my duty

481
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,210
and do my best for Cangyue.

482
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,190
It's not a waste

483
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,900
of Grandpa's expectations and cultivation.

484
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,750
Thank you, Miss Nangong.

485
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,690
Brother.

486
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,180
You're back.

487
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,580
Where is Young Master?

488
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,950
Is he safe?

489
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,550
Brother, don't worry.

490
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,630
Master has allowed him

491
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,900
to give up his identity

492
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,350
and return to normal life.

493
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,850
That's good.

494
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,160
Good.

495
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,160
Brother.

496
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,620
Father has already been vindicated.

497
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,540
The culprit who framed our family

498
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
has also been punished.

499
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,510
You and I have reunited.

500
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,340
Everybody is happy.

501
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,370
Why do you still look so worried?

502
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,060
I just saw the flowers

503
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,720
blooming so brightly.

504
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,880
I thought

505
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,710
you were actually like that flower.

506
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,900
You're at the best age.

507
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,980
But in order to save me,

508
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,840
you don't have much time left now.

509
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,470
Yun'er.

510
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,280
You really shouldn't have saved me.

511
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,040
Brother.

512
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,950
Don't say that.

513
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,130
Actually,

514
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,020
I gave you Fengchi

515
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,250
for my own selfish purpose.

516
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,210
After you wake up,

517
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,020
you can save the one I love.

518
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,120
Stop comforting me.

519
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,780
I know

520
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,570
you and I

521
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,340
are the same.

522
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,630
We all want to exchange our lives

523
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,520
for each other's life,

524
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,410
but we haven't considered each other's feelings.

525
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:48,950
Yun'er.

526
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,220
Do you know

527
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,570
that I will spend the rest of my life

528
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,370
in the torture of my heart?

529
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:56,770
Brother.

530
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,090
Just think of me as selfish.

531
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,860
At this point,

532
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,620
I will never

533
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,490
watch you die.

534
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,900
I'll leave tomorrow

535
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,500
to find the antidote

536
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,360
with Fusheng.

537
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,880
You must hold on until I come back.

538
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:15,370
Brother.

539
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,770
I have someone I love,

540
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,800
you

541
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,220
and Brother Fusheng

542
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
and everyone's care.

543
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,800
I'm already satisfied.

544
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,420
I don't want to live long.

545
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,510
I just want to spend

546
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,070
my last days

547
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,070
with Jiang Chaoxi.

548
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,060
Even if the days

549
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:31,850
are the most ordinary ones,

550
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,260
I have no regrets.

551
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:49,720
[Cangyue City]

552
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:45,920
Yunxi,

553
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,220
when I come back,

554
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,850
I will find

555
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,610
the antidote for you.

556
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,690
Brother! Brother Fusheng!

557
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,850
Take care!

558
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:54,700
Young Master.

559
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,600
No.

560
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:56,800
Brother-in-law.

561
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,870
Take good care of Yunxi.

562
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,690
Otherwise, we two brothers

563
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,030
won't let you go.

564
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,010
Don't worry.

565
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,190
We'll leave now.

566
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,400
Take care.

567
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,410
Take care.

568
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,940
Yunxi,

569
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,570
we should go.

570
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,220
From now on,

571
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,370
please take care of

572
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,290
Wuyan and my father.

573
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,320
Okay.

574
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,900
Don't worry.

575
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,510
Here.

576
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,210
Yunxi is leaving.

577
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,780
Let's say goodbye to her.

578
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,430
Yunxi.

579
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,530
Sister.

580
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:24,940
Alright.

581
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,170
You're not a kid anymore.

582
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,210
Don't cry.

583
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,540
In the future, you should take care of not only yourself,

584
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,160
but also Fengyi.

585
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:33,580
By the way,

586
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,540
remember to visit Uncle Jin

587
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,450
in Futian Institution.

588
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,480
I will.

589
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,680
You must come back soon.

590
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,150
We will all be here

591
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,930
waiting to reunite with you.

592
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,470
Yunxi,

593
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,290
this is the pancake I just learned to make.

594
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,330
It doesn't look good,

595
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,940
but it tastes good.

596
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,450
Take it

597
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,460
and the food inside along the way.

598
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,770
Thank you.

599
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,010
Goodbye.

600
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,520
Take care.

601
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,100
Yunxi,

602
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,980
take good care of yourself.

603
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,280
Find the antidote soon.

604
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,460
We'll wait for you to come back.

605
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,640
Cousin.

606
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,960
Take good care of Yunxi.

607
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:27,560
Let's go.

608
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,740
Thank you.

609
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,990
We'll wait for you to come back.

610
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,130
Take care of yourself.

611
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,030
Yunxi.

612
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,050
Look.

613
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,780
I made it myself.

614
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:39,700
Try it.

615
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:42,860
Is it good?

616
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,100
Yes, it's sweet.

617
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,140
Wait.

618
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:52,940
I forgot to add sugar.

619
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,400
You said it was sweet even though it didn't taste good.

620
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,340
Everything you make

621
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,110
is sweet.

622
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,860
Don't be perfunctory.

623
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,940
Because I'm with you,

624
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,140
the days are sweet,

625
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,300
my heart is sweet.

626
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,540
and the food is also sweet.

627
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,090
When did you learn

628
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,300
to be so glib-tongued?

629
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,370
How is that glib-tongued?

630
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,840
It's just sweet words.

631
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,050
Really?

632
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,940
I'll try it again.

633
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,980
You're really sweet.

634
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:30,810
What?

635
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,060
Are you not feeling well again?

636
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,420
It's okay.

637
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,389
I just want you to hug me.

638
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,060
The weather is nice these days.

639
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,540
Take me out for a walk.

640
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,600
So

641
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,060
it's so nice

642
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,770
to spend such ordinary days

643
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,230
with you.

644
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,480
I wish

645
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,090
I had met you earlier.

646
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,530
Jiang Chaoxi.

647
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,820
When did you fall in love with me?

648
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,520
Maybe the first time I met you,

649
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,810
I had you in my heart.

650
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,910
But if you ask me when I fell in love with you,

651
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,590
♫I like to be behind you♫

652

I can't explain.

00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,270

♫Even the night breeze becomes gentle♫

655

you somehow

657
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,550
lived into my heart

658
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,810
and occupied it.

659
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,050
Every time my heart beats,

660
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:45,150
♫I feel so happy♫

661

I'll miss you and love you.

What about you?

663
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:51,200
♫Time seems to have stopped♫

664
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,370
When did you fall in love with me?

665
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:48,790
Every time

666
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,420
you appear in front of me,

667
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,090
I fall in love with you.

668
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,930
Every day from now on,

669
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,490
♫I wish to hold your hand♫

670
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,030
I will always appear in front of you

671
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,040
and watch sunrise and sunset with you.

672
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,080
Then you can love me

673
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,910
all the time.

674
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,870
♫Till the end of the day♫

675
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,670
You're so greedy.

♫But I can't escape from fate♫

677
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,460
Wuyan has sent the letter again.

678
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,050
He said

679
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,740
Third Brother had ascended to be the new Master

680
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,070
and had proclaimed a general amnesty.

681

♫In the end, we will part♫

682
