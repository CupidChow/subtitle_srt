4
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,690
You mean...

5
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,680
You mean your brother is still alive?

6
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,600
But if we want to save him,

7
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,930
we must get Fengchi.

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,720
You really suffered a lot all these years.

9
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,140
It's all my fault.

10
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,680
It took me so long to find you.

11
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,330
Brother Fusheng,

12
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,230
how did you know

13
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm here?

14
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,940
All these years,

15
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,860
I've been looking everywhere

16
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,620
for you two.

17
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,050
But I found nothing

18
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,430
until I accidentally saw

19
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,570
the planning map of Cangyue City.

20
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,190
I recognized

21
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,860
that brush thread was exactly like your brother's.

22
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,970
That's why

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,160
I came to Cangyue

24
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,950
with the excuse for cultural exchange.

25
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,340
I didn't expect

26
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,850
it was your work.

27
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,079
Actually,

28
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,470
I've been looking for you

29
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,140
all these years.

30
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:35,680
Alright, girl.

31
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,340
We finally meet again.

32
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,829
It's a good news, girl.

33
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,610
By the way, Brother Fusheng.

34
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,950
Before my brother fell into a coma,

35
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,060
he told me the Swing Painting

36
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,540
is the map to find Fengchi.

37
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,450
But I remember

38
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,910
it was drawn by you and my brother.

39
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,220
Is there any secret in it?

40
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:54,870
Yes.

41
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,950
That painting was indeed

42
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,020
drawn by me and your brother.

43
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,190
But the part he drew

44
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,950
is the key.

45
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,780
I wanted to avoid any suspicion,

46
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:04,970
so I didn't go see him painting it.

47
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,670
Looks like we have to

48
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,910
get the map from Commander Xiao

49
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,780
if we want to find Fengchi.

50
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,620
By the way, Fusheng,

51
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,740
I' ve found out that Commander Xiao

52
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,220
killed my family.

53
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,590
Not only did he steal the Swing Painting,

54
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,500
but also made my brother fall into a coma until now.

55
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,860
Girl.

56
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,680
Promise me.

57
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,490
Don't seek revenge.

58
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,900
Your brother wants you

59
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,880
to live well.

60
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,380
Impossible.

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,520
It's fine if I didn't know.

62
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,630
But now that I know,

63
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,070
I won't let him escape.

64
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,170
But don't worry.

65
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,630
Before I find Fengchi

66
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,600
and save my brother,

67
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,030
I won't do anything.

68
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,620
If your brother knows

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,860
his awakening is

70
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,030
at the price of Fengchi,

71
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm afraid he won't be happy.

72
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,260
By the way,

73
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,990
before your brother fell into coma,

74
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,460
did he give you the white jade comb?

75
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,480
Where is the white jade comb?

76
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,620
Didn't he tell you

77
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,190
that white jade comb

78
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,150
was the key to find Fengchi?

79
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,040
It was urgent at the time.

80
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,740
After my brother gave me the comb,

81
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,580
the accident happened.

82
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,390
No wonder.

83
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,360
Commander Xiao got the Swing Painting

84
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,720
but failed to find Fengchi.

85
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,170
What about the white jade comb?

86
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,370
I...

87
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,649
I took it as a token of love

88
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,980
and gave it to Jiang Chaoxi.

89
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,390
A token of love.

90
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,100
Little girl,

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,440
You've grown up.

92
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,090
Does Jiang Chaoxi know

93
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,850
you don't have much time left?

94
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,420
He doesn't.

95
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,930
So I don't want to drag him down anymore.

96
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:37,909
Girl.

97
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,030
Don't worry.

98
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,250
I will help you find Fengchi.

99
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,690
But the Swing Painting is in Xiao's Mansion.

100
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:46,820
I went there several times

101
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,740
but failed to get it.

102
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,630
I'll figure it out.

103
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,620
As for the white jade comb,

104
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,060
Jiang Chaoxi

105
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,270
won't give me a hard time.

106
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay.

107
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,440
[Liaowu Mansion]

108
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,430
It's already dark.

109
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,950
Why isn't she back yet?

110
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,160
Does she really listen to my words

111
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,060
and won't come back?

112
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,900
No.

113
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,140
Young Master,

114
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,250
Yunxi is thick-skinned.

115
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,820
Besides,

116
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,480
when did she ever listen to you?

117
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,810
Who allowed you to say that about her?

118
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,220
I just feel sorry for you.

119
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,010
Yunxi just knew that Chuyao and

120
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,900
she came home late for him.

121
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,780
Doesn't she know

122
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,900
Young Master is worried about her?

123
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,670
Yes.

124
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,290
No.

125
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,250
What are you talking about?

126
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,650
When did I worry about her?

127
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,270
Young Master, it's good to be honest.

128
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,900
Why isn't she back yet?

129
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,380
You are just

130
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,140
too self-conceited.

131
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,170
That' s why

132
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,810
that Chuyao caught up with you.

133
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:46,500
I...

134
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,100
Yunxi

135
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,360
must be talking business with Chuyao.

136
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,690
She knows what she's doing.

137
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,050
I trust her.

138
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,870
Eat.

139
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,290
Yunxi,

140
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,260
I' m so angry.

141
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,620
You've got the best man

142
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:35,460
in Cangyue City,

143
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,630
but you don't cherish him.

144
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,010
From now on,

145
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,490
I'll break up with you.

146
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,490
Cut off the relationship

147
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,700
under the witness of the melon.

148
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,460
Young Master is wise.

149
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,240
Yunxi snubbed you so much.

150
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,659
It's time to let her feel

151
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,940
the pain of losing you.

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,570
You must break up her completely.

153
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,600
Otherwise, you and I

154
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,390
will be the one being hurt

155
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,380
Break up.

156
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,310
I must break up with her.

157
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:13,570
Young Master.

158
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,420
Break up.

159
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,980
You still know to come back?

160
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,450
What time is it?

161
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,130
Give me back my white jade comb.

162
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,360
What did you say?

163
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,040
I thought about it.

164
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,700
After all,

165
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,280
it is the memory left by my family.

166
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,570
It's better to take it back.

167
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,940
Really?

168
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,670
Do you want to take it back as a souvenir

169
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,630
or give it to someone else?

170
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,620
Let me tell you.

171
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,830
You have already gave it to me.

172
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,360
Even if I throw it away,

173
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,230
or break it into pieces,

174
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,750
I won't return it to you.

175
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,230
You can't break it.

176
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,490
It's the key to find Fengchi.

177
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,090
Great.

178
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,710
Great!

179
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,500
To get back the white jade comb,

180
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,240
you can actually make up this kind of lie.

181
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,390
Do you think I'm a fool?

182
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:18,770
Cousin.

183
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,850
It's me, your dear cousin.

184
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,390
What are you doing?

185
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,300
I don't have time to play with you now.

186
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,790
I'm not here to play with you.

187
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,960
Cousin, do me a favor.

188
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,060
Listen.

189
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,540
Don't cause trouble here.

190
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,370
I can't feel

191
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,180
my heart is pounding.

192
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,560
Am I only interested in Tang Qing?

193
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,040
What are you doing?

194
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,260
Nothing.

195
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,600
I'm just here to tell you.

196
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,910
From now on,

197
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,580
it's impossible between us.

198
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,900
Although we are cousins,

199
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,610
and we are

200
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,790
a match made in heaven,

201
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,070
right now I have someone

202
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,100
who makes my heart beat faster.

203
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,780
The doctor said

204
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,400
I might have fallen in love with someone else.

205
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,620
So please behave yourself

206
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,060
and stop loving me,

207
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,790
in case

208
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,690
you suffer from love because of me.

209
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,510
Suffering from love?

210
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,870
Well, they all

211
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,520
changed so fast.

212
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,350
In just a moment,

213
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,800
I've become

214
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,600
alone.

215
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,860
I don't love anyone anymore.

216
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,800
Young Master,

217
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,380
we still need to eat something.

218
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,010
We can' t go against our health.

219
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,360
Did Yunxi go out again?

220
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,520
Yunxi didn' t go out today.

221
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,190
But Mr. Chu is here.

222
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,380
He actually came to my mansion to meet Yunxi privately.

223
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,760
Do they really think I'm dead?

224
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,460
Young Master.

225
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,740
What a disappointment.

226
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,590
Where have you been

227
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,450
with all the rushing?

228
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,030
I went to see my cousin.

229
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,380
Didn't I tell you

230
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,540
not to find him?

231
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,980
Didn't you ask me to

232
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,870
communicate with my cousin more often

233
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
to develop a relationship?

234
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,030
Or

235
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,140
are you really going to

236
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,640
make me marry my uncle?

237
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,800
Nonsense!

238
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,350
Do you want to be beaten?

239
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,450
Let me tell you.

240
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,090
Don't think too much.

241
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,450
Why would father let you

242
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,150
marry him?

243
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:17,990
Father,

244
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,090
Must all the daughters of the Xiao family

245
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,170
be the Lady of Cangyue City?

246
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,180
Of course.

247
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,240
And I want you to be a person

248
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,620
like your aunt.

249
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,750
But I think

250
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,630
it is enough for our family to have my aunt

251
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,300
as the Lady of Cangyue City.

252
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,050
No.

253
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,280
The position of the Lady of Cangyue City

254
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,530
must be the daughter of the Xiao family.

255
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,400
But...

256
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,890
I think it's better for you

257
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,960
to have another daughter with your concubines

258
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,230
I'll let my future sister

259
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,240
take the position of the Lady of Cangyue City.

260
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,460
How dare you!

261
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,280
Father.

262
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,580
How dare you hit me for my future sister?

263
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,170
I don't want to live anymore.

264
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,740
I'm so mad.

265
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,110
I didn't even do anything.

266
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,470
I've been looking for you outside.

267
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,780
Look at you.

268
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,010
You closed your eyes and slept in silence.

269
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,120
You deserve it.

270
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,020
You must be tired

271
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,730
to lie down like this.

272
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,100
In a few days,

273
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,820
I'll take you away

274
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,350
and enjoy the beautiful scenery in the world.

275
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,030
OK?

276
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,680
My brother's wish

277
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,350
was for the three of us

278
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,580
to travel the world.

279
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,330
If he knows we reunited,

280
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,010
he will be very happy.

281
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,500
Don't worry.

282
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,540
This wish will come true soon.

283
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,390
I've bought a painting from Commander Xiao

284
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,460
at a high price.

285
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,600
This incident caused a sensation

286
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,940
in the whole Cangyue City.

287
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,180
Commander Xiao sent me an invitation.

288
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,210
He invited me to discuss painting skills.

289
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,890
Brother Fusheng,

290
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,140
Xiao's Mansion is heavily guarded.

291
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,390
You must be careful.

292
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,530
Yunxi,

293
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,870
You brought a wild man to see your family.

294
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,900
Where did you put me?

295
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,700
Why aren't you saying anything?

296
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:36,760
Listen.

297
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,430
You must give me

298
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,020
an explanation today.

299
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,660
Otherwise, I won't let it go.

300
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,230
Since you've seen it,

301
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,340
I have nothing to say.

302
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,710
You have nothing to say?

303
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:50,780
Fine.

304
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,660
Is this how you treat me?

305
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,530
You're great.

306
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,650
Girl,

307
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,150
Why are you doing this?

308
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,230
It's better to have a short pain than a long time suffering.

309
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,720
I was too greedy.

310
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,210
Now,

311
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,250
I should bear it.

312
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,610
I fell in love with Tang Qing.

313
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,300
No way.

314
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,490
No way.

315
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,640
Apart from being good-looking

316
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,730
handsome,

317
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,460
and kind to me,

318
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,940
he doesn't seem to have any advantages.

319
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,820
But

320
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,860
he is so handsome.

321
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,180
If he matches me,

322
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,580
it would be a perfect match.

323
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,400
A perfect match.

324
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,740
Miss,

325
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,790
don't you think it's too simple?

326
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,710
Master will never

327
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,620
allow you

328
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,260
to be with Guard Tang.

329
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,500
Things have changed.

330
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,670
My cousin has Yunxi.

331
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,590
He didn't want to marry me anyway.

332
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,510
I don't like

333
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,670
to force him.

334
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,040
As long as my cousin can handle the pressure,

335
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
and they are doing fine,

336
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,440
I will be free.

337
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,540
But I heard that Young Master and Yunxi

338
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,680
are having a fight recently.

339
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,970
They're having a hard time.

340
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,950
Fight?

341
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,250
How does it happen?

342
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,660
No.

343
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,870
They can't fight.

344
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,550
What if Cousin falls in love with me

345
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,020
and wants to marry me?

346
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,350
Hurry up.

347
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,220
Let's go to Young Master's Mansion.

348
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,440
Young Master. Blood! Blood!

349
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,460
Stop shooting!

350
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:55,860
Stop!

351
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,410
Shut up!

352
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,620
If you say one more word,

353
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,540
I'll take you as my target.

354
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,870
Cousin.

355
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,610
Miss Fengyi.

356
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,850
It's dangerous.

357
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,750
What's going on?

358
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,150
Young Master!

359
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,829
Young Master!

360
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,230
Young Master.

361
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:15,859
Cou...

362
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,609
Cousin.

363
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,740
I heard you had a fight with Yunxi.

364
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,710
What happened?

365
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,609
It has nothing to do with you.

366
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,580
Cousin.

367
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,730
Even though Yunxi is not as beautiful as me,

368
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,850
her family background is not as good as mine,

369
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,980
and her temperament is not as elegant as mine,

370
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,920
if you don't compare her with me,

371
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,530
a perfect girl,

372
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,530
Yunxi is an outstanding girl.

373
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,500
Cousin,

374
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,740
how could you

375
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,660
fight with her?

376
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,690
Miss Fengyi, stop it.

377
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,630
It's really not Young Master's fault this time.

378
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,180
It's someone who has changed her feelings.

379
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,420
It's not my cousin's fault.

380
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,900
Then did Yunxi fall in love with someone else?

381
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,420
Cousin,

382
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,810
I'm your family.

383
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,560
No matter how angry you are, you must love me.

384
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,630
There's a handsome boy.

385
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,450
Really?

386
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,960
Cousin, don't be angry.

387
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,370
How about letting me talk to Yunxi for you?

388
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,350
Yunxi used to be a loyal friend

389
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,280
and the little Cupid for us.

390
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,990
Today,

391
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,820
for your happiness,

392
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,140
let me be the little Cupid this time for you and Yunxi.

393
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,940
Cousin, am I a good friend?

394
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,850
Yunxi,

395
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,990
why on earth did you

396
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,060
ignore my cousin?

397
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,590
You two are a perfect match.

398
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,350
Even I, the Lady of the Young Master-to-be,

399
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,360
dropped out for you.

400
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,170
How can you not cherish

401
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,700
your hard-earned marriage?

402
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,520
Or

403
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,510
you don't like him anymore?

404
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,290
You really fell in love with someone else?

405
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,350
Miss,

406
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,820
whether two people can be together for a long time

407
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,230
will be influenced by many things.

408
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,180
It can't just depend on

409
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,130
whether you like him or not.

410
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,710
Like is like.

411
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,150
Dislike is dislike.

412
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,790
It's as simple as that.

413
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,320
Why did you make it so complicated?

414
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,300
So what exactly do you mean

415
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,350
by that?

416
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,980
You can just assume

417
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,280
I don't like him anymore.

418
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,220
My poor cousin.

419
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,750
You changed your heart just like that.

420
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,640
How can you say it

421
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,620
just like that?

422
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,440
My cousin is so pitiful.

423
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,100
Cousin.

424
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:03,940
What did she say?

425
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,790
Cousin.

426
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,610
How about you find someone else to love?

427
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,850
What do you mean?

428
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,870
Yunxi...

429
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,970
Yunxi said she didn't love you anymore.

430
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,580
Cousin,

431
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,760
don't be sad.

432
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,240
I think

433
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,850
since she doesn't love you anymore,

434
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,020
let's not force her.

435
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,030
They all say it's impossible to make a horse drink.

436
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,450
Just look at us.

437
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,400
You don't love me.

438
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,380
So

439
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,020
I gave you up.

440
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,540
Right?

441
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,340
Young Master!

442
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,870
My cousin is really a decisive man.

443
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,980
He doesn't pester or linger.

444
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,220
Good.

445
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,020
My Miss Fengyi,

446
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,580
aren't you going to be the little Cupid

447
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,350
for Young Master

448
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,690
and Miss Yunxi?

449
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:04,820
How did you

450
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,230
make things worse for them?

451
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,210
How could you say that?

452
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,480
It's Yunxi who doesn't like my cousin anymore.

453
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,420
That means they have already come to an end.

454
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,550
How did I possibly make things worse for them?

455
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,640
My fault?

456
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,140
[Xiao's Mansion]

457
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,560
Thank you, Commander.

458
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,150
When drinking with a bosom friend, a thousand cups will still be too little.

459
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,940
And it's rare to meet a bosom friend who is so much younger than me.

460
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,690
Here.

461
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,950
I...

462
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,460
want to make another toast to you.

463
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,950
Commander Xiao is not only good at painting

464
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,380
but also excellent in literature.

465
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,050
I admire you.

466
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,500
The person who knows me best is you.

467
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,990
Chu Yao.

468
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,220
Wait here.

469
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,350
Sit. Sit.

470
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,080
Lord Chu,

471
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,940
this is my latest piece.

472
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,340
Do I have the honor

473
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,040
to present it

474
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,740
to you?

475
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,690
[The Tiger King]

476
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,260
Commander Xiao's masterpiece

477
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,070
really put the other great painters,

478
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,220
like Gu Kaizhi and Dong Qichang,

479
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,030
to a lower place.

480
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,280
Well said.

481
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,700
Lord Chu,

482
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,500
you really have unique eyes and good taste.

483
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,540
Unlike

484
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,740
the other sanctimonious literary men

485
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,750
in Cangyue,

486
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,250
they don't understand

487
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,110
my drawing.

488
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,340
How dare

489
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,000
they question my painting skills

490
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,980
behind my back?

491
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,870
A bunch of useless people.

492
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,660
Useless!

493
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,270
Seeing a painting is like seeing the painter.

494
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,740
The painting can convey

495
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,560
the taste of the painter.

496
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,820
When I saw Commander Xiao's painting,

497
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,020
I knew

498
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,440
you must be a carefree person.

499
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,930
Lord Chu is really good at painting.

500
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,520
To be honest,

501
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,120
there is no painting

502
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,060
in this world that I can't understand.

503
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,640
Paintings are like riddles.

504
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,860
I've been passionate about this since childhood.

505
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,150
If I'm not that confident,

506
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,140
how would I dare to show off this little skill

507
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,190
in front of you?

508
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,470
In that case,

509
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,520
there is a painting

510
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,300
in my mansion.

511
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,410
I've studied it for eight years,

512
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,900
but I found nothing.

513
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,900
How about

514
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,280
you see this and give me some advice?

515
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,430
There's even a painting in the world

516
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,370
that Commander Xiao can't understand.

517
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,630
I must take a look.

518
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:33,860
OK.

519
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,110
Just wait here.

520
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
I'll get it for you.

521
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:40,580
Wait.

522
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,360
Dad, I'm back.

523
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:44,900
Dad!

524
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:45,890
Dad.

525
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:46,780
What are you...

526
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,810
My dear daughter is back.

527
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,930
How much did you drink?

528
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,690
She's my daughter.

529
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,620
You...

530
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,050
Are you drunk?

531
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,050
Drunk?

532
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,840
How could I be drunk?

533
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,550
Ask him if you don't believe me.

534
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,960
How hammered do you want to be?

535
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:02,730
Dad.

536
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,420
Dad!

537
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,920
My dad is drunk.

538
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,470
How about we call it a day?

539
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,850
You can come another day.

540
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,900
Commander Xiao struck me as a bosom friend at first sight,

541
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,250
so we drank happily.

542
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,390
I forgot my manners.

543
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,740
Please forgive me.

544
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,090
It's okay.

545
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,540
Why did you drink that much, Dad?

546
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,710
You can't drink this much next time.

547
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,480
Young Master.

548
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,480
Don't be angry.

549
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,300
There are so many girls in the world.

550
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,900
If this one doesn't like you, try another.

551
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,780
With your family background

552
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,500
and appearance,

553
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,350
you can have any kind of girl you want.

554
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,500
How could she just say that

555
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,810
she doesn't love me anymore?

556
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,270
What the hell does she think I am?

557
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,810
Or did I do something wrong?

558
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,860
You did nothing wrong!

559
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,990
It's all Miss Yunxi's fault.

560
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,140
She doesn't love you

561
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,460
and doesn't know how to appreciate you.

562
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,540
She has no taste!

563
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,050
She has no taste.

564
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,650
I can forgive her for that.

565
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,730
If she doesn't know how to appreciate me,

566
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,920
I can teach her.

567
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,040
But if she doesn't love me anymore,

568
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,690
she must give me an explanation.

569
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:21,900
Young Master.

570
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,910
If you go and ask a girl

571
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,180
whether she loves you or not

572
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,340
just like this,

573
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,190
you just ask for a slap in the face.

574
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,270
Face?

575
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,180
It's not easy

576
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,010
to steal that painting from Commander Xiao.

577
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,890
Brother Fusheng, don't blame yourself.

578
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,360
But

579
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,030
we are running out of time.

580
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,730
Young master still won't

581
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,570
give you back your white jade comb?

582
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,130
I'll get it back as soon as possible.

583
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,180
By then,

584
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,720
we'll leave with my brother.

585
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,730
Great!

586
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,910
Young Master.

587
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,790
I was right.

588
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,340
The reason you tried so hard

589
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,830
to get back

590
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,270
the love token you gave me

591
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,260
is you want to elope with this man!

592
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,250
Please listen to me.

593
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:10,920
What do you have to say?

594
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,700
Yes.

595
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,500
Please return my white jade comb.

596
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,850
You heartless woman.

597
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,130
Don't think I dare not touch you

598
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,360
because you are some goddamn envoy.

599
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,580

If you dare to hurt him,

604
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,740
I won't forgive you.
