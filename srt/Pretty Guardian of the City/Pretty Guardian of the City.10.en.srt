4
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,890
Why is there blood stain?

5
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,330
Did it really happen？

6
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,860
Yunxi and I...

7
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,990
That was not a dream.

8
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,050
Young Master.

9
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,310
Young Master.

10
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,270
I...

11
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:47,980
You're awake.

12
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,140
Yes.

13
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,770
Where is Yunxi?

14
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,840
I don' t know.

15
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,490
She moved back to her room

16
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,390
in the early morning.

17
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,930
She moved out?

18
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,310
Why didn't she tell me?

19
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,820
She is shy.

20
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,630
She actually knows to be shy.

21
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,240
She's being shy.

22
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,940
Did you hear that?

23
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:11,980
No.

24
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,680
Young Master.

25
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,940
What are you doing early this morning?

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,579
I' m exercising.

27
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:43,970
Miss Yunxi.

28
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,780
-Steward Zhu. -You are holding so many things.

29
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,490
Let me help you.

30
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,860
You don't have to, Steward Zhu.

31
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,329
I can do it myself.

32
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,780
Don't be so polite with me.

33
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,930
Let me do it.

34
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,890
Then please send it

35
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,920
to my room.

36
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,160
Okay.

37
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,120
Steward Zhu.

38
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,220
My room is over there.

39
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,070
Miss Yunxi,

40
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,080
Look at me.

41
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,050
I forgot to tell you.

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,290
Young Master has arranged

43
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,440
a new place for you.

44
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,570
This, this is...

45
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,010
Young Master arranged it.

46
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,540
This will be

47
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,290
your new place.

48
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,240
Miss Yunxi, take a look.

49
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,300
Are you satisfied?

50
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,970
Miss Yunxi, please have a look.

51
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,990
Hello, Miss Yunxi.

52
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,520
What are you doing?

53
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,270
It's your lunch.

54
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,080
My lunch?

55
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,880
This is too much.

56
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,750
I'm not suitable for

57
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,460
this enjoyable life.

58
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,530
I'd better

59
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,540
to live with Pepper.

60
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,460
Miss Yunxi,

61
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,720
Young Master values you so much.

62
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,980
Miss Yunxi, please don' t belittle yourself.

63
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,480
You are no longer

64
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,630
who you used to be.

65
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,880
Yunxi. Yunxi.

66
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,000
My good friend.

67
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,100
I'm here to enjoy my life with you.

68
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,830
Pepper.

69
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,660
Miss Yunxi.

70
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,930
Miss Yunxi.

71
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,110
From now on,

72
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,460
your daily life

73
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,290
will be taken care of by Pepper.

74
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,200
If you need anything,

75
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,570
feel free to tell me.

76
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,900
Yunxi,

77
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,540
my good friend.

78
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,530
Yunxi.

79
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,100
Yunxi,

80
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,540
you finally made it.

81
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,320
Don't forget to take me with you.

82
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,620
What are you talking about?

83
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,860
What's going on?

84
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,450
What do you mean?

85
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,890
Young Master likes you

86
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,520
so he naturally indulges you in every aspect.

87
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,720
Do you feel overjoyed

88
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,160
inside now?

89
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,030
I'm not feeling overjoyed

90
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,300
in my heart.

91
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,000
My heart is in a mess now.

92
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,280
Young Master.

93
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,400
How is she? Is she satisfied?

94
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,170
Quite satisfied.

95
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,570
Such a big house.

96
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,070
She even thanked you several times.

97
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,900
It really doesn't waste

98
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,160
my efforts.

99
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,870
Young Master.

100
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,970
I' ve found all the medicine.

101
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,100
Antidote Pill, Antidote Powder, Antidote Plaster.

102
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,500
I' ve brought everything

103
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,280
whether or not you heard them before.

104
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,540
It cost a lot.

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,310
Well done.

106
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,780
Thank you, Young Master.

107
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,870
I'll bring them to

108
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,660
Yunxi now.

109
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,430
Why can't you take the compliment well?

110
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,600
Did I do something wrong again?

111
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,150
If you bring the medicine

112
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,659
to Miss Yunxi,

113
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,600
what excuse does Young Master have

114
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,750
to see Miss Yunxi?

115
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,690
Jiang Chaoxi

116
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,100
suddenly treats me like this.

117
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,880
What does he want?

118
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,540
Why do I feel

119
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,970
feel so uneasy?

120
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,580
Qing.

121
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,870
Why did you move here?

122
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:14,940
I don't know

123
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,770
what's wrong with Young Master, either.

124
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,420
He arranged me here

125
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,220
all of a sudden.

126
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,460
What's the matter?

127
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,060
I went back to Jianjia Alley today

128
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,200
and found this.

129
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,570
Where did you get this?

130
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,370
Baozi got it

131
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,440
from

132
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:36,960
a single-eyed man.

133
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,750
The man was disguised in the demolition team.

134
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,260
He seemed to be inquiring

135
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,020
your brother's whereabouts.

136
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,150
Have you heard of Fengchi?

137
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,910
Fengchi?

138
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,560
Rumor has it that

139
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,160
Fengchi can detoxify all poisons and cure all diseases.

140
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,450
My brother and I

141
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,650
were hunted

142
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,550
because of it.

143
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,170
My original name is Luo Xiyun.

144
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,270
I was born with  the poison of heartburn.

145
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,290
In order to save me,

146
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,970
my brother obtained

147
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,030
the last Fengchi

148
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,180
in the world.

149
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,610
But because I was too young and weak,

150
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,400
I can't take the impact of Fengchi.

151
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,560
That's why the Ghost Doctor

152
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,310
tried so hard to suppress my poison

153
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,210
before I turn 18.

154
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,270
I would take Fengchi

155
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,230
when I was 18.

156
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,490
But unexpectedly,

157
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,260
we were targeted by someone with ulterior motives.

158
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,170
That year...

159
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,570
Let's go down the mountain.

160
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,640
Yun'er, slow down.

161
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,710
Be careful not to fall.

162
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,150
Brother.

163
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,340
When we get to the market,

164
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,860
I'll buy all the delicious food home.

165
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,530
Okay.

166
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,950
Who are you?

167
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,090
Hand over Fengchi and

168
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,490
we'll let you die with a whole body.

169
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,550
I don't have Fengchi.

170
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:55,910
Go.

171
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,740
My brother took me and ran away from hunt.

172
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,680
Then we met Jiang Chaoxi when he was young.

173
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,680
I saw him with my eyes that

174
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,660
he killed my brother.

175
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,470
After I escaped,

176
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,660
I took my brother's words and

177
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,460
went back to look for

178
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,740
the Swing Painting with Fengchi in it.

179
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,530
Let go of me!

180
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,290
I wandered around

181
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,290
until I met you.

182
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,100
Then I had a home in Jianjia Alley.

183
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,500
I knew that since someone took the painting,

184
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,640
I could never find Fengchi.

185
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,310
So I only wanted to avenge my brother.

186
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,690
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,980
I kept my identity from you

188
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,210
and my physical condition.

189
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,200
I made you worry.

190
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,260
We lived under the same roof

191
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,030
for eight years.

192
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,700
How could we not know

193
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,830
your physical condition?

194
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,020
You know?

195
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,690
At the beginning,

196
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,680
your illness relapsed once a year,

197
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,890
so we didn't take it to heart.

198
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,380
But later,

199
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,820
your illness got worse

200
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,870
and relapsed more frequently.

201
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,950
Although you said

202
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,710
you were born weak,

203
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,240
how can we not suspect you

204
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,370
when seeing you in much pain

205
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,060
each time you get sick?

206
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,240
It's just that

207
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,390
we didn't want you to be uncomfortable,

208
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,180
so we pretended not to know.

209
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,250
So Yunxi,

210
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,620
you got the poison of heartburn,

211
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,410
then...

212
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,620
How long can you live

213
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,630
if you don't have Fengchi?

214
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,690
One year at most.

215
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,000
You see.

216
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,420
Since that man is still looking for my brother,

217
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,290
could it be that

218
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,240
he haven't got Fengchi yet?

219
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,180
But now

220
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,890
we don't know where that man is.

221
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,670
As long as I know

222
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,750
they're still looking for Fengchi,

223
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,270
I got an idea to lure them out.

224
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,200
What is it?

225
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,640
OK.

226
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,100
I'll arrange it now.

227
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,380
Young Master.

228
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:28,900
What's the matter?

229
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,390
Nothing.

230
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,180
I just came to see you.

231
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,820
Last night...

232
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,560
I'm fine.

233
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,980
Don't worry.

234
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,200
Wait.

235
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,260
I'm here to give you the medicine.

236
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,030
Medicine?

237
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,710
This is the antidote found by the people I sent

238
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,980
after some hard work.

239
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,150
Although they are not as good as Fengchi,

240
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,980
they still work to some extent.

241
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,740
Thank you, Young Master.

242
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,030
Rest early.

243
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,440
Tell me.

244
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,230
I've worked so hard

245
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,420
to find the medicine for her.

246
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,270
She wouldn't even let me in her room.

247
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,380
What does she mean?

248
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,300
Maybe Yunxi dare not to

249
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,180
break the rules

250
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,570
between men and women.

251
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,730
She still cares about that?

252
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,690
Last night, She and I...

253
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,060
Steward Zhu.

254
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,740
Get rid of the stupid rules

255
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,330
immediately.

256
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,290
Get rid of?

257
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,460
Young Master.

258
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,650
you set the rules yourself.

259
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,490
Why did you do as I say?

260
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,820
Aren't you the head of the Young Master's Mansion?

261
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,580
You have no opinion of your own at all.

262
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,380
Young Master,

263
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,130
I think Miss Yunxi

264
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,480
may want a title.

265
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,030
A title?

266
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,740
Although you dotes on her,

267
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,760
and you've become husband and wife in practice,

268
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,870
-you... -Young Master!

269
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:23,990
Did you already...

270
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,380
But from Miss Yunxi's perspective,

271
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,250
it's still not proper

272
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,050
without a marriage.

273
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,920
Isn't that simple?

274
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,660
You go tell her.

275
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,900
I want to marry her.

276
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,160
You must be joking again.

277
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,750
Even if you like her,

278
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,190
and want to give her a title,

279
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,210
the position of legal wife...

280
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,040
I only choose

281
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,180
the one I like.

282
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,820
But you can't

283
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,020
be so straightforward.

284
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,700
Yunxi

285
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,500
is a girl after all.

286
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,970
Shouldn't you

287
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,230
spend more time on it?

288
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,580
Is this trying to detoxify

289
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,570
or dissolve me?

290
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,610
He looks so proud and domineering.

291
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,280
I didn't expect that he's quite...

292
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,550
This is not the time

293
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,350
to think about this now.

294
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,480
The most important thing

295
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,180
is to find Fengchi and save my brother.

296
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,740
I...

297
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,420
There is a beauty.

298
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,030
I'll never forget once I see her.

299
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,590
One day apart,

300
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,840
I miss her like crazy.

301
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,460
The phoenix flies,

302
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,080
-the Four Seas... -Young Master.

303
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,870
We failed again.

304
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,420
Miss Yunxi has left.

305
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,510
Miss Yunxi has left.

306
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,530
Your head...

307
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,040
You can lower it now.

308
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,940
I can't.

309
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:05,810
Young... Young Master.

310
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,160
I sprained myself.

311
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,630
Young Master.

312
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,859
Be gentle.

313
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,240
Why do you put force your strength so hard with your hands?

314
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,339
Young Master.

315
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,829
Why don't we just give up?

316
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Why do I feel

317
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,990
Miss Yunxi

318
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,230
doesn't want you to be responsible for her?

319
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,980
She doesn't want to?

320
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,550
So I don't need to

321
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,400
take the responsibility anymore?

322
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,670
What kind of person

323
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,500
do you think I am?

324
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,050
The reason I failed for the last two

325
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,870
must be that

326
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,700
I didn't touch her heart.

327
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,050
Looks like

328
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,340
I need to upgrade my tactics.

329
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,530
Ouch!

330
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,360
Sorry, Young Master.

331
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,240
There is a beauty.

332
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,810
I saw her once, and I can't get her out of my mind.

333
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,300
Yunxi?

334
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,380
Yunxi!

335
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,500
Young Master is looking for you.

336
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,760
It's true that they said the willow trees on both sides of the Zhaohe River sprout

337
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,160
in the Lunar March and look like a cloud of green smoke from afar.

338
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,510
This view is truely charming and beautiful.

339
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,050
In spring, the willow buds grow

340
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,320
and remind me of the girl in my heart.

341
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,540
True, true.

342
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,010
In such a beautiful scene,

343
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,310
don't you have anything

344
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,460
to say to me?

345
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,070
Of course!

346
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,460
Young Master,

347
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,590
look at the river!

348
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,970
It's wide and flat.

349
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,940
It's perfect for us to

350
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,140
build a new canal

351
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,310
to develop waterway freight.

352
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,520
It's such a waste

353
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,570
if it's used only for sightseeing.

354
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,590
Last time,

355
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,780
we didn't have eough time to properly survey the river.

356
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:07,820
What a pity.

357
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,320
And I don't have any measuring tools with me now.

358
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,130
But luckily,

359
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,190
my eyesight

360
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
is quite good.

361
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,470
I can visually estimate it.

362
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,460
If you do have good eyesight,

363
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,990
you shouldn't

364
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,810
say this crap at this time.

365
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,500
Young Master, what did you say?

366
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,550
I mean,

367
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,710
it's rare for us to come out for a walk.

368
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,610
Let's not talk about the construction.

369
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,250
Yunxi.

370
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,060
Actually, I have something to say to you.

371
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,550
To be honest...

372
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,420
The first time I saw you,

373
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,730
I thought you were special.

374
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,740
Steady and mature.

375
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,630
Are you sure you're talking about me?

376
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,350
Why are you eating?

377
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,100
Pepper made it.

378
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,200
I thought

379
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,230
I could have some snacks

380
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,650
if I got hungry on the walk.

381
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:17,870
Then I will continue.

382
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,930
You always surprise me

383
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,050
when I'm with you.

384
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,050
There's a mosquito.

385
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,440
It almost bit you just now.

386
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,340
Thank you.

387
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,760
I haven't finished.

388
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,020
When you were in a coma,

389
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,560
I realized

390
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,220
how I could ever live without you.

391
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,500
How important you were to me!

392
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,190
Who wrote it? So cheesy.

393
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,160
Yunxi,

394
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,200
I just want to tell you

395
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,600
I've fallen in love with you.

396
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,100
Isn't that Dr. Qi?

397
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,090
Qi...

398
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,190
Can't you see they're dating?

399
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,610
Don't disturb them.

400
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,390
So that is

401
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,470
Miss Nangong Siyan.

402
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,480
Look at her temperament.

403
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,190
She's really a beauty.

404
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,820
But I think there are many kinds of beauty.

405
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,620
One

406
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,820
is beautiful at first sight.

407
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,390
The other kind is that

408
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,090
the more you look at her, the more beautiful she is.

409
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,560
For example, you.

410
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,620
I found them!

411
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,510
They are over there!

412
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,520
Let's go.

413
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,740
Greetings, Dr. Xian.

414
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,730
Miss!

415
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,150
Come back with me quickly.

416
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,330
When Great Master found out that I was pretending to be you,

417
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,820
he wanted to sell me!

418
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,730
Miss Huayuan, I'm afraid you've got the wrong person.

419
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,820
Your lady is not here.

420
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,580
Please go back.

421
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,370
The one beside you,

422
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,550
who else could she be?

423
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,700
Please

424
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,020
don't make things difficult for us servants.

425
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,470
We're doing this

426
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,610
for our lady's reputation.

427
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,440
You!

428
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,900
You are slandering me!

429
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,570
Dr. Xian,

430
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,040
my Great Master has ordered

431
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,420
to take her back.

432
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,050
Please forgive me.

433
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,680
-Wait. -You...

434
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,320
Take a good look.

435
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,700
Am I your lady?

436
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,610
Then where is my lady?

437
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,540
I was wrong.

438
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,830
I offended you.

439
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,110
Please punish me, Dr. Xian.

440
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,660
Forget it.

441
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,180
It's just a misunderstanding.

442
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,290
Leave now.

443
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,300
Thank you, Dr. Xian.

444
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,260
I'll take my leave.

445
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,240
Don't worry.

446
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,360
They have left.

447
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,050
Come out.

448
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,270
Brother.

449
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,550
Thank you for helping me!

450
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,420
You're welcome, Miss Nangong.

451
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,790
You can just call me Yunxi.

452
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,820
Dr. Qi saved my life.

453
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,230
This thing

454
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,220
is nothing compared

455
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,140
to what he has done for me.

456
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,870
I didn't expect that

457
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,860
I could finally spend some time with Siyan,

458
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,450
but I caused such a trouble.

459
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,070
I'm sorry.

460
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,900
We are brothers.

461
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,680
Don't mention it.

462
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,200
In my opinion,

463
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,590
that stubborn old man

464
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,290
is too obstinate.

465
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,090
You two

466
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,260
clearly love each other,

467
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,510
but he insists on tearing you apart.

468
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,990
Miss Nangong, don't be sad.

469
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,630
As long as you and Dr. Qi

470
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,580
are in love,

471
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,300
no matter how many obstacles you encounter,

472
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,640
you can overcome them.

473
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,660
I've been busy planning my confession all day.

474
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,560
But I didn't expect to help my third brother in the end.

475
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,210
She is so clear

476
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,160
about other people's relationships.

477
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,510
How come she is so slow-witted

478
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,120
about her own business?

479
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,730
She doesn't appear to be clueless about love.

480
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,730
Yunxi,

481
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,220
do you think

482
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,090
as long as two people love each other,

483
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,850
they can overcome all obstacles?

484
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,250
Well...

485
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,210
It depends.

486
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:40,910
What about you?

487
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:45,780
Young Master,

488
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,760
this is not appropriate for me to say this.

489
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,800
In my heart,

490
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,580
I don't need a man.

491
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,810
I only love Cangyue,

492
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,640
the people,

493
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,240
and city construction.

494
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,520
Yunxi,

495
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,370
I'll just say it.

496
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,240
I fancy you.

497
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,080
Don't doubt your hearing.

498
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,110
You heard it right.

499
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,890
I have a crush on you.

500
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,380
When we marry,

501
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,870
you can say you finally

502
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,970
cross the social class divide.

503
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,650
At that time, you can build houses

504
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,120
or villages whenever you want.

505
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,990
You can do whatever you want.

506
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,420
Young Master, I...

507
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,210
Unbelievable, right?

508
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,980
I can't believe myself either.

509
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,780
A handsome

510
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,910
and powerful man like me.

511
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,590
How did I fall for you?

512
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,800
Anyway,

513
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,990
love

514
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,580
is unreasonable.

515
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,710
Although you don't have a good family background,

516
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:42,870
a good appearance,

517
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,530
or an attractive figure,

518
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,110
luckily,

519
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,190
love tends to be unreasonable.

520
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,030
Look.

521
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,750
I bumped into you.

522
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,030
It was an accident.

523
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,370
I have no choice.

524
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,470
Look how excited you are.

525
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,720
Your face is red.

526
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,320
Don't be shy!

527
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,490
Say it loudly.

528
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,440
I do!

529
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,790
I...

530
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,100
Go to hell!

531
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,320
Be gentle.

532
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,260
It hurts!

533
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,520
Is Yunxi

534
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,200
crazy?

535
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,100
It's fine that she won't accept me,

536
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,940
but she punched me!

537
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,290
What a shrew!

538
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,860
Young Master,

539
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,850
after hearing what you said,

540
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,440
I think Miss Yunxi

541
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,690
really cares about the people and the city construction.

542
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,860
She has great love.

543
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,440
On the contrary,

544
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,630
you said that

545
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,420
she doesn't have a good family background; she is plain

546
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,680
and has an average figure.

547
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,220
You're being insensitive.

548
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,730
Then you tell me,

549
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,890
why didn't she accept me?

550
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,390
Is it because of

551
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,340
my words?

552
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,590
Not really.

553
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,840
Could it be

554
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,830
Miss Yunxi and you

555
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,070
haven't reached the "three rescue" condition?

556
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,040
You have a point.

557
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,420
Why didn't I think of it?

558
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:04,870
Do you have any idea?

559
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,470
It's easy!

560
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,900
I'll put Yunxi in danger.

561
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,130
You'll save her.

562
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,270
You're so rush.

563
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,020
Why are you so impulsive?

564
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,910
What if your sharp sword

565
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,040
hurts her?

566
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,590
How can you save her if I don't hurt her?

567
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,160
Don't you dare hurt her!

568
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,830
Young Master, how about I use this?

569
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,490
Short weapons. I have a very steady hand.

570
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,190
When I get close to Miss Yunxi

571
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:28,810
and take action,

572
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,290
you come in time and stop me!

573
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,510
This won't do either.

574
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,470
This dagger is too dangerous.

575
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,280
If we can't cooperate well,

576
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,260
we'll hurt her too.

577
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,490
What should we do?

578
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,280
Use this!

579
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,140
I told you

580
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,330
you could only marry the young master!

581
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,790
Why did you

582
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,530
meet Jiang Chuxian secretly several times?

583
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,340
If others see you,

584
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,330
what about the reputation

585
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
of our Nangong family?

586
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,710
Do you admit your mistake?

587
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,650
Do you admit your mistake?

588
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,680
Remember!

589
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,370
As long as I

590
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,630
am alive,

591
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,420
you and Jiang Chuxian

592
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,930
will never be together.

593
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,330
I...

594
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,630
I...

595
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,110
You're raw and bleeding.

596
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,910
There's almost no good skin on you.

597
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,690
Great Master is so cruel.

598
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,590
If Dr. Xian knows,

599
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,850
he'll be heartbroken.

600
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,500
Don't tell him!

601
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,090
I don't know why Great Master

602
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,370
insists on your marrying Young Master.

603
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,140
Dr. Xian is generous and kind,

604
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,020
and he values friendship!

605
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,420
He is obviously more suitable for you

606
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,100
than the young master.

607
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,610
The position of the Master of Cangyue City

608
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,640
has always been passed down to the elder, not the wiser.

609
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,960
My grandfather cares a lot about the city.

610
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,580
He devoted everything to cultivate me.

611
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,460
How could he allow me

612
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,360
to marry Dr. Xian?

613
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,590
Miss.

614
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,110
In that case,

615
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,410
it is better to end the pain sooner rather than later.

616
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,740
Why don't you break up

617
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,320
with Dr. Xian?

618
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,930
If the Great Master finds out

619
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,300
you sneak out to meet him again,

620
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,310
he will punish you more than he has already.

621
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,920
True love is like real gold.

622
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,980
It will definitely be able to endure many tests.

623
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,000
I believe in myself

624
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,730
and him.

625
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,560
What should I do?

626
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,650
Greetings, Aunt.

627
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,340
Fengyi.

628
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,300
Come here.

629
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,040
Sit here.

630
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,920
Aunt.

631
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:10,940
What's wrong?

632
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,910
It's rare for you to visit me

633
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,730
in the Master's Mansion.

634
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,500
Why are you still pouting?

635
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,240
Who made my niece

636
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,090
angry?

637
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,200
It was me who made my cousin angry.

638
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,750
I punished

639
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,170
a girl in his mansion.

640
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,380
I might have punished her a little too severely.

641
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,600
My cousin still won't talk to me.

642
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,590
I thought it was something serious.

643
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,130
Once men

644
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,210
become interested in

645
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:34,900
some women,

646
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,260
it's normal for them to ignore others.

647
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,790
He'll get sick of that girl soon.

648
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,380
Don't worry about it.

649
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,340
I promise.

650
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,230
No one can take

651
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,730
the position of the legal wife of the young master away from you.

652
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,810
But my cousin

653
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,040
must hate me now.

654
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,840
You silly.

655
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,370
Xi'er is playful and forgetful.

656
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,010
After some time,

657
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,600
you can go to his mansion with some excuses.

658
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,220
Don't mention anything.

659
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,560
Just pretend nothing happened.

660
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,990
And everything will be over.

661
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,500
Really?

662
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,680
Yes.

663
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,580
[Xiao's Mansion]

664
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,730
Master.

665
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,060
Master!

666
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:50,860
Master.

667
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,070
Why are you in such a hurry?

668
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,730
You scared me.

669
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,580
What is it?

670
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,600
Master, we've got news about Fengchi.

671
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,280
Really?

672
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,060
Where is it?

673
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,490
Our men found that

674
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,700
someone in the city wanted to sell Fengchi.

675
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,190
Sell it?

676
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,130
It can't be.

677
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,970
Doesn't Luo Hexuan

678
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,140
want to use it

679
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,100
to save his sister?

680
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,180
Why would he sell it?

681
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,470
Maybe

682
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,510
after so many years,

683
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,540
something happened

684
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,380
to Luo Hexuan and his sister.

685
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,420
Or maybe

686
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,750
they have been killed

687
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,710
