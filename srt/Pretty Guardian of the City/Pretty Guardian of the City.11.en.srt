4
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,789
She likes me.

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,320
She doesn't like me.

6
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,430
Perhaps

7
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,460
she likes me.

8
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,550
She doesn't like me.

9
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,540
She likes me.

10
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,990
But it seems

11
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,290
she doesn't like me.

12
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,060
She definitely likes me.

13
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,620
She must

14
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,490
like me,

15

the Young Master.

16
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,410
What's your problem?

17
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,490
Sorry. I didn't mean it.

18
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,110
By the way, Young Master,

19
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,100
our secret source reported

20
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,250
unusual movements in Xiao's Mansion.

21
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,150
They seem to have found Fengchi.

22
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,670
Fengchi?

23
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:45,870
Has…

24
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,970
Has it fallen into my uncle's hands?

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,350
Not yet.

26
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,090
The trade will happen tonight.

27
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,820
Tonight?

28
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,140
No.

29
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,460
I must get Fengchi.

30
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,150
We're running out of time.

31
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,580
Let's go.

32
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,400
Young Master,

33
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,320
leave it to me.

34
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,410
At this critical moment,

35
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,600
anything you do

36
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,210
may alert Commander Xiao.

37
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,280
You have a point.

38
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,460
You smart ass.

39
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,460
Since that's the case,

40
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,910
you set off now

41
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,880
and bring Fengchi back no matter what.

42
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes.

43
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,170
We'll be able to save Luo Hexuan.

44
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,610
Hope Fengchi

45
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,260
is an antidote to all poisons.

46
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,250
You have something for sale?

47
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,340
What's your asking price?

48
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,459
50,000 taels of gold.

49
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,750
50,000?

50
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,720
You're asking a lot.

51
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,260
Did you bring it with you?

52
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,360
Show me.

53
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,170
That's it?

54
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,140
How can I know if it's fake?

55
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,310
Do you know

56
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,840
where I got the pill?

57
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:55,900
Where?

58
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,380
Eight years ago,

59
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,930
I stopped by a shabby temple

60
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,530
and met a brother and sister.

61
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,310
The brother was severely injured.

62
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,180
and knew he'd die soon.

63
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:06,850
Therefore,

64
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,460
he told his sister

65
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,580
to go where Fengchi was hidden to get it.

66
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,110
Lucky me.

67
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,390
I overheard them.

68
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,400
Besides,

69
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,960
I also tied up the loose ends.

70
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,420
This pill has been in my hands

71
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,150
for eight years.

72
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,930
I planned to save it for myself.

73
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,610
But

74
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,020
I'm too strong to fall ill.

75
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,760
I need food more than I need it.

76
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,580
I'm at the end of my rope.

77
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,750
So I decided to sell it.

78
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,770
If you don't believe me,

79
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,909
don't trade with me.

80
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,380
I can sell it to someone else.

81
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,850
Wait.

82
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,120
I'll buy it.

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,760
I want not only the pill,

84
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,940
but also your life.

85
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,270
What are you doing?

86
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,560
Give me Fengchi.

87
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,060
[Xiao's Mansion]

88
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,630
This is the real Fengchi?

89
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,140
I've gone through so much to finally get it.

90
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,000
Once I eat it,

91
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,620
I can greatly extend my life

92
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,380
and enjoy riches for hundreds of years.

93
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,740
Wait, my lord.

94
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,010
In my opinion,

95
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,840
this pill hasn't been authenticated.

96
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,730
It may be fake.

97
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,450
Why don't we have a physician examine it?

98
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,450
You can take it

99
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,600
after we know for sure it's real.

100
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,780
You're right.

101
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:42,690
Go.

102
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,380
Summon a physician to check it out.

103
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,340
Yes.

104
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,530
The man selling Fengchi

105
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,920
escaped during the fight.

106
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,620
This matter looks a bit fishy to me.

107
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,500
That guy seemed to intend on

108
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,790
letting Commander Xiao get the pill.

109
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,040
Do you think this was a trap?

110
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,530
Yeah.

111
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,360
I've got Fengchi

112
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,970
but was attacked suddenly.

113
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,900
Commander Xiao's man

114
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,340
took the opportunity to take Fengchi away.

115
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,360
It might be a trap,

116
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,270
but it also might be not.

117
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,560
Seems that I have to

118
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,770
visit Xiao's Mansion in person.

119
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,940
Commander Xiao wouldn't

120
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,940
simply hand Fengchi over to us.

121
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:36,730
Even Ham is smarter than you.

122
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,549
I'm going to

123
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,770
get it by force!

124
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,510
Careful. We may be overheard.

125
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,980
The clock is ticking.

126
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,600
I'll sneak into Xiao's Mansion tonight.

127
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,390
I hope my uncle

128
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,340
hasn't eaten Fengchi.

129
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,600
I'll go get prepared.

130
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,340
Prepare for what?

131
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,640
Prepare for what?

132
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,410
Look at yourself.

133
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,570
You can't even take me down

134
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,610
and are injured now.

135
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,250
Can you be of any help?

136
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,180
But...

137
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,820
Shut up.

138
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,410
Cut the crap.

139
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,790
Once I take action,

140
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,820
only success will follow.

141
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,750
You've been looking at it for so long.

142
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,360
Tell me.

143
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,040
Can this pill extend my life?

144
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,060
Commander Xiao,

145
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,580
I've examined it carefully,

146
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,500
but I can only

147
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,590
recognize rhubarb

148
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,690
and Senna leaves.

149
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,340
Shut up.

150
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,650
What are you talking about?

151
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,440
Put it plainly.

152
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,680
In other words,

153
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,140
this is just an ordinary laxative pill.

154
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,260
What do you mean?

155
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,250
Laxative?

156
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,500
That's impossible.

157
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,750
That man told me

158
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,660
a very convincing story about the pill.

159
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,540
How could it be a laxative pill?

160
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,820
Why don't you examine it again?

161
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,230
Maybe I'm not knowledgeable enough.

162
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,770
I really can't tell

163
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,480
what's special

164
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,730
about this pill.

165
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,870
If you don't trust my judgment,

166
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,090
ask other physicians to examine it.

167
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,010
Well…

168
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,750
Commander Xiao, you can't do that!

169
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,580
No, my lord.

170
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,940
No!

171
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:09,800
It's okay.

172
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,990
Even if it's fake,

173
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,300
I'll only have diarrhea.

174
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,440
What if it's true?

175
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,400
What if it's true?

176
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,010
My lord, it's too risky.

177
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,250
It's okay.

178
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:17,960
Listen.

179
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,440
I'm fine.

180
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,240
Look at me.

181
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,770
My lord!

182
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,450
Commander Xiao.

183
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,060
[Xiao's Mansion]

184
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,250
How could it be fake?

185
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,050
My Fengchi.

186
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,670
Again?

187
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,560
Someone actually arrived before me.

188
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,070
Is he looking for Fengchi too?

189
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,080
Who is it?

190
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,070
Assassin!

191
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,020
How dare you!

192
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,000
How dare you break into Xiao's Mansion!

193
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,600
You'll die here tonight!

194
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,130
Get out of my way!

195
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,210
One more.

196
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,840
Have you taken my house

197
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,100
as some tourist site?

198
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,880
Take them down!

199
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,010
[Breeze and Moon]

200
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,100
Wuyan.

201
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,180
Young Master, what happened?

202
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,350
Careful.

203
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,300
Watch your step.

204
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,210
Young Master, careful.

205
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,480
Young Master, what happened?

206
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,060
He was stabbed by Commander Xiao.

207
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,740
I'll go find a physician.

208
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,250
Wait.

209
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,260
I'll go.

210
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,710
Everyone knows you work for Young Master.

211
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,710
You may easily get exposed.

212
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,020
Yunxi,

213
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,590
be careful.

214
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,370
Young Master, you...

215
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,450
My lord?

216
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,270
Take a look.

217
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,350
Can you recognize that fabric?

218
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,760
My lord,

219
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,170
it's just a piece of normal black cloth.

220
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,470
But the silk thread on it

221
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,680
is the expensive Huzhou silk.

222
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,840
If he's not just a normal thief,

223
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,420
he must have come for Fengchi

224
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,780
after hearing about it.

225
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,210
If I hadn't eaten

226
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,940
that fake Fengchi,

227
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,940
a kung fu master like me

228
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,250
wouldn't have let

229
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,120
those two thieves escape.

230
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,660
Commander,

231
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,220
we followed them to Xinan Street

232
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,140
and lost them there.

233
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,220
It's okay.

234
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,480
I stabbed him.

235
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,170
He was badly injured.

236
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,590
Without a doctor

237
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,760
to treat his wound,

238
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,770
he won't last long.

239
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,530
Do as I command.

240
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,320
Keep a close eye on all the infirmaries in the city.

241
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,600
Don't even leave out the medical records

242
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,610
in the Master's Mansion.

243
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,770
Let's see

244
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,550
how they can get off.

245
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,270
Yes.

246
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,250
My lord, you...

247
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,310
It's too late.

248
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,910
Why are you arresting me?

249
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,340
Move!

250
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,340
Behave!

251
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,700
What did we do?

252
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,510
Why are you arresting us?

253
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,220
Move!

254
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,920
My children and parents need me!

255
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:50,850
Thank you.

256
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,510
Dr. Qi.

257
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,400
Dr. Qi.

258
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,590
Yunxi, why did you come?

259
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,540
I don't have time to explain.

260
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,110
Come with me.

261
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:55,620
Stop!

262
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,040
Who are you?

263
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,620
Commander Xiao gave the order

264
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,180
to close down all infirmaries in the city.

265
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,500
From today onwards,

266
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,849
no doctor is allowed to treat any patient.

267
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,770
Anyone disobeying the order will be executed.

268
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,030
Dr. Xian,

269
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,700
you don't want to go against

270
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,660
Commander Xiao, do you?

271
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,210
Since it's Commander Xiao's order,

272
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,329
I'll comply with it.

273
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,099
Miss,

274
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,660
come another time.

275
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,710
Okay.

276
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,359
Dr. Qi, I'll come another time.

277
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,020
Wuyu, let's go.

278
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,530
Wait.

279
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,609
Commander Xiao ordered

280
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,109
all physicians

281
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,820
to be kept in one place.

282
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,040
Although you have status, Dr. Xian,

283
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,490
we can't

284
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,700
make an exception for you.

285
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,120
Please cooperate.

286
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
You've gone too far!

287
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,260
Don't worry.

288
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,730
I will cooperate.

289
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,880
Miss, you can go back now.

290
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,700
Stop!

291
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,040
Who are you?

292
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,380
I'm here to see Dr. Qi.

293
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,200
In the middle of the night?

294
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:03,780
Go away!

295
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,460
Why are you so fierce?

296
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,210
Where is the physician?

297
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,260
Commander Xiao has ordered

298
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,860
to block all the hospitals and medicine stores in the city.

299
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,300
Doctors are not allowed to practice medicine.

300
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,220
Even Dr. Xian

301
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,160
has been guarded.

302
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,170
Then what should we do?

303
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,180
Young Master's sword injury is serious.

304
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,700
All right.

305
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,020
Turn around.

306
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,900
When did you learn to be shy?

307
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,200
What's wrong?

308
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,360
Why are you pulling a long face?

309
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,720
I'm fine.

310
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,300
Smile.

311
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,000
Young Master.

312
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:00,980
Why is he here?

313
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,480
Clean it away.

314
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,360
Okay.

315
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,120
Steward Zhu.

316
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,000
Why are you here?

317
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,140
What are you talking about?

318
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,990
It's time for Young Master to sleep.

319
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,960
I'm here to serve him.

320
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,840
Young Master

321
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,720
doesn't need us to serve him today.

322
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:23,810
Well.

323
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,360
Miss Yunxi is here.

324
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,980
I shouldn't have bothered.

325
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,690
Why are you

326
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,680
so insensitive?

327
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,830
Since Yunxi is here,

328
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,310
why don't you leave now?

329
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:36,710
I...

330
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,150
It seems

331
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,410
that Master's wish for a grandson

332
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,370
will come true soon.

333
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,880
Do you know

334
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,340
what we need to make it come true?

335
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,190
Decoction of Ten Powerful Tonics!

336
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,450
Let's go.

337
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,530
Let's go.

338
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,920
Have a good rest.

339
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,620
I'll find a way

340
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,560
to send for Dr. Xian.

341
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,340
Don't go.

342
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,210
It'll be toublesome

343
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,610
if you go out and let Zhu Wen find out.

344
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,420
Steward Zhu is on your side,

345
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,690
isn't he?

346
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,160
He is,

347
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,900
and he treats me well.

348
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,250
But he's my father's man.

349
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,540
If my father finds out,

350
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,430
it'll be chaotic.

351
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,850
But you're badly injured.

352
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,020
You should get someone to treat you.

353
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,310
Look.

354
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,450
I'm fine.

355
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,950
It's not as serious as you think.

356
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,900
You

357
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,420
stay here.

358
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,330
Don't go anywhere.

359
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,520
We can't act rashly now,

360
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,880
or Commander Xiao will suspect

361
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,750
me.

362
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,190
That'll be troublesome.

363
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,900
Why are you

364
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,910
so afraid of Commander Xiao, Young Master?

365
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,530
Isn't he your uncle?

366
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,750
Besides,

367
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,410
you deliberately

368
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,070
pretend to be a dandy in front of him.

369
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,810
That's

370
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,790
exactly what he wants.

371
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,670
After all, he wants

372
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,860
an obedient

373
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,180
and foolish

374
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,360
heir for future Master.

375
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,780
So,

376
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,070
there's quite a gap

377
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,000
between you and Commander Xiao.

378
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,910
Why do you have so many questions?

379
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,310
I haven't asked you yet.

380
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,520
Why did you appear in the Xiao's Mansion?

381
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,220
I heard

382
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,410
Commander Xiao got Fengchi.

383
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,300
I also wanted to get Fengchi

384
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,330
to detoxify me.

385
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,730
What kind of poison

386
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,560
did you get?

387
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,820
Didn't I tell you

388
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,610
last time?

389
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,140
It's my turn to ask you.

390
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,870
Then why did you go to the Xiao's Mansion?

391
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,710
I...

392
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,150
I went for Fengchi too.

393
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,680
Why were you looking for it?

394
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,760
I'll tell you later.

395
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,080
You got hurt so badly.

396
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,470
You shouldn't have saved me.

397
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,580
You're my girl after all.

398
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,890
You always talk without thinking.

399
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,740
I didn't agree to your confession.

400
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,030
I'm just a surveyor

401
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,910
you hired.

402
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Young Master, have a good rest.

403
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,360
Are you leaving again?

404
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:29,740
I...

405
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,610
I'm already like this.

406
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,830
Can't you stay with me?

407
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,870
I'm injured so badly.

408
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,990
What if something happens to me?

409
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,110
There's no one by my side.

410
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,650
OK. I'll stay.

411
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,040
Yunxi,

412
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,250
I confessed my love to you last time...

413
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,280
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

414
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,390
Last time, I was too impatient

415
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,210
and said something wrong.

416
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,130
It was my fault.

417
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,420
Actually, I think

418
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,630
you like me.

419
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,030
I am confident that my charm is unstoppable.

420
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,560
Maybe our identity is different,

421
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,840
or you have some concerns

422
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,150
which are inconvenient to express,

423
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,110
but it's okay.

424
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,410
I like you.

425
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,160
Don't worry.

426
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,040
We will

427
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,870
be together.

428
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,830
I won't be the Master in the future.

429
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,490
Let's live

430
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,430
an ordinary life,

431
00:23:59,500 --> 00:23:59,980
shall we?

432
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:08,910
♫Count the sorrows, who help each other in straits with feeble strength?♫

433
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,680
Already asleep?

434
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,760
♫There will be a pure place to expel the karma♫

435
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,040
So inattentive.

436
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,170
♫Unexpectedly, not until the pomp ended♫

437
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,710
♫Can I understand the unforgettable feeling♫

438
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:28,690
♫The hair has been grey, while the destiny can't be seen through♫

439
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,040
Let's go to sleep.

440
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:34,940
♫Luckily, my heart remains the same when all the flowers fall♫

441
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,870
♫I've been waiting for you for a thousand years♫

442
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,690
♫Dream that we are on the old road we met♫

443
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,620
♫See you gently play the zither♫

444
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:55,020
♫Who are you waiting for to make you a pot of tea?♫

445
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,170
I like you.

446
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,060
I like you.

447
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,870
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

448
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,510
Let me see your wound.

449
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,140
Don't worry.

450
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:00,640
It's okay.

451
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,560
I'll deal with it.

452
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,670
I like you.

453
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,030
I like you.

454
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,440
Yunxi, what are you burning?

455
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:45,730
Pepper.

456
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,990
Why do you always walk

457
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,590
like a ghost?

458
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,190
Can you come in with a breath next time?

459
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,000
A quiet conscience sleeps in thunder.

460
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:57,950
Yunxi,

461
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,500
do you have any secrets?

462
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,560
I'm unlucky these days.

463
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,710
I burn something

464
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,490
to get rid of bad luck.

465
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,140
What bad luck?

466
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,080
You are lucky!

467
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,510
Yunxi,

468
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,960
where did you sleep last night?

469
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,870
Don't tell me

470
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,720
you slept in your own room last night.

471
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,140
I won't believe that.

472
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,120
I was busy drawing in the study.

473
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,340
Drawing?

474
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,260
But why did other maids say

475
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,990
there was no light in the study?

476
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,520
Did you draw in the dark?

477
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,970
Why is there

478
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,660
blood on your clothes?

479
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,480
Oh no!

480
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,180
What are you looking at?

481
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,690
Here.

482
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,370
Don't think too much.

483
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,040
I...

484
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,780
I understand.

485
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,700
Pepper.

486
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,070
Don't

487
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,850
fabricate rumors.

488
00:27:59,270 --> 00:27:59,830
Yunxi.

489
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,080
Who am I?

490
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,250
I won't talk nonsense.

491
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:07,590
Let's go.

492
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,690
It's definitely true this time.

493
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,710
I'm Yunxi's best friend.

494
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,790
When she becomes

495
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,820
Young Master's wife,

496
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,450
I'll also be successful.

497
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,240
At that time, I'll

498
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,570
promote you.

499
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,380
What's wrong?

500
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,210
Are you all too excited to talk?

501
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,460
I'll get back to work first.

502
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:46,770
Guard Tang.

503
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,040
When did you come?

504
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,150
What do you want to eat?

505
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,020
I'll prepare it for you.

506
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,980
Is what you said true?

507
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,430
Of course.

508
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:53,900
I love to spread

509
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,660
secrets in the mansion,

510
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
but I have evidence.

511
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,980
I never make up stories.

512
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:02,320
Young Master.

513
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,820
The wound is serious.

514
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,090
If this goes on,

515
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,300
I'm afraid

516
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,780
you can't hold on.

517
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,730
The wound was not treated promptly last night.

518
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,760
But I think

519
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,100
Commander Xiao wouldn't dare

520
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,860
to close the hospitals for too long.

521
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,590
Young Master.

522
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,550
Young Master.

523
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,410
Let me help you wash up.

524
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,380
Steward Zhu.

525
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,580
Young Master is hungry.

526
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,130
Go prepare breakfast.

527
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,450
Leave the rest to me.

528
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,750
Alright.

529
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,400
I'll ask the kitchen to add two more dishes.

530
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,350
Blood.

531
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,330
Young Master, why is there blood?

532
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,610
I'll go get the physician.

533
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,480
-Wait. -Wait.

534
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,250
Don't go!

535
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,470
Why, Young Master?

536
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,090
I have my reasons.

537
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,420
Hemorrhoids?

538
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,300
Yes.

539
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,870
Hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids.

540
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:16,840
Lower your voice.

541
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,100
Do you want the whole Cangyue City

542
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,600
to know it?

543
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,090
Young Master.

544
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,030
But you are still young.

545
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,430
How did you get this disease?

546
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,020
Last night,

547
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,160
when I went to the toilet,

548
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,310
I just...

549
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,350
Overexertion.

550
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,580
Yes! I overexerted.

551
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,480
But Young Master's illness

552
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,240
does spoil the image.

553
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,580
But we have to cure it.

554
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,570
I'd rather die than cure it.

555
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,910
Let me tell you.

556
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,690
If anyone spreads this out

557
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,810
and makes me lose face,

558
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,430
I'll make you lose your souls.

559
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,050
Wait.

560
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,580
My illness...

561
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,400
My breakfast needs to be light.

562
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
It'll be light and oil-free.

563
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:03,980
Young Master.

564
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,500
I'll go

565
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,420
and find out

566
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,460
where Dr. Xian is detained.

567
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,870
[Xiao's Mansion]

568
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,700
Master,

569
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,150
all the doctors

570
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,570
in the hospitals

571
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,570
and even the physicians in the Master's Mansion

572
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,220
have been guarded.

573
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,710
But we didn't find

574
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,780
any trace of the assassin.

575
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,900
No hurry.

576
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,980
I stabbed him.

577
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,480
I know best

578
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,320
about how bad he was hurt.

579
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,740
Without a doctor,

580
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,290
he can't be cured

581
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,650
by only relying on the medicine for knife wounds.

582
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,800
If he doesn't show up today,

583
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,640
keep

584
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,860
locking those doctors up.

585
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,310
Let's see

586
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,140
how long this fellow can stick it for.

587
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,020
Yes.

588
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,760
[Young Master is injured.]

589
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,460
Young Master is injured.

590
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,230
Qing.

591
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,620
What's wrong?

592
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,700
Why are you pouting?

593
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:28,910
Yunxi,

594
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,180
did you really

595
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,890
stay with Young Master in the same room last night?

596
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,020
Should I tell Qing the truth?

597
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,170
If I tell him...

598
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,370
Commander Xiao. Here you are.

599
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,670
Young Master is still in the bedroom.

600
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,790
I'll send someone to inform him.

601
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,260
Don't be so polite.

602
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:47,980
Commander Xiao,

603
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,560
we'd better go to the front hall

604
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,490
and have tea.

605
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:53,880
Well...

606
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,310
I'll explain to you later.

607
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,110
Yunxi.

608
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,880
Commander Xiao.

609
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,270
Yunxi.

610
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,030
Commander Xiao, Young Master is having a rest.

611
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,270
Commander Xiao, be careful.

612
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,390
Commander Xiao.

613
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,560
What are you doing?

614
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:20,830
Commander Xiao,

615
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,210
let's have tea in the front hall.

616
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,710
Commander Xiao. Commander Xiao.

617
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,320
You can't go in.
