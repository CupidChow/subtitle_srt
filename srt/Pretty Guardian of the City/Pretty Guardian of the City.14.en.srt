Tang Qing.

5
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,700
How dare you attack city guards!

6
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:58,850
Soldiers!

7
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,740
Get him!

00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,470
Young...

9
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,500
Shut up!

10
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,550
Tell me.

11
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,100
What happened?

12
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,810
We're just carrying out an order.

13
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,140
The order is

14
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,210
that we pay every household five taels of silver

15
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:18,420
and empty Jianjia Alley within ten days

16

by hook or by crook.

Get lost!

18
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,460
Bravo! Bravo!

19
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,550
We'll be in trouble.

20
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,410
Yunxi,

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,730
those men are the city guards.

22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,000
Leave with your men now.

23
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,150
Don't get yourself into trouble.

24
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,240
Sir, don't worry.

25
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,560
It's not a big problem.

26
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,320
Mr. Liu, don't worry.

27
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,300
We can handle it.

28
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
A perfect match.

29
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,130
So handsome.

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,820
So good-looking.

31
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,200
He's stunning.

32
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,200
He's a knockout.

33
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:07,970
Coming through.

34
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:09,840
Hey,

35
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,980
he's the first exalted guest

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,370
to our compound.

37
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,760
It's rude of you

38
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,910
to stare at him like this.

39
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:17,930
Leave.

40
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,060
Mind your own business.

41
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:19,670
Hurry up.

42
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,750
Go.

43
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:21,880
Go away.

44
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,500
Go play over there.

45
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,290
Stop looking.

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,570
Help yourself.

47
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,100
Xu,

48
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,190
go and make

49
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,410
something delicious

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,350
to treat

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,180
our first son-in-law

52
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,570
in the compound.

53
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,630
Uncle Jin,

54
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,990
what are you talking about?

55
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,320
Are you shy?

56
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,130
Shut up. Go serve the tea.

57
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,110
Aunt Xu,

58
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,329
this is Mr. Jiang,

59
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:50,620
a friend working

60
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,450
in Young Master's Mansion with me.

61
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,579
Nice to meet you, madam.

62
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,180
I came in a hurry today

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,610
and didn't have time to prepare a gift.

64
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,380
Please forgive me.

65
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,180
So phony.

66
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,010
Yunxi.

67
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,770
Come and help me cook.

68
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,310
It's raw.

69
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,339
Yunxi,

70
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,060
tell me the truth.

71
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,380
Are you in a relationship

72
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,610
with that Mr. Jiang?

73
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:23,980
Aunt,

74
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,300
I...

75
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,900
I've been there before.

76
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,290
I have to warn you.

77
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,460
You don't have to say it but I can tell

78
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,340
that Mr. Jiang is not a commoner.

79
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,010
Falling in love is easy,

80
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,870
but he's of high status

81
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,340
and you're just a commoner.

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,890
Love won't be the antidote

83
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,980
to all your problems in the future.

84
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:47,810
Again.

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,670
Look at you.

86
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,280
You're just like me back then,

87
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,430
blinded by love.

88
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,320
Luckily,

89
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,900
I corrected my mistake.

90
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,650
I doubt that.

91
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,820
You were simply stupid.

92
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,590
Yunxi is very clever.

93
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,180
Anyway, I like that guy.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,740
Yunxi,

95
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,630
you're a normal girl

96
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,880
and should marry a normal man.

97
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,210
Qing is a good choice.

98
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,710
He always cares for you.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,400
Aunt,

100
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,440
that's nonsense.

101
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,890
Qing takes me as his sister.

102
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,170
I only see him as my brother.

103
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,850
Don't play dumb.

104
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,310
I don't believe you can't see

105
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,390
that he has feelings for you.

106
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,460
I know,

107
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,370
all these years,

108
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,270
he has never told you

109
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,420
how he feels about you.

110
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,780
But what he's done for you

111
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,460
speaks volumes.

112
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,110
Aunt,

113
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,610
don't say something like this again.

114
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,600
I only treat Qing as my brother

115
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,270
and will always do.

116
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,860
Qing,

117
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,040
do you think

118
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,210
Yunxi and that gentleman are a good match?

119
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,380
It doesn't matter

120
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,150
whether they are a good match or not.

121
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,790
It will work as long as they love each other.

122
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:03,860
Yunxi,

123
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,170
if you love him,

124
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,440
just be with him.

125
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:12,760
Sir,

126
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,590
your outfit is so beautiful.

127
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,500
It feels so soft and smooth.

128
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,560
It must be expensive.

129
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,450
Yunxi and Tang Qing

130
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:19,950
told me

131
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,870
that Young Master is very rich.

132
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,310
Even his pigs wear fancy clothes

133
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,310
and eat exquisite food.

134
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,870
I wish to become

135
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,150
Young Master's pig,

136
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,820
so I can eat well and live in a big house.

137
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,440
See?

138
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,270
Commoners

139
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,120
are living so miserably

140
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,590
because

141
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,190
those men in power

142
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,980
are corrupt,

143
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,580
spendthrift,

144
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,700
and useless.

145
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,310
Qing,

146
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,280
you just see one side of the story.

147
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,520
There are officials who have devoted themselves

148
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,090
to the well-being of the people here.

149
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,150
Stop!

150

[Jianjia Alley]

151
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,180

Liu.

154
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,790
What's going on?

155
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,680
We're moving out.

156
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,950
I drop by to tell you, my old neighbors.

157
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,000
Mr. Liu,

158
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,410
why are you moving out so soon?

159
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,990
Did you get the compensation?

160
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,180
You've seen

161
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,080
what happened today.

162
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,480
We've offended the city guards.

163
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,100
I don't expect to get compensation.

164
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,940
I'd be grateful if they could let us live.

165
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,450
Mr. Liu,

166
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,820
what is this?

167
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,470
This is the threshold of my house.

168
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,470
Why are you taking it with you?

169
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,060
It looks heavy.

170

Young man,

171
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,310
back then, my ancestors answered

172
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,020
the City Master's call

173
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,380
to build Cangyue City.

174
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,610
They moved here

175
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,520
and made this threshold.

176
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,990
They were determined to take root here.

177
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,190
Unexpectedly,

178
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,750
we spent most of our lives here

179
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,530
but ended up being kicked out of Cangyue.

180
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,910
Do you know

181
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,050
how miserable I feel?

182
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,680
I'll take this threshold with me

183
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,110
wherever I go

184
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,440
as a reminder of our hometown.

185
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,150
Well,

186
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,130
leave this threshold here.

187
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,790
You don't have to move out.

188
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:25,990
Just stay here.

189
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,260
It's hard to leave our hometown.

190
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,420
We want to stay.

191
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,890
But given the circumstances…

192
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,270
Liu, do as he said.

193
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,409
Stay.

194
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,010
Can we?

195
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,480
Mr. Liu, don't worry.

196
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,530
It was we who beat the city guards.

197
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,510
We'll take care of it.

198
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,090
What's wrong?

199
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,610
Are you still worried about

200
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,310
the demolition of Jianjia Alley?

201
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,440
Eight years ago,

202
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,020
after I left my brother,

203
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,230
I met Uncle Jin and Aunt Xu.

204
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,440
Homeless people like us gathered together

205
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,390
and became a big family

206
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,600
in Jianjia Alley.

207
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,300
There were many children back then,

208
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,820
but we didn't make much money.

209
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,300
I survived

210
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,270
thanks to

211
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,480
the help of everyone in Jianjia Alley.

212
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,700
This place is poor and derelict,

213
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,650
but when I think of moving out,

214
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,360
I feel reluctant to leave.

215
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,770
Those eight years

216
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,330
must have been a hard time for you, right?

217
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,780
With my family around me,

218
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,390
life was hard but happy.

219
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,830
My brother taught me

220
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,620
many mapping skills when I was young.

221
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,070
By the age of ten,

222
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,700
I'd been running around Cangyue City

223
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,760
and selling maps

224
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,200
to merchants passing by.

225
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,210
Later, I used the name Yun Zhongzi

226
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,240
to do surveying jobs secretly.

227
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,110
My life finally became stable.

228
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,770
Yunxi,

229
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,140
from now on,

230
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,680
I'm indebted to people you're indebted to.

231
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,830
I'll watch out for them.

232
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:32,970
Look!

233
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,010
That's a good thing.

234
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,500
We used to catch crayfishes

235
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,710
every night for special treats.

236
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,150
Are you sure this ugly thing is edible?

237
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,570
What's wrong?

238
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,650
I got bitten.

239
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,340
Show me the wound.

240
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,760
You're not a kid.

241
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,380
Can't believe you were hurt by a crayfish.

242
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,630
Does it hurt?

243
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,310
I've checked it. You're fine.

244
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,860
Let me show you around.

245
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,390
What kind of tree is this?

246
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,690
Why are there so many red straps on it?

247
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,930
This is Fate Tree.

248
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,150
Young people come here wishing for blessings

249
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,900
and tie red straps onto it.

250
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,090
Then let's make a wish.

251
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,060
You believe it?

252
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,670
It's just a way

253
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,990
of expressing wishes.

254
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,440
Because

255
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,190
not every couple in love

256
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,760
can have a happy ending,

257
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,180
people come here

258
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,720
to seek solace in myths.

259
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:35,620
♫I was once lonely. Whose heart have I broken?♫

260
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,100
Forget it.

261
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:41,320
♫I pray for the chance to make it up♫

262
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,140
Make a wish.

263
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,610
We're already here.

264
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,010
♫Time flies and everything changes♫

265
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,530
♫The mistake can never be fixed♫

266
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,050
♫Sorry that I failed to keep my promise♫

267
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,450
♫Count the sorrows, who help each other in straits with feeble strength?♫

268
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:07,380
♫There will be pure soil to expel the karma♫

269
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,220
Believer Jiang Chaoxi

270
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,430
♫Unexpectedly, not until the pomp ended♫

271
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,200
prays to you sincerely.

272
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,850
♫Can I understand the unforgettable feeling♫

273
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't want wealth or fame.

274
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,080
I have only one wish.

275
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,870
♫The hair has been grey, while the destiny can't be seen through♫

276
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,820
Please kindly make it come true.

277
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,940
I wish to spend the rest of my life

278
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,830
with the woman beside me.

279
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:27,140
♫Luckily, my heart remains the same when all the flowers fall♫

280
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,090
Believer Yunxi

281
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,670
doesn't pray for health

282
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,960
or an easy life.

283
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:34,110
♫I've been waiting for you for a thousand years♫

284
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,000
I know I'm asking too much

285
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,550
but please let me

286
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,910
spend the last days of my life

287
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,750
with the man beside me whom I deeply love.

288
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,560
♫Dream that we are on the old road we met♫

289
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,120
♫See you gently play the zither♫

290
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:47,490
♫Who are you waiting for to make you a pot of tea?♫

291
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,830
It's done.

292
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,340
Now our wishes

293
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,290
will come true.

294
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,170
What's your wish?

295
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,860
I can't tell you.

296
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,010
It won't come true if I do.

297
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,510
Then I won't tell you mine either.

298
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,190
Fate Tree,

299
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,300
please make our wishes

300
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,160
come true.

301
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,740
I love him at the moment.

302
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,270
I shouldn't care about how we'll end.

303
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,660
Since I've fallen in love with him,

304
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,730
I should be brave

305
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,240
and let him know.

306
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,000
I should cherish everything I have now.

307
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,170
My wish came true.

308
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,870
It really came true.

309
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,510
You held my hand.

310
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,160
It means you agree to be with me!

311
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,660
Fate Tree,

312
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
thank you!

313
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,730
Father.

314
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,430
They have lived

315
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,430
in Cangyue City for generations.

316
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,550
Now they've grown old

317
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,820
and are forced to leave their hometown.

318
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,840
We need to know that their ancestors

319
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,230
were the first outsiders answering the call

320
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,660
to settle down in Cangyue.

321
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,940
Cangyue was a new city back then.

322
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,420
There were less than 100,000 residents in the city.

323
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,140
Now,

324
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,210
Cangyue is building a new city,

325
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,050
but their descendants

326
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,650
are to be evicted from their homes.

327
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,080
Those people

328
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,630
who contributed to the building of Cangyue City

329
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,870
would be heartbroken to know it.

330
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,750
Young Master, you're right.

331
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,980
The people in the south

332
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,110
have done a lot

333
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,910
for Cangyue City.

334
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,290
But what about the people in the north?

335
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,830
Do you mean to be ungrateful

336
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,630
to the ancestors of the rich families

337
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,050
in the north who also devoted

338
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,880
a lot to Cangyue City?

339
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,560
Young Master,

340
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,440
as the Chief Inspector of the city construction,

341
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,990
you should listen to

342
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,940
the voices of different officials

343
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,880
and avoid being bigoted.

344
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,740
You can't change decisions that have been made.

345
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,610
All in all,

346
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,260
I still insist on demolishing the south of the city.

347
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,940
We all agree.

348
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,100
Master,

349
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,600
the Planning Department has paid those people compensation.

350
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,680
They can rebuild their homes

351
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,140
outside Cangyue City.

352
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,119
The south of the city is now a ruin.

353
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,240
The houses and streets are old.

354
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,130
To them,

355
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,300
relocation is not necessarily a bad thing.

356
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,190
Master.

357
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,770
My lords.

358
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,810
There are seven people in my family.

359
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,900
There are only five liangs of silver for us.

360
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,220
If we have to move out of the city to build a house,

361
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,220
I'm afraid they are not even enough

362
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,020
to buy bricks and tiles.

363
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,680
It's hard to survive.

364
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,420
How can we rebuild our homeland?

365
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,380
Only five liangs of silver.

366
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,030
What's going on?

367
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,930
Master.

368
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,800
We should ask Commander Xiao about it.

369
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,890
After all,

370
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,580
he is the person responsible for issuing silver.

371
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,780
How could such a thing happen?

372
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,080
These audacious

373
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,470
petty officials!

374
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,710
How dare they covet the money?

375
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,780
Master.

376
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,570
It was my negligence that caused the problem.

377
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,980
Please rest assured.

378
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,980
I will investigate it myself.

379
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,360
I must find these borers.

380
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,770
That's great.

381
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,560
The plan to demolish the Winding Alleys

382
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,800
in the south of the city

383
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,100
will not be changed.

384
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,490
But

385
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,940
the silver allocated for demolition

386
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,240
must be paid in place.

387
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,250
Xi'er.

388
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,900
You'll be in charge of this.

389
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,700
Father.

390
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,490
I got it.

391
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,850
So,

392
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,110
you've promised Young Master?

393
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,330
It's okay as long as you're happy.

394
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,620
Thank you, Qing.

395
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,900
By the way,

396
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,940
does Young Master know the things of your family?

397
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,770
He was still young back then.

398
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,620
He doesn't know the specific reason.

399
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,070
But he told me

400
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,430
my father was an upright man.

401
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,460
There was no probability that he would be corrupt.

402
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,870
I want to find a chance

403
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,110
to investigate this case again.

404
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,430
Is there a direction for investigation?

405
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:41,980
Supervision Guard.

406
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,090
It's said that there are the files

407
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,800
of all cases

408
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,780
in the past 20 years.

409
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,780
I think

410
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,390
there might be some clues there.

411
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,320
Yunxi, I…

412
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,770
You are back.

413
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,930
The location of the mall

414
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,390
should still be built in the south of the city.

415
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,580
But don't worry.

416
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,020
I've sent someone

417
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,220
to watch the demolition money.

418
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,630
The money will be paid in place.

419
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,420
Don't blame yourself for the demolition.

420
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,460
This is a complicated matter.

421
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,030
It's not easy to change the resolution

422
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,900
made by the Planning Room.

423
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,230
Let's check out

424
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,100
the site of the relocation.

425
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,760
Everyone.

426
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,920
Does this outfit

427
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,820
make me look

428
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
gentle

429
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,480
and elegant?

430
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,820
The scroll in my hand

431
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,610
makes me look more knowledgeable and elegant.

432
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,160
You're usually untrammeled and romantic in character.

433
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,000
This outfit makes you look gentler and more ethereal

434
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,570
than usual.

435
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,220
It's a little intentional,

436
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:58,930
but

437
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,090
I like it.

438
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:02,980
What about this one?

439
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,760
Only one word.

440
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,130
Charming.

441
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,320
You look evil and mysterious,

442
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,390
unruly and profound.

443
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,170
An occasional smile

444
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,870
shows your tenderness

445
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,190
and impeccable charm.

446
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,990
This outfit

447
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,870
does improve

448
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,770
your appearance and temperament.

449
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,570
But isn't it too exaggerated to go out

450
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,930
in this outfit?

451
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,220
A little bit.

452
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,650
What about this one?

453
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,040
Black

454
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,520
will make me majestic-looking.

455
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,180
The tight fitting design

456
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,520
perfectly shows

457
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,960
my strong posture

458
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,080
and handsome appearance.

459
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,100
These colours

460
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,560
are too plain.

461
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,410
These are not Yunxi's type.

462
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,640
Yunxi likes pink.

463
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,850
Shut up.

464
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,460
As a loser

465
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,460
in love,

466
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,130
your opinion will not be accepted.

467
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,370
I called you here

468
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,860
to show

469
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,550
my victory

470
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,720
in front of you.

471
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,560
That makes me more confident.

472
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,150
Young Master,

473
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,850
you've been doing this for four hours.

474
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,550
You're just going out of the city

475
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,560
to inspect the site.

476
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,530
Why are you making such a fuss?

477
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,780
I think you should just wear one.

478
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,740
You should shut up too.

479
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,310
Do you know why

480
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:25,880
you've been single

481
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,820
all these years?

482
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,620
Since I knew you,

483
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,380
I haven't seen you change your clothes.

484
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,590
You dress like a steel ball every day.

485
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,240
Don't you feel embarrassed to go out?

486
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,800
No matter which one I wear,

487
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,820
I have my own characteristics.

488
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,510
It's really hard to choose.

489
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:53,680
Yunxi.

490
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,840
Leave it to me.

491
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,140
I put on makeup for the girls in this mansion

492
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,630
when they date.

493
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,170
Go and ask around.

494
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,150
Everyone knows

495
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,260
I'm good at doing makeup.

496
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,950
I'll definitely make you reborn.

497
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,730
Perfect.

498
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:10,860
Is it done?

499
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,050
What do you think? Surprise?

500
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,130
Aren't you pretty?

501
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,110
This...

502
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,390
This is the most popular

503
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,420
pink peach blossom makeup.

504
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,660
Young Master will never

505
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,530
forget you.

506
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,940
It's really unforgettable.

507
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,440
But I'm going out to...

508
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,420
No.

509
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,270
We are sisters.

510
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,520
I won't do anything bad to you.

511
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:31,890
Yunxi,

512
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
this is your first date

513
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,310
with Young Master.

514
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,560
Of course we have to be grand.

515
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,740
That's why we can't be hasty.

516
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,700
Yunxi,

517
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,410
the pattern on your comb

518
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,120
is so unique.

519
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,810
This is my family heirloom.

520
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,800
It's so beautiful.

521
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,470
How did you know this place?

522
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,070
This is my secret garden.

523
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,070
You showed me your childhood.

524
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,130
I'll show you my joy.

525
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,010
Do you like it?

526
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,270
Yes.

527
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,860
The flowers smell so good.

528
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,990
The sky is so blue.

529
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:48,870
You're prettier.

530
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,540
You!

531
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,270
How dare you make fun of me!

532
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,330
Wait and see.

533
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,460
Come on.

534
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,470
I'm surrounded by many people.

535
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,320
They please me in all respects

536
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,780
in front of me.

537
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,270
But behind my back, they laugh at me.

538
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,020
Sometimes, I feel annoyed.

539
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,240
I can only keep it to myself.

540
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,770
So,

541
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,650
I feel lonely sometimes.

542
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,940
I can only look up to the sky and tell.

543
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,380
Maybe

544
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,220
it's really lonely at the top.

545
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,430
Everyone has secrets

546
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,960
and unknown worries.

547
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,990
Now that you know my secret,

548
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,580
you won't be able to escape.

549
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,320
Close your eyes.

550
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,520
Close your eyes

551
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,590
♫Can we just keep quiet♫

552
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:33,180
♫And enjoy the scenery♫

553
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,520

556
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,770
With the red string,

557
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,210
you'll be mine.

558
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:54,300
♫Let's preserve the most beautiful moment♫

559
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,950
What if

560
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,710
I regret it?

561
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,350
It's useless to regret.

562
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,120
The rope is tied.

563
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,660
You are mine.

564
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,590
You can't escape.

565
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,510
♫I wish to hold your hand♫

566

Okay.

567

As the call, so the echo.

568
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:11,750
♫Till the end of the day♫

569

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,520
my brother left me.

571
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,650
I give it to you.

572
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,520
What is it?

573
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,150
♫But I can't escape from fate♫

574

Fine.

575
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,700
I'll consider it as a token of love.

576
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,480
I'll take it.

577
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:27,730
♫In the end, we will part♫

♫Let's preserve the most beautiful moment♫

584
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,760
Cousin! Cousin! Cousin!

585
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,040
Miss Fengyi.

586
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,230
Steward Zhu, where is my cousin?

587
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,080
He went to survey the site

588
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,350
with Miss Yunxi.

589
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,090
How could a man and a woman go out

590
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,310
together?

591
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,140
What if Yunxi

592
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,540
concocts a plot

593
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,590
against Cousin?

594
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,730
Young Master knows kung fu.

595
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,350
Miss Yunxi can't beat him.

596
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,580
If my cousin knows to fight women with fists

597
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,660
like you,

598
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,500
I'm relieved.

599
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,740
But Yunxi is so smooth-talking.

600
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,430
Even a smart person like me

601
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,340
was cheated by her.

602
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,830
My cousin is not safe either.

603
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,310
No.

604
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,810
She has a lot of bad thoughts

605
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,840
about my cousin.

606
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,580
Please mind your words. Miss.

607
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,760
Yunxi is not that kind of person.

608
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,340
Do you want to scare me to death?

609
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,340
Tang Qing.

610
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,090
Don't think you can look at me like this

611
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,790
just because you're pretty.

612
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,370
You...

613
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,650
How dare you ignore me!

614
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,090
I'm going to see my cousin.

615
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,330
Come with me.

616
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:03,780
No.

617
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,380
I'm the young lady of the Xiao family.

618
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,480
You have to listen to me.

619
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,580
Steward Zhu.

620
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,680
Can I borrow this bodyguard?

621
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,880
Take him away.

622
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,300
It's so hot.

623
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,820
Why is the road getting remote?

624
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,980
Are they here

625
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,120
to survey or search for treasure?

626
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,350
My legs are going to break.

627
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,140
Tang Qing,

628
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,700
did you lead the wrong way?

629
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,350
Stop!

630
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,350
You...

631
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,390
Come and carry me.

632
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,700
Miss,

633
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,840
it's improper for men and women to touch each other.

634
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,920
It's inappropriate for me to carry you on my back.

635
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,620
I...

636
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,150
I don't care.

637
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,990
I won't go if you don't carry me.

638
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,820
Save your energy.

639
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,820
You can't get rid of me.

640
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,640
I'm too tired. Carry me.

641
00:30:59,380 --> 00:30:59,980
Miss.

642
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,080
Get up first.

643
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,060
No.

644
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,230
Miss.

645
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,720
Get up.

646
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,450
You promised to carry me?

647
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,580
You should have told me earlier.

648
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,610
Come here. Hurry!

649
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,740
Come on. Come here.

650
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,960
Come on. Hurry up.

651
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:17,830
No.

652
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,350
You...

653
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,290
Put me down!

654
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,870
Put me down!

655
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,660
I can't.

656
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,290
I'm going to throw up.

657
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,500
I'm going to throw up.

658
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,480
I'm too tired.

659
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,060
Are you okay?

660
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,970
Do I look okay to you?

661
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,300
Are you mocking me?

662
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,440
When I see my cousin,

663
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,550
I'll let him punish you

664
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,370
to death.

665
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,180
Are you afraid?

666
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,170
I'm so scared.
