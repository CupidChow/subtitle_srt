4
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,180
Tell me.

5
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,310
What else is there

6
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,460
that I don't know about?

7
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:49,940
Cousin!

8
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,700
This part is important.

9
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,180
Yes.

10
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,479
Cousin!

11
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,620
Why are you here again?

12
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,660
Cousin.

13
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,500
Why are you here?

14
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,550
I am just passing by

15
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,860
and I see you here.

16
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,700
Don't you think

17
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,980
we are fated?

18
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,550
I'm afraid this fate

19
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,980
is arranged by someone else.

20
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,430
Looking at you two attractive people,

21
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,930
this fate must be arranged by God.

22
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,950
You guys have a chat.

23
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,940
I'll get back to work.

24
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,970
Go ahead.

25
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,070
I'll go too..

26
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,650
Cousin.

27
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,450
You must be tired.

28
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,670
Wait for a moment.

29
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:41,579
Here.

30
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,750
Try the sweet heart pastry

31
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,880
I made for you.

32
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,840
Is it tasty?

33
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:48,910
Yes.

34
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,380
Right?

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,110
Thank you.

36
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,570
Wuyan.

37
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,740
Come and help me flick the string.

38
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:52,790
Don't move.

39
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,090
Cousin.

40
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,890
Let me help you.

41
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:58,980
Let me ask.

42
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,340
What is this?

43
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,100
Just pull it straight and flick it.

44
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,510
Flick it...

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,040
Flick it?

46
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,620
Young Master.

47
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,860
Not like that.

48
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,470
You need to pluck it.

49
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,620
You should have explained it before.

50
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,210
I...

51
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,730
This is easy. Let me do it.

52
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,900
Hold the string.

53
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,910
It's really...

54
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:29,940
Young Master.

55
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,470
Young Master, are you okay?

56
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,329
Cousin.

57
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,320
It's all her fault for not holding the string well.

58
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,310
Cousin, let me help you...

59
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,020
C-Cousin!

60
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,440
I-I'm sorry.

61
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,340
Hurry up.

62
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,300
Get some water.

63
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,230
Young Master!

64
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,220
Miss.

65
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,740
Let me blow on it for you.

66
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,020
Miss, don't do that.

67
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,240
-No... -Don't touch me!

68
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,500
What's wrong?

69
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,090
Miss,

70
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,430
you shouldn't wash quicklime off with water.

71
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,230
He can go blind.

72
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,140
-Don't touch me. -Young Master.

73
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,160
Then what should we do?

74
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,260
Use oil.

75
00:03:59,490 --> 00:03:59,850
Oil?

76
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,540
Oil?

77
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:01,910
Jiaobai.

78
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,020
Go get some oil quickly.

79
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,540
Yes.

80
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:03,940
Young Master.

81
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,610
Don't touch me. Stay away from me.

82
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,910
Let me blow on it for you.

83
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,750
I'm going to be blind

84
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,660
because of you!

85
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,370
Be gentle.

86
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,230
I know that

87
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,519
your nemesis is not only Miss Fengyi,

88
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,269
but also Yunxi.

89
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,620
Yunxi is your greatest nemesis.

90
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,140
Don't mention her name

91
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,010
in front of me.

92
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,630
Young Master,

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,440
this won't do.

94
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,540
Let's kick Yunxi out.

95
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,560
We can replace her.

96
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,220
I...

97
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,090
I just said not to mention her name.

98
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,650
Her presence

99
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,070
is not a problem.

100
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,970
By the way, where is she?

101
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,120
She disappeared as soon as she came back.

102
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,070
That Yunxi.

103
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,330
Forget that

104
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,940
she is Xiao Fengyi's spy.

105
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,340
I got so hurt

106
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,870
yet she does not show

107
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,340
one bit of guilt.

108
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,710
Carry on, apply more.

109
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,020
Why are you here too, Young Master?

110
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm exercising.

111
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,660
It's good to exercise.

112
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,420
Not only can it strengthen your body,

113
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,780
but also enhance your courage and intelligence.

114
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,380
Do you think our Young Master is stupid?

115
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,710
Young Master, let me try.

116
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,080
You can have this place.

117
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,150
I'm about to go somewhere else anyway.

118
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:18,740
Stop there.

119
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,140
You're leaving now that I'm here?

120
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,020
Is something

121
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,740
on your conscience?

122
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,920
What are you talking about?

123
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,330
What bad intentions can I have?

124
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,980
I'm just worried

125
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,630
that there are still

126
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,620
poisonous insects and snakes and whatnot

127
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,380
that could hurt you again.

128
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,500
I've checked this place.

129
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,580
It's very safe.

130
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,100
Young Master,

131
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,290
you can stay here at ease.

132
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,850
I need to exercise too.

133
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:42,930
Let's exercise together.

134
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,670
No, thank you.

135
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,670
I'm done.

136
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,640
It's not up to you.

137
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,100
Young Master.

138
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,460
Don't be willful.

139
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,300
I'm a living person.

140
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:01,870
You don't trust

141
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,060
my archery skills?

142
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,030
I do.

143
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,450
You're an excellent archer

144
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,280
who never misses.

145
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,420
It's just that I don't deserve to be your target.

146
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,800
You deserve it now.

147
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,200
No, Young Master!

148
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,610
What did I do wrong?

149
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,580
Tell me.

150
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,340
Today, why did Xiao Fengyi

151
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,420
turn up at the construction site?

152
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,740
How would I know?

153
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,070
Her legs belong to her.

154
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,020
She goes wherever she wants.

155
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,070
I can't control her.

156
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,260
You're still making excuses.

157
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:30,940
You want to

158
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,140
play Cupid?

159
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:32,700
Fine.

160
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,700
I'll grant your wish today

161
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,280
and shoot a pair of wings out of you.

162
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,220
I'm really sorry.

163
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,450
You admit you're wrong?

164
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,020
Then let the storm

165
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,420
begin.

166
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,340
Let's see if you'll start

167
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,780
taking me seriously now.

168
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,060
Don't leave.

169
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,120
Let me down!

170
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,020
What do you mean?

171
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,150
Jiang Chaoxi.

172
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,700
You are my sworn enemy!

173
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,290
It's pitch-dark in the middle of the night.

174
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,340
It's unlikely I'd run into

175
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,140
Jiang Chaoxi now.

176
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,120
Young Master!

177
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,830
Where did I hit?

178
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,160
My waist.

179
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,130
It's Jiang Chaoxi and Wuyan.

180
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,190
What are they doing here

181
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,220
in the middle of the night?

182
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,030
Why aren't you sleeping at this hour?

183
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,450
-You scared me. -I also wanted to ask you.

184
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,740
You weren't there when I woke up

185
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,670
and it took you so long to come back.

186
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,420
You even look so flustered.

187
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:12,640
What are you up to?

188
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,540
I couldn't sleep,

189
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,380
so I went to the garden

190
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,240
for a walk.

191
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,030
You are fumbling for words. Something must be up.

192
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,820
Why are you hiding something from me?

193
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,590
Do you no longer

194
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,180
treat me as your good friend?

195
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,140
Of course not.

196
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,680
Fine. I'll tell you.

197
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,020
But you must not tell anyone.

198
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,240
Young Master,

199
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,770
I really didn't see it.

200
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,150
I heard it from Yunxi.

201
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:33,700
Shut up!

202
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,900
Listen.

203
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,820
For this month,

204
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,750
you're not allowed to speak.

205
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:45,780
Go.

206
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,970
Get Yunxi here.

207
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,500
Thank you for your mercy...

208
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:49,920
Shut up!

209
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,860
Yunxi.

210
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,050
Yunxi again?

211
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,060
Young Master,

212
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,990
have some tea to calm down.

213
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,940
What about that damn Yunxi?

214
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,680
Young Master,

215
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,500
I will punish her

216
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,020
for you.

217
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,570
It's time to teach her a lesson.

218
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,900
I need to come up with something.

219
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,260
Stand still.

220
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,140
Young Master.

221
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,350
These are the new guards.

222
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,540
How should we allocate them?

223
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,250
You can do this job.

224
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,560
Why are you asking me?

225
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,940
What's your name?

226
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,060
Young Master,

227
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,400
my name is Tang Qing.

228
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,820
Your waist accessory is quite nice.

229
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,210
Where did you buy it?

230
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,370
This is a gift

231
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,070
from someone

232
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,060
very important to me.

233
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,040
Yunxi, you're really something.

234
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,150
You killed my Ham,

235
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,870
and even gave its belongings

236
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,900
to another man?

237
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,260
Young Master.

238
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,620
Young Master.

239
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,530
What can I do for you?

240
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:43,940
Qing?

241
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,420
Why are you here?

242
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:46,970
Yunxi.

243
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,390
You know each other?

244
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,370
Yes.

245
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,270
I grew up with Qing.

246
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,420
He is like a little brother to me.

247
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,450
What a fate.

248
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,410
You are even working at the same place now.

249
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,800
Let me introduce

250
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,860
the new guards of my mansion.

251
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:06,940
Guard?

252
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:07,920
No.

253
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,840
Qing can't stay here.

254
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,620
Why?

255
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,540
Is my mansion not good enough?

256
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:12,940
No.

257
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,290
Young Master's Mansion is good.

258
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,050
But Qing is still young.

259
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,300
I'm afraid he's not qualified.

260
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,500
It's okay.

261
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,050
Since he's already here,

262
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,820
he can stay.

263
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,900
On the account that he is your little brother,

264
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,540
I'll make an exception.

265
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:30,740
By the way,

266
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,340
I call you here

267
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,070
about the planning map.

268
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,160
Since your little brother is here,

269
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,970
you can catch up.

270
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,860
Thank you, Young Master.

271
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,700
Why are you here?

272
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,470
Are you okay?

273
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,020
Move along!

274
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,340
Why don't you punish her?

275
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,030
She has crossed the line.

276
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,240
Mere punishments won't do.

277
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,070
Yunxi.

278
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:20,900
Why are you so happy?

279
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:21,940
Why do you come here

280
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,900
as a guard?

281
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,200
Ever since you came to work here,

282
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,430
I've been looking for ways to come in.

283
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,900
A few days ago,

284
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:27,810
Young Master's Mansion began recruiting.

285
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,780
It was my chance.

286
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,580
We don't need more than one breadwinner.

287
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,340
Anyhow, go back to Jianjia Alley

288
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:32,900
as soon as possible.

289
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,400
I'm not leaving.

290
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,520
I don't care what Jiang Chaoxi is like.

291
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,940
I want to stay by your side to protect you.

292
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,260
Even if this is a dangerous place,

293
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,740
I won't leave.

294
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,620
Why are you so disobedient?

295
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,660
Yunxi,

296
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,410
ever since you left,

297
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,730
I've been worried about you every day.

298
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,660
I only feel relieved when you're in my sight.

299
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,400
So,

300
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,830
please don't chase me away.

301
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:57,990
Forget it.

302
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,940
You can stay if you don't want to leave.

303
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,350
But you have to promise me

304
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,100
to stay away from Jiang Chaoxi.

305
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,440
I promise.

306
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,980
Yunxi, don't worry.

307
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,790
I will help you

308
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,520
reach your goal.

309
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,440
Is it really just a rumor?

310
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,900
I dare not lie.

311
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,940
Someone in the mansion misunderstood Young Master.

312
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,190
Get up.

313
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,100
Since it's all nonsense,

314
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,900
let's tear off the rumor-mongers' tongues

315
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,220
and sell them.

316
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,790
This...

317
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,140
This...

318
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,530
The initiator of the rumor

319
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,420
is the surveyor hired by Young Master.

320
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,500
This woman is good at

321
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,510
both city planning

322
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,260
and Fengshui.

323
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,070
Young Master admires her very much.

324
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,980
He also trusts her

325
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,660
with the supervision of the city's construction.

326
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,100
Wait.

327
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,280
This woman?

328
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,260
The surveyor is female?

329
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,970
From what I see,

330
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,860
Young Master treats that lady

331
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,780
differently.

332
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,080
Since Xi'er was young,

333
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,620
I've never seen him interested in any females.

334
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,810
And he's so trusting of her?

335
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,920
It seems like

336
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,650
there is something special about this lady.

337
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,550
Young Master admires

338
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,450
capable and talented people.

339
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,540
It's good that he has admiration for women.

340
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,020
He's not young anymore.

341
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,370
If it wasn't for his repeated refusal,

342
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,740
he would have already been married.

343
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,390
In future,

344
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:26,990
we can't let him

345
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,900
be willful anymore.

346
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,100
A lady.

347
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,420
My condolences, Young Master.

348
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,980
The dead cannot be revived.

349
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,410
Don't grief too hard,

350
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,970
lest it takes a toll on you.

351
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,350
Young Master, what happened?

352
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,010
His two best friends

353
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,890
are killed by evil people

354
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,150
and died unjustly.

355
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,350
Young Master has been so overwhelmed with grief,

356
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,760
crying all morning.

357
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,930
What a tragedy.

358
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,100
What's happened has happened,

359
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,020
Young Master,

360
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,580
so accept it and take it easy.

361
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,550
How?

362
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,400
They still can't rest in peace

363
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,090
because they have yet to be buried.

364
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,940
How can I take it easy?

365
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,060
Young Master,

366
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,220
the most important thing now

367
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,390
is to get them buried

368
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,390
so as to

369
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,800
comfort their souls in heaven.

370
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
You're right, Steward Zhu.

371
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,560
Steward Zhu, go and find

372
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,150
a mortician

373
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,340
who is trustworthy.

374
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,550
Someone who will bury my two friends well.

375
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,120
The cost doesn't matter.

376
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,150
As long as I can make them happy,

377
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,180
I'll spend as much as it needs.

378
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,220
Okay.

379
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,440
How lucky am I!

380
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,210
Young Master,

381
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,839
coincidentally,

382
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,750
before entering the mansion,

383
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,410
I have prepared several burial ceremonies for my relatives and friends.

384
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,579
I am experienced

385
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,609
in funeral services.

386
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,920
I'm willing to share your responsibility.

387
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,940
Can you do it?

388
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:28,400
Steward Zhu,

389
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,340
I don't like what you said.

390
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,740
In our line of work,

391
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,390
we need to know not only astrology and geography,

392
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,070
but also feng shui.

393
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,060
I'm not bragging.

394
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,870
From the funerals

395
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,780
I had been responsible for,

396
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,600
the deceased were always satisfied.

397
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,730
All the families of the deceased

398
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,060
were satisfied.

399
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,170
Since you are so confident,

400
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,790
I'll leave it to you.

401
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,960
Thank you, Young Master.

402
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:57,890
Don't worry.

403
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,230
I will give you

404
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,150
a nice funeral

405
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,260
to satisfy the deceased

406
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,700
and the living.

407
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,220
Young Master, I'll leave and prepare.

408
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,430
This is a profitable job.

409
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,130
Since you're so generous,

410
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,870
I can make some extra money easily.

411
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,270
That's enough for people in Jianjia Alley

412
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,760
for a while.

413
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,440
Why is your acting so exaggerated?

414
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,880
I just did it the way we rehearsed

415
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,040
last night.

416
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,760
My two best friends.

417
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,070
I didn't expect Jiang Chaoxi

418
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,940
to be so good at KungFu.

419
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:50,940
Your KungFu

420
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,110
has improved a lot.

421
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,510
It seems that my personal bodyguard

422
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,780
should be replaced.

423
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:03,820
You.

424
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,250
Come here.

425
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,330
Young Master.

426
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,180
I heard you're very skilled at KungFu.

427
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:13,900
Come.

428
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,840
Fight with me.

429
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,720
No.

430
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,820
No?

431
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,580
Don't worry.

432
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,150
I won't hurt you.

433
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:23,740
Young Master.

434
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,780
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.

435
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,260
How arrogant.

436
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,830
He's afraid of hurting me.

437
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,430
Jiang Chaoxi is hiding

438
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,410
his abilities.

439
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,790
Shameless.

440
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,010
Don't pull my hair.

441
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,010
As a young master,

442
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,830
how can you pull my hair?

443
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,140
I can.

444
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,350
I can't breathe.

445
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,620
I don't care.

446
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:21,980
Let go!

447
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:22,820
No.

448
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,350
Let go of me first.

449
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,710
If you don't, I'll use my kill shot.

450
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,340
What can you do?

451
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,070
Jiang Chaoxi, you bastard!

452
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,180
What are you doing?

453
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,550
-We… -We…

454
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,740
Fine.

455
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,140
I'm fine.

456
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,780
Young Master.

457
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,300
Young Master.

458
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,600
The mourning hall is ready.

459
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,560
When can we

460
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,390
move the body of the deceased in?

461
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,160
There's no body.

462
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,070
Sword.

463
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,090
He died so miserably

464
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
his body cannot be put together.

465
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,170
Oh my god.

466
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
How brutal!

467
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,950
When the murderer is caught,

468
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,430
he should be tortured

469
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,380
in the cruelest way.

470
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,500
Don't worry.

471
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,770
He will.

472
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,740
Young Master.

473
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,210
Since there is no body,

474
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,250
are there any remains?

475
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,020
Remains?

476
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,500
I asked Zhu Wen to prepare this.

477
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,850
He put their favorite things

478
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,870
before death

479
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,850
in the fine rose wood coffins.

480
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,260
Carry these coffins to the mourning hall later.

481
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,420
Thank you, Young Master.

482
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,660
I still need some help at the mourning hall.

483
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,420
I hope to add a few more helpers.

484
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,580
OK.

485
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:32,730
As you wish.

486
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,840
Thank you, Young Master.

487
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:34,860
Tang Qing,

488
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:35,490
come with me.

489
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:40,820
Did I agree?

490
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,630
You are taking him away?

491
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,460
Did I agree?

492
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,450
Yes.

493
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,800
I thought he was very good at martial arts.

494
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,420
Just a draw

495
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,470
with me.

496
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,370
How old is he?

497
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,740
How old are you?

498
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,290
Ladies

499
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,460
and gentlemen,

500
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,550
thank you for being here.

501
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,420
I don't think

502
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,210
your friends want us

503
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,520
to be so sad.

504
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:05,940
So,

505
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,720
no more tears

506
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,590
and grief.

507
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,020
There's no body in here.

508
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,730
Stone sink, brush.

509
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,490
Why do these things

510
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,800
seem to be for pigs?

511
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,980
So the two friends of Jiang Chaoxi

512
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,140
are ham?

513
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,690
Young Master.

514
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,680
Are you satisfied with the funeral?

515
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,510
Yes.

516
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,170
But most importantly,

517
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,210
I want you to be satisfied.

518
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:34,970
Guards!

519
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,420
Throw her in!

520
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,020
-Yes. -Young Master!

521
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,940
Young Master!

522
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,600
Young Master!

523
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,730
Young Master, calm down.

524
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,300
Take the medicine first.

525
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,080
You think you can protect her?

526
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,420
Do you know?

527
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,840
You almost destroyed the future of Cangyue City.

528
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,780
I didn't mean it.

529
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,440
Besides, it was you that wanted to nail me

530
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,180
in the coffin first.

531
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,230
I did so much

532
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,170
for you.

533
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,390
What did I do wrong?

534
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,260
Why did you punish me like this?

535
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,390
Of course.

536
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,600
You don't know

537
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,980
what you have done.

538
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,640
But I know

539
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,960
very well.

540
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,540
Who gave Tang Qing

541
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,200
the golden ring?

542
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,170
Oh no.

543
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,540
How could I forget it?

544
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,480
No wonder he asked me to bury pigs.

545
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,860
So he already knew.

546
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,230
But I can't admit it.

547
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,730
If he finds out

548
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,250
my assassination attempt...

549
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,620
Young Master.

550
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,490
It's just an ordinary gold ring.

551
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,980
You must have misunderstood.

552
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,680
Since you don't admit it,

553
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,450
then the murderer is Tang Qing.

554
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,190
Let him be buried with the dead.

555
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,210
Wait.

556
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,500
-I'm the murderer. -I'm the murderer.

557
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,360
Nonsense.

558
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,410
Young Master is wise.

559
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,210
I'm sure you've noticed it long ago.

560
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,380
So,

561
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,770
the person who wanted to kill me

562
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
at the pig race

563
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,760
was you.

564
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,660
Tell me.

565
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,600
Why did you try to kill me?

566
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,610
You tried every means to get a place in my mansion.

567
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,430
What are you up to do?

568
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:54,980
Young Master,

569
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,740
I admit I killed the pig.

570
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,100
But that was just momentary greed.

571
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,410
You live a good life.

572
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,750
So you don't know

573
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,110
how hard I've been living in the Jianjia Alley.

574
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,900
I haven't eaten meat

575
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,020
for several months.

576
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,180
But for this reason,

577
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,450
I am accused of attempting to kill you.

578
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,260
You cast the blame on me easily,

579
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,250
even without powerful evidence.

580
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,340
How dare you argue with me?

581
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,520
The person who tried to kill me that day

582
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,340
had a smell of herbs.

583
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,700
You have that smell

584
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,320
too.

585
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,980
- That was me! -Shut up!

586
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:22,580
None of your business.

587
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,020
Young Master.

588
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,030
Only based on that smell,

589
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,310
it is hasty

590
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,390
to call me a murderer.

591
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,310
We've spent so much time together.

592
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,420
Don't you know me?

593
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,270
I've saved you many times.

594
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,800
It's fine that you don't understand me.

595
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,020
How could you treat me unjustly?

596
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,700
-You... -Don't interrupt. Hear me out.

597
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,740
Besides, I admit I have done much

598
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,060
to get a job in your mansion.

599
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,060
But

600
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,930
it is totally

601
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,000
out of my passion.

602
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,580
As a surveyor

603
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,220
with excellent ability,

604
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,290
I hope

605
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,830
to make a great contribution

606
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,570
to the construction

607
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,190
of Cangyue City.

608
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:01,920
It's the only way

609
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,060
to not let people down,

610
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,550
not let myself down.

611
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,270
And

612
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,480
I will have a worthy life.

613
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,770
Well said.

614
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,200
Thank you.

615
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,610
Cousin,

616
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,040
I heard what she said just now.

617
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,780
I believe Yunxi,

618
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,740
who is so selfless,

619
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,870
will never harm you.

620
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,180
Thank you, Miss Fengyi.

621
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,630
You are reasonable.

622
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,980
Yes, I am.

623
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,480
But this is a different matter.

624
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,450
Look what you've done to him.

625
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,360
Cousin.

626
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,750
My poor cousin.

627
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,350
I came here

628
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,020
as soon as I heard you are hurt.

629
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,320
All right,

630
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,060
I'm fine.

631
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,860
Then I'm relieved.

632
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,660
Yunxi,

633
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,990
do you know

634
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,060
if something really happened,

635
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,460
can you bear the responsibility?

636
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,330
Who is he?

637
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,150
He is so good-looking.

638
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,450
He is the new guard

639
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,240
in our mansion.

640
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,180
His name is Tang Qing.

641
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,670
Why are you looking at me like that?

642
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,900
Please forgive him.

643
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,210
Qing is new here.

644
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,290
So he doesn't know the rules.

645
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:20,650
Cousin,

646
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,090
Yunxi made such a big mistake.

647
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,340
Shouldn't you punish her severely?

648
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,460
Forget it.

649
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,200
She didn't mean it anyway.

650
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,510
Tang Qing.

651
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,130
I've noticed that

652
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,370
you've been standing here for so long.

653
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,760
I'm a considerate boss.

654
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,180
Let me help you.

655
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,810
Young Master, I'm not tired.

656
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,620
Let me do it.

657
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,990
As I say, you are tired.

658
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,580
Come on.

659
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,940
Young Master.

660
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,180
I'm done.

661
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,490
I'm done.

662
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,140
So sorry.

663
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:08,740
It's all your fault.

664
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,550
You talk too much.

665
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:15,890
Give me a hand.

666
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,520
Okay.

667
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:18,940
What's wrong?

668
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,250
There's something strange with this wood.

669
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,570
Wuyan.

670
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,910
Get Song Qing here.

671
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:35,970
Yes.

672
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,910
Greetings, Young Master.

673
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,450
Take a look.

674
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,410
Song Qing.

675
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,030
If I remember correctly,

676
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,770
there are rules for building the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

677
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,600
The wood

678
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,430
should be rose wood.

679
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:16,730
Yes.

680
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,530
How dare you use

681
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,430
inferior white acid branch?

682
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,000
Do you think I'm a fool?

683
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,220
Or do you think my ancestors

684
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,930
are fools?

685
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,290
I dare not.

686
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,760
These wood

687
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,910
are purchased by Commander Xiao.

688
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,470
My uncle, right?

689
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:33,980
I see.

690
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,100
You mean

691
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,950
my uncle tells you to use white acid branch

692
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,900
to replace rose wood.

693
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:39,980
Right?

694
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,720
No.

695
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,180
No.

696
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:41,760
Young Master.

697
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,520
Please calm down.

698
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:43,990
In my opinion,

699
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,760
from its color and texture,

700
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,800
it is rose wood.

701
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,910
It isn't white acid branch.

702
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,520
The two kinds of wood

703
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,430
have the same appearance,

704
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,970
but the prices are quite different.

705
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,320
Rose wood

706
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,700
has a scent of herb medicine.

707
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,960
But white acid branch smells sour.

708
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,660
You can smell it.

709
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,070
And tell us if it is white acid branch

710
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:00,990
or rose wood.

711
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,300
Song Qing.

712
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,420
Don't be nervous.

713
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,020
Relax.

714
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,860
Do you like playing games?

715
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,640
Let's play a game.

716
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,330
By the way, Mu Yan.

717
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,050
Do you remember the game we played

718
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,620
last time?

719
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,380
What game?

720
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,930
The exciting one.

721
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:26,500
Yes.

722
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,180
Okay.

723
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,880
Play a game with me

724
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,840
to relax.

725
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,890
You can answer my question later.

726
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,190
I'm not angry.

727
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,390
Play a game.

728
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,670
You want to play a game.

729
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,940
It is relaxing.

730
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,520
Lord Song.

731
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,060
Come.

732
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,020
Okay.

733
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,300
Lord Song.

734
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,820
Let me help you.

735
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:01,910
Hold out your right hand.

736
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,800
Put it on the table.

737
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,500
Hand wrestling, right?

738
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,650
Yes.

739
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,870
I'm really good at this.

740
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,080
This is more fun than hand wrestling.

741
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,240
Hold out your left hand.

742
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,090
This...

743
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:16,530
Yes.

744
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,900
-Both hands? -Hold with both hands.

745
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,380
You're going to lose.

746
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,600
You know? I'm good at this.

747
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:21,770
Take a deep breath.

748
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:22,850
Ready.

749
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:23,630
One.

750
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,530
Two.

751
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:32,880
Three.

752
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,330
Please spare my life.

753
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,300
It's my fault.

754
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,680
This is indeed white acid branch,

755
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,390
not rose wood.

756
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,330
I'll get someone to replace it.

757
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:47,910
My god!

758
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,190
All right.

759
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,310
Is it fun?

760
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:58,460
Yes.

761
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,410
No, it's not fun.

762
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,600
Listen, Song Qing.

763
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,490
This time, I'll take it as negligence.

764
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,790
If anything happens next time,

765
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,750
you can resign your position

766
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,040
as the Director of Planning Room.
