Yunxi?

5
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,009
Commander Xiao. Young Master is resting.

6
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,380
Commander Xiao, slow down.

7
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,420
Commander Xiao.

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,660
What are you doing?

9
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:00,740
Commander Xiao,

10
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,190
let's have tea in the front hall first.

11
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,700
Commander Xiao.

12
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,320
You can't go in!

13
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,190
Commander Xiao.

14
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,580
Shoo.

15
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,230
What are you doing?

16
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,350
What are you doing?

17
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,660
I'm asking you.

18
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,220
What are you doing?

19
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,030
Do you hear that?

20
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,090
He's asking you.

21
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,210
Commander Xiao.

22
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,190
Young Master...

23
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
Why don't we move to the front hall

24
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,650
and have some tea?

25
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,520
For what?

26
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,540
Let me tell you.

27
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,790
You're the great Young Master.

28
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,500
It's inappropriate to engage in lewd activities during the day.

29
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,980
Put on your clothes and come see me immediately.

30
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,610
Commander Xiao, please.

31
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,170
Uncle,

32
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,310
why did you

33
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,550
barge in without notice

34
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,430
and interrupt my sweet opportunity?

35
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,900
I'm busy.

36
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,420
You're so overbearing.

37
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,060
You have the nerve to say that?

38
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,060
You're indulging in romantic times

39
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,260
in broad daylight.

40
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,900
If word gets out,

41
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,190
the Supervisory Officials

42
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,180
will make a big fuss again.

43
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,270
Uncle,

44
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,950
you're wrong.

45
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,860
How is it in broad daylight?

46
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,790
I was in my room

47
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,620
with the doors closed.

48
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,150
With a thud,

49
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,860
you barged in.

50
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,570
You messed up my rhythm.

51
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,140
Nonsense.

52
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,070
How can you utter

53
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,920
such shameless words?

54
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,300
As your uncle,

55
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,170
I have to teach you a lesson today.

56
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,820
You've gone too far.

57
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,750
Uncle, you've gone too far.

58
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,700
How could you get physical?

59
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,540
Uncle, you actually hit me.

60
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,659
And you hit me so hard.

61
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,670
Since young,

62
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,430
my father and mother

63
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,010
have never hit me,

64
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,920
not even once.

65
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,710
You're getting on my nerves.

66
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,330
I'll tell on you to my father.

67
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,600
I purposely aimed at the area

68
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,720
where the assassin was injured.

69
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,220
But Xi'er didn't react at all.

70
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,530
Looks like

71
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,620
he's not the assassin.

72
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,620
See?

73
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,380
Look at

74
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,180
how angry uncle is.

75
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,690
He must be suspicious of me.

76
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,340
Why would he suspect you?

77
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,330
Many people are watching me in the mansion.

78
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,740
It's not surprising for him to suspect me.

79
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,490
We should think of a way

80
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,470
to fool him.

81
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,740
How can you fool him like this?

82
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,110
Here's an anesthesia pill.

83
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,040
After taking it,

84
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,310
your pain will be relieved.

85
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,360
Later, no matter what

86
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,140
Commander Xiao does to you,

87
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,020
you won't feel any pain.

88
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,180
Xi'er.

89
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,850
I just wanted to

90
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,300
exchange blows

91
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,960
and have a friendly competition.

92
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,430
Your martial arts skills are poor,

93
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,140
so you lost.

94
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,740
How can you blame me?

95
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,370
If it's just a friendly competition,

96
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,360
then you should have told me first.

97
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,150
Your sudden attack

98
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,370
messed up my rhythm again.

99
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,860
I didn't expect

100
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,700
your skills to be this poor.

101
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,340
Forget it.

102
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,760
I'll stop nagging.

103
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,570
I don't want to annoy you.

104
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,180
Uncle?

105
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,220
Don't go.

106
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,110
You haven't eaten yet.

107
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,420
I have no appetite.

108
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,900
Young Master, you...

109
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,940
Aren't you going to send uncle out?

110
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,580
Yunxi,

111
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,970
what happened?

112
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,830
I'll explain it to you later.

113
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,540
Young Master.

114
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,980
What's wrong with you?

115
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,600
Commander Xiao deliberately tested Young Master

116
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,830
by hitting his wound.

117
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,610
I'm afraid the bleeding won't stop.

118
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,220
I'll go to the Master's Mansion

119
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,800
to get the doctor.

120
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,320
Even if Young Master's cover is blown,

121
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,830
we can't let him remain in such a dangerous state

122
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,500
and risk losing his life.

123
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,980
No, you can't go.

124
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,750
Since Young Master risked his life

125
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,500
to hide his injury,

126
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,060
It means this is a serious matter.

127
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,270
Then are we going to

128
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,380
just watch him die?

129
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,290
Wuyan.

130
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,620
Listen to Yunxi.

131
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,260
Commander Xiao must not

132
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,200
find out about this.

133
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,740
Otherwise,

134
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,220
my years of effort

135
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,260
will be in vain.

136
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,480
As long as we can stop the bleeding

137
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,620
at the moment,

138
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,540
we can buy some time.

139
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,900
I have a solution, but it's risky

140
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,140
and quite agonizing.

141
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,610
It's going to hurt.

142
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,830
Stuff this in your mouth.

143
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,890
Don't you have anesthesia pills?

144
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:12,900
The one I just gave you

145
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,720
was the last one.

146
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,860
Young Master.

147
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,560
Come on!

148
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,190
Young Master, hang in there.

149
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,450
The pain from burning is agonizing,

150
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,180
but once the blood vessels on the wound are burned,

151
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,310
the bleeding will stop.

152
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,420
Dr. Xian.

153
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,580
What's the situation?

154
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,450
This place is already surrounded by

155
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,450
the Supervision Army.

156
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,860
I really can't get out.

157
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,680
But I just heard from the guards

158
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,190
that there was an assassin in the Xiao's Mansion last night.

159
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,900
After being stabbed by Commander Xiao,

160
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,520
the assassin escaped.

161
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,170
In order to catch the assassin,

162
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,430
Commander Xiao has detained all the doctors

163
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,580
in Cangyue City.

164
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,920
An assassin?

165
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,590
Did Yunxi

166
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,920
come to me in a hurry last night

167
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,820
because of this?

168
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,260
Don't worry, Dr. Xian.

169
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,280
I don't think the injured

170
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,830
is Miss Yunxi.

171
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,060
But Commander Xiao

172
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,190
goes too far this time.

173
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,260
After all, you're the son of the Master of Cangyue City.

174
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,510
The great Dr. Xian.

175
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,060
How can you be treated like this?

176
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,340
All right, don't be angry.

177
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,140
In his eyes,

178
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,310
I'm nothing.

179
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,800
You say I'm a prince,

180
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,150
but I'm despised to this extent.

181
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,440
Just a random excuse

182
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,890
and I'm imprisoned here.

183
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,710
I couldn't protect my mother.

184
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,540
I can't love the person I love.

185
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,940
In the entire Cangyue,

186
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,100
is there another prince

187
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,580
as undignified as me?

188
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:32,860
Wuyan.

189
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,120
Take good care of Young Master.

190
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,210
That's not a good idea.

191
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,180
With my image,

192
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,440
living in the same room with Young Master

193
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,410
would result in more gossip.

194
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,840
You should stay.

195
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,450
Yunxi can't stay.

196
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:43,860
You...

197
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,930
Aren't you on duty now?

198
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,380
You'll be punished if you leave your post without permission.

199
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,040
Stand guard.

200
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,140
There's something more important

201
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,870
than standing guard.

202
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,700
I'll stay and take care of Young Master.

203
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,750
Young Master's reputation

204
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,900
has only just recovered.

205
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:55,740
Why are you stirring trouble?

206
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,460
Get out of here now.

207
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,060
I'm not leaving.

208
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,020
I want to take care of Young Master.

209
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,260
If you weren't

210
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,860
Young Master's brother-in-law,

211
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,300
I'd slap...

212
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,020
What are you talking about?

213
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,130
You want to fight?

214
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:08,930
Fine.

215
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,040
Both of you. Leave.

216
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,500
I'll stay.

217
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,180
Young Master.

218
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,730
This is the extent of my help.

219
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,290
Young Master.

220
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,600
Why are you not eating?

221
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,440
With you looking at me like this,

222
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,150
how can I eat?

223
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:59,390
♫Sweet dreams as scheduled, worries hidden in eyebrows♫

224
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,700
You lied to me!

225
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,540
I'm warning you.

226
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm the Young Master.

227
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,140
If you dare to attack me,

228
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,120
♫Her glance gets me drunk in the spring breeze♫

229
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,140
you'll be dead when we get back.

230
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,140
Try me then.

231
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,130
Don't be angry.

232
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,460
I'll carry you back.

233
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,880
♫Looks like we’ve known each other before♫

234
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,720
♫The look in her eyes confirm it♫

235
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:10,730
Let's go.

236
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,120
Yunxi,

237
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,390
I just want to tell you

238
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:18,670
♫Her beautiful smile urges me to review my previous life♫

239
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,550
that I've fallen in love with you.

240
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:26,400
♫The longing is mysterious like misty rain♫

241
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,960
♫Her tenderness stirs up deep and ceaseless affection♫

242
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,330
Jiang Chaoxi.

243
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,350
You hurt my brother,

244
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,530
♫The oath is about to be spoken but stopped♫

245
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,230
so I should resent and hate you.

246
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,460
♫Afraid that the dream will shatter♫

247
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,470
But now I'm hopelessly

248
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:45,950
♫It’s hard to rewrite the ending even after half a lifetime of repentance♫

249
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,220
in love with you.

250
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:46,970
If there is a next life,

251
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,070
♫We meet in the fragrance of sweet-scented osmanthus as the rain knocks♫

252
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,170
may we have no grudges,

253
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,960
♫Smiling under the umbrella brings back the longing again♫

254
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,260
and may I be healthy without illness,

255
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,260
♫The one with desire can’t help that the other does not reciprocate♫

256
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,920
so I can be with you forever.

257
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,390
♫Heartbreaking zither music fills my dream for the rest of my life♫

258
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,010
But in this life,

259
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,210
we're not meant to be together.

260
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,080
♫There is no cure for romantic longing that causes inconsolable heartache♫

261
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,020
♫Clearly interested but biased against the one with desire♫

262
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:58,730
Qing.

263
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,020
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,700
It's my fault.

265
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,400
I went to Xiao's Mansion last night.

266
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,620
Jiang Chaoxi got injured while saving me.

267
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,760
You lied to me again.

268
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,740
You always do this,

269
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,080
leaving me behind

270
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,900
to do such a dangerous thing alone.

271
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,090
Don't be anxious.

272
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,650
Nothing happened to me.

273
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,690
But what if this aroused the poison

274
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,170
in your body?

275
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,780
If Young Master didn't save you...

276
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,680
Young Master.

277
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,230
I would rather it was me

278
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,260
who got stabbed in your place.

279
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,380
What you did today,

280
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,620
disregarding your reputation

281
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,720
to cover up his injury.

282
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,660
Is it because

283
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,620
you feel guilty,

284
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,100
or...

285
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,660
or...

286
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,670
have you fallen for him?

287
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,750
Is this important?

288
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,950
He is the Young Master,

289
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,990
and I don't have long to live.

290
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,310
It's impossible no matter what.

291
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,960
Young Master, have some soup.

292
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,520
What's the matter?

293
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:24,660
Nothing.

294
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:25,870
Just here to deliver soup.

295
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:28,940
Oh, there's something.

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,700
Speak up.

297
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,840
Why don't we skip tomorrow's meeting

298
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,030
at the meeting hall?

299
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:35,590
No.

300
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
I went to great lengths

301
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,920
to defuse uncle's suspicions.

302
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,080
If I don't go tomorrow,

303
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,830
I'm afraid he will become

304
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,620
suspicious again.

305
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:48,910
Uncle was able to

306
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,390
target me so soon.

307
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,930
There must be more of his spies in my mansion.

308
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,200
I'll step up the investigations.

309
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,210
Wait, no.

310
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,120
They have escaped

311
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,190
our multiple investigations.

312
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,280
Their identities are hidden well.

313
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,180
While I'm injured,

314
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,910
don't act rashly

315
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,300
lest we alert them.

316
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:10,900
Yes.

317
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,030
While I was injured,

318
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,859
was Yunxi worried about me?

319
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,180
More than that.

320
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,960
She couldn't rest in peace.

321
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,849
Miss Yunxi must

322
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,900
have feelings for you.

323
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:25,990
She stayed here

324
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,940
all day yesterday.

325
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,260
Really?

326
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,540
It's all my fault for being so charming.

327
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,030
It's natural

328
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,140
for her to like me.

329
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,030
Young Master, what's wrong?

330
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,790
Zhu Wen seems to know

331
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,850
about my injury.

332
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,620
What should we do?

333
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,780
Steward Zhu works for the Master of Cangyue City.

334
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,100
He's not on our side.

335
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,300
But killing him

336
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,620
seems to be a little cruel-hearted.

337
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,740
Yes.

338
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,020
Steward Zhu has been taking care of me for so many years.

339
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,620
He has done so much.

340
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,870
How could I kill him

341
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,540
just for this?

342
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,860
Besides,

343
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:24,950
I like

344
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,820
being with him.

345
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,390
I just hope that

346
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,590
on account of our long relationship,

347
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,850
he can keep it a secret for me.

348
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,640
Young Master, you're badly injured.

349
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,750
What if you can't make it

350
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,500
to the meeting hall tomorrow?

351
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,750
I must go

352
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,810
to the meeting hall tomorrow.

353
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,020
And I'll go

354
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,070
with my injuries.

355
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,110
Otherwise, how long will those doctors

356
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,300
be imprisoned?

357
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,590
Commander Xiao disregarded the law

358
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,770
and imprisoned all doctors in the city for no reason.

359
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,180
He even closed

360
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,650
all the medicine stores.

361
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,410
The people are complaining.

362
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,720
This reckless move

363
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,460
must be punished severely.

364
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,030
Don't charge me

365
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,100
with these trumped-up accusations.

366
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,730
Who is unsatisfied with my behavior?

367
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,740
Who?

368
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,810
You can get him here.

369
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,580
If you get him here,

370
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,420
I can argue with him face to face.

371
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,420
I am unsatisfied.

372
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,110
You're so domineering.

373
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,380
What if someone has an emergency

374
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,180
and needs to see a doctor urgently?

375
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:30,820
What if?

376
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,500
I can only be sorry for their misfortune.

377
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,430
Wrong time to be ill.

378
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,680
Father,

379
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,880
I'm dying!

380
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,980
What happened?

381
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,500
What happened?

382
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,100
Carried in on a stretcher...

383
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,580
What happened?

384
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,600
Why is he carried in?

385
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,140
How inappropriate!

386
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,380
What happened to you?

387
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,690
I'm sick.

388
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,500
What's wrong with you?

389
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,100
What's wrong?

390
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,900
The disease is hard to explain.

391
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,470
This disease

392
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,350
weakens my body.

393
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,590
The itch and pain is unbearable.

394
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,810
I have no appetite,

395
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,580
can't sleep at night,

396
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,570
and can't walk during the day.

397
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,790
You've been talking so much.

398
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,810
What the hell is wrong with you?

399
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,600
Not too severe, not too mild.

400
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,790
Last night,

401
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
I used too much force in the washroom

402
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,310
and got hemorrhoids.

403
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,680
Since you're sick,

404
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,230
you should take a leave and get treated at home.

405
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,910
Why did you come here

406
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,820
and embarrass yourself?

407
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,660
I have no choice.

408
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,870
There's no doctor.

409
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,620
I can't even find one

410
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,330
in the entire Cangyue City.

411
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,390
Commander Xiao.

412
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,540
Do you see that?

413
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,880
Even the Young Master

414
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,340
can't get treatment for his illness.

415
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,110
Not to mention the common people.

416
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,260
Do you still think you are innocent?

417
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,290
What did I do wrong?

418
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,380
I did this

419
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,940
for a reason.

420
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,970
I was almost assassinated in my mansion.

421
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,270
The assassin ran away injured.

422
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,650
And I detained those doctors

423
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,750
to find the assassin.

424
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,420
Assassin?

425
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,340
I guess he came

426
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,910
for your guilty deeds.

427
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,060
Chairman.

428
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,820
You're so aggressive

429
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,900
and speak ill of me.

430
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,390
You even stop me from investigating.

431
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,740
Are you trying to cover up something?

432
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,220
You...

433
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,660
It hurts.

434
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,690
All right.

435
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,580
Stop arguing.

436
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,440
Take Young Master away.

437
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,100
Get a doctor for him.

438
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,530
No, no, no.

439
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,050
Father, it's improper.

440
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,040
This is my butt.

441
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,260
I'll be embarrassed

442
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,770
if someone looks at my butt.

443
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,460
If this gets out,

444
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,500
I will become a joke in Cangyue City.

445
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,150
If you don't see a doctor,

446
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,100
how can you recover?

447
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,600
So we should find

448
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,870
a reliable one.

449
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,500
Father,

450
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,460
why don't we ask Chuxian?

451
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,060
He has excellent medical skills.

452
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,150
And when we were kids,

453
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,540
we took a bath together.

454
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,900
Master.

455
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,130
Dr. Xian

456
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,790
has been detained

457
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,730
by Commander Xiao now.

458
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,660
I'm afraid he can't treat Young Master.

459
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,340
What?

460
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,330
Is my brother imprisoned by my uncle?

461
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,140
How is that possible?

462
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,180
Someone possesses great power.

463
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,600
Not to mention Dr. Xian,

464
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,980
he even thinks nothing

465
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
of the Master.

466
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,440
Stop sowing discord.

467
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,400
Actions speak louder than words.

468
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,070
Dr. Xian is the Master's son,

469
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,700
yet you dare to imprison him.

470
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,920
In Cangyue City,

471
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,350
is there anything

472
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,620
you do not dare to do?

473
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,660
Chairman!

474
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,830
Stop arguing.

475
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,300
You…

476
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,030
Commander Xiao,

477
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,690
this is a matter of civilian safety.

478
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,130
The city can't live one day without the doctor.

479
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,860
Although you are investigating

480
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,520
the assassin,

481
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,680
this method

482
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,820
is indeed inappropriate.

483
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:40,860
Father,

484
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,500
my butt...

485
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,040
Crude!

486
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,820
Since your illness

487
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,680
is so special,

488
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,070
let Chuxian treat you.

489
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,660
Thank you, Father.

490
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,900
Dr. Xian is here.

491
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,860
Dr. Xian.

492
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,340
Brother.

493
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,560
This disease can be severe or mild.

494
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,250
Come.

495
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,490
Let me see your injury.

496
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:24,780
Yunxi,

497
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,210
why don't you give us a minute?

498
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,130
Young Master is actually...

499
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:34,820
This is...

500
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,700
Sword wound.

501
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:41,840
This wound...

502
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,670
Actually, I...

503
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,950
I only care about saving lives

504
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,810
without asking why.

505
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,340
The wound was treated with heated metal.

506
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,090
It was an emergency.

507
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,560
I had no choice

508
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,420
but to do it.

509
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,480
Well done.

510
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,610
The heated metal can stop the bleeding,

511
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,980
but the wound has worsened.

512
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,090
Ordinary medicine

513
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,870
is no longer effective.

514
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,980
What should we do?

515
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,500
We need some new medicine

516
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,640
and acupuncture treatment.

517
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,700
Commander Xiao.

518
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,120
You're here.

519
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,280
Greetings, Uncle.

520
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,260
How is it?

521
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,180
Uncle,

522
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,340
the hemorrhoids

523
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,820
need to be treated patiently.

524
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,940
Mere hemorrhoids.

525
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,010
Xi'er, you're a man.

526
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,740
How can you be so delicate?

527
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,710
Come.

528
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Let me see

529
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,660
how serious it is.

530
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,980
I'm a grown-up.

531
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,170
How can I

532
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,570
show my butt freely?

533
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,730
It's fine if you insist,

534
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,450
but let me see your butt first.

535
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,000
That would be fair.

536
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:00,510
Don't move.

537
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,770
Fine.

538
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,950
I give up.

539
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,530
But, Xi'er,

540
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,890
during your recuperation,

541
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
you will inevitably neglect the business in your mansion.

542
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,750
I will send Steward Xiao

543
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,030
to assist Zhu Wen.

544
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,380
Steward Xiao.

545
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,130
Yes.

546
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,010
Be careful.

547
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,440
I'm afraid someone will take this opportunity

548
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,770
to put Young Master's Mansion in danger.

549
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,300
You need to buy all the necessities and medicine

550
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,760
in person.

551
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,810
Yes, my Lord.

552
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,550
Commander Xiao.

553
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,170
I can handle

554
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,620
the business in Young Master's Mansion.

555
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,550
Besides, you need a helper

556
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,630
to run your mansion.

557
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:42,780
I think

558
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,970
there's no need to bother Steward Xiao.

559
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,820
It's not a problem.

560
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,540
Xi'er is my nephew.

561
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,070
I'm his uncle.

562
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,500
As his uncle,

563
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,630
of course I should show my concern.

564
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,300
Xi'er, I suppose

565
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,230
you will not

566
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,280
refuse my sincere help.

567
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,420
I'm grateful

568
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,340
for your care.

569
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,540
Thanks, Steward Xiao.

570
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,900
I will do my best

571
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,040
for Young Master's Mansion.

572
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,700
All right, Xi'er.

573
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,380
I'm busy.

574
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,730
I'll visit you next time.

575
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:21,700
Dr. Xian,

576
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,730
since the diagnosis is done,

577
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,860
you shouldn't stay here

578
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,060
and disturb Xi'er.

579
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,740
Write the prescription

580
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,600
and give it to Steward Xiao quickly.

581
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,950
He'll fill it.

582
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,490
Yes.

583
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,700
Take a good rest.

584
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:51,640
Young Master,

585
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,180
how could you let Steward Xiao

586
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,410
stay here?

587
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,060
What else can I do?

588
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,100
Do you think

589
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,200
I could have refused?

590
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,060
If I said no,

591
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,570
he would not let it go.

592
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,590
By then, my mother

593
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,460
will know about this too.

594
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,540
By the way,

595
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,600
be careful these days.

596
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:13,730
Yes.

597
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,270
Brother.

598
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,780
Your treatment can't be delayed any longer.

599
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,780
I'll write you a new prescription.

600
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,350
Let me see you off.

601
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,780
Dr. Qi.

602
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
His injury...

603
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:32,990
I won't tell others.

604
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:36,970
I didn't expect that

605
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,940
he would also

606
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,820
have times without choice.

607
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,250
All these years,

608
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,880
it must have been hard for him to hide it.

609
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,420
But I can't

610
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,340
give my prescription

611
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,000
to Steward Xiao.

612
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,450
Anyone who knows medicine

613
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,250
can find out the truth.

614
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,710
Come here.

615
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,250
These herbs

616
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,510
are for external injuries.

617
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,330
I can only make them into pills

618
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,300
and try to sneak them in.

619
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,540
But now,

620
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,100
Let's go.

621
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,510
Young Master's Mansion

622
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,620
is supervised by Commander Xiao's men.

623
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,340
I'm afraid

624
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,820
I'll be questioned the next time.

625
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,020
How can we bring the medicine in?

626
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,410
Make them into pills first.

627
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,780
I'll figure out the rest.

628
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,250
[Liaowu Mansion]

629
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,490
I didn't know

630
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,350
you are

631
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,660
the Steward of Xiao's Mansion.

632
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,190
So I didn't say hello before.

633
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,310
I didn't expect

634
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,900
the assistant of Yun Zhongzi

635
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,380
to be the Young Master's surveyor.

636
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,270
As the saying goes,

637
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,060
the guards of the Prime Minister are influential.

638
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,190
Man struggles upwards.

639
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,140
Water flows downwards.

640
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,830
I came here

641
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,510
with Yun Zhongzi.

642
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,330
He's here too?

643
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,210
Yes.

644
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,650
I couldn't earn money at other places.

645
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,970
So I quit my job.

646
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,910
I heard

647
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,100
Young Master was hiring guards.

648
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,340
My teacher

649
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,320
happened to know something about KungFu.

650
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,380
So,

651
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,550
he came to Young Master's Mansion

652
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,380
as a guard.

653
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,660
A lot of people

654
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,760
wanted this job.

655
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,820
I was the one

656
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,540
who helped him get the job.

657
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:05,700
That's good.

658
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:13,980
Young Master,

659
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,430
Steward Xiao has

660
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,120
the door guarded.

661
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,300
They check everyone who comes in and out.

662
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,100
How dare he!

663
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,430
Commander Xiao is disrespecting the superior.

664
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,150
It seems that

665
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,140
his suspicions have yet to be defused.

666
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,500
Who would believe such a thing?

667
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,460
Young Master, don't worry.

668
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,900
I've already figured out

669
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,270
how to bring

670
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,140
those pills in.

671
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,220
Yunxi,

672
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,490
it's all thanks to you this time.

673
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,070
Otherwise, I wouldn't know

674
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,060
what to do.

675
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,820
It's time

676
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,300
for me to patrol.

677
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,230
I'll take my leave too.

678
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,700
It hurts.

679
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,420
It hurts.

680
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,510
Are you okay?

681
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,500
My wound suddenly hurts.

682
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,640
It hurts so much.

683
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,370
I don't want you to leave.

684
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,710
You lied to me again.

685
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,350
If the wound

686
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:02,980
hurts now,

687
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,280
I'll ask Dr. Xian back.

688
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,780
No.

689
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,380
Don't bother.

690
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,840
I want you.

691
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,910
As long as you're by my side,

692
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,650
it won't hurt anymore.

693
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,580
Stop it.

694
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,460
I have something to do.

695
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:14,750
Be good.

696
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,760
Don't go.

697
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,900
You smell good.

698
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,530
I'm leaving.

699
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,580
This smell...

700
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,390
Brother!

701
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,340
Yun'er, run!

702
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,140
Brother!

703
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,260
What's that smell?

704
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,180
I should have recognized her

705
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,030
the first time

706
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,940
I smelled the scent of the herb.

707
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:27,900
No.

708
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,630
It's too reckless

709
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,530
to tell her now.

710
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,830
If it weren't for her...

711
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,350
Why am I so unlucky today?

712
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,450
I come to visit my cousin,

713
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,120
and I run into this pretentious girl.

714
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,830
Miss, you are here.

715
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,150
Steward Xiao, where is my cousin?

716
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,160
He's inside.

717
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,830
Cousin!

718
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,220
Stop!
