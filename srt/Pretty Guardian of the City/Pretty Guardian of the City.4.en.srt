00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,310
Wuyan.

5
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,070
Open the door. Be quick!

6
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,490
Please.

7
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:52,610
Young Master.

8
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,210
The young master has been pricked like a hedgehog by you.

9
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,460
After my acupuncture,

10
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,259
the poison

11
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,570
has been almost detoxified,

12
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,030
but you still treat me like this.

13
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,590
Isn't that immoral?

14
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:14,940
You...

15
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,320
If you don't believe me,

16
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,180
you can ask Young Master.

17
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,860
Young Master.

18
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,700
if you

19
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,700
feel better,

20
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,020
just blink your eyes

21
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,700
and tell Wuyan.

22
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,820
Look.

23
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,870
Young Master's eyes

24
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,820
are out of control.

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,720
Wuyan.

26
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,260
Forget it.

27
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,100
No matter how much I explain,

28
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,940
you may not believe me.

29
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,060
Ask Dr. Qi if you don't believe me.

30
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,620
Thanks to Miss Yunxi's acupuncture.

31
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,960
Otherwise, if the poison goes into the organs,

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,300
he'll have to lie down for at least half a month.

33
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,240
Do you hear that?

34
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,340
Brother.

35
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,670
You should take a walk

36
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,340
to unblock your qi and blood.

37
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,810
Your body will recover soon.

38
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,200
Dr. Xian, you have no idea.

39
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,140
This girl is really bad.

40
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,900
Although she detoxified Young Master,

41
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,560
she was the one who released the bug.

42
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,350
I didn't.

43
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,020
It's you.

44
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,100
You sneaked around

45
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,780
in the garden in the middle of the night.

46
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,900
I saw it with my own eyes.

47
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,080
Young Master, what should we do?

48
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:18,900
Yes.

49
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,730
Young Master means

50
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,900
flogging fifty times.

51
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,790
I'll execute it myself.

52
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,829
Let her go.

53
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,480
Young Master.

54
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,560
You can speak now?

55
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,770
Dr. Qi,

56
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,920
your medical skills work quickly.

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,590
Impressive.

58
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,770
It's better than last time.

59
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,690
Thanks to your anesthetic,

60
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,020
I don't need to take poison

61
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,410
to control the poison of heartburn in my body.

62
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,660
By the way, Dr. Qi,

63
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,970
I didn't expect you to be Dr.Xian.

64
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,470
Sorry.

65
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,640
I had no choice

66
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,280
but kept it from you before.

67
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,220
I understand.

68
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,230
But for you,

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,310
I'll always be Dr. Qi.

70
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,240
By the way,

71
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,720
besides the anesthetic,

72
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,810
I prescribed some other medicines.

73
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,670
I wanted to bring them to you at Jianjia Alley.

74
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,430
I didn't expect

75
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,460
you're here.

76
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,140
Thank you, Dr. Xian.

77
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,740
By the way, Yunxi,

78
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,390
why are you here?

79
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,300
I'm doing what I'm good at.

80
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,640
Anyway, Young Master needs

81
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,490
a folk surveyor and

82
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,700
the money is good.

83
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,980
It's much better than

84
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,620
I take private jobs from the market.

85
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:38,990
Fair enough.

86
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,490
Even though Young Master is playful,

87
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,380
he is kind-hearted

88
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,860
and tolerant to people around him.

89
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,860
If you are by his side,

90
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,860
I can rest assured.

91
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,180
Kind-hearted,

92
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,480
and tolerant.

93
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,950
It seems that Dr. Qi

94
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,600
doesn't know him well.

95
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,500
Yunxi,

96
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,840
we are friends.

97
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,110
-If you need my help -Move.

98
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,020
-please let me know. -What' s wrong with you?

99
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,500
How can you

100
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,130
to enter the Young Master's mansion at your will.

101
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,100
I need to find someone.

102
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,320
You're looking for someone?

103
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,550
How dare you, a mere farmer,

104
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,460
enter the Young Master's mansion?

105
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,180
Tang Qing,

106
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,620
I'm warning you. Don't go too far.

107
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,110
Qing.

108
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,580
What's wrong?

109
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,660
Wait.

110
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,460
Yunxi.

111
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,090
Yunxi.

112
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,680
What happened?

113
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,060
Dr. Xian. Miss Yunxi.

114
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,820
Xian?

115
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:23,740
He is a friend of

116
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,720
us.

117
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,480
Yunxi,

118
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:29,900
I'm leaving now.

119
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,710
Qing, come with me.

120
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,530
Go!

121
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,370
Yunxi.

122
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,380
Dr. Qi,

123
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,460
Why is he Dr. Xian?

124
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,340
I didn't know it until today.

125
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,260
Dr. Xian usually likes to practice medicine and keeps a low profile.

126
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,270
That's why

127
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,460
he calls himself Dr Qi.

128
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,980
But don't be timid.

129
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,500
Just get along with him as you always do.

130
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,659
By the way,

131
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,740
why are you here?

132
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,210
Did something happen

133
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,190
in Jianjia Alley?

134
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,930
Someone came

135
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,530
to ask you to plan a manor.

136
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,010
Let's not take this job.

137
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,980
I know.

138
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,130
But Uncle Jin said

139
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,160
he gave a lot of money.

140
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,580
They've received the deposit.

141
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,720
And they want Yun Zhongzi

142
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,870
to plan in person.

143
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:10,980
Otherwise,

144
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,270
we have to pay them

145
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,260
100 liang in liquidated damage.

146
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,960
100 liang?

147
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,000
Why did Uncle Jin do that again?

148
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,500
How dare he take the job with such high compensation?

149
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,180
And they want Yun Zhongzi to show up.

150
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,090
I'm just a girl.

151
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,180
By the way,

152
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,050
how much did they pay?

153
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,860
50 liang.

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,310
It's five times higher

155
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,430
than the market price.

156
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,710
Yunxi, do you think something is wrong?

157
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,300
Don' t worry.

158
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,010
How about

159
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,350
we find a way

160
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,530
to raise the compensation for them.

161
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,220
100 liang.

162
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,590
It's enough to feed us in Jianjia Alley

163
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,100
for two or three years.

164
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,230
How about this?

165
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,700
Young Master,

166
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,830
I found that Yunxi

167
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,870
has a special relationship

168
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,780
with Dr. Xian.

169
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:18,930
They look quite close.

170
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,670
Close?

171
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,260
Young Master.

172
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,760
I've sent Dr. Xian away.

173
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,850
Stay away from my brother from now on.

174
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't have any bad intentions.

175
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,550
Why?

176
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,490
How can you be so shameless?

177
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,590
Haven't you hear

178
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,460
what Young Master said?

179
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,720
Young Master,

180
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,409
are you afraid I'll harm Dr. Xian?

181
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:56,980
Don't worry.

182
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,030
Dr. Xian and I

183
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,060
are friends of Damon and Pythias.

184
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:07,700
You may leave now.

185
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,830
I'll make it clear.

186
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,430
My third brother already has a girl in his heart.

187
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,990
He won't fall in love with you.

188
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,909
Young Master, you misunderstood.

189
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,320
Dr. Xian and I have been friends for years.

190
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,909
Our relationship is as pure as a cup of green tea.

191
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,060
I'm warning you.

192
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,070
No matter now or future,

193
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,540
don't ever have any bad intentions

194
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,000
towards my third brother.

195
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,830
I...

196
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,420
Forget it.

197
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,060
It's pointless to tell you.

198
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,580
You won't live long anyway.

199
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,020
Choose a way to die.

200
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,450
Should I stab you to death

201
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,260
or give you a glass of poisonous wine?

202
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,650
Why am I dying again?

203
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,220
I just saved you.

204
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,300
Saved me?

205
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,060
Tell me. Why did that Dian bug

206
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,380
woke up

207
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,030
when it touched your blood?

208
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:38,740
I...

209
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,030
Could it be

210
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,980
the poison in my blood

211
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,280
that wakes the bug up?

212
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,550
Young Master.

213
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,860
My mouth is on fire now with all the talking.

214
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,060
It really wasn't me.

215
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,470
Looks like you won't tell me the truth

216
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,710
unless I torture you with some extreme pulishments.

217
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,990
Guards!

218
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,520
Wait, Young Master.

219
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,670
Young Master, calm down.

220
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,420
I'm not an unreasonable person.

221
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,300
You are also a generous person.

222
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,430
If I can find the person

223
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,710
who kept the bug

224
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,940
to prove my innocence,

225
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:07,950
then

226
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,680
can I live?

227
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,320
Yunxi,

228
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,620
are you alright?

229
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,970
Why did they arrest you?

230
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,560
Did they do anything to you?

231
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,320
Pepper.

232
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,770
I almost lost my virginity.

233
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,030
After all,

234
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,130
I am a decent girl.

235
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,390
He wanted to take off my clothes

236
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,180
as soon as he saw me.

237
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,860
He also asked me to take a bath in front of him.

238
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:48,890
Tell me.

239
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,090
Even though he is the young master,

240
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,590
he can't do whatever he wants, right?

241
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,430
How did you seduce him?

242
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,740
I did it for you.

243
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,300
Why did you also wrong me?

244
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,840
That's a different matter.

245
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,580
Well,

246
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,600
if it weren't for you,

247
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,270
who released the bug that bit Young Master?

248
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,490
I think

249
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,400
there must be someone in the mansion trying to harm Young Master,

250
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,880
and put the bug in the garden.

251
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,790
Unluckily, I happened to pick flowers there

252
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,840
and became a scapegoat.

253
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,130
Good sister.

254
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,230
In this regard,

255
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,420
I feel grateful to you.

256
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,420
By the way,

257
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,690
how's your test?

258
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,660
Thanks to you,

259
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,460
the head of the imperial kitchen

260
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,150
praised me

261
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,160
a lot.

262
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,710
I am now the secondary baker

263
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,660
in the kitchen.

264
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,570
I don' t need to make desserts for pigs anymore.

265
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,080
But if I want to be

266
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,280
the special baker for Young Master,

267
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,340
I need to work harder.

268
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:41,940
Keep up the good work.

269
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,690
You can do it.

270
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,610
By the way, Yunxi.

271
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
We are good sisters.

272
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,860
Let's share happiness together.

273
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,860
By the way, Pepper.

274
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,970
Do me a favor.

275
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,740
Guys,

276
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,840
come and have a rest.

277
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:04,950
Young Master is kind.

278
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,900
He specially rewarded some snacks

279
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,530
for everyone.

280
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,740
Thank you, Young Master.

281
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,730
Thank you, Miss.

282
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,190
You're welcome.

283
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,850
Thank you.

284
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,510
Thank you.

285
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,220
It's delicious.

286
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,060
Yeah.

287
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,460
Yes.

288
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,700
The Young Master rewarded us some good stuff.

289
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,190
Master.

290
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,410
Why aren't you coming?

291
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,520
My hands are dirty.

292
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,590
I just touched the dirt.

293
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,790
It's delicious.

294
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,400
Yes.

295
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:31,980
Hold on.

296
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,700
Guys.

297
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,900
Come and wash your hands first.

298
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,620
Okay.

299
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,330
Coming.

300
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:47,840
Here.

301
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,060
Thank you, Miss.

302
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,850
Thank you, Miss.

303
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,170
Thank you.

304
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,850
You...

305
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,130
The water is poisonous.

306
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,990
What's wrong?

307
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,220
Jiang Chaoxi's study

308
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,420
is the most private place

309
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,360
in Young Master's Mansion.

310
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,000
Could there be a secret room?

311
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:12,820
Yunxi,

312
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,150
How did you...

313
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,090
How did you suspect

314
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,060
the gardener?

315
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,290
Because of the details.

316
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,590
Details?

317
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,980
The Dian bug was found

318
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,730
in the garden,

319
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,980
so the murderer is probably

320
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,600
the gardener who maintains the garden.

321
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,260
Yesterday, you asked me

322
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,940
to take a bath and get close to the bug.

323
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,460
So I guess

324
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,620
the person who fed the bug

325
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,210
must always keep clean.

326
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,620
In my opinion,

327
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,650
the criminal who fed the bug

328
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,300
must be a gardener

329
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,350
who likes to be clean and tidy.

330
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,870
So you poisoned

331
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,390
in the water where they wash their hands.

332
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,220
Yes.

333
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,910
Every day,

334
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
the criminal fed the bug

335
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,830
with his blood,

336
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,380
so there must be cuts on his fingers.

337
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,590
As long as he touches the water

338
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,060
with a small amount of poison,

339
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,130
the poison must enter his body

340
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,020
through the wound.

341
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,370
Once the poison kicks in,

342
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,110
the murderer will show himself up.

343
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,390
You're quite smart.

344
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,990
Thank you, Young Master.

345
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,160
Young Master.

346
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,420
He has confessed.

347
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,580
He was hired

348
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,440
by someone.

349
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,890
Did he confess the man behind this scheme?

350
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,770
Yes.

351
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,660
But...

352
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,250
Just tell me. What's holding you back?

353
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,020
Why are you hesitating?

354
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,650
He said it was Commander Xiao's butler

355
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,070
who arranged it.

356
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,170
Commander Xiao

357
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,200
wanted to kill Jiang Chaoxi.

358
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,680
It seems that their relationship

359
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,090
is not as harmonious

360
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,670
as the rumor said.

361
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,740
Yunxi,

362
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,370
since you caught the murderer,

363
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,280
you've done a good job.

364
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,070
How about this?

365
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,560
What reward do you want?

366
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,140
Pick anything in this room.

367
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,230
I don't want anything material,

368
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,850
but...

369
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,800
But what?

370
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,180
Don't you think

371
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,310
you can reach the heaven

372
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,720
after seeing my body?

373
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:04,940
You...

374
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,780
I just want you to give me a day off

375
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,210
to visit my relatives and friends.

376
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,390
Okay.

377
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,780
Go.

378
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,070
Thank you, Young Master.

379
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,360
Why are you staring at me?

380
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,190
Keep an eye on her.

381
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:23,530
Yes.

382
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,720
Go and check what she's doing.

383
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,270
Are you sure the Dian bug incident

384
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,890
was done by my good uncle?

385
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,760
Are you Yun Zhongzi?

386
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,990
Impossible.

387
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,610
How could Yun Zhongzi

388
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,390
be so young?

389
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,190
Your honor,

390
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,850
my master is really Yun Zhongzi.

391
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,300
It's true.

392
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,770
Although he looks young

393
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,700
my master's

394
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,610
command of feng shui

395
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,940
is one of the best.

396
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,670
He was famous in the city

397
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,550
at the age of 13.

398
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,340
I wonder

399
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,330
who is your teacher?

400
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,160
Are the skills of

401
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,420
the mapping and design

402
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,080
your family heritage?

403
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,150
I lost my parents when I was young.

404
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,240
I met a beggar when I was wandering on the street.

405
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,829
I learned the skills from him.

406
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,290
Beggar.

407
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,339
What's his name?

408
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,130
Where is he now?

409
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:13,359
He passed away.

410
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,690
When I met him,

411
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,400
he was severely sick.

412
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,609
Not long after,

413
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:24,980
he passed away.

414
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,950
We never get to know

415
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,120
his name.

416
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,070
However,

417
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,260
we call him Mr. Beggar.

418
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,390
You...

419
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,500
We are all orphans.

420
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,940
We grew up together.

421
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,780
We've met that Mr. Beggar.

422
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,470
And we've learned from him for a while.

423
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,420
But

424
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,960
our master is the most talented

425
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,010
and the best student.

426
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,290
What a pity.

427
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,020
Then

428
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,280
how old was he?

429
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,150
Don't all beggars

430
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,300
look old and sick?

431
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,680
How can we tell his age?

432
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,920
Fine.

433
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,900
But

434
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,480
he can pass on all of this skill

435
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,830
to you.

436
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,560
It's a blessing.

437
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,150
I'll leave the planning of our manor

438
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,060
to you.

439
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:16,690
OK.

440
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,370
I'll leave you two alone.

441
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,180
Yunxi,

442
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,230
this person is so strange.

443
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,660
He doesn't appear to

444
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,450
care about the manor.

445
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,100
Instead, he keeps inquiring about us.

446
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,580
Maybe

447
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,810
it's us who think too much.

448
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,920
They have nothing but money.

449
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,080
After all, the fortune of the main family

450
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,340
depends on the design of the house.

451
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:42,990
By the way,

452
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,130
look what I brought you.

453
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,440
The dessert from the Young Master's Mansion.

454
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,080
Try it.

455
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:47,970
Is it good?

456
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,130
It's delicious.

457
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,770
You brat,

458
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,430
how dare you pick up my buns?

459
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,780
Bad guy! Don't you hit him!

460
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,610
Don't be afraid. The bad guy is gone.

461
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,730
Do you want to give it to me?

462
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,380
We can share it.

463
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,950
Don't worry. If I have something to eat in the future,

464
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,020
you won't be starving either.

465
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:27,950
Here.

466
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,830
Is it good?

467
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,300
Yes.

468
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,330
First, it's Dr. Xian.

469
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,950
Then this handsome boy.

470
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,670
This girl does

471
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,070
have a lot of friends.

472
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,250
Who's there?

473
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,180
Qing.

474
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,620
Wuyan.

475
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,090
How dare he stalk me!

476
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,370
I was only away for half a day.

477
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,700
Jiang Chaoxi

478
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,800
really has a very suspicious mind.

479
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,300
Qing.

480
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,460
Stop chasing.

481
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,540
Who could he be?

482
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,580
Why is he following you?

483
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,300
Who knows!

484
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:30,900
No.

485
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:31,550
Yunxi,

486
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,060
you can't stay in the Young Master's Mansion anymore.

487
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,780
I'm worried.

488
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,390
How can you be so sure that he was following me?

489
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,810
Maybe

490
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,360
he was stalking that butler.

491
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:37,740
He...

492
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,720
This Yun Zhongzi

493
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,220
is a 15-year-old boy.

494
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,990
And he learned his skills from a beggar.

495
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,010
And that beggar is dead?

496
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,250
Yes.

497
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,730
What a coincidence!

498
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,330
Apart from knowing

499
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,790
Luo's manufacturing skills,

500
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,870
he indeed doesn't have anything to do

501
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,910
with Luo Hexuan.

502
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,060
I wonder

503
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,060
when we can find Luo Hexuan.

504
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,740
It'll be too late

505
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,370
if we can't find Fengchi.

506
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,600
Look at me.

507
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,960
I already have

508
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,130
grey hair.

509
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,990
God will protect you

510
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,930
and help you find Luo Hexuan as soon as possible.

511
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,060
The one who acquires Fengchi will be immortal.

512
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,470
I don't want to be immortal.

513
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,070
As long as

514
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,500
I can live another 100 or 80 years,

515
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,260
I'll be content.

516
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,550
Otherwise,

517
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,980
of all the money and treasures

518
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,320
I have saved,

519
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,310
who will be the one to enjoy them?

520
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,260
Young Master.

521
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,050
I'm so angry.

522
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,300
Quarreling really will consume a lot of energy.

523
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,500
Why is that old Nangong Shi

524
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,260
so stubborn?

525
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,620
Yes.

526
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,780
Young Master.

527
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,860
Sit down.

528
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,500
Have some tea.

529
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,490
Please calm down, Young Master.

530
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,060
You see.

531
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,740
I used to love playing.

532
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,040
He said I was not ambitious.

533
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,310
But now I've decided to turn over a new leaf

534
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,090
and devote myself to my people.

535
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,760
But he still tries everything to stop me.

536
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,840
It's just a drainage culvert.

537
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,620
How come it is

538
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,600
at the people's expense?

539
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,180
Besides, it never occurs to him that

540
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,830
how should we deal with the silting

541
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,340
if there is a heavy rain in the city?

542
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,470
I just want to

543
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,300
fix this problem once and for all.

544
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,500
Young Master is so right.

545
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,980
Don't mind him.

546
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,720
Calm down.

547
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,420
How can I calm down?

548
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,600
If I can't finish the construction of the city

549
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,550
on time,

550
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,240
my father will definitely force me to get married.

551
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,590
At that time, if I marry

552
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,200
Xiao Fengyi and Nangong Siyan,

553
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,550
do you think

554
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,220
my whole mansion would live in peace?

555
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,180
We wouldn't.

556
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:58,710
That's it!

557
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,110
Do you think that old man, Nangong Shi, is

558
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,930
doing this on purpose?

559
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,670
To let me marry his granddaughter,

560
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,260
he deliberately stopped me.

561
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,370
You can't think like that, Young Master!

562
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,340
Although the Chairman is a little stubborn,

563
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,760
he is righteous

564
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,780
and upright.

565
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,890
The whole city is aware of that.

566
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:26,730
Really?

567
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,340
Fine.

568
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,730
Forget it.

569
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,700
For the sake of his age,

570
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,990
I'll spare him.

571
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,880
The snacks

572
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:43,830
are tasty lately.

573
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,680
Delicate and chic, and you can eat one at a time.

574
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,900
Of course.

575
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,460
Everyone in the mansion knows

576
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,650
the young master's mouth is a little longer than two cuns.

577
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,740
The chef specially customized the snacks for your mouth's size.

578
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,010
Not only

579
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,660
are the snacks

580
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,640
exactly the size of your mouth,

581
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,310
but so are the dishes.

582
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,580
Who says my mouth is a little longer than two cuns?

583
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,370
Miss Yunxi.

584
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,140
She didn't even measure it.

585
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:04,840
How could she know?

586
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,420
I forgot

587
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,900
she's a surveyor.

588
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,980
No matter what it is,

589
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,900
she will know its size

590
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,140
when she sees or touches it.

591
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,160
Since the young master has something to do,

592
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,310
I'll take my leave.

593
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,600
Young Master.

594
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:48,900
Go ahead.

595
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,990
Yunxi went to help plan a courtyard

596
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:51,970
for the Xiao family.

597
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,030
Did you hear

598
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,830
what they said?

599
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,620
It was too far away.

600
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,910
I couldn't hear them clearly.

601
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,500
Can't you listen to them closely?

602
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,650
Why are you so stupid?

603
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,340
No.

604
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,570
There is a Kung Fu master around Yunxi.

605
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,510
His ears are

606
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,690
as sharp as bats.

607
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,690
I was only a few steps closer

608
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,330
and then I was spotted.

609
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,980
But I saw that Yunxi and that master

610
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,700
were really close.

611
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,620
She even fed him snacks.

612
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,420
Fed him!

613
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,330
He's a man!

614
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,220
Then why are you so angry?

615
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:32,620
I...

616
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,390
Am I?

617
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,160
Who is angry?

618
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,220
I just can't stand

619
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,080
that she's so flirtatious.

620
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,390
She's the surveyor

621
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,380
in my mansion.

622
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,130
But she flirted with another man.

623
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,980
If she ruins our reputation,

624
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,940
I...

625
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,080
I'm afraid I'll be implicated.

626
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,440
Young Master, you're right.

627
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,430
But I think

628
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,780
that's not the point.

629
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:58,680
The point is

630
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,630
who this Yunxi is?

631
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,220
How would I know who she is?

632
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,710
I didn't...

633
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,810
I didn't figure her out yet.

634
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,490
Why don't we catch her

635
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,770
and torture her?

636
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,740
I don't believe this girl

637
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,800
can handle my tortures.

638
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,610
I've told you 100 times!

639
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,940
Don't be so cruel.

640
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,060
What if you scare her?

641
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,090
I mean...

642
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,720
Yunxi is a little strange,

643
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,870
but she should not be a bad person.

644
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,800
Otherwise,

645
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,060
she would have killed me.

646
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,630
Let's keep an eye on her.

647
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,030
Let her live freely for a few more days.

648
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,000
Doesn't she like acting?

649
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,540
I'll let her act hard.

650
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,650
Let's see how long she'll keep acting.

651
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,540
Let's play it cool,

652
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,820
and find out what she's up to.

653
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,110
You used to be timid,

654
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,420
but now you're indecisive.

655
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,380
Young Master,

656
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,370
you've really changed.

657
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,830
Who is indecisive?

658
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,500
This is called strategy.

659
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,840
Win a victory without shedding a drop of blood, understand?

660
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,580
Alright.

661
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,710
Now come with me

662
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,460
to my uncle's house.

663
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,560
I can't

664
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,650
just let that bug bite me for nothing.

665
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,310
My master, you're indeed majestic and powerful!

666
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,850
It's really as if the great ancestor were alive.

667
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,990
You have shown us

668
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,520
that everything is yours.

669
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,500
Just by looking at you,

670
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,410
we can feel your power and strength.

671
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,060
How about today's painting is called

672
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,140
Shoot a Big Eagle with a Bent Bow?

673
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,020
Okay!

674
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,470
Uncle, someone wants to

675
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,390
kill your beloved nephew!

676
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,100
You have to help me!

677
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,100
My, my arms.

678
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,360
What are you doing?

679
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:45,730
Uncle,

680
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,820
you have no idea.

681
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,850
I almost didn't get to see you.

682
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,310
In just a few days,

683
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,180
your nephew met a series of assassinations.

684
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,670
If I hadn't been lucky,

685
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,430
at this moment,

686
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,940
you should be crying for me.

687
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,480
Fine.

688
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,350
Go away! Get away from me!

689
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,120
You can just stand there and say it.

690
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,620
What's going on?

691
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,490
Did you offend someone again?

692
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,570
Uncle, I'm innocent.

693
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,690
How can I offend anyone?

694
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,230
These days,

695
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,460
I couldn't be more well-behaved.

696
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,350
I've been running around

697
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,330
to build Cangyue City.

698
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,120
I wonder which rebel

699
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,170
wanted me dead.

700
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,800
It was a assassin last time.

701
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,830
Thank God I was lucky

702
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,700
to dodge the bullet.

703
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,170
This time, it's even worse.

704
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,680
They actually

705
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,460
used a  goddamn bug!

706
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,790
This is too much!

707
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,180
Watch out, Master!

708
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,900
Trample this Dian bug to death! Hurry!

709
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,260
We can't let them run wild in the house!

710
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,180
Step on it.

711
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:37,820
Yes.

712
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,170
Step on it! Step on it hard!

713
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:39,930
It bit me.

714
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,980
I was pricked so many times because of it.

715
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,490
It's fine that I suffered, Uncle.

716
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,620
But my Ham.

717
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,390
After he was bitten by this bug,

718
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,330
he bled to death.

719
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,820
Wait, Uncle.

720
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,130
How do you know this is a Dian bug?

721
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,820
This, this, this...

722
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,580
I,

723
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,850
I've heard

724
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,750
there is a bug

725
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,330
that can kill people without leaving a trace.

726
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,960
It must be that kind of bug.

727
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,260
Right?

728
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,040
But don't worry.

729
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,680
I will definitely investigate this matter.

730
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,200
Uncle,

731
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,460
I did offend someone,

732
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,660
but I've never killed anyone.

733
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,450
Who has a deep grudge against me

734
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,850
and wants to kill me?

735
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:34,950
Xi'er,

736
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,860
You don't have to kill someone

737
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,000
to let them hold a deep grudge against you.

738
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,590
Why can't you see it?

739
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,500
Just take the old man Nangong Shi

740
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,820
for example.

741
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,870
He's dead-set against building a culvert on the west side of the city

742
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,740
to drain the water.

743
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,110
Do you really think

744
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,990
he is fair and upright and afraid of spending money?

745
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,770
Then what could it be?

746
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,910
His ancestors

747
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,030
were buried in the west of the city.

748
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,590
If you build a Handong there,

749
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,000
you'll ruin

750
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,640
the feng shui of his family.

751
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,660
You will be hated.

752
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,870
So,

753
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,410
who else

754
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,950
but your mother and uncle

755
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,650
would treat you with their hearts?

756
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,670
No one!

757
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,610
Only my uncle.

758
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,250
Uncle.

759
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,300
From now on,

760
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,870
I will be at your command.

761
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,070
Good, Xi'er.

762
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,540
If you talk like this,

763
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,830
I'll

764
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,120
help you today!

765
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,140
I will investigate this thoroughly

766
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,470
and help you find the culprit!

767
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,210
Thanks, uncle.

768
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,700
You can go back if there's nothing else.

769
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,580
What are you drawing?

770
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,130
Look at your drawing.

771
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,640
What the hell is this?

772
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,770
He doesn't look like a human or a ghost.

773
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:53,750
You didn't show

774
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,140
my uncle's bravery at all.

775
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,800
I deserve to die.

776
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,430
Not handsome enough?

777
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,270
Don't move.

778
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,410
So brave.

779
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,420
So heroic.

780
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,300
Uncle.

781
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,550
Stay in this position.

782
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,160
You are so powerful.

783
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,000
Please don't move.

784
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,570
Go away. I'll draw it myself.

785
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,800
Here, give me a pen.

786
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,070
What is the theme of this painting?

787
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:28,970
Young Master,

788
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,060
this painting is called "shooting a big eagle with a bent bow."

789
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,180
What a cliché!

790
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,650
I think this painting

791
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,060
should be called

792
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,010
"Killing the Eagle."

793
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,870
It will make my uncle more domineering.

794
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,630
That's right.

795
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:57,420
Uncle,

796
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,230
have the painting mounted well later.

797
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:12,650
[Xiao's Mansion]

798
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,340
Look at you.

799
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:16,900
I was so worried

800
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,040
because of you!

801
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,070
Why did you

802
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,180
have to draw that silly eagle-killing painting?

803
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
If you really piss him off,

804
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,550
how can I

805
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,500
protect you by myself?

806
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,780
Don't think that

807
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,300
I am as stupid as you.

808
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,480
He won't do anything to me.

809
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,930
Then why did he let that bug bite you?

810
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,180
He just wanted to warn me.

811
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,680
Maybe he think

812
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,840
I've been disobedient lately.

813
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,520
So he scared me with that bug.

814
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,830
And then,

815
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,600
he would find a way

816
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,100
to frame it on Nangong Shi

817
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,250
so as to make me have a conflict with him.

818
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,240
Unfortunately, he didn't expect

819
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,980
that I would be safe and sound.

820
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,650
But let Yunxi

821
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,860
make a contribution by accident.

822
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,190
Commander Xiao is so cruel.

823
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,590
After all,

824
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,510
you are his nephew

825
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,380
nominally.

826
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,750
Nephew?

827
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,820
Brother, what should we do now?

828
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,620
If the Master of Cangyue City finds out

829
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,680
I didn't give birth to Xi'er,

830
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,790
I will be doomed.
