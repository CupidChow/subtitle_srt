[Episode 17]

4
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,100
Look at that color.

5
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,940
So ugly.

6
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,660
What are you doing?

7
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,570
I'm changing it for you.

8
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,039
No need.

9
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,650
Such a strange color.

10
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,759
Is it from a girl?

11
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,040
Is it from Yunxi?

12
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,780
I knew it.

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,090
Only she would choose

14
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,699
such a tacky color.

15
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,390
I like it.

16
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,490
Stop right there!

17
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,960
You took hers,

18
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,380
so you have to take mine too.

19
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,470
Miss.

20
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,000
Take it back. I don't want it.

21
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,360
If you dare to return it,

22
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,970
I won't talk to you again.

23
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:26,650
Miss,

24
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,670
please don't force me.

25
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,730
Tang Qing,

26
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,130
I hate you so much!

27
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,000
Miss.

28
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,770
Do you want to know your fortunes?

29
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,890
Marriage. Destiny.

30
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,980
Future. Wealth.

31
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,650
I can look at the flowers and tell your fortunes.

32
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,780
Are you interested?

33
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,810
No. Let's go.

34
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,130
Judging from your faces,

35
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,180
you are destined to be together.

36
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,670
In the future,

37
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,290
you will be a loving couple

38
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,090
and live happily together.

39
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,870
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,360
How's it possible that he's the one for me?

41
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,650
Miss, you haven't paid.

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,380
Nonsense.

43
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,720
You need to pay me more or less.

44
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,190
You...

45
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,820
Poor me.

46
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,370
My brother's condition is getting worse.

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,340
I can't even get him to drink the ginseng soup.

48
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,060
He won't last long if this goes on.

49
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,500
I want to go to the Xiao's Mansion again.

50
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,100
No way.

51
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,260
Fengchi

52
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,370
is not in Commander Xiao's hands.

53
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,390
The rumors

54
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,660
about Fengchi

55
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,670
were perhaps spread

56
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,520
by someone deliberately.

57
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,000
I spread

58
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,670
those rumors.

59
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,050
So it was a trap

60
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,120
you set up.

61
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,720
You planned to lure out

62
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,100
the one who took the Swing Painting.

63
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,220
But I accidentally

64
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,910
fell into

65
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,870
your trap.

66
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,140
I didn't expect

67
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,290
you to visit the Xiao's Mansion that night.

68
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,100
It's my fault that you were stabbed.

69
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,860
Fine.

70
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,760
I'll take it as a blessing in disguise.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,770
I saved your life

72
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,530
and we're together now.

73
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,750
But there's one thing

74
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,779
I don't understand.

75
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,540
If the Swing Painting

76
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,800
is really in my uncle's hands,

77
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,170
why hasn't he found Fengchi

78
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,010
in the past eight years?

79
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,120
Actually,

80
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,150
I'm confused about that too.

81
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,610
But I'm sure

82
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,190
that the Swing Painting is in the Xiao's Mansion.

83
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,590
Maybe there's something tricky

84
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,480
about the Swing Painting

85
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,540
and Commander Xiao

86
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,540
hasn't figured it out.

87
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,340
Since you're sure about where it is,

88
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,350
let's find a way

89
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,180
to get it first.

90
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,080
However,

91
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,659
you can't take the risk

92
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,580
of breaking into the Xiao's Mansion again.

93
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,520
But my brother…

94
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,390
Leave it to me.

95
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,110
If we don't want

96
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,460
to alert my uncle again,

97
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,890
we have to bide our time

98
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,630
to get the Swing Painting.

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,550
My brother has been lying here alone

100
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,860
for so long.

101
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,260
He must be very lonely.

102
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,740
After he wakes up,

103
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,770
I will take him back to the Jianjia Alley.

104
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,370
With all of us

105
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,570
around him,

106
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,790
he'll be very happy.

107
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:12,960
So,

108
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,900
you still want to go back to the Jianjia Alley.

109
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,860
It's shabby,

110
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,890
but my home is there.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,270
[The Blueprint of Cangyue City]

112
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,480
Maybe

113
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,180
I should tear down the Jianjia Alley.

114
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,170
Young Master, are you crazy?

115
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,680
It was an effort for us to save it.

116
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,350
Why did you have a change of heart?

117
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,570
You fool.

118
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,820
You know what?

119
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,440
Yunxi's childhood

120
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,540
was very miserable

121
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,990
and depressing.

122
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,860
I want to do something for her.

123
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,690
Money and jewelry

124
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,010
are too vulgar.

125
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,870
I want to rebuild her home for her.

126
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,780
Young Master,

127
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,160
I doubt it will work.

128
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,540
Why?

129
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,650
In my opinion,

130
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,570
you should rebuild

131
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,640
the whole Winding Alleys.

132
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,580
I bet you also want

133
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,510
to build a mansion

134
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,700
in that slum

135
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,290
which will become an easy target for thieves.

136
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,700
Good idea.

137
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,140
Young Master,

138
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,180
I was joking.

139
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,420
You didn't take it seriously, did you?

140
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,870
Rebuilding the Winding Alleys will cost a lot.

141
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,330
Even the City Treasury

142
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,520
may not be able to afford it.

143
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,320
You underestimate me.

144
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,310
Do you think

145
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,950
I'm as stupid as you?

146
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,890
You know you're no better than me.

147
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,810
Go back to your work.

148
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,760
Listen.

149
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,780
Don't let Yunxi know about this.

150
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:50,830
Forget it.

151
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,670
Don't talk to her

152
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,800
in the next three days.

153
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,820
Otherwise…

154
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,180
I think we'd better

155
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,130
trust each other more

156
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,330
and be more friendly to each other.

157
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,760
You've been in the study for so long.

158
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,560
What are you doing?

159
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,970
I'm learning

160
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,160
mapping skills.

161
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,790
Really?

162
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,390
Tell me.

163
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,860
Are you holding out on me?

164
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,510
No.

165
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,970
We should be honest with each other.

166
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,740
If you lie and keep secrets,

167
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,260
I'll be sad.

168
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,780
That's not necessarily right.

169
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,540
In fact,

170
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,860
sometimes white lies

171
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:52,260
can bring us

172
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,780
closer to each other.

173
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,060
So,

174
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,720
you admit that you are holding out on me?

175
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,370
Can't you just be honest with me?

176
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,890
Wuyan has told me everything.

177
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,060
An imbecile he is.

178
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,300
I just want to give you a surprise.

179
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,870
That's not a surprise.

180
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,780
It's a bombshell.

181
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,460
Tell me.

182
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,670
Have those aristocrats

183
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,860
gone back on their word?

184
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,040
You couldn't stand the pressure

185
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,150
and decided to tear down

186
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,930
the Winding Alleys.

187
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,159
[Draft of rebuilding the Jianjia Alley into Futian Institution.]

188
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,600
Don't you want to take your brother

189
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,179
back to live in the Jianjia Alley?

190
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,970
So I want to rebuild

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,039
the Jianjia Alley.

192
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,040
I wanted to give you a surprise.

193
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,010
It's all Wuyan's fault. That stupid guy.

194
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,860
He'll be fined three months' salary.

195
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,480
Three months are not enough.

196
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,510
Make it three years.

197
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,700
Okay.

198
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,590
The Winding Alleys to the south

199
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,940
are an old

200
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,120
and messy neighborhood.

201
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,960
People there

202
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,620
are living in tough conditions.

203
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,580
They also seriously affect

204
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,680
the overall layout and beauty

205
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,370
of Cangyue City.

206
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,340
So I think

207
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,230
we should tear down the Winding Alleys

208
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,010
and build Futian Institution there.

209
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,100
But this is a serious matter.

210
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,870
You can't come up with it

211
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,620
on a whim

212
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,050
and expect us all to agree.

213
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,980
As for the expense of building Futian Institution,

214
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,630
I've written clearly about it

215
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,190
in the proposal.

216
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,490
[Proposal]

217
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,420
Please take a look, Father.

218
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,450
The City Treasury

219
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,980
will find the money spent worth it.

220
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,500
Young Master, you're not in charge of the City Treasury

221
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,410
so you don't know about it.

222
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,250
The City Treasury can't afford such expense.

223
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,580
Our city has been developing slowly these years

224
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,920
and taxes have been reduced.

225
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,010
We don't have extra money.

226
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,660
Well...

227
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,660
I know

228
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,200
you proposed to rebuild the Winding Alleys

229
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,260
for the well-being of the people.

230
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,940
I don't object to it

231
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,510
and I won't.

232
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,220
But I'm afraid

233
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,000
you have to pay for it out of your own pocket.

234
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,350
Uncle,

235
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,210
you can't say that.

236
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,650
Everyone standing here

237
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,210
is a pillar of Cangyue City.

238
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,670
We all should strive for

239
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,400
the well-being of the people.

240
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,970
Since the City Treasury is cash-strapped,

241
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,750
in my opinion,

242
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,410
Uncle should take the lead

243
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,150
to donate some money

244
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,640
for the construction of Futian Institution.

245
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,250
Sorry to disappoint you, Young Master,

246
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,740
but I've made

247
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
lots of donations these years

248
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,260
and don't have

249
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,220
much savings.

250
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,010
However,

251
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,480
Young Master's proposal

252
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,330
will greatly benefit our people.

253
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,220
Therefore,

254
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,700
even if everyone in my household

255
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,880
has to tighten our belts,

256
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,650
I'll be the first one to support Young Master.

257
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,020
I'll donate

258
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,050
a month's salary.

259
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,690
I'm glad to make a bit of a contribution

260
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,940
to the construction of Futian Institution.

261
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,010
Master,

262
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,050
I don't have money,

263
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,590
but I'm willing to

264
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,990
sell the house I prepared for my retirement

265
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,620
to support Young Master!

266
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,250
You've been pretending to be ignorant in the meeting hall

267
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,290
and using all your wits to deal with your uncle

268
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,000
for all these years.

269
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,210
It must have been hard for you.

270
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,330
Father,

271
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,400
you finally

272
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,270
recognize my efforts.

273
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,480
I'm so glad.

274
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,590
Why don't you also donate some money

275
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,060
to build Futian institution?

276
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,850
Cut the crap.

277
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,340
Zhu Wen is my man.

278
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,590
You must have known it.

279
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,460
So I'll be honest with you.

280
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,310
I've been watching

281
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,070
your every move.

282
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,360
Since you were young,

283
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,130
I've liked you the most among your siblings.

284
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,970
You're the smartest one

285
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,080
and are just like me.

286
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:16,970
But now...

287
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,420
You...

288
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,740
Father.

289
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:21,990
Enough.

290
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,680
Actually, I know

291
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,850
you have no other options.

292
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,220
Raising money to rebuild the Winding Alleys

293
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,630
is very hard.

294
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,920
But you have to do it

295
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,690
for the prosperity

296
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,260
of our people

297
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,360
and to make them

298
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,670
live a better life.

299
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,920
You must do your best.

300
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,470
I support you from the bottom of my heart.

301
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,530
Then...

302
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,050
What about the donation?

303
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,630
I...

304
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,010
I support you mentally.

305
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,170
So stingy.

306
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,350
-So glib. -What are you murmuring?

307
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,650
I said I really admire you.

308
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,130
Thank you for your support, Father.

309
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,170
If there's nothing else,

310
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,370
I'll take my leave.

311
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:01,790
Wait.

312
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,670
Now let's talk about family affairs.

313
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,540
Your mother fell sick because of you.

314
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,620
Why haven't you visited her?

315
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,790
I'll go visit her now.

316
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,490
Greetings, Mother.

317
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,490
It's too oily.

318
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,840
Do you want to make me sicker?

319
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,320
Who made the soup?

320
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,240
Madam,

321
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,260
I made it.

322
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,190
Did you?

323
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,910
The soup you kindly made for me

324
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,570
should not be wasted.

325
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,330
You drink it.

326
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,340
Mother,

327
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,540
I've been bustling around for a while

328
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,590
and haven't eaten anything yet.

329
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:55,650
How about

330
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,110
giving the soup to me?

331
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:08,710
Mom.

332
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,480
What are you doing?

333
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,220
I'm showing

334
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,810
you kindness

335
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:15,910
but you made it look like

336
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,180
I'm bullying you.

337
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,660
You're all here.

338
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,920
Chuxian, you're here too.

339
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,590
You visited Mother

340
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,780
more frequently than I did.

341
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,420
Anyway,

342
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,780
you are the most filial one

343
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,780
among our brothers.

344
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:58,840
Good.

345
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,240
Mother.

346
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,040
How have you been?

347
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,210
Still breathing.

348
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,640
How could you say that?

349
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,940
You know what?

350
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,600
You can't imagine

351
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,530
how much I've missed you these days.

352
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,220
I...

353
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,280
I was impulsive last time.

354
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,870
I'm here

355
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,980
to apologize to you.

356
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,700
Lady Mo,

357
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,820
why don't you and Chuxian take your leave?

358
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:35,700
Yes.

359
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Did I allow you to leave?

360
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,830
Jiang Chaoxi.

361
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,600
Are you here to see me

362
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,780
or to plead for them?

363
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,630
Mother,

364
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,460
don't get me wrong.

365
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,840
Of course I'm here to see you.

366
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,630
What's wrong?

367
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,790
Has Chuxian done something that made you angry?

368
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,100
Chuxian, how could you?

369
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,470
You've been thoughtless

370
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,470
since you were young.

371
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,020
Why did you make Mother angry so often?

372
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,370
Don't come here again.

373
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,760
All you do is make Mother angry.

374
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,820
Even looking at you is annoying.

375
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,480
Why are you still here?

376
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,180
Leave now.

377
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:10,470
Yes.

378
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:13,660
You two…

379
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,680
Don't be angry.

380
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,080
Don't be angry.

381
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,710
Calm down.

382
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,430
If your condition gets worse,

383
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,140
I'll be worried sick.

384
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,250
I'm angry because of you.

385
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,740
Leave now.

386
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,340
No.

387
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,780
You actually want me to stay, right?

388
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,290
You didn't mean what you said.

389
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,290
Mother,

390
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,340
I'm here today

391
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,740
because of a tricky matter.

392
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,020
I want you to help me.

393
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,240
What trouble have you got into this time?

394
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,300
How could you

395
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,800
put it in such a hurtful way?

396
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:51,960
It's a serious matter.

397
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,900
A serious matter.

398
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,450
I have been

399
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,180
raising money

400
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,550
to build Futian Institution.

401
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,710
I'm so bothered

402
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,150
that my hair turned grizzled.

403
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,170
I thought of

404
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,030
the valuable things you have.

405
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,430
Mother…

406
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,230
I knew you came to see me

407
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,109
with ulterior motives.

408
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,460
Get out!

409
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,369
I get a headache at the sight of you.

410
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,069
Mother must not have had a headache

411
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:16,760
because of me.

412
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,400
Let me tell you.

413
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,710
It must be this vase

414
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,530
that has affected my mother's mood.

415
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,140
How dare you make my mother angry.

416
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,579
It's fine.

417
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,660
I'll move them away for you later.

418
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,190
Put it down.

419
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,260
And this bottle.

420
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,050
You have to piss me off, right?

421
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,510
Alright.

422
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,450
I'm fine.

423
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,250
But Her Ladyship

424
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,310
has gone too far.

425
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,850
I don't mind being wronged.

426
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,530
As long as you can live a stable

427
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,520
and safe life,

428
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm satisfied.

429
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,040
It's all my fault.

430
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,810
I can't protect you.

431
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,190
In front of outsiders,

432
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,580
call me Lady Mo.

433
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,580
I was Her Ladyship's maid.

434
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,810
I accidentally

435
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,350
became Master's concubine.

436
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,230
Of course Her Ladyship doesn't like me.

437
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,550
I'm used to it.

438
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,260
Just bear with it.

439
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,800
As long as you're fine,

440
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,720
I will be happy.

441
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,660
Mother.

442
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,070
I'll go beg Father

443
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,700
to let us go.

444
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,870
Don't do that!

445
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,410
Silly boy.

446
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,540
How can you think like that?

447
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,070
All these years,

448
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,410
Master and Her Ladyship

449
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,320
have helped us a lot.

450
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,060
You should be polite

451
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,000
and focus on

452
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,820
serving Young Master well.

453
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,890
You are his younger brother.

454
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,180
As long as you behave well

455
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,020
in front of him,

456
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,950
he will not

457
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,100
treat you unfairly in the future.

458
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,060
Got it?

459
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,140
Don't mention

460
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,890
about leaving again.

461
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,680
As long as we follow the rules,

462
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,810
we will live a happy life.

463
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,520
Got it, Mother.

464
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,210
Thank you for saving me today. Young Master.

465
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,340
We are brothers.

466
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,320
Don't treat me as a stranger.

467
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,910
Call me Brother.

468
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,170
Okay. Brother.

469
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:34,960
Have a seat.

470
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,990
Brother, what can I do for you?

471
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,290
I need your help.

472
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,260
Help me complete the construction

473
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,290
of Futian Institution.

474
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:49,770
Futian Institution?

475
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,060
Brother, as you know,

476
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,180
I'm just a doctor.

477
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,620
I can save people,

478
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,970
but I'm afraid I can't do construction.

479
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,610
Who said you couldn't?

480
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,430
You study hard

481
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,740
and love the people.

482
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,630
You're a wise man.

483
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,000
It is such a good chance

484
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,100
to make contributions.

485
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,630
As long as you seize the chance

486
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,300
and work hard,

487
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,210
Father and the officials

488
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,270
will be impressed by you.

489
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,080
But, Brother,

490
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:17,980
as you know,

491
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,530
that's not what I want.

492
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,430
I just want to live a peaceful life

493
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,730
and protect Mother.

494
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,820
That's all.

495
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,800
Third Brother.

496
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,330
I know

497
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,050
you want to protect Lady Mo,

498
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,070
but you can't just

499
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
compromise.

500
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,540
You have to make yourself stronger.

501
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,170
Only by being strong

502
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,480
can you

503
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,190
be qualified and able to protect

504
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,130
who you want to protect.

505
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,760
I know

506
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,450
you want to change

507
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,170
and are eager to work for the people.

508
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,400
Why don't you take this opportunity

509
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,940
as a good start?

510
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,300
You know the will of the people

511
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,500
and strategies.

512
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,810
This is the real you, right?

513
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,350
You are ambitious

514
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:04,900
and devote yourself to the people.

515
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,560
I'm afraid

516
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,740
that you acting dandyishly

517
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,370
is just your disguise.

518
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,550
There's no need to say it clearly.

519
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,480
I have no choice.

520
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,150
All the time,

521
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,660
my uncle and his people

522
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,750
have had strict control over me.

523
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,880
In their hearts,

524
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,740
they want

525
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,240
a foolish

526
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,540
and obedient nephew.

527
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,910
But I couldn't find

528
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,970
the evidence of his corruption.

529
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,980
I didn't expect

530
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,970
you and I were in the same boat.

531
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,100
As you said,

532
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,170
I couldn't even protect

533
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,830
the woman I love.

534
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,650
Third Brother.

535
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,260
You don't have to be like this.

536
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,980
Don't worry

537
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,340
about the wedding.

538
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,220
I will never marry

539
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,740
Fengyi and Miss Nangong,

540
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,010
because Yunxi is the only one

541
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,070
in my heart.

542
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,070
Even if I have to marry someone,

543
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,300
I will only marry her.

544
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,520
I really admire

545
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,640
your deep love.

546
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,500
Since you trust me,

547
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,950
I will do my best.

548
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:17,740
Okay.

549
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,510
Except for the money

550
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,170
that Young Master pocketed from Her Ladyship,

551
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,260
a total of 2,100 liangs

552
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,140
are raised.

553
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,710
To build Futian Institution,

554
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,060
the money is far from enough.

555
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,920
It's all my uncle's fault.

556
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,150
All the officials

557
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,630
are cowards.

558
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,750
No one dares to surpass him in donation.

559
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,890
The current problem

560
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,940
is how to raise the money.

561
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:54,860
Shut up!

562
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,840
After all,

563
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,870
I'm one of the intellectuals.

564
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,380
I should have the right to speak.

565
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,260
Dr. Xian.

566
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,930
Brother, I think

567
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,150
we can let Wuyan say something.

568
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:09,940
Go ahead.

569
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,730
I think we can

570
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,360
be bold.

571
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,950
Let's visit Xiao's Mansion at night

572
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,150
and steal the wealth

573
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,140
that Commander Xiao has coveted

574
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,410
in recent years.

575
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,980
The money can't be exposed.

576
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,270
He won't report it if he loses it.

577
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,650
I think this is a good idea.

578
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,260
You've become smarter. Wuyan.

579
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,290
But

580
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,220
it's a bit risky.

581
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,290
Since this idea

582
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,030
is proposed by Wuyan,

583
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,900
let him have a try.

584
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,720
If you succeed,

585
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,200
you'll be the hero of Futian Institution

586
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,980
and be famous in the future.

587
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,480
If you fail and get caught on the spot,

588
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,170
you will be chopped

589
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,700
by my uncle's soldiers.

590
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,940
I will remember

591
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:49,720
to tell your story

592
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,860
over and over again

593
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,170
in the future.

594
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:52,720
How about that?

595
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,660
Wish you success.

596
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,710
You must be joking.

597
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,810
I think this idea

598
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,050
is a little immature.

599
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,920
You talk first.

600
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,980
I'll think about it again.

601
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,670
In order to raise donations,

602
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,910
it seems that

603
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,830
we need to start it from common people.

604
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,560
Don't these officials

605
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,540
care about their dignity the most?

606
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,910
Why don't they care about it

607
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,330
when it comes to donation?

608
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,300
I have an idea.

I'm here to tell you the good news.

What?

626
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,150
It's a surprise.

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,900
Okay.

You top the list.

publicize this good deed you did, Uncle.

I mean

649

you are too high-profile.

650
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,200
This is against

00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,030

you can be a low-key person,

but you should do things in a high profile.

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,750
I asked Yunxi to send them to you.

691
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,260
Maybe the Xiao's Mansion is too big,

692
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,290
so she got lost.

693
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,120
But she's old enough now.

694
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,710
Just leave her alone.

695
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,680
Okay.

696
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,210
We'd better go find her.

697
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,850
If Miss Yunxi gets lost,

698
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,880
she'll be worried.

699
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,820
Go and find her.

700
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,540
Cousin.

701
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,270
I heard that you had been busy

702
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,300
raising donations

703
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,150
for Futian Institution these days.

704
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,070
Have you raised enough money?

705
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:27,740
Cousin.

706
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,700
Have you raised enough money?

707
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,050
Of course not.

708
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,620
We still need a lot of money.

709
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:36,640
Father.

710
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,920
You have to donate more.

711
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,840
Uncle donated 100 liangs.

712
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,510
Only 100 liangs?

713
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,700
You are so stingy.

714
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,670
How can I

715
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,260
establish myself in the Noble Lady's circle?

716
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,620
Nangong Siyan

717
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,930
will laugh at me.

718
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,640
I'm stingy.

719
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,140
What do you know?

720
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,740
100 liangs.

721
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,850
100 liangs are enough.

722
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,060
My monthly salary

723
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,990
is only 100 liangs.

724
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,220
You don't need to take care of the family,

725
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,660
so you don't know that the daily necessities are expensive.

726
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,740
Take a look.

727
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,910
There are so many people

728
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,900
living on

729
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,100
my salary

730
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,850
this month.

731
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,170
There's really no money

732
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,320
in the Xiao's Mansion.

733
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,410
Nonsense!

734
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,630
You spend hundreds of liangs

735
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,790
buying cumumber for your face every month.

736
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,460
And facial masks

737
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,210
which can

738
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,230
whiten your skin.

739
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,420
Enough.

740
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,560
Stop talking nonsense.

741
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,530
Feed your rabbit.

742
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,620
No.

743
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,290
This concerns my dignity.

744
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,390
I can't let Father

745
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,380
mess around like this.

746
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,500
How dare you?

747
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,090
You...

748
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,020
Fine.

749
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,470
I have an idea

750
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,170
which can both save her face

751
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,150
and save your embarrassment.

752
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,860
Tell me.

753
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:45,980
How about

754
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,340
donating some money first

755
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,410
and setting an example for the officials?

756
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,120
With you as the leader,

757
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,290
the officials and rich merchants

758
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,700
will be encouraged

759
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,220
to donate.

760
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:58,790
When I get

761
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,100
the donations,

762
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,250
I'll return your money to you.

763
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:02,710
Cousin...

764
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,980
I'll double it for you,

765
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:05,650
okay?

766
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,310
Write an IOU.

767
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,700
A 5,000-liang note. Take it.

768
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,510
Five thousand?

769
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,910
Thank you, Uncle.

770
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,270
You two!

771
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,030
One is my future husband,

772
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,680
and the other is my father.

773
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,450
How despicable you are!

774
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,880
You even faked the good deeds.

775
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,110
You guys, search separately.

776
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,110
Brother,

777
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,650
where is Miss Fengyi's yard?

778
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,010
Listen.

779
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,030
My uncle is like

780
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,820
a loach in the water.

781
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
He is too cunning.

782
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,590
His cunning mind

783
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,220
is devoted to striving for power and profit all his life.

784
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,310
If he owns Fengchi,

785
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,100
I'm afraid Cangyue City is over.

786
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,040
It was such a good opportunity.

787
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,790
I missed it.

788
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,230
Don't worry.

789
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,980
I'll find a chance to bring you here again.

790
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,940
According to my observation today,

791
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,270
the Xiao's Mansion is heavily guarded

792
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,750
and Commander Xiao is suspicious.

793
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,230
I'm afraid it will be very hard

794
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,030
to find another chance

795
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,820
to enter his study.

796
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,210
Yes.

797
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,090
He is too cunning.

798
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,790
It's not easy

799
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,750
to get something from him.

800
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,540
Fortunately, we found something.

801
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,500
We'll find another chance.

802
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,220
Did your fish take the bait?

803
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,060
Of course.

804
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,630
I'm going to spread this.

805
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,710
With my uncle as the leader,

806
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,320
I believe

807
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:05,940
all the officials will follow him.

808
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,460
The money problem will be solved.

809
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,580
Then how to deal with

810
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,330
the refund?

811
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,120
It's hard, but we still need to do it.

812
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,990
There is a way out.

813
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,770
Trust me.

814
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
There is no obstacle that can't be overcome.
