4
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,350
Are you mocking me?

5
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,509
When I see my cousin,

6
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,620
I'll get him to punish you.

7
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,420
Sentence you to death!

8
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,340
Are you scared?

9
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,220
I'm so scared.

10
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:59,110
It's good that you're scared.

11
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,820
I'm hungry.

12
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,340
Go get me some food.

13
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,140
Get me some food,

14
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,910
do you understand?

15
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,760
I'm exhausted.

16
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,140
So cute.

17
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,680
So cute.

18
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,090
What's your name?

19
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,300
So cute.

20
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,340
You are so beautiful.

21
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,250
Little white rabbit.

22
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,420
Why are you breaking these branches?

23
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,500
To make a fire.

24
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,670
A fire?

25
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,130
Why do you need fire in broad daylight?

26
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,540
How can I cook the rabbit

27
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,320
without fire?

28
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,480
How can you be so cruel?

29
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,250
It's so cute.

30
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,040
How can you eat it?

31
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,770
If Yunxi were here,

32
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,200
this rabbit would have been cooked long ago.

33
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,630
That's because she's not kind.

34
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,620
She has a heart of stone.

35
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,610
Do you have anything else to eat?

36
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,140
Why does it taste so bad?

37
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,470
So sour.

38
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,540
Then give me the rabbit.

39
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,340
Master.

40
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,920
It's time to arrange a marriage

41
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,360
for Xi'er.

42
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,820
I was about to mention this,

43
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,100
as what you have just said.

44
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,060
We

45
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,040
share the same sentiments.

46
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,110
Do you have a suitable candidate?

47
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,380
Xi'er and Fengyi

48
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,680
grew up together

49
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:18,860
like childhood sweethearts.

50
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,070
They have deep affection,

51
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,170
and are very compatible.

52
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,150
Fengyi is good.

53
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,080
But

54
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,370
I also have another candidate in mind.

55
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,650
The chairman's granddaughter, Siyan.

56
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,060
Siyan

57
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,230
is well-educated,

58
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,720
gentle and virtuous.

59
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,280
If Xi'er marries her,

60
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,090
she will definitely be

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,920
a great support to him.

62
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,430
Isn't Siyan good?

63
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,420
It seems

64
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,650
Master has already thought things through.

65
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,540
You're right.

66
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
Both Fengyi and Siyan

67
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,630
are good matches.

68
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,060
Xi'er is lucky

69
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,650
to marry either of them.

70
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,100
What do you think?

71
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,380
A few days ago,

72
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,660
when I went to the temple to pray for your blessings,

73
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,060
I also had

74
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,240
Xi'er's fortune told.

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,730
God has destined

76
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,910
Fengyi as his sole, perfect match.

77
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,460
Dear,

78
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,220
this fortune-telling

79
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,280
is timely.

80
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,170
But

81
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,550
it is unjust for Siyan

82
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,720
to be

83
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,440
a second lady.

84
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,600
How about this?

85
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,610
Let Xi'er marry both of them.

86
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,790
Whoever gives birth to a son first

87
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,770
will be

88
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,220
the Lady of Young Master.

89
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,580
What do you think?

90
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,310
This...

91
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,300
I'm afraid this is inappropriate.

92
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,020
How so?

93
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,320
You and Lady Jing

94
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,450
were in the same situation.

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,400
However,

96
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,390
you know Xi'er.

97
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,760
He's very rebellious.

98
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,990
If you told him

99
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,020
the marriage is arranged,

100
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,320
I'm afraid he'll refuse it.

101
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,070
Dear,

102
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,130
thank you in advance.

103
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,100
You must make him

104
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,190
agree willingly.

105
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,110
Okay?

106
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,160
Yes.

107
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,710
This kid

108
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,070
really makes me worry.

109
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,500
The terrain here is flat

110
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,930
and close to Cangyue City.

111
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,690
But judging from

112
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,960
the soil and water source here,

113
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,570
this is likely saline land.

114
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,090
Carrying out

115
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,980
construction here

116
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,270
would require a lot of

117
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,000
manpower and material resources

118
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,920
to neutralize the soil.

119
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,340
Otherwise, the floors and walls

120
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,260
of the buildings

121
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,190
will always have alkali.

122
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,950
Is it that serious?

123
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,010
Not only that,

124
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,990
the soil and water source here

125
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,260
-also have... -Cousin.

126
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,930
Cousin.

127
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,100
Let me down.

128
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,140
I've finally found you.

129
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,310
Where in the world is this place?

130
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,300
It's so remote.

131
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,270
My legs are about to break.

132
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,410
Why are you here?

133
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,450
To protect you, of course.

134
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,830
There's a cruel beast

135
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,750
by your side.

136
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,850
What if she does something to you

137
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,640
and you can't handle it?

138
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,560
Young Master is very skilled at martial arts.

139
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,670
There is no beast

140
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,420
he can't handle.

141
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,610
Cousin,

142
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,590
aren't you tired from the journey?

143
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,420
Yes, of course.

144
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:45,940
Let Tang Qing

145
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,620
take you back to your mansion to rest.

146
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,340
No.

147
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,270
You're bullying me.

148
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,750
I'm going back to tell my aunt.

149
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,290
Why are you not stopping me?

150
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,450
Cousin.

151
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,160
Enough. Stop it, okay?

152
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,550
If you want to stay,

153
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,240
then stay.

154
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:20,930
Paper.

155
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,130
What paper?

156
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,110
Put the soil on the paper,

157
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,180
wrap it up and bring it back.

158
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:33,510
Let me do it.

159
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,750
I know how to do it now.

160
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,630
Let me do it.

161
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,510
Young Master.

162
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,780
Let me do it.

163
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,740
I'm adept at it,

164
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,640
so it'll save time.

165
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,360
This way,

166
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,320
everyone can go back early.

167
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,460
Time is meant to be wasted.

168
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,470
Why save time?

169
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,030
But you're the Young Master.

170
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,130
How can the Young Master

171
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,090
carry out such a menial task?

172
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,130
I can do it.

173
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,910
Young Master, you can't.

174
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,650
Let me do it.

175
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,970
After all, Yunxi and I

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,880
grew up together.

177
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,900
We have better chemistry.

178
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,840
Young Master.

179
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,980
Give it to me.

180
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,300
If you don't,

181
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,250
I'll knock your head off.

182
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,970
Let's see whose head

183
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:40,720
is tougher.

184
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,010
Why does it feel like

185
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,950
my cousin and Tang Qing

186
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,540
are vying for Yunxi's affection?

187
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,380
Let me...

188
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,580
You can't do it.

189
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,740
You just can't do it.

190
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,070
Cousin,

191
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,400
I want to ride the horse with you.

192
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,550
I'm here.

193
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,590
Cousin.

194
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,280
You've had a tiring day.

195
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,590
Why don't you take the carriage?

196
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,440
I don't want to.

197
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,160
Yunxi,

198
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,320
take the carriage.

199
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,400
I want to ride the horse with you.

200
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,340
Miss,

201
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,310
how about I take the carriage with you?

202
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,920
That's a great idea. Let's go.

203
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,800
I want a hug.

204
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,380
Take this.

205
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,250
You're so clueless.

206
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,600
Give me a hug.

207
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,390
Tang Qing.

208
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,450
You do it.

209
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,230
-No! -No!

210
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,790
Are you ignoring

211
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,450
my orders?

212
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:30,960
Do it.

213
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,250
No!

214
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,860
Tang Qing, you jerk.

215
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,940
Don't think

216
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,560
that your handsome face

217
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,490
is license to treat me

218
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,280
however you like.

219
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,350
Got it, Miss.

220
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,570
Tang Qing, you jerk.

221
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,610
Miss,

222
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,560
did you come here for the Young Master?

223
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,490
Are you and cousin

224
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,260
the only ones allowed to go outside the city?

225
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,320
Don't think I don't see right through

226
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,390
your charade.

227
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,190
Naturally, I'm focused on

228
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,980
assisting Young Master

229
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,420
and settling the people from the south of the city quickly.

230
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,930
You care so much for him.

231
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,530
You must share similar thoughts as me.

232
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,780
Yunxi,

233
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,000
don't think that you can gloat in front of me

234
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,840
just because my cousin cares about you.

235
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,580
He is just momentarily interested in you

236
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,780
because of the novelty.

237
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,900
Although you know about mapping

238
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,190
and can help my cousin,

239
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,040
I'm smart too.

240
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,270
If I study hard,

241
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,560
I'll definitely become better than you.

242
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,770
By then,

243
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,630
my cousin will fall in love with me.

244
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,530
Miss,

245
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,110
If this is so,

246
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,550
then Young Master should be in love with

247
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,730
the Director of the Planning Department.

248
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,920
I don't care

249
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,060
who he is in love with,

250
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,030
as long as I am

251
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,860
his future wife.

252
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,180
The name of the Lady of Young Master

253
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,910
doesn't belong to me anyway.

254
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,380
I won't fight for it.

255
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,660
Really?

256
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,910
You're not lying to me?

257
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:42,890
Yunxi,

258
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,510
as long as you aren't fighting for

259
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,760
the name of the Lady of Young Master

260
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,110
we still can be good friends.

261
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,560
I didn't mean to

262
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,720
punish you the last time.

263
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,980
Don't be angry.

264
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,130
Actually, I was very regretful.

265
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,210
I felt so bad.

266
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,980
Miss,

267
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,890
I was partially at fault too.

268
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,220
Please pardon me.

269
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,000
Yunxi,

270
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,060
you are so nice.

271
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,360
Since you are so magnanimous,

272
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,380
I'll also not be petty.

273
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,130
You can have cousin.

274
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,330
But

275
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,390
you mustn't hinder our marriage.

276
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,800
Marriage requires mutual affection.

277
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,140
The man you like

278
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,910
likes other women,

279
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,540
yet you're not bothered.

280
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,230
That means you don't love him deeply enough.

281
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,160
Miss,

282
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,940
if you can,

283
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,280
be nicer to him in the future.

284
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,370
He is my cousin.

285
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,330
Of course I'll treat him well.

286
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,190
[Liaowu Mansion]

287
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,660
What is this?

288
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,880
Can't you tell?

289
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,160
There are fruits on a tree.

290
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,360
Someone wants to pick fruits.

291
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,680
No?

292
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,220
Someone wants to hang himself,

293
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,260
so the other is rushing to save him.

294
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,550
It's so obvious yet you can't tell?

295
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,980
This is you.

296
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,200
This is me.

297
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,390
You want to tie a red string on the Marriage Tree,

298
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,600
and I'm lifting you up.

299
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,530
Do you see it now?

300
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,090
I just wanted to draw a painting

301
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,140
to record

302
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,130
our most romantic moment.

303
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,230
Yet you can't even figure it out.

304
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,510
I'm so sad.

305
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,670
So sad.

306
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,950
Of course I could figure it out.

307
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,420
Your drawing is so vivid.

308
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,380
It's hard not to see it.

309
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,350
I was only teasing you just now.

310
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,420
From now on, I will make a painting every day

311
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,540
to record every detail

312
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,420
of our life together.

313
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,590
In the future, my paintings

314
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,180
will surely fill several rooms.

315
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,610
Aren't you being too passionate?

316
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,400
I'm not ready yet.

317
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,150
I have something else to tell you.

318
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,260
I took the soil

319
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,080
we brought back today from outside the city

320
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,230
for further inspection.

321
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,090
I got the result.

322
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,490
This is my summary of it.

323
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,460
Take a look.

324
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,790
This matter?

325
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,760
Dear lords,

326
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,940
what do you think of this soil?

327
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:36,880
This...

328
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,240
-This... -This...

329
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:39,710
Right,

330
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,340
I forgot to introduce her.

331
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,960
This is Yunxi,

332
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,670
the surveyor of Cangyue City.

333
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,300
We're here today

334
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,860
to discuss about the construction.

335
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,320
It's obvious.

336
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,960
Isn't this saline soil?

337
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,740
Can we build a house

338
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,560
on such saline land?

339
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,980
This lady

340
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,710
is the Young Master's surveyor,

341
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,579
so she must be extraordinarily talented.

342
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,980
But she doesn't even know this?

343
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,900
To build a house on saline land,

344
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,619
we must first neutralize

345
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,920
the alkali in the soil,

346
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,069
which requires a lot of

347
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,569
time and money.

348
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,950
Even if the house is built,

349
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,869
it will be eroded.

350
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,470
Collapse!

351
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,740
-Well said. -Well said.

352
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,660
Well said, Lord Song.

353
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,660
That's right.

354
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,280
We can't build houses on this soil.

355
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,270
But Young Master collected this soil

356
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,190
from the area

357
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,180
where the people are about to be

358
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,010
relocated to.

359
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,120
That area is made up of saline land.

360
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,830
People can't build houses

361
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,800
or farm.

362
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,530
I can't agree with that area being designated as

363
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,020
the resettlement site.

364
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,610
The Planning Department has made

365
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,330
a hasty decision.

366
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,030
No.

367
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,900
This land

368
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,670
can be improved.

369
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,650
You just said

370
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:53,970
that improving saline land

371
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,290
is time-consuming and expensive.

372
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,370
Neutralized soil

373
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,020
can only be maintained for a few years.

374
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,400
Who can guarantee their living

375
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,980
during periods when the soil is being neutralized?

376
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,990
Lord Song, will you support them?

377
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,200
Since you

378
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,320
are so wealthy

379
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,730
and generous.

380
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,010
That's not bad.

381
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,340
You're so generous.

382
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,180
You must be joking.

383
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,750
I don't have that money.

384
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,420
Really.

385
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,270
There's no perfect policy.

386
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,120
Human effort is the decisive factor.

387
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,380
Besides, the government has offered them

388
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,560
a large amount of compensation.

389
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,920
It can be said that

390
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,430
we've done our best.

391
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,540
Since they have received the compensation,

392
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,950
if they are still unsatisfied

393
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,950
with the arrangement,

394
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:34,750
sure,

395
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,430
they can find another place

396
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,750
to build a house and settle down.

397
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,540
Commander Xiao.

398
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,210
If the resettlement compensation

399
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,350
is used in

400
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,640
both construction and living,

401
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,950
it won't take long

402
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,580
to run out.

403
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,370
Everyone here

404
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,380
is an official of Cangyue City.

405
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,940
We can't use the money from the people

406
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,340
and leave them without money.

407
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,290
Am I right?

408
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,960
But speaking of building a market,

409
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,870
whether it be demolishing the south

410
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,780
or the north of the city,

411
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,710
it is related to the stability of Cangyue City.

412
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:08,980
In the end,

413
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,010
it's for the people.

414
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,000
You say it is for the people.

415
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,510
But do you know

416
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,190
what lives

417
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,090
they are living?

418
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,430
Do you know

419
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,530
what

420
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,180
they really need?

421
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,820
The so-called stability

422
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,560
is to settle down.

423
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,360
My lords,

424
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,370
please take a look at those

425
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,500
who are about to be expelled,

426
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,530
and always in hunger.

427
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,420
These people are forced to leave their homes.

428
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,850
How can they find stability?

429
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,340
You're being unreasonable.

430
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,730
Little girl,

431
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,520
you know nothing.

432
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,250
I've been in politics for decades.

433
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,420
How can I not be more experienced

434
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,800
than a young girl like you?

435
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,750
Commander Xiao has made great contributions.

436
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:46,970
Of course I can't match you.

437
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,100
It's just that I have my own specialty.

438
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,050
Commander Xiao is good at writing.

439
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,300
You can write the story of thousands of years.

440
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,130
But you may not be able to

441
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,740
draw a small map of construction planning.

442
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,070
Commander Xiao,

443
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
you must know

444
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,700
why the demolition place

445
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,950
is in the south of the city.

446
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,100
It is because we don't want to

447
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,840
harm the interests of aristocrats.

448
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,530
That's why we force the people

449
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,900
to leave their homes.

450
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,500
If we can't

451
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,320
find a reasonable plan

452
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,480
to relocate the people of the south,

453
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,750
then we can only remove

454
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,890
the manor in the north.

455
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,980
Without permission, you've changed the plan

456
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
into demolishing the north of the city.

457
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,860
Is that fair to

458
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,480
the aristocrats who

459
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,160
fought for Cangyue City?

460
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,020
Uncle,

461
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,020
I've already

462
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,140
considered  this.

463
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,440
It's all about interests.

464
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,760
I can propose to my father

465
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,370
that 10% of

466
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,570
the market's annual taxes

467
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,820
are granted to the aristocrats in the north.

468
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,180
That's right.

469
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,350
These aristocrats

470
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,890
are devoted to Cangyue City.

471
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,080
Young Master have thought about it.

472
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,390
He will never do anything

473
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,970
against his conscience.

474
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,230
What he plans for the market

475
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,050
must be beneficial to the country.

476
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,590
My lords,

477
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,100
what do you think?

478
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,990
This...

479
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,290
This matter is very important.

480
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,080
Young Master,

481
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,940
you'd better think about it.

482
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,910
No need.

483
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,680
As the Chief Supervisor

484
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,500
of city construction,

485
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,830
I have the power to decide.

486
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,220
All right.

487
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,450
It's settled then.

488
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,850
My lovely bunny.

489
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,260
My Joy.

490
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,610
My lovely bunny.

491
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,070
Tang Qing!

492
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,210
Tang Qing.

493
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,450
Miss, Young Master is not here.

494
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,500
Please come again.

495
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,290
I'm not looking for him. I'm looking for you.

496
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,980
Me?

497
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,590
This rabbit is for you.

498
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,780
I've been a vegetarian lately.

499
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,370
Who told you to eat it?

500
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,310
The one I brought back last time

501
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,380
was a male rabbit.

502
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,470
I named it Happy.

503
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,990
This one I bought

504
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:06,950
is a female rabbit,

505
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,550
called Joy.

506
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,820
Since

507
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,570
they are too young

508
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,240
to become emotionally involved,

509
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,190
you need to take care of this one.

510
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,180
Take care of it?

511
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,780
I don't have time to take care of it.

512
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,520
Tang Qing!

513
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,000
If you don't listen to me,

514
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,310
I'll ask my cousin

515
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,120
to kick you out.

516
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:29,860
Be good.

517
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,820
Take good care of it.

518
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,340
If anything happens to Joy,

519
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,630
I will be angry.

520
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,460
Alright.

521
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,100
Get along well with daddy.

522
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:43,830
Yunxi.

523
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,910
Thanks to your help,

524
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:46,990
otherwise...

525
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,570
Xi'er.

526
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,610
Uncle.

527
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,560
Just now, I put the people first

528
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,370
and fought for their interests.

529
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,580
I did well, right?

530
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,080
If you insist on changing the site,

531
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,310
I can give in.

532
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,020
But remember,

533
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,670
you are the Young Master.

534
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,430
Don't be seduced easily

535
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,690
by the words

536
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,870
of an unknown woman.

537
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,030
And

538
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,160
you are not young anymore.

539
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,980
Shouldn't you prepare

540
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,280
for your wedding with Fengyi?

541
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,340
Uncle,

542
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,040
My marriage

543
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,760
is up to my father.

544
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,620
I can't even make my own decision.

545
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,220
I'm afraid you...

546
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,260
Don't use your father as an excuse.

547
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,070
You're young.

548
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,260
I can understand you indulge in others

549
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,510
because of novelty.

550
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,860
But don't forget

551
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,670
your status.

552
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,770
A girl

553
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,630
with humble identity

554
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,870
from nowhere

555
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,930
cannot be a good match for you.

556
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,150
You're right, uncle.

557
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,920
Not anyone

558
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,800
can be

559
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,630
the Lady of Young Master.

560
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,820
At least,

561
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,160
it should be someone

562
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,460
I like.

563
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,480
Fine.

564
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,620
You've grown up.

565
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,540
So, you don't respect me now,

566
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,660
right?

567
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,790
No, no, no.

568
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,100
Uncle, you must be joking.

569
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,730
You're so busy.

570
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,370
I just don't want you

571
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,010
to waste time on my business.

572
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,680
What's wrong?

573
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,780
Are you jealous

574
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,000
because uncle just mentioned

575
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,160
my marriage?

576
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,170
It was because

577
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,940
we were a good match

578
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,630
in the Planning Room.

579
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,390
So he

580
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,470
mentioned that again.

581
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,910
Don't worry about it.

582
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,340
Besides,

583
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,060
I may be very popular,

584
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,750
but

585
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,790
I only have you in my heart.

586
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,770
So don't worry that I'll marry someone else.

587
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,360
You must be angry.

588
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,600
Say something.

589
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,210
No.

590
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,880
There's nothing to be angry about.

591
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,660
Although Commander Xiao's words are unpleasant to hear,

592
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,010
it does make sense in some ways.

593
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,530
You and Miss Fengyi

594
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,750
are from the same class.

595
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,210
It's appropriate

596
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,790
for her to marry you.

597
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,060
What are you talking about?

598
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,130
In my heart,

599
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,590
I treat you as the one

600
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,740
to spend the rest of my life with.

601
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,220
I don't think so.

602
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,120
I only focus on the present instead of the future.

603
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,450
Some things need to be let go.

604
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,570
Don't force it.

605
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,310
Whatever happens

606
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,290
in the future,

607
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,760
I can live with it.

608
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,450
I'm different from you.

609
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,020
No one can change the thing

610
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,460
I've decided.

611
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,320
Don't be so childish.

612
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,580
Since some things are predestined,

613
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,560
you don't have to force them.

614
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,230
Then I...

615
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,310
If I marry someone else,

616
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,720
won't you be jealous, angry,

617
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,440
or sad?

618
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,900
I just want you to be happy.

619
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,870
Happy?

620
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,770
But if you marry someone else,

621
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,290
I won't make you happy.

622
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,060
I must get you back.

623
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,240
Jiang Chaoxi

624
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,660
is getting more and more outrageous.

625
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,260
What I want is

626
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,420
a Master's heir that is foolish and obedient.

627
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,260
Not a self-righteous one

628
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,620
beyond my control.

629
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,560
Where does Yunxi come from?

630
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,540
Master.

631
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
She's the surveyor hired by Young Master.

632
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,590
Last time I went to the Young Master's Mansion,

633
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,190
I found that she was the assistant

634
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,930
of Yun Zhongzi before.

635
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,610
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

636
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,790
I didn't find it noteworthy then.

637
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,020
I thought

638
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,610
that since it's not easy for her to make a living outside,

639
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,400
It's normal for her to work

640
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,390
in the Young Master's Mansion.

641
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:13,990
Song Qing.

642
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,670
Tell me.

643
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,160
What's your opinion

644
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,020
of Yunxi?

645
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:20,830
Commander Xiao.

646
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,580
Nothing.

647
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,930
No.

648
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:23,950
I...

649
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,230
I mean Miss Yunxi

650
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,260
is nothing.

651
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,200
These drawings I found

652
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,300
are done by her.

653
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,220
On the whole, these drawings are just so-so

654
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,530
in design and planning.

655
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,280
In terms of style,

656
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,330
these are somewhat similar

657
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,060
to Luo Daoan's.

658
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:44,980
But

659
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,350
from my years of expertise,

660
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,680
then,

661
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,890
I think it's blatant plagiarism.

662
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,530
So it's nothing.

663
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,660
In terms of ability,

664
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,670
she is not competitive.

665
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,740
Compared with me,

666
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,600
she is

667
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,470
far below me.

668
00:27:59,330 --> 00:27:59,730
Blow.

669
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,630
Commander Xiao.

670
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,180
Blow.

671
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,460
I'm not blowing my horn.

672
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,820
Lord Song.

673
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,490
He wants me to blow for him.

674
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,380
Song Qing,

675
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,210
I'm not blaming you.

676
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,580
If you were really capable,

677
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,720
you wouldn't have been scolded

678
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,180
like that in the Planning Department.

679
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,360
That is because

680
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,590
a good man doesn't fight with a woman.

681
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,290
Go away.

682
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,350
Look at you.

683
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,180
You can't even win.

684
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,570
You may leave.

685
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,620
Recently,

686
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,900
I have some new ideas

687
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,380
about the city construction,

688
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,630
though they are just half-baked.

689
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,110
I still want to share with you.

690
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,700
You want to share half-baked ideas?

691
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
We'll talk about it when they are fully-developed.

692
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:40,600
Leave.

693
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,220
Commander Xiao,

694
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,340
I have a fully-developed suggestion.

695
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,170
Go ahead.

696
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,080
I... I want to blow.

697
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:53,880
Get out.

698
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,070
I think

699
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,220
we should investigate

700
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,090
Yunxi carefully.

701
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:07,840
Yes.

702
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,120
I'm troubled by trivial matters

703
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,760
and mediocre people.

704
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,140
How can I reach the harmony

705
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,710
between man and nature,

706
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,980
and live forever?

707
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,560
In less than half a day,

708
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,140
I got angry again

709
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,350
and grew two wrinkles.

710
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,140
Is it good?

711
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,440
Bunny.

712
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,890
Fengyi.

713
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,030
What time is it now?

714
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,730
Why do you still have the time

715
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,740
to play with this useless rabbit?

716
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,830
The rabbit is so cute.

717
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,730
How is it useless?

718
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,140
Dad, do you have taste?

719
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,470
Is the rabbit more important

720
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,770
or your cousin?

721
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,250
If you have time,

722
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,720
you could learn more about

723
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,470
your cousin.

724
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,280
Cousin.

725
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,620
He's too boring.

726
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,590
He's less important than a rabbit.

727
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,300
Yunxi is by his side.

728
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,120
Do you know?

729
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,420
Yes.

730
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,610
She's my good sister.

731
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,480
Sister?

732
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,360
You are the daughter of the Xiao family.

733
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,910
Can anyone from nowhere

734
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,170
be your sister?

735
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:14,790
Also,

736
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,950
do you know

737
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,180
she's dating your cousin?

738
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,270
I know.

739
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,440
Dad, don't worry.

740
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,740
Yunxi has told me.

741
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,790
She would not be

742
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,940
the Lady of Young Master.

743
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,770
Never.

744
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,270
They are in love with each other.

745
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,060
Aren't you worried?

746
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,630
For what?

747
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,620
What I want is the position of

748
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,890
the Lady of Young Master.

749
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,780
He can love anyone he likes.

750
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,240
They are in love.

751
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,150
Isn't that a threat

752
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,940
to your chances as the Lady of Young Master?

753
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,390
You...

754
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,700
Think about it.

755
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,200
Dad.

756
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,800
What's wrong with you?

757
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,600
Why are you so irritable without reason?

758
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,220
Let me tell you.

759
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,460
I'm smart.

760
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,320
Sooner or later,

761
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,270
I'll be the Lady of Young Master.

762
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,210
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

763
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,030
Give the rabbit back.

764
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:58,820
This...

765
00:30:59,400 --> 00:30:59,600
She...

766
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,980
A careless girl.

767
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,180
Young Master.

768
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,340
Miss Yunxi.

769
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,790
It can't be.

770
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,300
They've only been dating for days.

771
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,000
How can they have a quarrel?

772
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,770
Get out.

773
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,920
I don't accept your apology.

774
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,710
It's you.

775
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,020
You scared me.

776
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,410
Young Master.

777
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,110
What did Miss Yunxi do

778
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,980
to offend you?

779
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,980
How about you talk to me about it?

780
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,660
Today, uncle

781
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,620
mentioned my marriage with Fengyi

782
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,120
in front of Yunxi and I.

783
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,380
But Yunxi didn't seem

784
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,290
to care at all.

785
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,730
What does she mean?

786
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,350
Does she care about me or not?

787
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,630
It may not be because

788
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,060
she doesn't care.

789
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,320
Then why didn't she

790
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,000
say something

791
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,830
when she heard about my marriage with others?

792
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,200
She's a reserved girl.

793
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,090
Of course she wouldn't express it in front of you.

794
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,200
Just like the days in May and June,

795
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,460
women are unpredictable.

796
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,490
In my opinion,

797
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,870
maybe Yunxi is more upset

798
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,740
than you.

799
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,220
Really?

800
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,530
How do you know so much?

801
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,960
When I was young,

802
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,250
I was known as a Romeo.

803
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,200
It's right to listen to me.

804
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,410
So, my reaction

805
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,070
is too petty.

806
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,140
I can't be.

807
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,760
I have to find her.

808
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,410
Thank you.

809
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,070
Your Ladyship calls for

810
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,900
you and Miss Yunxi.
