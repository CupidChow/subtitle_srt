[Episode 7]

4
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,580
Is it fun?

5
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:46,759
Yes.

6
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,700
No, it's not fun.

7
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,080
Listen to me, Song Qing.

8
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,740
This time, I will totally consider it as your negligence.

9
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,100
If anything happens next time,

10
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,070
you can hand over

11
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,340
the Director of Planning Department.

12
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,830
Understand?

13
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,460
Yes.

14
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,780
Then get lost!

15
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,880
There must be something wrong with Song Qing.

16
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,419
As the Director of the Planning Depertment,

17
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,570
how can he not tell

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,240
the difference of the wood!

19
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,100
There is something wrong with him.

20
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,380
Then why don't you punish him?

21
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,340
How can I?

22
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,579
Song Qing is a man of my uncle

23
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:18,320
Commander Xiao.

24
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,630
If I hold him accountable,

25
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,430
things will be more troublesome.

26
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,650
Besides,

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,390
there'll be no fish if the water is too clear.

28
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,140
You know it perfectly.

29
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,600
Should we just let him be?

30
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,360
I punished him

31
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,910
just now.

32
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,660
The previous Director of Planning Department,

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,840
Luo Daoan left many legendary works

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,390
when he was alive.

35
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,500
Qixia Temple in the west of the city.

36
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,810
the Star Tower in the north of the city.

37
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,820
Even the Young Master's Mansion you're living in

38
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,570
is a classic.

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,050
Unfortunately, after Director Luo died,

40
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,130
there is no more great construction in Cangyue City.

41
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,120
The higher-ups are letting off

42
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,020
and people below are idling around.

43
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,220
No wonder it is like this now.

44
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,100
I'm so happy.

45
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,560
We have food after work.

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,080
Delicious.

47
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,540
I'm considerate to my subordinates.

48
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,730
Let me help you.

49
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,329
Young Master, I'm not tired.

50
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,130
Let me do it.

51
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,460
You're tired when I say you're tired.

52
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,960
Come on.

53
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,230
Young Master.

54
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,050
I'm done. I'm all good now.

55
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,380
Young Master.

56
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,030
Isn't this drumstick

57
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,130
your favorite?

58
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,900
You want it?

59
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,700
Young Master.

60
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,180
You've been staring at us.

61
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,110
Do you want a taste of

62
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,220
my snacks?

63
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,310
Dessert is delicious,

64
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,610
but it may not suit you.

65
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,100
What's so good about dessert?

66
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,390
Watch me.

67
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,180
I'll catch a rabbit

68
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,590
and roast it.

69
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,850
What a cute rabbit.

70
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,980
I'll get one for you too.

71
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,870
There is one.

72
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,790
Why are you so cute?

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,560
Young Master,

74
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,950
Girls

75
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,020
like

76
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,860
fluffy things.

77
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:14,940
Looks like

78
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,360
we can't eat the rabbit.

79
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,940
Didn't you just eat the drumstick?

80
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,060
What's so good to eat a rabbit?

81
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,300
If she likes it, she can keep it.

82
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,420
But it's too lonely to only have one.

83
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,360
I'll get another one.

84
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,980
We can form a pair.

85
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,540
Let's go and catch the rabbit.

86
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,409
Can't I at least take a break!

87
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,360
We'll raise two rabbits together.

88
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:47,770
Young Master.

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,720
This is Papa Rabbit.

90
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,670
You roasted it!

91
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:52,900
Yes.

92
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,110
Baby Rabbit, it's gone.

93
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,960
Don't get angry.

94
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,470
We only roasted the rabbit.

95
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,200
We didn't eat it behind your back.

96
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,260
We're waiting for you.

97
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,030
Young Master caught another one.

98
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,180
Qing.

99
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,250
You were just worried

100
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,190
it was not enough for four of us.

101
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,240
This is great.

102
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,740
Roast the one in Young Master's arms.

103
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,540
That will be enough.

104
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,300
Yunxi,

105
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,050
are you a girl or not?

106
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,090
Did I do something wrong again?

107
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,580
Didn't you just say

108
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,820
the rabbit was cute and you wanted to keep it?

109
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,690
I do think it's cute.

110
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,820
But it's cute because it is fat.

111
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,900
And I didn't say I want to keep it.

112
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:30,740
That's right.

113
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:31,870
You didn't say

114
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,740
to keep a rabbit.

115
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,260
Yes.

116
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:34,900
Young Master,

117
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,350
do you think

118
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:36,980
I roasted the rabbit too early and

119
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,790
you want to take it back

120
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,810
for some time before roasting?

121
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,090
You're inexperienced in this.

122
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,260
If you take

123
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,340
the wild rabbit home,

124
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,270
it will lose weight.

125
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,620
It won't taste good then.

126
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,170
He's so unpredictable.

127
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,920
The rabbit should be ready.

128
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,360
Really?

129
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,610
Qing, try it.

130
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,020
It's delicious.

131
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,570
How about

132
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,440
we roast the one

133
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:08,880
in Young Master's arms too.

134
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,460
Let me tell you.

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,990
I'll roast you if you dare to roast it.

136
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:18,980
Such a fat rabbit.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,150
It's a waste if you don't eat it.

138
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,460
Young Master.

139
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,540
This horse is injured.

140
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm afraid we can't ride it anymore.

141
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,260
How about this?

142
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,060
Yunxi,

143
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,520
you can ride a horse with me.

144
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:36,980
No.

145
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,659
-Why not? -Why not?

146
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,650
Tang Qing's horse

147
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,720
is very weak.

148
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,960
Unlike my healthy and strong horse,

149
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,120
it can't bear the weight of two people.

150
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,860
Yunxi is so thin.

151
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,659
Of course it can.

152
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,620
Yeah.

153
00:07:59,520 --> 00:07:59,840
Let's go.

154
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,070
Don't you understand

155
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
what I mean?

156
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,980
-Stay away from Young Master. -Stay away from Young Master.

157
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,160
You should stay away from him.

158
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,460
But Yunxi,

159
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,580
don't you think

160
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,200
Jiang Chaoxi treats you specially?

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,860
Yes.

162
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,980
He's very strict with me.

163
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,300
Today,

164
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,120
I just ate one of his rabbits,

165
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,690
and then he wanted to roast me.

166
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,010
Yunxi, you are right.

167
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:35,980
Young Master

168
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:36,980
has been treating you badly.

169
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:37,820
That's too much.

170
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,419
Exactly.

171
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,210
So,

172
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,510
we should

173
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,539
stay away from Young Master.

174
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,559
Don't worry.

175
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,590
I know how to

176
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,420
to deal with Jiang Chaoxi.

177
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,780
Don't you know it's improper for men and women to touch each other?

178
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,150
Do you need me

179
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,340
to remind you?

180
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,420
Let's go.

181
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,460
Why is the Young Master's Mansion

182
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,200
so quiet today?

183
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,550
From now on,

184
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,820
be aware of yourselves.

185
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,490
Those who are good-looking,

186
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,700
stand to the left.

187
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,980
Don't let me call your name one by one.

188
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,340
Steward Zhu.

189
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,810
Come back!

190
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,530
Miss Fengyi,

191
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,380
can't you judge from

192
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,760
my temperament?

193
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,080
When I was young,

194
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,680
I was pretty charming.

195
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,910
That was when you were young.

196
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,130
You're not a threat now.

197
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,240
Come back.

198
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,190
Cousin.

199
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,470
What are you doing?

200
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,340
Cousin

201
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,420
You're back.

202
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,140
I'm managing your servants.

203
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,460
Managing the servants?

204
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,940
I only need Zhu Wen to

205
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,850
manage the chores in my mansion.

206
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,240
If you want to learn about managing,

207
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,470
you can manage Xiao's mansion.

208
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,870
But from today on,

209
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm going to move in here.

210
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,060
No.

211
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,830
Why not?

212
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,350
Anyway, I'll marry you sooner or later.

213
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,820
When I say no, then it means no.

214
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,890
The Young Master's mansion is pretty cautious about men and women's affairs.

215
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,740
Watch your language and behaviors.

216
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,550
Don't always talk about

217
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,060
marrying me.

218
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,130
I moved in

219
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,730
under my aunt's command.

220
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,620
She said

221
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,670
if you don't agree,

222
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,060
she would move in herself.

223
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,890
Let's go.

224
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,460
Yunxi.

225
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,000
Come here.

226
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,460
Yes, it's you.

227
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,470
What can I do for you?

228
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,340
Yunxi,

229
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,830
I always think

230
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,380
you are a smart girl.

231
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,640
and I value you very much.

232
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,460
Thank you, Miss.

233
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,570
I came to you

234
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,180
because there's one thing that

235
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,160
I need your help.

236
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,760
Please go ahead.

237
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,450
Actually,

238
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,020
the reason why I live in the Young Master's mansion,

239
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,880
it is not only to keep an eye on my cousin

240
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,080
under my aunt's command,

241
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,970
but also to make him fall in love with me.

242
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:03,870
In the future,

243
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,110
you will marry Young Master.

244
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,380
It's only natural

245
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,400
to make him fall in love with you.

246
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,750
To be honest,

247
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,700
I've been working hard

248
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,260
for many years,

249
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,920
but it didn't work.

250
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,020
So,

251
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,380
you must continue to help me

252
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,790
and be the Cupid

253
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,460
between us.

254
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,700
Miss,

255
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,020
I may not be able to help you with this.

256
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,070
You should find someone else.

257
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,250
If you dare to leave,

258
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,440
I'll kick you out.

259
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:33,820
I have an idea.

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,140
[The domineering master falls in love with me]

261
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:45,970
Good idea.

262
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,620
When the fairy in white looks back,

263
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,390
even the god is enchanted.

264
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,940
If you show up in front of Young Master,

265
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,770
like an Empyrean Fairy,

266
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,120
dressed in white,

267
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,100
then it's hard for Young Master

268
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,360
not to fall in love you.

269
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,580
Empyrean Fairy.

270
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,380
I can totally handle this.

271
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,060
Jiaobai often said that

272
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,550
there is a celestial sense

273
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,700
in my beauty.

274
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,380
If you are confident,

275
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,530
you can do it.

276
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,320
Really?

277
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,240
How about this?

278
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,370
[Xiao' s Mansion]

279
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,940
Commander,

280
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,380
you can' t leave me alone.

281
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,940
It's fine

282
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,170
if Young Master only beat me up,

283
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,680
but he threatened me to change the rose wood back.

284
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,390
Commander.

285
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,980
Song Qing,

286
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,790
I know you've suffered,

287
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,740
but you're holding my leg.

288
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,460
How inappropriate!

289
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,020
I want to!

290
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,260
My legs

291
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,590
are not rose wood.

292
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,140
Get up.

293
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:55,940
Sit down.

294
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,220
I can't get up.

295
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,540
What's wrong?

296
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,000
It's swollen.

297
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,840
Song Qing,

298
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,540
don't blame me for lecturing you.

299
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,480
It's indeed your fault.

300
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,490
That's the Ancestral Temple.

301
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,400
How can you use something bad pretending to be good?

302
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,020
He didn't kill you this time.

303
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,920
It  was already a mercy.

304
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,420
But Commander,

305
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,130
the supplier of the wood said

306
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,460
you agreed.

307
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,970
I was also cheated.

308
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,260
The rose wood

309
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,860
is so similar to white acid branch.

310
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,220
Who can recognize it

311
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,860
at a glance?

312
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,750
But I didn't expect

313
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,570
the surveyor hired by Young Master

314
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,380
saw through it.

315
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,010
Where can I get

316
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,940
rose wood for her?

317
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,120
It's easy.

318
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,700
Go find those wood suppliers.

319
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,760
But Commander,

320
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,180
the wood supplier

321
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,820
just spent a lot of money

322
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,540
buying the Painting of a Hundred Beasts from you.

323
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,090
If you go back on your word now,

324
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,780
what if...

325
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,980
What are you trying to say?

326
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:00,590
At this point,

327
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,860
he can only blame his bad luck.

328
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,500
If you can't do it,

329
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,780
buy some rose wood

330
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,790
with your own money.

331
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,680
Got it.

332
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:21,800
Commander Xiao,

333
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,620
I'll go and

334
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,150
change the white acid branch to rose wood.

335
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,140
You see. Jiang Chaoxi

336
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,630
knew perfectly that

337
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,900
Song Qing is my man.

338
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,540
How dare he beat him without second thoughts?

339
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,500
He is not respecting me

340
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,230
at all.

341
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,050
Young Master has something on him.

342
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,760
Luckily, he didn't look into it.

343
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,360
Otherwise...

344
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,850
Jiang Chaoxi is obviously blocking my way

345
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,970
of making money.

346
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,820
Guards!

347
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,740
Wuyan.

348
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,380
Zhu Wen.

349
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,160
Wuyan.

350
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:39,750
Zhu Wen.

351
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,020
Wuyan.

352
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,180
Wuyan.

353
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,180
Zhu Wen.

354
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,660
Wuyan.

355
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,700
Cousin.

356
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,580
Young Master.

357
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:22,980
Stop!

358
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,730
No, no.

359
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,930
Yes. Yes. Put me down.

360
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:26,830
Put me down.

361
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,650
♫I like being behind you♫

362
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:42,320
♫Even the evening wind has become very gentle♫

363
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:51,030
♫The feeling of happiness bit by bit♫

364
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,770
♫Time seems to be stopped♫

365
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,030
Cousin!

366
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,800
Help, cousin.

367
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,160
I'm saying let go of your hands.

368
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,020
What are you doing?

369
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,210
Is it romantic?

370
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,060
What are you doing?

371
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,160
Make the atmosphere better.

372
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,170
What are you doing now?

373
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,640
Put me down.

374
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,640
The atmosphere is good.

375
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,960
I can't help it

376
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,380
Cousin, help!

377
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:38,780
Hurry up.

378
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,530
Miss.

379
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,380
Yunxi!

380
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,890
What exactly do you want?

381
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,840
Miss Fengyi.

382
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,710
Here.

383
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:52,570
I am here.

384
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,460
You!

385
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,950
Miss.

386
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,900
Be careful.

387
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,280
I don't need your fake kindness.

388
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,290
Tell me!

389
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
Why did you

390
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,230
hold my cousin

391
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,420
and ruin my plan just now!

392
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:06,580
Well...

393
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,020
I don't know if I should tell you.

394
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,990
If you

395
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,850
can't explain yourself to me today,

396
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,900
I'll make you suffer.

397
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,300
Miss,

398
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,180
when you were flying in the sky,

399
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,140
you were so...

400
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:21,540
Beautiful?

401
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,900
So ugly!

402
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,500
You didn't look like a fairy at all.

403
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,720
Instead, you look like a ghost.

404
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
I don't want you to scare him away

405
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,940
so he won't get close to you in the future.

406
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,760
It's not worth it.

407
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,150
I look like a ghost!

408
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,940
How can I look like a ghost?

409
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,170
Jiaobai.

410
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,290
Do I look like a ghost?

411
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,840
Go get me a mirror.

412
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:41,770
Yes.

413
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,830
Miss.

414
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,590
How can I look like a ghost?

415
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,530
Yunxi,

416
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,130
I wronged you.

417
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,620
What's flying empyrean fairy in white anyway?

418
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,160
Look back with a smile, and men will go crazy.

419
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,790
The stories are all lies.

420
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,820
If I want my cousin to fall in love with me,

421
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,950
it seems that I have to use

422
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,180
my own characteristics.

423
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,340
Charming?

424
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,900
Miss,

425
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,490
why don't we start by

426
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,920
trying to be cute first?

427
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,270
What?

428
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,050
Am I not charming?

429
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,090
My cousin will definitely have a crush on me.

430
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,930
Fortunately, I fooled her.

431
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,830
Otherwise, Xiao Fengyi

432
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,700
will strangle me to death.

433
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:00,420
Stop!

434
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:03,890
Qing.

435
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,720
Who asked you to assassinate Jiang Chaoxi?

436
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,180
Myself.

437
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,740
Didn't I tell you

438
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,840
I don't want to kill him anymore?

439
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,790
Then why are you still here?

440
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,160
I stay here

441
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,060
to find my brother.

442
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,460
So,

443
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,170
you have a brother?

444
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,940
Qing, you were too reckless today.

445
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,180
You almost made a big mistake.

446
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,470
Sorry, Yunxi.

447
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,050
I didn't know this would be the case.

448
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,740
I promise

449
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,700
I will never

450
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,410
act on my own again.

451
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,050
Don't be mad at me, OK?

452
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,500
Yunxi,

453
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,700
let me help you find your brother.

454
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:49,860
After all,

455
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,580
I'm now a guard at the Young Master's Mansion.

456
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,260
It's much more convenient for me to do the job.

457
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,770
I didn't realize Yunxi

458
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,190
to have fallen so hard for me

459
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,020
that she can't control herself.

460
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:10,850
It's my fault.

461
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,910
Why didn't I realize it earlier?

462
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:15,580
Young Master.

463
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,240
Young Master!

464
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,900
It's getting late.

465
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,980
It's time to for you to sleep.

466
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,990
I can't fall sleep

467
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,780
because of my charm.

468
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,570
Tell me.

469
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,040
Is it a fault

470
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,650
that I am too charming?

471
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,180
Forget it.

472
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,450
With your look,

473
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,270
I don't think you can understand

474
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:41,890
my agony.

475
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,480
Based on my years of experience,

476
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,270
I don't think it's your fault.

477
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,750
Also, you can't blame

478
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,900
the one who has fallen for you.

479
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,090
After all, everyone loves beauty.

480
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,070
Besides, Young Master, you are

481
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,030
so perfect and handsome.

482
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,090
Well said.

483
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,290
You know me well.

484
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:09,980
All right.

485
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,780
You may leave now.

486
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,700
I'm going to sleep.

487
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,140
Good morning, Lord Li.

488
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,790
Good morning.

489
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,820
Morning, uncle.

490
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,180
Why do I feel that

491
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,690
you are more manly and handsome today?

492
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,520
Did you shave your beard?

493
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,600
Why are you ignoring me?

494
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,460
Did I make you angry again?

495
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,320
I've been doing so well lately.

496
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,200
Why are you always dissatisfied with me?

497
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,660
It's a good thing

498
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,830
that you do your best to make progress.

499
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,630
How can I be dissatisfied?

500
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:38,860
That's good.

501
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,100
Uncle,

502
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,510
let me tell you a joke.

503
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,350
In the past,

504
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,850
I only thought playing around

505
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,640
was fun.

506
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,410
But now I suddenly realize

507
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,690
that supervising others' work is more fun.

508
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,780
You see. A couple of days ago,

509
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,980
I just dealt with that Song Qing.

510
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,070
He actually

511
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,110
replaced the specified rose wood to renovate the Ancestral Temple

512
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,020
with the white acid branch wrongly.

513
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,940
And he said it was approved by you.

514
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,140
How come I wouldn't get angry

515
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,130
when I heard this?

516
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,260
Yet he even tried to

517
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,100
put the blame on you!

518
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,900
It was his fault!

519
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,710
So I  gave the order to

520
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,380
flog him hard.

521
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,190
Beat him up!

522
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,780
In the end, he finally admitted that he was negligent.

523
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,960
Well done.

524
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,090
Why didn't you just flog him to death?

525
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,750
Young Master, you did a great job.

526
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,310
I did a really great job!

527
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:21,940
Uncle.

528
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,220
I will continue to work hard

529
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,500
and try harder.

530
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,300
Chairman?

531
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,300
Young Master.

532
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,340
Long time no see.

533
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,060
How's your injury?

534
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,020
Thank you for your concern.

535
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,030
It's just

536
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,900
a minor injury.

537
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,180
It's nothing.

538
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,460
Besides,

539
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,990
Commander Xiao

540
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,410
sent me some tiger bone meal.

541
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,460
With that,

542
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,700
I'm even more agile than

543
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,740
before I got hurt.

544
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,340
It's just a little tiger bone meal.

545
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,060
It's not worth mentioning.

546
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,200
But, Chairman,

547
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,990
you are not that young anymore.

548
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,860
You don't have to rush to come back to the meeting hall.

549
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,660
Anyway,

550
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,420
there are young people like us.

551
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,820
Although I'm old,

552
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,860
I still have good eyesight.

553
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,170
I can still see with one look

554
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,420
those greedy bugs

555
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,280
who want to bring disaster to Cangyue.

556
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,980
If necessary,

557
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,880
I still have the strength

558
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,440
to exterminate those bugs.

559
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,810
Are you implying something?

560
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,900
What do you mean?

561
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,700
Nothing.

562
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,420
Please

563
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,420
don't relate to yourself.

564
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,350
Chairman.

565
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,270
I don't like

566
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:41,980
what your said.

567
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,910
This city has my father,

568
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,020
a wise ruler.

569
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,300
And there are also capable ministers

570
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,230
like you and my uncle.

571
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,350
If there were really woodworms

572
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,170
in the meeting hall,

573
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,220
it would still be your responsibility

574
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,180
as chairman.

575
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,900
Young Master, you are right.

576
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,610
I was indiscreet.

577
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,530
See?

578
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,460
This is my real nephew.

579
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:11,700
Let's go.

580
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,380
Well,

581
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,310
that old man Nangong

582
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,550
just likes to act on his seniority.

583
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,700
He always goes against me.

584
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,300
Today,

585
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,080
you really did it for me.

586
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,900
That's what you call a great job.

587
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,100
Long live the Master of Cangyue City.

588
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,150
Long live the Cangyue.

589
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:43,900
Rise.

590
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,650
Everyone,

591
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,190
recently,

592
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,830
I received many memorials,

593
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,820
all of which made the same suggestion.

594
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,230
That is, to set aside

595
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,190
a large piece of land

596
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,510
in Cangyue City

597
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,500
to develop business

598
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,860
by building a large-scale market.

599
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,900
In this way,

600
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,330
we can trade with other cities,

601
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,220
and it's also convenient for the people in the city.

602
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,130
It will not only promote the economy

603
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,580
but also increase taxes in our city.

604
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,900
What do you think?

605
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,780
I don't think it'll work.

606
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,690
It's really good.

607
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,620
We need to think about it.

608
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,080
Is it appropriate?

609
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,340
Master,

610
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,330
it is a great thing

611
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,310
for the people and the city.

612
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,480
I believe all my colleagues

613
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,020
will have no objections.

614
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,360
But the location of this market

615
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,580
is the most important thing.

616
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,500
We must choose carefully.

617
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,500
Chairman is right.

618
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,440
Let's put this into the city construction plan.

619
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:43,980
Xi'er.

620
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,470
You and the Planning Room

621
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,760
must do your best

622
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,240
and build the trade market.

623
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:48,820
Got it?

624
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,740
Yes, Father.

625
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:53,780
All right.

626
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,040
If there's anything else,

627
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,340
report to me one by one.

628
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,220
Cousin, you're back

629
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:10,500
Stop.

630
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:17,780
Yunxi.

631
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,020
How did it go?

632
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Very good.

633
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,730
This sense is perfect.

634
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,590
Casual and not deliberate.

635
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,510
Romantic, yet not artificial.

636
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,660
If Young Master sees it,

637
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,680
he will have a crush on you.

638
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,110
Really?

639
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,870
Young Master is back.

640
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,680
Hurry up.

641
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,620
Get ready. Move.

642
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,320
OK.

643
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,410
Let's go.

644
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,510
Get me a horse later.

645
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,290
I'm going to inspect.

646
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,180
Yes.

647
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,050
Now!

648
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,630
Cousin,

649
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,230
you're back!

650
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,350
My waist.

651
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,740
Cousin?

652
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,040
Brother!

653
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,950
You are stretching, right?

654
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,480
No!

655
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,510
All right, go on with your exercise.

656
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,220
You can lie down here for a while longer.

657
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,100
No!

658
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,140
Brother!

659
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,630
Let me tell you.

660
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,060
I thought about it.

661
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,640
No horse.

662
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,750
Use the carriage.

663
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,730
Brother! Help me up!

664
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,110
Miss.

665
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,780
Miss, are you alright?

666
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,550
Get up.

667
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,020
Help me.

668
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,460
My waist.

669
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,290
Be gentle.

670
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,370
Be gentle.

671
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,320
It hurts.

672
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,520
Oh my god.

673
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,820
It hurts so much.

674
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,490
Why am I so unlucky?

675
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,420
Miss.

676
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,120
You must be in pain.

677
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:40,820
Of course.

678
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,360
Why don't you try falling once?

679
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,060
Be gentle.

680
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,180
How about we forget it?

681
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,150
It's hard to like someone.

682
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,250
But it's even harder to make someone like you.

683
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:54,940
You're right.

684
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,560
I've decided to give up.

685
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,520
Really?

686
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,760
I gave up on making him like me.

687
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,370
But I'm going to jump to the end.

688
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,100
How?

689
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,900
Of course you're going to help me.

690
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,500
Guard Tang.

691
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,240
This is for you.

692
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,060
I don't want them.

693
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:40,740
Are you being shy?

694
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,270
I'm Pepper.

695
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,380
I'm

696
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,090
your sister Yunxi's best friend.

697
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,120
I don't like flowers.

698
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,950
You don't have to be polite in front of me.

699
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,580
Take it.

700
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,320
What are you doing?

701
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,230
Go away!

702
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,150
How can you treat

703
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,100
a delicate woman like this?

704
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,620
You are so rude!

705
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,090
Qing.

706
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,400
Don't move.

707
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,590
You are all red.

708
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,560
Nowadays,

709
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,980
it's a sin to be pretty.

710
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:39,780
Here, here.

711
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,220
Look!

712
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,970
You look!

713
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,180
In broad daylight,

714
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,710
how can she be so intimate with a man?

715
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,090
How inappropriate!

716
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,980
Don't we have a rule

717
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,640
that men and women shouldn't get too close with each other?

718
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,010
No, Young Master.

719
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,580
Didn't you say

720
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,140
that everyone in the Young Master's Mansion

721
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,120
should worship freedom?

722
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:57,550
I ...

723
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,970
Set the rules now!

724
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,330
Especially for those two.

725
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:03,860
Young Master.

726
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,380
Forgive me for saying this.

727
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,270
Your behavior now

728
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,230
is like

729
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,450
you are jealous.

730
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,910
I...

731
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,820
Am I jealous?

732
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,770
Of whom?

733
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,520
Don't talk nonsense.

734
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,740
Yunxi,

735
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,740
we're leaving now.

736
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,840
Follow me to inspect the location of the market.

737
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,730
Young Master, please wait a moment.

738
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:28,610
I'll be ready soon.

739
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,410
Here, here, here.

740
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,240
-OK. Don't scratch. -It's itchy here.

741
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,740
I want more.

742
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,750
And here.

743
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,210
And here too.

744
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,070
Okay, got it.

745
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,020
And here.

746
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,850
And here.

747
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,430
Here.

748
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,420
You're a man.

749
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,540
Why are you being so dramatic?

750
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,060
You apply it yourself!

751
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,560
I can't see

752
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,100
where my face is red and swollen.

753
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,480
I can't apply it myself.

754
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,040
Yunxi.

755
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,090
Here, here.

756
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,450
Great.

757
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,910
I have time.

758
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,030
I can apply it for you.
