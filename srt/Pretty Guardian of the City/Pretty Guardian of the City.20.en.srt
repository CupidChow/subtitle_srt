[Episode 20]

4
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,150
It is not a good time

5
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,450
to kill Xiao Huasheng now.

6
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,500
Don't do anything stupid.

7
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,030
You've long known it was Xiao Huasheng

8
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,250
who killed my parents, right?

9
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,729
Yes.

10
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,800
I've long found it out.

11
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,810
But what's the point of telling you?

12
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,980
Can you kill him?

13
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,790
The Xiao's Mansion is heavily guarded.

14
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,460
Besides, he himself is a master

15
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,420
of martial arts.

16
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,820
You will only get yourself killed.

17
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,870
Even if I'll get killed, I have to give it a try.

18
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,380
Who are you to make a decision for me?

19
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,579
You have no idea

20
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,020
what Xiao Huasheng has put me through.

Do you know what they are?

25
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,590
They are all

26
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,460
lethal poisons.

27
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,090
Since young,

28
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,510
I've been taking these poisons

29
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,980
like taking meals.

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,070
Only by doing that can I

31
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,460
subdue the poison of heartburn in my body.

32
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,060
Even so,

33
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,310
I have to live

34
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,670
in the fear of

35
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,140
sudden bouts of excruciating pain.

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,510
Now I finally

37
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,380
found the culprit.

38
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,740
How could you ask me to give up revenge?

39
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,710
Think about it.

40
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,820
If something happens to you,

41
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,200
how are your brother

Let me do it.

Yunxi.

47
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,170
Here.

48
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,700
Have some more.

49
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,060
I bet you didn't sleep well last night.

50
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,790
Go take a nap after eating.

52
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,620
Bad news.

Luo Hexuan is missing.

54

What do you mean?

55
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,460
I went to deliver Ginseng soup just now

56
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,060
and didn't see him when I got in.

Has anyone left the mansion this morning?

60
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,940
Only Pepper did.

61
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,310
She said the bathtub in Miss Yunxi's room

62
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,040
was broken.

63
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,579
She got some people to carry it out to fix it.

64
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,740
Has she taken my brother away?

65
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,190
So Pepper

66
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,620
is the spy

67
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,290
sent by Commander Xiao.

68
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,910
No wonder we had no clues at all

69
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,580
after searching for so long.

70
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,820
Who would have known

71
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,430
the spy

72
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,620
is the unsophisticated Pepper?

73
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,540
Great.

74
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,320
You did a great job.

75
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,940
I'll give you a big reward.

76
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,659
Thank you, Commander.

77
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,230
Your identity

78
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,180
must have been exposed.

79
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,820
You don't have to

80
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,180
return to Young Master's Mansion.

81
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,180
Just follow my instructions

82
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:58,820
in the future.

83
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,970
Yes, Commander.

84

If there is nothing else,

85
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,050
I'll leave now.

Commander Xiao,

87
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,700
his pulse is stable

88
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,820
but too weak.

89
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,820
Besides, he has been in a coma for too long.

90
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,180
Even if we use strong medicine to wake him up,

91
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,400
I'm afraid

92
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,080
he won't live

93
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,740
for more than an hour.

94
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,990
An hour?

95
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,790
It's enough.

96
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,850
Use the medicine on him now.

97
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,270
Well…

98
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,820
Ask Xiao

99
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,920
to return my brother to me!

100
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,540
Young... Young Master.

101
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,150
Xiao Huasheng!

102
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,710
You can't go in.

103
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,659
Give me my brother!

104
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,860
You're so audacious.

105
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,330
How dare you break into my mansion!

106
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,420
Guards!

107
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,370
Take them down!

108
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,300
Xiao Huasheng,

109
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,100
if you don't give me my brother,

110
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,290
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

111
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,620
Your brother?

112
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,910
So,

113
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,780
you're Luo Daoan's daughter?

114
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,700
I couldn't find you anywhere,

115
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,510
but you came to my door yourself.

116
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,580
I finally got both you and your brother

117
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,650
in my hands.

118
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,420
Cut the crap.

119
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,540
Hand over Luo Hexuan quickly

120
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,700
and we'll pretend

121
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,450
nothing has happened today.

122
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,090
But it did happen.

123
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,440
I'm so disappointed in you, my nephew.

124
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,210
Since you've been hiding Luo Hexuan

125
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,100
for so long,

126
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,670
you must have known

127
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,460
your parentage.

128
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,150
What cards

129
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,000
do you hold now

130
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,270
to stand up to me?

131
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,380
Back then,

132
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,280
you and the Lady of Cangyue City

133
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,870
swapped Master's son for me.

134
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,380
If I'm punished,

135
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,330
the Xiao family

136
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,830
won't be able to get off easily.

137
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,900
Childish.

138
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,730
Do you think

139
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,470
we sink or swim together?

140
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,740
I won't do

141
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,620
such a stupid thing.

142
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,250
As long as

143
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,140
you don't leave my mansion today,

144
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,100
no one will know

145
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,480
what happened back then.

146
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,710
What are you waiting for?

147
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,800
Make it quick.

148
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,090
Xiao Huasheng.

149
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,940
Don't tell me you're so naive

150
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,420
as to think we came here unprepared.

151
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,540
What do you mean?

152
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,670
Why don't you go

153
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,980
check up on your precious daughter?

154
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,520
Tang Qing.

155
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,960
Tang Qing.

156
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,120
How come you have time

157
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,580
to walk the rabbits with me today?

158
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,860
The weather is nice today.

159
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,650
I think it'll be good

160
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:36,800
to take Happy and Joy out

161
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,870
and let them bond.

162
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,980
Feelings may come in time.

163
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,540
Why didn't I think of that?

164
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,420
Let's go.

165
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,900
Hurry up.

166
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,890
Release Fengyi!

167
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,260
As long as you return my brother to us,

168
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,190
she will come back safely.

169
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,980
Alright. Sheathe your swords.

170
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,620
You young people

171
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,820
are so impulsive.

172
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,390
No matter what,

173
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,220
I've been your uncle for so many years.

174

We don't have to fall out.

just like we used to be.

Isn't that good?

179
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,420
That's perfect.

180

Luo Hexuan is in my study.

189
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,620
Go take him away.

Who are their Mom and Dad?

They are me and you.

Don't worry.

I'm not interested in you.

How dare you talk to me like that?

207
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,420
We don't want to hang out with him anymore.

It bit me.

Both you and your rabbit picked on me.

Show me the bite.

218

It hurts.

It's okay.

220
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,570
It's just a little red.

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,300
Go back and apply ointment.

That's more like it.

I'll give you a chance to make it up to me.

I was wrong in thinking

that you threw your lot with Xiao Huasheng.

Sorry.

hadn't found out my identity,

poisoned them,

244

and you wouldn't have gone through all this.

I can't blame you

for what happened to my family.

Without you,

248
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,700
Xiao Huasheng would victimize other people.

But I didn't expect you

to be in so much pain too.

251
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,330
I didn't tell you

252

because I didn't want you to act on an impulse.

253

After all, neither of us

can beat Xiao Huasheng.

What should we do next?

is to our advantage.

he can't harm us without backfiring.

get rid of Xiao Huasheng once and for all,

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,190
even if he found out

346
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,990
his true identity,

347
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,420
he should know clearly

348
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,510
that his future is bound

349
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,900
with the Xiao family's.

350
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,230
He knows better

351
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,800
than to cut his nose to spite his face.

352
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,100
Besides,

353
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,970
I raised him myself.

354
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,080
So what?

355
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,790
Don't forget

356
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,420
that the ledger

357
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,340
took away by Luo Daoan

358
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,770
hasn't been found yet.

359
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,910
As long as Jiang Chaoxi is alive,

360
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,580
he's a threat to us.

361
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,820
But if we kill him,

362
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,360
I'll lose my only child.

363
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,100
The Xiao family will lose its status.

364
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,460
Don't worry about that.

365
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,320
I've thought about it.

366
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,800
Technically speaking,

367
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,340
Jiang Chuxian

368
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,310
counts as the Xiao family's offspring too.

369
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,560
Although his mother

370
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,640
was just a servant of the Xiao family,

371
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,750
she was kind of a member of the Xiao family.

372
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,060
No.

373
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,030
How can we let that lowly maid's son

374
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,750
climb up?

375
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,640
Don't worry.

376
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,680
He and his mother are spineless.

377
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,570
Even if they are in a high position,

378
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,620
they are just our puppets.

379
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,140
But...

380
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,480
It's decided.

381
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,570
I'm not here

382
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,670
to discuss it with you.

383
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,860
You're my sister.

384
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,960
I would never do anything to harm you.

385
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,150
No.

386
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,470
I can't let that lowly maid

387
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,540
and her son gain influence.

388
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,750
Long live the Master of Cangyue City.

389
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,160
Long live Cangyue.

390
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,170
Rise.

391
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,030
Xi'er, this is ridiculous.

392
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,430
How could you bring a girl

393
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,180
to the meeting hall?

394
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,730
Father,

395
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,020
this is the architect I invited

396
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,590
to build Cangyue City.

397
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,660
She's called Yunxi.

398
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,180
She is also the daughter of Luo Daoan,

399
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:46,980
the previous director of the Planning Department.

400
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,310
Luo Xiyun.

401
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,150
Luo Daoan has a daughter?

402
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,670
H-His bloodline wasn't ended?

403
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,110
Master,

404
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,730
my name is Luo Xiyun.

405
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,050
My father is Luo Daoan.

406
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,290
I have a brother, Luo Hexuan.

407
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,060
He's still alive,

408
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,540
but he was victimized by someone vicious

409
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,700
and has been in a coma for many years.

410
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,690
Xi'er.

411
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,060
Father.

412
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,210
What's going on?

413
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,010
Tell me.

414
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,210
After verification,

415
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,119
the Luo family

416
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,540
were killed by a villain cruelly

417
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,270
after being framed for corruption.

418
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,700
And the murderer

419
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,500
is right in the meeting hall today.

420
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,580
In the meeting hall?

421
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,820
This is the account book

422
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,380
I found in his residence

423
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,550
after the muderer left home this morning.

424
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,950
It recorded in detail

425
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,730
the construction funds of the imperial mausoleum he embezzled.

426
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,830
Lord Song.

427
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,380
Why are you shaking?

428
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,740
Lord Song?

429
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,070
Please spare my life! Master!

430
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,270
Please spare my life! Master!

431
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,400
I...

432
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,910
Shut up!

433
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,820
Song Qing.

434
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,140
How dare you

435
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,460
do such outrageous things?

436
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,060
Even I

437
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,170
was deceived by you.

438
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,430
Master!

439
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,620
I appointed wrong people

440
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,560
and had been deceived by this culprit for many years.

441
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,990
Please punish me.

442
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,680
Uncle,

443
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,130
we haven't made it clear yet.

444
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,200
Why are you in such a hurry?

445
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,070
You...

446
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,420
Xi'er.

447
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,310
Do you mean

448
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,960
there are some other secrets?

449
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,210
In my opinion,

450
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,400
Song Qing was just

451
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,590
a minor official in the Planning Department,

452
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,720
so he might not have the guts

453
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,790
to brew such a plot.

454
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:35,810
I think

455
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,190
there is

456
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,510
a real mastermind behind this.

457
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,070
Master,

458
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,420
the Luo family

459
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,560
died overnight.

460
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,360
After only two days of investigation

461
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,850
on such a serious case,

462
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,570
he was sentenced to committing suicide for fear of punishment

463
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,910
and the case was closed hastily.

464
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,860
And the person who investigated the case

465
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,440
was Commander Xiao

466
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,820
who promoted Song Qing.

467
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,700
It is such a coincidence.

468
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,370
Chairman.

469
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,530
What do you mean?

470
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,660
You are obviously framing me.

471
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,110
I have devoted half of my life

472
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,820
to Cangyue City.

473
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,780
I can't stand

474
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,060
being wronged like this.

475
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,580
Please help me. Master.

476
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,360
Song Qing.

477
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,320
What on earth

478
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,180
is the truth of that year?

479
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,770
Tell me.

480
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,590
Say it!

481
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,080
Say it!

482
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,950
Song Qing.

483
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,460
Since you have done

484
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,200
such an inhumane thing,

485
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,330
you've already let

486
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,650
your parents, wife and children down.

487
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,780
It is your chance

488
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,650
to confess everything now.

489
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,820
I advise you

490
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,580
to think before you speak.

491
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,270
Don't take the wrong path again.

492
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,490
Everything

493
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,210
was done by me alone.

494
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,920
It had nothing to do with others.

495
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,760
It's really him.

496
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,140
He did it himself.

497
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,520
Fine.

498
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,790
Since you've admitted it...

499
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,890
Guards, drag him out.

500
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,160
He'll be executed someday.

501
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,020
Master, please spare my life.

502
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,380
Please spare my life!

503
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,140
Please spare my life!

504
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,810
Take him away.

505
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,220
Master, please spare my life!

506
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,320
Please spare my life!

507
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,240
Please spare my life!

508
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,460
Master.

509
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,610
How conscienceless he is!

510
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,700
How could he do such a thing?

511
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,630
I didn't expect that after many years,

512
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,240
the Luo family case

513
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,690
could be righted today.

514
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,170
It's really touching.

515
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,460
Miss Yunxi.

516
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,550
It's been hard for you these years.

517
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:07,860
From now on,

518
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,340
you can work for Xi'er

519
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,050
and help him build Cangyue City.

520
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,710
I won't treat you badly, okay?

521
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:15,610
Father,

522
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,340
in my opinion,

523
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,150
with Yunxi's talent,

524
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,340
it's a pity to work for me.

525
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,280
Now that Song Qing has been executed,

526
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,180
I think

527
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,610
we can make her

528
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,110
the new director of the Planning Department.

529
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,050
We can return the Luo family's things

530
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,320
to the Luo family.

531
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,080
Master.

532
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,480
Please don't do that.

533
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,340
No matter how talented

534
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,790
Miss Yunxi is,

535
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,430
she is still a woman.

536
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,500
Cangyue has never had

537
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,040
a female official.

538
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,330
That's a stereotype.

539
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,980
If there is no precedent,

540
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,120
we can start one.

541
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,850
Xi'er.

542
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,600
What Chairman said makes sense.

543
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,700
Making Miss Yunxi

544
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,810
the director of the Planning Department

545
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,790
is indeed inappropriate.

546
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,540
Let me think about it.

547
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,510
Got it.

548
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,910
How about this?

549
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,940
Let her

550
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,260
be the Chief Planner.

551
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,650
First,

552
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,700
she can show her talents.

553
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,480
Second,

554
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,870
it won't break the rules.

555
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,760
What do you think?

556
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,710
Chief Planner?

557
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,830
Say thank you.

558
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,140
Thank you for your appreciation. Master.

559
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,270
This...

560
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,190
She is a woman.

561
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,320
I'm afraid she can't take the responsibility.

562
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
That's right.

563
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,300
It's hard for a female official

564
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,550
to do things well.

565
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,520
That's right. This is against the rules.

566
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,160
It's inappropriate for a woman to do that.

567
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,780
What a mess!

568
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,220
Let's go.

569
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,940
As I expected,

570
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,190
we couldn't

571
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,030
defeat Xiao Huasheng easily.

572
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,550
Fortunately, Song Qing has been executed today.

573
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,390
I think my parents can feel a little comforted

574
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,500
in the underworld.

575
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,590
But why did you

576
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,270
mention in the meeting hall

577
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,740
that you wanted me to be the director of the Planning Department?

578
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,030
Women are not allowed to be officials.

579
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,110
I knew these old men

580
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,850
wouldn't agree.

581
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,130
That's why I purposely mentioned it.

582
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,050
My purpose is to ask Father

583
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,920
to give you a title

584
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,730
so that you can attract more attention.

585
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,470
At that time, Xiao Huasheng won't dare

586
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,790
to hurt you again.

587
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,830
Thank you

588
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,260
for being so considerate for me.

589
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,700
Yunxi.

590
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,410
When I get Fengchi,

591
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,060
I will cure

592
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,040
your brother and you

593
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,340
and find evidence

594
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,400
to execute Xiao Huasheng.

595
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,140
Then I'll take you out of here

596
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,160
and let you live the life you want,

597
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,130
okay?

598
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,440
What a perfect couple!

599
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,500
You are really enviable!

600
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,990
But

601
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,900
it's still unknown

602
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,190
whether you can live till tomorrow.

603
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,660
What tricks does Xiao Huasheng want to play?

604
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,540
Don't worry.

605
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,000
He doesn't dare to do anything.

606
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,500
Don't panic.

607
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:45,600
Got it.

608
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,320
Yunxi,

609
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,920
today is the beginning of the month.

610
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,850
My brothers and I

611
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,420
need to listen to

612
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,210
my father's instructions.

613
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,090
I have to go.

614
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,020
Come back early.

615
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,630
Be good.

616
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,630
Your Ladyship.

617
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,640
She is here.

618
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,110
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

619
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,290
You're quite capable

620
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,120
to make Xi'er disobey me in public.

621
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,880
You must have used many means

622
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,290
behind my back.

623
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,150
We truly love each other.

624
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,640
Our love doesn't involve in any utility.

625
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,090
Please investigate it and trust us.

626
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,730
You're a straightforward person.

627
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,460
I won't hide it anymore.

628
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,860
Xi'er is not the son of me

629
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,860
and Master.

630
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,480
You already know that, right?

631
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,440
Although I'm not his biological mother,

632
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,930
I've raised Xi'er after all.

633
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,590
After so many years,

634
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,890
we have affections.

635
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,340
Let me tell you.

636
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,710
If Xi'er wants to protect himself now,

637
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,520
he can only marry Fengyi

638
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,120
and continue to be

639
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,260
the good son of the Xiao family.

640
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,750
Only in this way,

641
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,510
he has the value of continuing to exist

642
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,410
for my brother.

643
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,650
Young Master doesn't want

644
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,510
to be against Commander Xiao.

645
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,150
We only hope

646
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,470
to be with the one we love.

647
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,190
I hope Commander Xiao

648
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,120
can be merciful,

649
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:44,980
so that both sides

650
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,070
won't be too disgraceful.

651
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,220
Are you really childish?

652
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,870
At this point,

653
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,880
if Xi'er doesn't marry Fengyi

654
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,310
or Nangong Siyan,

655
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,940
what will happen to him?

656
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,110
You don't know that?

657
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,020
If you want him to die,

658
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,830
you can stay together.

659
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,510
If you want him to live,

660
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,370
he can only marry Fengyi.

661
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,100
Did I make myself clear?

662
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,920
I won't kill you

663
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,680
or kick you out.

664
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,820
I'd like to see

00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,110
I wanted to take you

688
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:40,700
to a place.

689
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,950
Since you're tired,

690
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:47,520
♫Luckily, my heart remains the same when all the flowers fall♫

691
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,980
let's go back and rest.

692
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,050
We'll go another day.

693
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,590
No need.

694
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,970
I just want to go today.

695
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,560
I won't be tired as long as I'm with you.

696
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:54,360
♫I've been waiting for you for a thousand years♫

697
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,990
Really? You always tease me.

698
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,820
Besides, you don't know

699
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,450
where to go.

700
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,280
I'll go anywhere

701
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,940
♫Dream that we are on the old road we met♫

702
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,370
as long as it's you who take me to go.

703
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:57,900
Really?

704
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:58,860
Really?

705
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,280
♫See you gently play the zither♫

706
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,700
Okay.

707
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:07,750
♫Who are you waiting for to make you a pot of tea?♫

708
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,410
Come with me

709
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,620
I'll carry you if you're tired.

710
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,290
Are we there?

711
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,600
How far?

712
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,000
We're here.

713
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,290
What is this?

714
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,840
I made it myself.

715
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,520
A model.

716
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,670
I will build

717
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,510
a town just like this for you in the future.

718
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:45,970
This is you.

719
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,730
This is me.

720
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,660
In the future,

721
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,890
we will

722
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,080
live freely

723
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,410
in this small town.

724
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,310
I'll go wherever you go.

725
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,260
I'll stick to you every day

726
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,370
and have many children with you.

727
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,680
When they grow up,

728
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,240
they'll have many children.

729
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,620
By then, generation after generation of descendants

730
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,080
will live here and make it bustling.

731
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,540
Do you like it? Are you happy?

732
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,220
Yes.

733
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,100
I really hope what you said

734
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,180
will come true in the future.

735
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,210
Of course.

736
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,430
After all,

737
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,280
this is my dream

738
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,090
and our future.

739
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,330
I will make it come true.

740
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:40,810
Trust me,

741
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:41,960
okay?

742
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,070
Tang Qing.

743
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,280
Tang Qing.

744
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,810
Why did you turn around after you saw me?

745
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,680
Are you avoiding me?

746
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,400
No. How could it be?

747
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,470
Miss Fengyi.

748
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,460
You keep going.

749
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,580
I have work to do.

750
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,070
Stop!

751
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,310
I'm here to see you.

752
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,790
You have no idea.

753
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
My father

754
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,270
has been strict with me lately.

755
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,490
I had a hard time

756
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,400
sneaking out.

757
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,700
I know

758
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,710
my cousin likes Yunxi

759
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,870
and doesn't want to marry me.

760
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,190
Actually,

761
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,710
I don't want to marry my cousin now.

762
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,560
I don't want a man who doesn't love me.

763
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,520
Miss Fengyi,

764
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,170
what can I do for you?

765
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,260
I just want to talk to you.

766
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,820
I don't know why.

767
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,240
I feel very happy

768
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,380
when I'm with you.

769
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,380
I'm even happier

770
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,160
than when I'm with Cousin.

771
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,900
You must be joking.

772
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,590
How can I compare with

773
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,420
Young Master?

774
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,470
I have to patrol.

775
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,720
Please don't

776
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,370
make fun of me anymore.

777
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,650
You can't leave.

778
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,600
Playing with me

779
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,990
is your work today.
