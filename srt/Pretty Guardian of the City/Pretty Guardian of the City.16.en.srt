Pepper.

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,580
Why are you panicking?

6
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,370
Am I panicking?

7
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,110
No.

8
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,009
I' m just cleaning the room.

9
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,150
Yunxi,

10
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,330
after all, you are the most precious treasure

11
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,090
of Young Master now.

12
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,780
I have to take good care of you.

13
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,720
What's wrong? Are you unhappy?

14
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,240
Did you have a fight with Young Master?

15
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,270
Yunxi,

16
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,470
don' t be ungrateful.

17
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,810
If you don't cherish him,

18
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,360
you will be reproached

19
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,910
by all the women in Cangyue City.

20
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,520
Yunxi,

21
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,430
do you know

22
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,550
how popular Young Master is

23
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:48,180
in Cangyue City?

24
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,450
Well...

25
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,880
You can lose him in a blink of an eye.

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,480
You...

27
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,490
How dare you quarrel with him?

28
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,490
It's not what you think.

29
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,140
I don't want to waste my time

30
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,410
on quarreling with him.

31
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,470
After all, the time left for me...

32
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,170
That's right.

33
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,680
Young Master is not married yet and

34
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,960
he still can love you solely.

35
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,650
When he marries someone else,

36
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,670
how come you and him can still be in love

37
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,700
like this?

38
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,340
So you should cherish him as you can.

39
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,950
Besides, he is the Young Master.

40
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,470
Can't you give in to him a little?

41
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,700
Don't be afraid.

42
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,060
Greetings, Mother.

43
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,829
Greetings, Madam.

44
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,870
You've grown up now,

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,240
and won't listen to me anymore.

46
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,750
Even your mother

47
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,890
has to come to your mansion in person

48
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,740
to see you.

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,480
You misunderstood me, Mother.

50
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,010
Recently,

51
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,650
I've been very obedient to my uncle,

52
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,890
and I worked hard

53
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,090
to build Cangyue City.

54
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,740
I'm really busy.

55
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,010
It's all my fault.

56
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,960
I won't do it again.

57
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,160
You're so smooth-tongued.

58
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:16,860
Mother,

59
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,140
what can I do for you?

60
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,350
Your father and I

61
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,460
have discussed.

62
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,750
We'll pick an auspicious day to arrange the marriage.

63
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,990
Let Fengyi and Nangong Siyan

64
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,770
marry into our family at the same time.

65
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,240
This...

66
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,320
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

67
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,460
Why not?

68
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,520
Fengyi is your destined wife.

69
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,950
As for Nangong Siyan,

70
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,650
it's all your father's idea.

71
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,570
In the future,

72
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,720
she'll be a second lady at most.

73
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,290
No, Mother.

74
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,260
I still don't want to...

75
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,080
No matter how you put it,

76
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,650
it is because

77
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,740
you were seduced by someone.

78
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,210
Well...

79
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,480
Since you like her,

80
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,540
I won't disapprove.

81
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,660
She'll just be a concubine.

82
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,780
She will only be my wife.

83
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,230
How dare you!

84
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,420
Miss,

85
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,750
you must be a smart person.

86
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,060
You should know how to choose.

87
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,950
Thank you for your compliment.

88
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,080
But

89
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,190
Yunxi doesn' t want to be a concubine.

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,120
How dare you!

91
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,640
You don't know the rules!

92
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,040
How dare you seduce Young Master

93
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,170
and talk back to me!

94
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,530
Ansu.

95
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,580
What are you doing?

96
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,170
Are you okay?

97
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,720
I' m fine.

98
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,640
Yunxi is the person I want to protect.

99
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,180
No one can bully her.

100
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,990
I respect you as my mother.

101
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,760
But please respect me, too.

102
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:17,870
You...

103
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,740
Yunxi,

104
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,500
this wound looks scary.

105
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,000
It doesn' t hurt at all.

106
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,990
Besides, I got hurt because of you.

107
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,420
I' m willing to do it.

108
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,370
Why are you crying?

109
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,810
♫I wish to hold your hand♫

110

He gave me the chance to save you.

118
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,980

Are you looking for Young Master?

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,220
You guys continue.

141
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,220
I'll go back first.

142
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,170
Why are you so slow-witted?

143
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,600
Can't you see that both of us...

144
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,440
I want to join the Supervision Army.

145
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,210
I want to be Yunxi' s backup.

146
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,010
I don' t want others to say

147
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,500
she only deserves to be a concubine.

148
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,250
Have you made up your mind?

149
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,240
Fine.

150
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,570
I support you.

Don't worry.

152
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,210
I promise

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,280
you'll have a bright future

154
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,440
in the Supervision Army.

155
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,490
Then Yunxi...

156
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,520
My sister is your responsibility now.

157
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,100
Don't worry.

158
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,500
I will protect her.

159
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,420
I won't let her get hurt.

160
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,860
If one day

161
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,220
you don't love her anymore,

162
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,870
give her back to me.

163
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,950
That day won't come.

164
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,270
Why are you here?

165
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,010
Yunxi,

166
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,410
I'm joining the Supervision Army.

167
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,590
Jiang Chaoxi recommended me.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,400
Didn't we agree to discuss it later?

169
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,000
Yunxi,

170
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,090
this is my own decision.

171
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,370
I joined the army

Nothing happened.

Why would he resign?

It doesn't hurt anymore.

514
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,760
I blow it for you.

515
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,940
What do you know?

516
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,620
When I was young,

517
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,110
I was even more icky than him.

518
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,960
Do you feel better?

519
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,470
One more.

520
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:38,570
Siyan.

521
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,580
What's wrong, Siyan?

522
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,150
What happened?

523
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,210
I...

524
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,530
I'm going to be married to Young Master.

525
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,190
Young Master?

526
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,740
The Lady of Cangyue City and Commander Xiao

527
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,020
are eager to facilitate the marriage of

528
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,980
Miss Fengyi and Young Master.

529
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,330
Master asked me and Miss Fengyi

530
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,430
to marry Young Master at the same time.

531
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,440
Chuxian.

532
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,690
What should we do?

533
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,360
I can't let you marry someone else.

534
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
I'll talk to my father.

535
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,820
It's useless.

536
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,500
To balance the power,

537
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,320
the master needs the daughter of the Nangong family to marry Young Master.

538
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,370
In their eyes,

539
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,310
personal feelings are nothing.

540
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,410
Chuxian, let's go.

541
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,620
Let's get out of here

542
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,870
and live like an ordinary married couple,

543
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,520
OK?

544
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:21,460
Get out of here?

545
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,560
Forget it.

546
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,490
I was just saying.

547
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,000
Siyan.

548
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,650
Let's go.

549
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,980
Chuxian.

550
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,950
Life is short. Without you, I have no joy in life.

551
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,450
Siyan.

552
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,410
After I settle my mother down,

553
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:54,760
I'll take you away.

554
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:26,820
My Lady.

555
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,500
Why are you crying?

556
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,790
It's all because of the onions.

557
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,760
But you're holding a carrot.

558
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,260
Miss,

559
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,320
I have good news.

560
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,020
Do you want to hear it?

561
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,440
Say it.

562
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,620
I found out

563
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,530
where Guard Tang is.

564
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,730
He didn't go far.

565
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,930
He just joined to the Supervision Army.

566
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,470
Is...

567
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,420
Where he is

568
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,590
has nothing to do with me.

569
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,510
I'm not interested and I don't care.

570
00:29:59,260 --> 00:29:59,740
Miss,

571
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,130
are you sure you don't want to visit him?

572
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,620
He left

573
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,540
without telling me.

574
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,060
Who do you think I am?

575
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,040
I don't want to see him.

576
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,350
Damn Tang Qing!

577
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,220
You can just wait there!

578
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:32,900
Here.

579
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,140
It's so hot.

580
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,740
Poor thing.

581
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,130
A Supervision Guard

582
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,310
is not something that anyone can do.

583
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
It's so hot.

584
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,560
It's so refreshing to have some herbal tea.

585
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,320
Jiaobai.

586
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,000
Go.

587
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,960
Pour some for them.

588
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:08,920
OK. You can pass.

589
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,700
Here's the water.

590
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:13,690
Water.

591
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
Thank you, Miss Fengyi.

592
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,830
Thank you, Miss Fengyi.

593
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,620
Thank you, Miss Fengyi.

594
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,450
You're welcome.

595
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,670
Yours.

596
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,600
Thank you, miss.

597
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,340
Thank you, miss.

598
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:22,980
Guard Tang.

599
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,440
Jiaobai.

600
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,370
That's enough.

601
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,980
They still have to work.

602
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:27,930
Don't take too much of their time.

603
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,980
What are you laughing at?

604
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,090
Get back to work.

605
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,470
Tang Qing.

606
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,950
Why didn't you tell me

607
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,990
when

608
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,160
you left the Young Master's Mansion.

609
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,810
You abandoned Joy.

610
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,030
She now was not joy.

611
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,630
She doesn't even eat carrots anymore.

612
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,610
Miss, I have to guard the gate.

613
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,510
Please go back first.

614
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:04,980
Well,

615
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,060
I'll return it to you.

616
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,340
I really don't know how to raise a rabbit.

617
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,120
It's yours now.

618
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,480
You have to raise it, even if you don't know how.

619
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,970
And you have to take good care of it.

620
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,430
If you abandon her again,

621
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,130
I won't be your friend anymore.

622
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,280
Pass.

623
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,680
Then you send me home?

624
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,530
Miss, I am on duty.

625
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,820
On duty?

626
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:33,970
Pass.

627
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,830
Is he still on duty?

628
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,650
It's about time.

629
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,400
It's time to change shifts.

630
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,790
It's almost time.

631
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,050
Let's go.

632
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,320
Keep up.

633
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,990
Come and take a look.

634
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,120
Miss,

635
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,330
take a look at

636
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,340
my pretty knots.

637
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,570
Why don't you choose one?

638
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,450
Is this sword tassel nice?

639
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,690
How about I buy it for you?

640
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,690
No, I have one.

641
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,070
What color is this?

642
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:29,940
So ugly.

643
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,580
What are you doing?

644
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,550
Change it for you.

645
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,040
No need.

646
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,760
What a strange color.

647
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,740
Did a girl give it to you?

648
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,980
Did Yunxi give it to you?
