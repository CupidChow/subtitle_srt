4
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,320
Miss, you are here.

5
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,660
Steward Xiao, where is my cousin?

6
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,680
He's inside.

7
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,300
Cousin!

8
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:53,700
Stop!

9
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,130
Commander Xiao ordered

10
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,070
that during special times

11
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,130
everyone must be interrogated

12
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,310
before entering Young Master's Mansion.

13
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,530
Steward Xiao,

14
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,730
Are you blind?

15
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,060
How dare you stop my lady?

16
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,020
Commander Xiao says whether I know this person or not,

17
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,270
I have to interrogate.

18
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,160
Besides,

19
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,229
we need to be more careful

20
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,380
especially for an acquaintance to do bad things.

21
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,060
Then why didn't you

22
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,940
interrogate Miss Fengyi?

23
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,390
People of the Xiao family

24
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,210
won't do anything

25
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,690
to harm Young Master.

26
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,190
You mean our Nangong family

27
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,220
intend to harm Young Master?

28
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,079
Not to mention you,

29
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,180
even your master

30
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,240
dare not say such a thing.

31
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,820
Miss, here.

32
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:26,980
Go in.

33
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,940
Leave this to me.

34
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,579
You...

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,370
Steward Xiao,

36
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,500
why are you stopping us?

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,079
Don't think I don't know that

38
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,230
you just want to stop

39
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,640
my lady from seeing Young Master.

40
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,900
Don't flatter yourselves.

41
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm not.

42
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,300
Young Master

43
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,500
clearly likes my lady.

44
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,710
Forget it.

45
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,310
It's my lady who

46
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,260
Young Master likes.

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,240
My cousin.

48
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,460
Consin.

49
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,010
Miss.

50
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,470
Greetings, Miss.

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,340
You must

52
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,890
come here to visit Young Master too.

53
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,890
When he sees you,

54
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,100
he must be in ecstacy with both body and mind,

55
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,730
with peace but without bitter.

56
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,030
Nangong Siyan,

57
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,420
Can you talk normally?

58
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,700
You're always speaking like a book.

59
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,460
Are you tired?

60
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,040
I am afraid that

61
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,230
Miss Fengyi have some misunderstandings about me.

62
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,500
I'm  talking like this

63
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,220
out of a personal habit.

64
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,690
I didn't do it on purpose.

65
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,060
As the saying goes...

66
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,500
I don't want to hear it! You are mumbling!

67
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,340
You hypocrite!

68
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,500
So annoying.

69
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:27,970
Cousin

70
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,230
This is the hemorrhoids ointment

71
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,340
I bought from the old doctor

72
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,870
who claimed to be a second Hua Tuo.

73
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,740
It cost me a fortune.

74
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,250
As long as you apply a little bit on the wound,

75
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,230
it will immediately work.

76
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,740
Cousin

77
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,820
Let me apply the medicine for you

78
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,050
Let me apply it for you.

79
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,300
Wait. Let go of me.

80
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:41,740
It's not appropriate.

81
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,800
Not appropriate?

82
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,740
Men and women are different.

83
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,340
It's okay.

84
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,540
Cousin,

85
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,230
you are a girl after all.

86
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,340
It's okay.

87
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,730
Young Master! He's mine!

88
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,860
Step aside.

89
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,500
None of your business.

90
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,180
Cousin,

91
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,470
we'll be husband and wife sooner or later.

92
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,740
Don't be shy.

93
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,750
Miss Fengyi.

94
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,490
Miss,

95
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,990
although you are a perfect match,

96
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,200
you are not married yet.

97
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,810
It doesn't sound good if words spread out.

98
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,260
It will ruin the beautiful story

99
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,140
of you two

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,160
among the people.

101
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,810
It makes sense.

102
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,560
Fine.

103
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,650
Dr. Xian,

104
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,780
please.

105
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,770
Nangong Siyan,

106
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,300
What food did you bring to my cousin?

107
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:41,980
I'm not as thoughtful as

108
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,110
Miss Fengyi.

109
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,550
I just made some snacks

110
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,700
for Young Master.

111
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,280
Nangong Siyan.

112
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,460
What are you up to?

113
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,340
Can my cousin eat

114
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,500
such sweet food now?

115
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,220
Here.

116
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,730
Let me try it.

117
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,750
Why does it taste weird?

118
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,140
A little weird.

119
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,290
Miss Fengyi,

120
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,070
you should take care of

121
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,410
your slender figure.

122
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,540
Having too many desserts

123
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,380
is bad for your body figure.

124
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,620
That makes sense.

125
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,860
It's all your fault.

126
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,350
Why is it so hot?

127
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,530
So stuffy.

128
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,780
Are you guys hot?

129
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,940
Yes.

130
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,610
Maybe the room is not ventilated.

131
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,240
Miss,

132
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:49,980
why don't you take a walk in the garden?

133
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,100
A walk?

134
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,860
No way.

135
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,980
I also feel a little stuffy.

136
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,820
Young Master,

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,580
can I take a walk around the house?

138
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,750
Go. Go.

139
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,830
Cousin,

140
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,950
I'll go out for some fresh air, too.

141
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,700
It's too hot.

142
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,350
Young Master, I...

143
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:18,810
You should go too.

144
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,720
Don't waste time.

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,540
Thank you, Young Master.

146
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,520
Aren't you hot?

147
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,970
Yes.

148
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,880
Young Master.

149
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,870
Eat it.

150
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,300
What is this?

151
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,460
I only hope that your heart is like mine.

152
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,180
Then I will never let you down.

153
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,990
What is this?

154
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,360
There are no poems.

155
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,950
I used to communicate with Chuxian

156
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,110
with simple musical notes.

157
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,940
As long as our souls are connected,

158
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,050
we can understand the love in the song.

159
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,630
You educated people

160
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,420
are different from others

161
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,300
even in a relationship.

162
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,180
By the way.

163
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,610
This is...

164
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,540
It's a long story.

165
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:35,800
Anyway,

166
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,380
we need to thank Miss Siyan for

167
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,820
taking the medicine into the mansion.

168
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,620
Take it.

169
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,380
Siyan.

170
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,659
After what happened in Zhao River,

171
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,300
I was so worried about you.

172
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,690
I'm worried that your grandfather might punish you.

173
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,220
I'm worried

174
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,620
you would be sad

175
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,170
because of the rush leave that day.

176
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,340
I'm fine.

177
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,430
Grandpa may seem strict with me

178
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,620
on the surface,

179
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,370
but he couldn't bear to punish me.

180
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,340
But I'm grounded.

181
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm afraid

182
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,800
it'll be harder for me

183
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,010
to meet you.

184
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,660
I am lucky to have known you in this life,

185
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,120
and it made me experience the pain of missing someone.

186
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:31,940
Siyan,

187
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,500
please trust me.

188
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:34,990
One day,

189
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,860
I will let everyone

190
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,460
acknowledge us and bless us.

191
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,340
I will

192
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,070
make you

193
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,140
the happiest woman.

194
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,610
Chuxian.

195
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,890
Siyan.

196
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,030
Who?

197
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,380
Who's there?

198
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,550
It's so hot.

199
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,190
Your body feels so cool.

200
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,100
Let go of me!

201
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,820
What are you doing?

202
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,910
Men and women shouldn't touch each other.

203
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,140
Don't move.

204
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,720
Let me hold you a little longer.

205
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,550
Miss. Miss.

206
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,620
Don't do this.

207
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:21,940
If you keep doing this,

208
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,250
I'll scream.

209
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:24,740
Go ahead.

210
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,580
You can scream.

211
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,570
Miss.

212
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,250
You...

213
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,260
What are you doing?

214
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,540
Don't go.

215
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,680
This is crazy.

216
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,780
It's not like that.

217
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,140
Miss.

218
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,500
Who is it?

219
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,430
You...

220
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,910
Miss.

221
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,210
You are even more crazy.

222
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:42,910
You...

223
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:43,960
Control her.

224
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,270
Hurry!

225
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,640
Don't move.

226
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,300
Don't scratch.

227
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,070
Cousin,

228
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,220
Look what you've done

229
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,250
to Guard Tang.

230
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,010
Look how worried someone is.

231
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,200
Cousin,

232
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,260
please help me.

233
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,310
I did get hot

234
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,780
after I ate the snacks

235
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,950
made by Nangong Siyan.

236
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,940
and then I lost my manners.

237
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,500
She must put drugs

238
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,180
in the snacks.

239
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,390
She has some ulterior motives

240
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,300
for you.

241
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,850
You misunderstood me, Miss Fengyi.

242
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,040
I don't have any intention

243
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,610
for Young Master.

244
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,410
and I wouldn't do anything crossing the line.

245
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,380
Cut it out.

246
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,550
Your little tricks

247
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,740
like that

248
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,940
are played over by me.

249
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,640
Fengyi, stop messing around.

250
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,110
How can you joke about

251
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,340
the reputation of a girl?

252
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,490
Cousin, why don' t you believe me?

253
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,580
Yunxi,

254
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,050
give me the rest of the snacks.

255
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,260
I'll get someone to check it.

256
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,140
There must be something wrong.

257
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:04,580
Miss,

258
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,360
I ate all the snacks.

259
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,070
Except for indigestion,

260
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,550
nothing is wrong.

261
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,220
You've finished them.

262
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,540
How can you eat

263
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,880
so many all of them?

264
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,540
Enough.

265
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,540
Are you here to visit me

266
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,480
or to make a scene?

267
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,660
I'm a patient.

268
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,590
I don't have the energy

269
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,180
to play with you.

270
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,660
You...

271
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,010
You...

272
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,260
You are all together

273
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,820
to bully me.

274
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,260
You...

275
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,570
come with me.

276
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,910
Don't seduce my cousin again.

277
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,900
Young Master.

278
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,810
I'll take my leave.

279
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,610
Let's go.

280
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,160
Stop winking at my cousin.

281
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,110
I feel so relaxed.

282
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,650
I've never felt so good.

283
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,740
Great.

284
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,750
Congratulations, Young Master.

285
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,820
You've recovered.

286
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,630
My master can remove

287
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,780
the stone

288
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,640
in his heart.

289
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,510
I still need to thank my uncle

290
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,060
for his care.

291
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,020
When I was sick,

292
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,540
he put you in charge of Young Master's Mansion.

293
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,100
Now that I've recovered,

294
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,530
I won't bother you anymore.

295
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,140
Please leave.

296
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,220
This...

297
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,610
What?

298
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,870
You don't want to leave?

299
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,020
Or do you want to stay for dinner?

300
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,850
What do you want to eat, Steward Xiao?

301
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,880
I dare not.

302
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,750
I'll go back

303
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,590
and report to Master.

304
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,770
What are you waiting for?

305
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,560
Go see him off.

306
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,360
Please, Steward Xiao.

307
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,800
Let me see you off.

308
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,370
I finally kicked him out.

309
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,660
Thanks to you this time.

310
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,900
Without you,

311
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,820
my injury would have been exposed.

312
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,870
Yunxi should be the one you need to thank for.

313
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,530
Without her bringing the medicine,

314
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I could only be anxious and do nothing.

315
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,260
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

316
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,660
I'm not feeling well

317
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,010
and I feel a little nauseous.

318
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,740
Maybe I've been too busy lately.

319
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,780
Let me check your pulse.

320
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,910
Being tired and feeling nauseous...

321
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,750
Could it be...

322
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,060
What is it?

323
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,000
Yunxi,

324
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,650
judging from your pulse,

325
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:23,900
you are...

326
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,140
Pregnant?

327
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:26,980
Too exhausted.

328
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,180
And lost the baby?

329
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,960
What are you talking about?

330
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:32,820
That's too much.

331
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,600
You don't have to overreact.

332
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,240
We slept together that day.

333
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,420
Counting the days,

334
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,340
it's almost time today.

335
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,140
You...

336
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,740
Who slept with you?

337
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,480
That night,

338
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,860
we did nothing.

339
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,610
You did.

340
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,030
You're shy.

341
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,190
That night,

342
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,260
I saw it clearly.

343
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,570
You...

344
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,890
Please mind your words.

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,510
Young Master.

346
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,670
If there's nothing else,

347
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,800
I'll get going too.

348
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,740
Wuyu.

349
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,490
Let's go.

350
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,180
Goodbye.

351
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,620
I got it wrong.

352
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,520
How could I be wrong?

353
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,780
Young... Young Master.

354
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,020
How could you make a mistake?

355
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,210
Impossible.

356
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:29,630
Impossible.

357
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,270
If nothing had happened

358
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,140
that day,

359
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,340
how did I fall asleep?

360
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,190
Could it be Yunxi?

361
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,660
In this case...

362
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,010
Are you okay, Young Master?

363
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,130
It's all my fault.

364
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:52,870
Wait.

365
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,780
What now?

366
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:57,820
I'm helping you

367
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,260
cut the thread on your clothes.

368
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,520
Young Master, bad news.

369
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,100
Luo Hexuan's condition is deteriorating.

370
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,930
I'm afraid he's dying.

371
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,820
What happened?

372
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,660
He was fine yesterday.

373
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,050
Let's go and have a look.

374
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,310
Why is my brother suddenly in critical condition?

375
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,740
[Light Breeze and Bright Moon]

376
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,319
That's strange.

377
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,960
He's fine.

378
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,109
I knew it was you.

379
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,140
You must have spent a lot of effort

380
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,339
to infiltrate around me.

381
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,900
You set a trap

382
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,470
to lure me here.

383
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,780
Be careful.

384
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,340
Don't hurt yourself.

385
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,870
How did you find out who I truly am?

386
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,140
The fragrance of herbs on you.

387
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,320
Your scent has never changed.

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,400
I thought it was awful,

389
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,530
but now

390
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,860
I find it a little more unique.

391
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,380
Now that you know,

392
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,960
what do you want to do with me?

393
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,500
Why should I?

394
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,350
I've been looking for you for eight years.

395
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,530
But I didn't expect you

396
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,670
to take such great pains

397
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,740
to come to me again.

398
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,650
You...

399
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,220
Why? Jiang Chaoxi!

400
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,220
You severely injured my brother eight years ago,

401
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,060
but you kept him alive for eight years.

402
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,780
What exactly do you want?

403
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,510
When did I injure your brother?

404
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,100
I saw it with my own eyes.

405
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,370
Brother.

406
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,170
I didn't expect that you had bad eyesight

407
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,210
when you were young!

408
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,790
Back then, it was...

409
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,220
Brother.

410
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:03,810
Impossible.

411
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,550
That's impossible.

412
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,960
I've hated you for eight years.

413
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,510
I did everything I could to get close to you

414
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,740
in order to avenge my brother.

415
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,710
How could I find the wrong enemy?

416
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,570
Why not?

417
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,740
If it weren't for me,

418
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,620
your brother would have died long time ago.

419
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,930
To save your brother,

420
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,980
I searched hard for Fengchi.

421
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,100
So you spied out the Xiao's Mansion at night

422
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,890
to save my brother?

423
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,950
Not quite.

424
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,500
Although you said you had found a way

425
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,050
to suppress the poison in your body,

426
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,180
it hasn't been cured.

427
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,060
So I think

428
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,700
maybe Fengchi could cure you too.

429
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,610
Then why did you save my brother?

430
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,740
Because of something personal.

431
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,420
I can't tell you now.

432
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,180
But don't worry.

433
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,340
I never had any intention of

434
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,460
hurting you and your brother.

435
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:06,610
Do you

436
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,740
know

437
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,340
if it's true that my father committed suicide

438
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,460
because of corruption?

439
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,620
Director Luo was an upright person.

440
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,340
He would never do anything to bend the law for personal benefits.

441
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,770
As for the real reason,

442
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,960
I was still young

443
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,780
so I didn't know.

444
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,170
Really?

445
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,670
Have you seen my parents?

446
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,540
Your father and your brother look very much alike.

But since you asked,

about love recently.

493
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,200
I think you just made up a friend.

494
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,060
You've been staying all day long at Young Master's Mansion lately.

495
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,160
How come you have other friends?

496
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,580
Is that friend you just mentioned

497
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,890
yourself?

498
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,590
Of course not!

499
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,580
I'm not interested in men!

500
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,260
Fine.

501
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,750
Then tell me.

502
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,390
What kind of difficulties

503
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,180
did your friend encounter?

504
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,500
My friend

505
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,600
has a low status.

506
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,110
But recently,

507
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,020
She was chased by a man in a high and powerful position.

508
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,440
Look,

509
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,180
their status gap is so big.

510
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,220
Can they be together?

511
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,640
You asked the right person!

512
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,040
Mismatch in status.

513
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,810
Read this book.

514
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,480

519
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,990
She still has a hard and unforgetable relationship

520
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,990
with the male protagonist.

521
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,540
In the end, she even becomes the Lady of her city.

522
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,380
Really?

523
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,210
What if the heroine

524
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,820
is poisoned and dying soon?

525
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,180
All the more reason for them to be together!

526
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,500
This book.

527
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,250
[So what if I go against heaven for you?]

528
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,170
So what if I go against heaven for you?

529
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,340
This book tells the touching story

530
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,740
of the heroine who was poisoned

531
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,670
by 18 kinds of poison,

532
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,330
but still

533
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,890
fell deep in love with the hero.

534
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:11,500
What if...

535
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,000
But this ending is a bit awful.

536
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:14,830
In the end,

537
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,240
the hero actually cured the heroine.

538
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,230
What if the heroine...

539
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,620
I have!

540
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,250
The male and female characters in these books

541
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,950
are all facing obstacles of money,

542
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,790
status, appearance, country,

543
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,130
and even species.

544
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,570
But they all end up happily together

545
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,870
with no exception.

546
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,270
Do your friend have

547
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
more problems than them?

548
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,650
No.

549
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,610
That's right.

550
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,680
You can talk to your friend later.

551
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,820
Life is short.

552
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,630
If she hesitates and misses her true love,

553
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,670
it will be a pity.

554
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,780
Yunxi is really

555
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,580
Luo Hexuan's sister?

556
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,400
If so,

557
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,950
Miss Yunxi has

558
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,420
a really rough life.

559
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,420
From now on,

560
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,910
I won't let anyone

561
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,860
hurt her anymore.

562
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,140
I don't understand.

563
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,270
Why don't you

564
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,020
just tell her that

565
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,270
Commander Xiao is the culprit

566
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,500
who killed her family?

567
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,660
Is your brain just an ornament?

568
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,410
By Yunxi's personality,

569
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,420
if she knows the truth,

570
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,380
she will definitely go after him

571
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,380
for revenge.

572
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,650
Isn't it like hitting a rock with an egg?

573
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,760
Besides,

574
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,900
the Luo family

575
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,850
died because of me.

576
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,240
If she knows all this,

577
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,320
she might be estranged from me.

578
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,710
The tragedy of Luo's family

579
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,900
was caused by Commander Xiao!

580
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,320
How can she blame it on you?

581
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,070
In my opinion,

582
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,940
Miss Yunxi is not

583
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,160
the unreasonable kind of person.

584
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,060
Sometimes I don't understand

585
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,060
why you are so stubborn.

586
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,670
Why must you save Luo Hexuan

587
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,420
and find out his background?

588
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,350
Just like now,

589
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,100
why can't you

590
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,220
just be your Young Master?

591
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,730
My father is so good to me.

592
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,510
I know

593
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,590
I'm not his biological son.

594
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,810
How can I just

595
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,910
let him to pass his crown on me?

596
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,500
Besides,

597
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,360
if I become the Master of Cangyue City,

598
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,150
my uncle will surely force me

599
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,810
to marry Fengyi.

600
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,290
By then,

601
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,030
Cangyue City

602
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,260
will be the Xiao's!

603
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,260
Young Master.

604
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,780
Young Master.

605
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,570
This is tranquilizing tea.

606
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,980
Take it and rest early.

607
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,830
You just recovered.

608
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Thank you, Steward Zhu.

609
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,700
Young Master.

610
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,180
Although

611
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,510
I was sent by the Master,

612
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,990
in my heart,

613
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,890
you are

614
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,920
my only master.

615
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,390
If you are in danger again,

616
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,220
please let me

617
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,220
help you.

618
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,940
I'll take my leave.

619
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:07,860
Young Master.

620
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,890
Steward Zhu is going to betray Master for you.

621
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,020
I think

622
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,100
after a long time,

623
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,680
we can always  have some feelings.

624
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,110
[Liaowu Mansion]

625
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,620
Tell me.

626
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,220
What if she rejects me again?

627
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,840
Will she find me annoying?

628
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,590
What if she moves out of my mansion out of rage?

629
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,590
What if she never talks to me again?

630
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,140
what should I do?

631
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,020
I'll talk to you.

632
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,020
No. No.

633
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:43,980
She can't just ignore me.

634
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,770
I'm so outstanding.

635
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,140
Where else can she find

636
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,340
such a perfect husband like me?

637
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,670
She must be shy last night.

638
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,380
Yes, she was just shy.

639
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,540
She is after all a girl.

640
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,260
Guard Tang.

641
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,260
Good Morning.

642
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,770
Have you had breakfast?

643
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,020
We can have some together.

644
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,680
Young Master.

645
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,010
How dare he ignore you?

646
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,230
I'll teach him a lesson now.

647
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,300
Calm down.

648
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,050
No.

649
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,300
He's disrespecting you.

650
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,020
In your mansion, how could he...

651
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,700
Are you stupid?

652
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,460
Tang Qing is Yunxi's little brother.

653
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,220
If I marry Yunxi,

654
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,090
then he will be my brother-in-law.

655
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,060
How could I offend

656
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,000
my future brother-in-law?

657
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,020
Bad news, Young Master!

658
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,070
This is crazy.

659
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,050
Yunxi made a scene in the prison!

660
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,370
I paid the fine.

661
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,250
Why don't you let me take him away?

662
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,370
Stop being unreasonable.

663
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,420
Paying the fine can only spare his life.

664
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,250
This kind of man

665
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,830
has to be in prison for a few years to learn some lessons.

666
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,380
Do you know

667
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,390
who I am?

668
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
How dare you say these things to me?

669
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,790
Judging from what you're wearing,

670
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,710
you are just an ordinary girl. Who could you be?

671
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,500
Do you know

672
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,380
my relationship with Young Master?

673
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,440
What relationship can you with him?

674
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,350
Are you his beauty?

675
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,660
Are you qualified?

676
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,780
Look carefully

677
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,620
when you go home to visit your ancestors' graves.

678
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,460
Is there any sign

679
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,860
above those graves?

680
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,380
Leave here now!

681
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,190
-I'm not leaving! -Leave now!

682
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,020
Young Master.

683
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,450
Young Master.

684
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:10,670
Are you alright?

685
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,570
-Greetings, Young Master. -Greetings, Young Master.

686
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,230
How dare you push my woman?

687
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,090
How dare you!

688
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,170
You...

689
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:20,800
Young Master.

690
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:21,870
Please forgive me!

691
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,060
I'm innocent.

692
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,130
That Qian Duojin,

693
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,500
pretended to be dead by smearing chicken blood on his body

694
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,300
to frame the demolition team

695
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,090
for compensation.

696
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,250
We were ordered to arrest him.

697
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,330
But this lady

698
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,660
asked us to release him.

699
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,280
Shut up!

700
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,200
Listen.

701
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,380
I'm here to back her up,

702
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,090
not  to enforce the law.

703
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:40,990
Remember,

704
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,670
she is my woman.

705
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,180
If you dare touch her,

706
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
I'll kick you to death.

707
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,280
Yes!

708
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,790
I know. I know.

709
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,090
Release that man!

710
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:52,920
Yes.

711
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,840
Hurry!

712
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,140
Give it to me.

713
00:29:59,340 --> 00:29:59,980
No.

714
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,580
This gentleman has an imposing appearance

715
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,140
and is so handsome.

716
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,640
You're not an ordinary person, right?

717
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,200
You're Young Master's guard,

718
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:11,660
right?

719
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,700
Aunt Xu is a fortune teller.

720
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,430
She said you may be with

721
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,740
a young master's guard.

722
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,680
Are you really with a guard?

723
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,750
Uncle Jin, don't talk nonsense.

724
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,780
He is the young master...

725
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,420
That's right.

726
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,250
I'm a guard in the Young Master's Mansion.

727
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,090
Leader of the guard.

728
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,720
Yunxi

729
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:29,990
is my friend.

730
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,320
Friend?

731
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,990
Would friends

732
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,180
flirt with each other?

733
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,190
Uncle Jin, look at your mouth.

734
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,060
It's injured.

735
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,430
Save some of your words.

736
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,420
Well,

737
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,400
I need to go back to Jianjia Alley.

738
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,570
Young Master, you...

739
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,030
Let me go back with you.

740
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,740
I happen to be free right now.

741
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,600
It's good

742
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,680
to experience

743
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,470
people's lives personally.

744
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:17,900
[Jianjia Alley]

745
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,820
It seems

746
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,940
the work of the Planning Room

747
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,210
is quite efficient.

748
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,120
It is efficient now

749
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,900
but please look at the people.

750
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,570
They are all woebegone.

751
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,260
They don't want to move at all.

752
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,660
Don't say these to him!

753
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,750
Let him press his fingerprint.

754
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,140
Hurry up!

755
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,120
Sir, what are you doing?

756
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,280
Uncle Liu.

757
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,060
Asking me to move is like

758
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,200
asking me to die.

759
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,140
-No, I won't move. -Uncle Liu.

760
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,180
Uncle Liu, are you alright?

761
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Yunxi, I'm fine.

762
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:35,830
Uncle Liu.

763
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,340
Who are you?

764
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,380
How dare you meddle in our business?

765
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,320
A passerby.

766
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,340
I meddle

767
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,350
because I don't like your way of doing business.

768
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,170
This is how you

769
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,860
persuade them to move?

770
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,300
What's going on?

771
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,470
How to do it is the rule set by the higher-ups.

772
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,700
We just follow the rules.

773
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,110
He's just a scoundrel.

774
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,110
He took demolition and relocation funds but refused to leave.

775
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,760
Sir,

776
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,670
the higher-ups asked us to move.

777
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,690
We can move.

778
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,480
But the fund

779
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,750
is only five liang.

780
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,930
They only give me five liang of silver for my whole family.

781
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,820
How can my whole family survive

782
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,600
with five liang of silver.

783
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,840
Not to mention building a house,

784
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,350
just living...

785
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,190
We

786
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,110
can't live on this money for long.

787
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:12,970
Don't be angry, Uncle Liu.

788
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,420
Only five liang.

789
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,670
Mr,

790
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,960
how many people are there in your family?

791
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,740
Seven.

792
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,340
Seven?

793
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,780
The Planning Room

794
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,880
has detailed rules for demolition compensation.

795
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,160
According to the headcount,

796
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
five liang per person.

797
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,350
Seven people shall

798
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,080
have 35 liang.

799
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,200
Why does this old man

800
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,210
only have five liang?

801
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,740
I don't need to explain to you how much money I gave him.

802
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,000
Don't ask for trouble.

803
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,460
It's so hot.

804
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,380
The dog's barking is so annoying.

805
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,570
Tang Qing, shut his mouth.

806
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,260
That's enough.

807
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,160
Don't kill him.

808
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,030
I'll listen to you and ask him to stop.

809
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:18,770
Tang Qing!
