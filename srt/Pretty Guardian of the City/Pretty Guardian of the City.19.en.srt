00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,570
Miss!

00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:56,620
-Help! -Help me!

6
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,030
Aunt!

7
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,540
Help me!

8
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,580
Go save Fengyi!

9
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,390
Yes! Go! Save her!

10
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,640
Go!

11
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,100
Siyan!

12
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,410
Help!

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,590
Si...

14
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,160
Cousin.

15
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,530
-Tang Qing. -It' s alright.

16
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,030
It's okay.

17
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,600
Miss Nangong.

18
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,940
Give me your hand.

19
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,100
Are you okay?

20
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,910
Mother tried so hard

21
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,360
to arrange such a play.

22
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,860
Don't you know

23
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,820
there's always a change in life.

24
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,290
Wuyan.

25
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,980
Let me give you a piece of advice.

26
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,850
Young Master is in a bad mood now.

27
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,700
You'd better not mess with him.

28
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,500
To be honest,

29
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:16,590
what you did this time

30
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,620
was too much.

31
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,050
Not only did you hurt Young Master,

32
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,420
but also me.

33
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,380
How did I hurt you?

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Why wasn't I on the list?

35
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,420
Am I not romantic

36
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,010
or not handsome?

37
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,600
Think about it.

38
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,540
You are Young Master's personal guard.

39
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,880
If you do something else,

40
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,620
and you get distracted,

41
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,970
who's gonna protect Young Master?

42
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,860
Am I right?

43
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,440
Sounds reasonable.

44
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,450
Can I go in now?

45
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,160
Young Master.

46
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,240
I have good news.

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,130
The beauty show has earned a lot of money.

48
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,790
Our problem has been solved.

49
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,100
It's my fault that

50
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:04,970
I didn't tell you before.

51
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,320
But it's nothing.

52
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,110
I'm just helping Miss Siyan

53
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,240
to protect Dr. Qi.

54
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,060
Young Master.

55
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,750
I've said so much,

56
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,100
but you still won't forgive me?

57
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,160
I'm leaving then.

58
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,140
I already apologized.

59
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,700
I know I was wrong.

60
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,850
I'll give a boat for Dr. Xian.

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,000
Can you make it up to me by apologizing?

62
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,140
Don't mind the process.

63
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:42,740
Do you realize?

64
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,100
We're rich now.

65
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,190
After paying off the refunds

66
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,140
of the rich officials,

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,600
we can still have a lot.

68
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,460
You're the biggest contributor

69
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,220
of the fundraising for the Futian Institution this time.

70
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,660
After Futian Institution is built,

71
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,810
I must pick

72
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,950
the brightest place

73
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,810
to build a memorial tablet for you.

74
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,180
It can bless you

75
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,090
both happiness and longevity.

76
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,580
If you had tried less tricks,

77
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,860
you wouldn't have gave a boat to another man

78
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,020
behind my back.

79
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,000
Yunxi, what's wrong?

80
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,420
There are many people today.

81
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,590
If grandpa knows

82
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,460
I help Chuxian to raise his value,

83
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,460
I will be punished.

84
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,070
Besides,

85
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,330
the Lady of Cangyue City is also here.

86
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,070
Chuxian and I are not supposed to

87
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,380
cause gossip.

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,330
What should we do?

89
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,970
That's easy.

90
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,580
I'll help you to save Dr. Xian.

91
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,080
Wouldn't that make everyone happy?

92
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,180
It's really not my fault.

93
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,700
I didn't expect

94
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,020
this would happen.

95
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,650
You're still so righteous.

96
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,190
Don't you feel

97
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,020
a little guilty?

98
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,540
Of course I do.

99
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,540
My heart aches for you.

100
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,140
But think about it.

101
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,120
It's 10,000 liang of gold.

102
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,830
How much can you do with it

103
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,820
for the people in South City?

104
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,510
Don't you think it's worth it?

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,220
I'm angry now.

106
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,270
Young Master.

107
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,740
Don't be angry, okay?

108
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,420
I know I was wrong.

109
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:09,960
Tell me.

110
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,580
How can you forgive me?

111
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,680
Don't act first and report later.

112
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,340
You must tell me everything beforehand.

113
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,250
So...

114
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,040
there can't be secrets between us.

115
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,200
Okay, I promise you.

116
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,310
Miss, it's getting late.

117
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,180
You should go to bed.

118
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,220
You may leave.

119
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,670
Yes.

120
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,790
Miss, it's Dr. Xian.

121
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,620
Miss, do you want to play the zither?

122
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,060
Miss.

123
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:26,170
♫The longing is mysterious like misty rain♫

124
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:32,650
♫Her tenderness stirs up deep and ceaseless affection♫

125
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,400
♫The oath is about to be spoken but stopped♫

126

♫Afraid that the dream will shatter♫

♫It' s hard to rewrite the ending even after half a lifetime of repentance♫

128

♫We meet in the fragrance of sweet-scented osmanthus as the rain knocks♫

♫The one with desire can’t help that the other does not reciprocate♫

131

♫Heartbreaking zither music fills my dream for the rest of my life♫

♫There is no cure for romantic longing that causes inconsolable heartache♫

♫Clearly interested but biased against the one with desire♫

134
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,420
Xi'er.

135
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,730
These days,

136
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,310
you've done your best

137
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,220
to raise money for Futian Institution.

138
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,780
With your achievements today,

139
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,410
you deserve all the credit.

140
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,440
Thank you, Father.

141
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,310
It's all thanks to my third brother

142
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,800
for completing the task.

143
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,280
He and I are united and

144
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,020
he is so capable.

145
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,240
He made a great contribution.

146
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,740
He has to be

147
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,800
the greatest contributor.

148
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:37,850
Fine.

149
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,530
I'm very pleased to see

150
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,860
you treat Xian'er so kindly.

151
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,740
In the future,

152
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,400
you two can get along well.

153
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,200
It's a good thing for him

154
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,450
to help you build Cangyue.

155
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,170
Everyone,

156
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,950
do you have anything else to discuss

157
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,420
today?

158
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,460
We don't have anything else.

159
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,060
Good.

160
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,970
In that case,

161
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,530
let's call it a day.

162
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,340
Farewell, Master.

163
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,340
Young Master.

164
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,780
Yes?

165
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,780
It's time to return the money.

166
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,620
Let's settle the accounts.

167
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,060
Yes.

168
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,850
With our relationship with Young Master,

169
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,140
the interest will be less.

170
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,620
Right?

171
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,740
That's right.

172
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,420
Today,

173
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,300
it's time

174
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,220
to settle accounts with you.

175
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,240
Here.

176
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,000
They are all here.

177
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,420
Okay.

178
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,100
Come on.

179
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,380
Here.

180
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,150
[Hubby Pay]

181
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,150
[My husband will pay for the 200 taels of silver I spent today.  A mere verbal statement is no guarantee. Take this as a proof.]

182
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,150
[Signature: Li Qianqin]

183
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,020
This...

184
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:49,780
This...

185
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,540
This...

186
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,320
How is this a promissory note?

187
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,230
Miss, don't worry.

188
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,060
There is a new way to pay

189
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,380
for this cruise.

190
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,630
Hubby Pay.

191
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,430
To put it bluntly,

192
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,530
it's just a promissory note.

193
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,160
But the promissory note

194
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,470
is not paied off by you.

195
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,150
Who will pay for it?

196
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,350
As long as you press a fingerprint

197
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,160
under the prepared promissory note,

198
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,950
your husbands

199
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,140
will pay for you.

200
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,670
Well...

201
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:10,540
Think about it.

202
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,630
Your husbands

203
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,060
throw out money relentlessly.

204
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,470
If you want your husbands' attention,

205
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,420
you have to let them spend money for you.

206
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,410
That makes sense.

207
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,410
I'll sign 600 taels first.

208
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:21,660
Me too.

209
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,620
Me too.

210
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,260
Me too.

211
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,030
Me too.

212
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,680
Look carefully.

213
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,670
Let me see yours.

214
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,140
This is the bill of Hubby Pay.

215
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,700
It records

216
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,440
the daily expenses

217
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,130
of your wives and daughters.

218
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,740
They all have fingerprints.

219
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,340
The amount is also marked.

220
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,100
See for yourself.

221
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,040
This doesn't make sense.

222
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,610
Come on.

223
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,460
Yes.

224
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,060
I've calculated

225
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,220
the amount of money on Hubby Pay

226
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,560
and it happens to offset

227
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,710
the amount of money

228
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,180
you require to refund.

229
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,600
There is even some left after paying off your refunds.

230
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,350
I will go to your mansions

231
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,040
to collect the money later.

232
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,250
What's going on?

233
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,270
What a sin!

234
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,420
Scoundrel!

235
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,820
Young Master,

236
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,180
Those women signed it out of mischief.

237
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,780
It can't be counted.

238
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,560
Yes.

239
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,090
Yes.

240
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,230
It can't be counted.

241
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,300
Don't.

242
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,020
Don't deny it.

243
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,830
Let me tell you.

244
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,310
I asked the local government

245
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,260
to supervise them.

246
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,850
These are all legitimate

247
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,950
according to the law of Cangyue.

248
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,460
Uncle.

249
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,380
Don't go.

250
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,800
It's all thanks to your advice

251
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,300
so that

252
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,420
the task was completed so well.

253
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,700
But don't worry.

254
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,700
I will return your donation

255
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,440
in private.

256
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,220
Nonsense.

257
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,820
There's no such repayment.

258
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,940
Didn't we discuss it?

259
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,470
I said once I'd raise donations

260
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,290
I would return the 5, 000 taels of silver

261
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,930
you donated.

262
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,830
No, no

263
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,510
How could you

264
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,460
speak so casually?

265
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,980
It will make the listeners misunderstand.

266
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,050
People will think

267
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,060
it was us

268
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,290
who set a trap

269
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,260
to deceive people.

270
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,500
Hurry up.

271
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,700
Explain to them.

272
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,580
It's my fault.

273
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,380
It's my fault.

274
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,070
I should have discussed it

275
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,980
in private.

276
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:10,800
However,

277
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,900
I'll keep my word.

278
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,640
I will definitely pay you back.

279
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:16,610
You...

280
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,150
This...

281
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:17,900
My lords,

282
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,230
how can we take back

283
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,330
the donation?

284
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,810
I've always been kind

285
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,720
and tried to do good deeds.

286
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,500
I never falsified.

287
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,430
The money...

288
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,330
I donate it all.

289
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:40,660
Thank you.

290
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:46,860
You see.

291
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,660
I was set up

292
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,710
by him

293
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,500
in meeting hall.

294
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,390
In general, Xi'er is a playboy

295
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,380
and doesn't care about politics.

296
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,660
I thought he was too playful.

297
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,930
But unexpectedly,

298
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,820
he didn't think about the consequences

299
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,850
How dare he hurt you?

300
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,440
No!

301
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,700
He

302
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,550
is not

303
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,130
as careless as before.

304
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,010
Even I can't handle

305
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,100
his succesive tricks.

306
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,380
I knew

307
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,220
there was something wrong with him.

308
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,470
I didn't expect him to be

309
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,300
more and more disobedient.

310
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,850
I'm also worried about this.

311
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,620
I wanted to arrange his marriage with Fengyi

312
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,780
as soon as possible.

313
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,850
At the beauty show yesterday,

314
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,350
I especially made a play

315
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,860
for the hero to save the beauty.

316
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,790
I wanted to cater to the "three rescue",

317
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,130
and let Xi'er marry her.

318
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,120
But unexpectedly,

319
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,720
Xi'er excaped from it.

320
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,490
What was the use of your arrangement?

321
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,460
He still dares to disobey

322
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,460
you and Master.

323
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,700
Now,

324
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,020
let's think of another way.

325
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,500
Before Xi'er

326
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,720
getting out of our control,

327
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,790
we can strangle this wild horse

328
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,510
with one move.

329
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,570
That's hilarious.

330
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,330
Stop.

331
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,350
Let me tell you.

332
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,760
Young Master has suffered a lot this time.

333
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,040
Once he went aboard the boat

334
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,910
with that Fatty Du,

335
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,690
she ran after Young Master,

336
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,720
and wanted to be close to him.

337
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,020
He was scared and hid around.

338
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,940
Later, he used

339
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,650
a slight step.

340
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,680
But that Fatty Du is too heavy.

341
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,350
The tip of the boat

342
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,270
went straight upward.

343
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,180
Young Master fell into the water

344
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,570
by surprise.

345
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,360
All right.

346
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,500
It's all in the past. Let's not talk about it.

347
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,480
By the way, third brother,

348
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,750
the problem in Futian Institution

349
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,460
has been solved.

350
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,390
Father praised you

351
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:38,930
in the meeting hall.

352
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:39,950
Why are you still

353
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,740
not happy?

354
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,500
Is it because of Miss Nangong?

355
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,100
It's all my fault.

356
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,060
It was so dangerous,

357
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,620
but I couldn't save her.

358
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,330
But it was not your fault.

359
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,890
It was an emergency,

360
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,580
and you were so far away from her,

361
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,420
Right?

362
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,560
Why are you so worried

363
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,230
about Nangong Siyan?

364
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,310
Since when

365
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,220
you two become so close?

366
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,240
Miss.

367
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,230
Everyone knows

368
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,340
the affection

369
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,760
between Dr. Xian and Miss Nangong.

370
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,640
You're the only one who doesn't know.

371
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,030
And you always bully her.

372
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,140
So you two are a couple.

373
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,580
Yes.

374
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,860
That's why

375
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,820
you've gone too far

376
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
to treat Miss Nangong that way.

377
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,110
You should have told me earlier.

378
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,210
By the way,

379
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,150
you two are a perfect match.

380
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,910
You also speaks like a book.

381
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,210
I don't understand.

382
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,800
I really don't understand.

383
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:35,740
All right.

384
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,700
Let's not talk about this.

385
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,150
This time,

386
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,020
we did something big together.

387
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:39,690
Tonight,

388
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,980
we should celebrate it.

389
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:41,700
Come.

390
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:42,530
Cheers.

391
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,780
Cheers.

392
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,150
Cheers.

393
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,750
We did

394
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,980
a meaningful thing together,

395
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,270
Everyone is happy.

396
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,900
Why are you still pulling a long face?

397
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,609
I've been like this since I was a kid.

398
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,619
I don't like to smile.

399
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,470
Nonsense.

400
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,150
Every time when you are with Yunxi,

401
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,760
you can smile very happily.

402
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,780
Look.

403
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,450
You're not talking again.

404
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,380
But I like

405
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,260
talking to you

406
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,030
and sharing my joy with you.

407
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,460
Today,

408
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,150
I have another happy thing to share with you.

409
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,740
Nangong Siyan

410
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,860
will never steal my cousin from me again.

411
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,340
Is Jiang Chaoxi that nice?

412
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,060
You like him that much?

413
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,380
That's different.

414
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,820
I'm worried that someone will steal my cousin away.

415
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,830
It's not because I like him.

416
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,820
Since I was young,

417
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,300
my father

418
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
said that I would be the Lady of Cangyue.

419
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,770
No one can take this place away from me.

420
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,310
Why are you so good-looking?

421
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,860
It would be great

422
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,720
if I didn't have to be the Lady of Cangyue.

423
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,700
Then I can marry you.

424
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,300
Miss,

425
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,990
you'd better drink less in the future.

426
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,410
You're talking nonsense.

427
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,940
Although I am loose-lipped,

428
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,730
I never talk nonsense.

429
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,510
I say what I think in my heart.

430
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,660
Every day with you

431
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,540
is a good day.

432
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,640
Promise me.

433
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,580
You'll be happy every day.

434
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,170
I promise you.

435
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,620
We will be together forever.

436
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,900
I always thought

437
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,020
I was carefree

438
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,940
and didn't care about anything.

439
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,790
But now,

440
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,860
I'm reluctant to leave.

441
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't want to leave the world.

442
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,440
And I don't want to leave you even more.

443
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,080
Your body...

444
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,050
Fighting fire with fire

445
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,260
no longer helps.

446
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,670
So, don't use it again.

447
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,770
Isn't that ridiculous?

448
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,590
I was already ready

449
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,700
to die.

450
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,790
But at the last moment,

451
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,660
I get cold feet.

452
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,680
I really regret it.

453
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,340
I knew I was going to die,

454
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,300
but I still fell in love with Young Master.

455
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,530
It just makes me not want to leave this world even more.

456
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,570
When love is at hand,

457
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,480
one can't help it.

458
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,800
Sometimes,

459
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,950
I really envy you.

460
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,830
Although your life is about to end,

461
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,780
you are brave enough to love

462
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,820
at the last moment.

463
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,170
But what about me?

464
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,850
I couldn't even save my love

465
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,350
when she was in danger.

466
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,870
Which woman doesn't want the person she loves

467
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,420
to be her side

468
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,810
when things go wrong?

469
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,270
You might as well sincerely

470
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,220
apologize to her.

471
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,240
Miss Nangong is sensible

472
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,740
and has a deep love for you.

473
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,460
I'm sure she won't be too harsh on you.

474
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,040
But I have let her down

475
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,910
too many times.

476
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,190
Then you have even more reasons

477
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,940
to apologize to her.

478
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,810
It's not about the forgiveness,

479
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,270
but let her see

480
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,180
that you care about her.

481
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,490
Master.

482
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,290
There's news from Young Master's Mansion.

483
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,330
[Luo Hexuan is hiding in Young Master's Mansion]

484
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,460
What?

485
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,570
Luo Hexuan is hidden in Young Master's Mansion?

486
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,250
What are you doing?

487
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,900
Acting like this in broad daylight.

488
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,590
If others saw you,

489
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,660
they would make fun of you again.

490
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
I just passed by the garden

491
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,380
and saw the beautiful flowers.

492
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,980
They remind me of you.

493
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:11,750
Thank you.

494
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,070
Why are you sweating so much?

495
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,650
You don't look well either.

496
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,040
Are you not feeling well again?

497
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:23,970
I'm fine.

498
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,250
I'm just tired

499
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,000
of drawing design maps.

500
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,980
Don't worry.

501
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,820
How can I not worry?

502
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,790
Should I call a doctor for you?

503
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,220
No need.

504
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,070
I'll be fine after some rest.

505
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,390
How about

506
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,510
you hold me while we lie down for a while?

507
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,450
Yunxi,

508
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,750
how about I...

509
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,260
Say no more.

510
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,220
Just hold me.

511
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,640
Our umbrella.

512
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,100
Miss.

513
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,910
What are you waiting for?

514
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,280
Take it!

515
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:10,920
Come on.

516
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,760
One, two, three.

517
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:14,670
Again.

518
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,040
One, two, three.

519
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,190
One, two, three.

520
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,540
Get in the carriage now.

521
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,450
In case you catch a cold.

522
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,650
Thank you, Young Master.

523
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,540
Take it.

524
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,010
Let's go.

525
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,560
Miss, let's get in the carriage.

526
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:42,740
Miss!

527
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,410
Okay.

528
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,240
Just now it was sunny.

529
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,780
Why suddenly it rained?

530
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,830
We can't make it to the temple.

531
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,140
So we have to go back now.

532
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,360
I feel sorry for you, Miss.

533
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,550
You were drenched.

534
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,470
Luckily, the young master showed up in time.

535
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,990
He hold an umbrella for you

536
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,060
and push our carriage for you.

537
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,780
He knows how to cherish a girl!

538
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,070
Don't talk nonsense.

539
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,450
What I said is true.

540
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,380
I think

541
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,920
among his brothers,

542
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,380
the young master is the best.

543
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,080
Not only is he handsome,

544
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,100
but he is also meticulous and decisive.

545
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,820
Compared to him,

546
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,100
even the gentlest Mr. Xian

547
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,560
seems a little indecisive.

548
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:30,990
Huayuan!

549
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,740
Don't talk about others behind their backs!

550
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,160
Yes.

551
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,810
[Nangong's Mansion]

552
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,540
Miss.

553
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,730
Dr. Xian is here.

554
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,140
Siyan.

555
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,150
That day,

556
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,010
I couldn't save you.

557
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,010
I was wrong.

558
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,940
You know,

559
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,660
I didn't have a choice...

560
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,100
No.

561
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,080
You have a choice.

562
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,870
It's just that your every choice

563
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,740
is to give up on me.

564
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:26,700
How could I...

565
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,440
Siyan, I won't give up on you.

566
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,030
You know

567
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,800
I have my reasons.

568
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,460
Reasons?

569
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,050
You have your reasons every time.

570
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,090
I've had enough.

571
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,230
I don't want to give myself up

572
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,920
to understand you.

573
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,860
That day, the Lady of Cangyue City was there too.

574
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,210
If I save you

575
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,020
before my brother,

576
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,580
my mother...

577
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,770
My mother will be punished by Her Ladyship.

578
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,820
Your mother again?

579
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,710
Since your whole heart is for your mother,

580
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,850
why do you come to me?

581
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,350
I think I should be grateful for falling off the building.

582
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,510
Otherwise,

583
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,180
I still wouldn't be able to see

584
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,540
what a coward you are.

585
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,740
Look at Young Master.

586
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,280
He is so determined

587
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,170
to go to Yunxi.

588
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,960
As long as you had

589
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,590
a little of his courage,

590
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,860
we wouldn't be like this now.

591
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,640
Siyan!

592
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,210
Siyan.

593
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,270
I understand what you mean.

594
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,180
I swear to you.

595
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,020
In the future,

596
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,310
I will become

597
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,230
someone like my big brother

598
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,790
to protect and shield the woman

599
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,540
I love.

600
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,580
I won't let you suffer anymore.

601
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,090
OK?

602
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,780
I don't need it anymore.

603
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,330
From now on,

604
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,710
I won't put my hopes

605
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,900
on you anymore.

606
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,670
Everything we had in the past,

607
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,150
just take it as

608
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,530
a dream.

609
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,010
Siyan!

610
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,660
Chairman.

611
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,930
I thought

612
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,570
you and Siyan grew up together

613
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,650
and have been together for years.

614
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,030
Let's not talk about daily things.

615
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,420
But when she was in danger,

616
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,810
you would always stand up for her.

617
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,370
I really didn't expect you

618
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,150
to be such a coward!

619
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,510
You have always been against us.

620
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,900
Now that you have what you want,

621
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,900
you don't have to hit me when I'm down.

622
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,230
I'm glad

623
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,540
I've been against you!

624
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,620
Do I have to

625
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,800
give my precious granddaughter

626
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,430
to a man,

627
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,020
an indecisive man, like you?

628
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,620
You can't even protect

629
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,660
the woman you love.

630
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,160
I think you won't achieve anything great

631
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,450
in your life.

632
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,590
Young Master.

633
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,680
Young Master, drink this ginger soup

634
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,350
and warm yourself up.

635
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,620
Wuyan!

636
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,030
Why did you let the young master get drenched

637
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,180
after going out?

638
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,270
How did you serve him?

639
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,880
It was the young master who was kind

640
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,220
and gave Miss Nangong the umbrella.

641
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,300
I got wet too.

642
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,400
Why are you so delicate?

643
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,790
Should I just

644
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,100
watch a girl to get wet in the rain?

645
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,860
By the way, where is Yunxi?

646
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,500
She is talking

647
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,500
with Guard Tang.

648
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,570
Guard Tang?

649
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,230
Why can she talk

650
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,300
to everyone except me?

651
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,660
You said Commander Xiao

652
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,900
has hidden the Swing Painting somewhere else?

653
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,820
I've searched carefully

654
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,780
for the mechanism you mentioned.

655
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,030
There was nothing wrong about it.

656
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,960
I'm afraid we have alerted him

657
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,160
and he hid the painting somewhere else.

658
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,430
One more thing.

659
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,350
What is it?

660
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,750
I've searched

661
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,360
all the files of the Supervision Army.

662
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,740
I finally found a lead

663
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,370
about the Luo family's tragedy.

664
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,660
The person who reported your father's corruption

665
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,400
was his only disciple.

666
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,290
Song Qing.

667
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,670
Are you sure?

668
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,680
I've verified it.

669
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,230
And after what happened to your family,

670
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,560
Song Qing

671
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,760
was promoted to be

672
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,700
the head of the Planning Room by Commander Xiao.

673
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,050
So,

674
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,750
the one who framed my father was Song Qing?

675
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,420
Then he set up

676
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,180
my father's suicide too?

677
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,060
Not necessarily.

678
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,350
At that time,

679
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,580
he was just a minor officer

680
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,120
in the Planning Room.

681
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,570
He was not that capable.

682
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,340
According to the investigator

683
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,120
from the Supervision Guard,

684
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,690
the Luo family's tragedy

685
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,900
was most likely caused by

686
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,860
intentional poisoning.

687
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,970
The investigator

688
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,040
had doubts about the cause of your family's death,

689
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,280
but he died in an accident.

690
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,250
But Commander Xiao

691
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,000
suppressed these doubts

692
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:52,990
and closed the case hastily.

693
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,870
To be concluded,

694
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,010
the mastermind behind this

695
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,910
should be Commander Xiao.

696
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,590
It's him.

697
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,890
He not only put my brother

698
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,560
in a coma

699
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,140
but also killed my parents.

700
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,180
If I don't take revenge,

701
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,850
I will be a disgrace to our family.

702
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,340
Yunxi,

703
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,440
calm down.

704
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,350
You know

705
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,270
the Xiao Mansion is heavily guarded.

706
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,830
If you go to him like this, you'll die.

707
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,320
How can I calm down?

708
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,510
Xiao Huasheng

709
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,180
destroyed my family!

710
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,620
I can't wait to

711
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,780
cut him into pieces!

712
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,700
Qing.

713
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,050
If you stop me,

714
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,280
don't blame me for turning against you!

715
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:27,460
Yunxi,

716
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,980
since you have made up your mind,

717
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,960
I'll go with you.

718
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,340
Now is not the good time

719
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,660
to kill Xiao Huasheng.

720
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,620
Don't do anything stupid.
