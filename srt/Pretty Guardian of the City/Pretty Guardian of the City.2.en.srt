4
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,729
Young Master,

5
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,870
I applied

6
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,910
to be your surveyor.

7
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,150
Not your pretty girl who idles around with you.

8
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,940
Tell me.

9
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,270
Why do you

10
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,740
want to get close to me?

11
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,390
You tried so hard to stay around me.

12
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,060
That's fine.

13
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,330
Now you want to be my girl?

14
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,500
Did you just call yourself a pretty girl?

15
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,650
You're just a girl.

16
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,860
Have I

17
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,890
passed the test or not?

18
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,500
If he goes back on his word,

19
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,420
it'll be hard for us to meet again.

20
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,570
See?

21
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,570
You're trying to cozy up to me again.

22
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,400
Seems that you are determined

23
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,440
to be my girl.

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,550
Young Master, you misunderstood.

25
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,510
I...

26
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,870
I've seen

27
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,980
too many women like you

28
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,520
who played hard to get.

29
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,880
I have to please him

30
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,590
so I can stay around him.

31
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,540
Young Master,

32
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,350
I can't help but be drawn

33
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,580
to your manly chest.

34
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,590
So, Young Master,

35
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,070
please try not to be so charming

36
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,240
in front of me.

37
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,570
That's my fault?

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,060
Judging from what she said,

39
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,490
it's your fault, Young Master.

40
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,910
Did I talk to you?

41
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,180
You didn't,

42
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,160
but that doesn't change what she meant.

43
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,090
I love whatever she says.

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,850
All right. You passed the test.

45
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,790
Thank you, Young Master.

46
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,230
I will devote myself

47
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,890
to you and Cangyue City.

48
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,180
Jiang Chaoxi,

49
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,140
after I get in your house,

50
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,660
I'll eventually find a chance

51
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,490
to kill you without anyone knowing.

52
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:36,980
Go back.

53
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,260
Come to my mansion tomorrow.

54
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,420
Thank you, Young Master.

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,140
Check her background.

56
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,640
Don't miss any details.

57
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,670
I wonder

58
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,450
how Ham is doing now.

59
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,650
Don't worry.

60
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,820
Ham

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,580
must have gone out for fun.

62
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,110
It's spring now.

63
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,420
All living things have come back to life.

64
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,000
Young Master.

65
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,120
Young Master,

66
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,550
the Western Region just sent

67
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,250
some honey melons as tribute.

68
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,940
I'll go get some

69
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,829
to feed Bacon.

70
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,460
He is quite smart.

71
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,200
Unluckily, he works for my father.

72
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,940
You got anything to say?

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,950
I've figured it out.

74
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,850
Yunxi came from Jianjia Alley in the south of the city.

75
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,670
Her parents died young. She's an orphan.

76
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,080
She lives with

77
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,740
other homeless people.

78
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,240
She lives off selling maps.

79
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,970
So we live

80
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,940
in different worlds.

81
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,830
I don't remember

82
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,880
offending her.

83
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,590
Why did she want to kill me?

84
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,740
She was the assassin?

85
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,460
I'll go kill her now.

86
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,870
Why are you

87
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,350
as stupid as this pig?

88
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,490
I knew she was the assassin,

89
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,470
but I gave her the chance

90
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,320
to get close to me.

91
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,200
Do you think I did that for fun?

92
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,810
Then why did you do that?

93
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,640
The scent of medicine on her

94
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,680
is familiar to me.

95
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,710
After she comes here,

96
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,400
keep an eye on her.

97
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,110
Yes.

98
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,390
My name is Zhu Wen.

99
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,940
I'm the chief steward of this mansion.

100
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,770
Miss Yunxi,

101
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,040
just call me Steward Zhu.

102
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,190
If you need anything

103
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,980
in the future,

104
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,020
just let me know.

105
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,940
Thank you, Steward Zhu.

106
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,250
I knew people here were not to be underestimated.

107
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,110
Thank god I didn't rush into anything.

108
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,630
Pepper.

109
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,890
Steward Zhu,

110
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,030
what are you doing here?

111
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,200
This is Miss Yunxi,

112
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,590
the surveyor Young Master hired

113
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,150
to help him build Cangyue City.

114
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,660
She'll live with you.

115
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,290
No problem.

116
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,500
I'll take care of her. Don't worry.

117
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,840
Are you really a surveyor

118
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,220
coming here to help build Cangyue City?

119
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,270
Yeah.

120
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,100
I passed

121
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,940
test after test to be here.

122
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,450
What does Young Master see in you?

123
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,700
Talent.

124
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,270
Liar.

125
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,380
Be honest with me.

126
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,800
Have you fallen in love with Young Master?

127
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,310
Being his surveyor is just an excuse

128
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:47,780
to approach him, right?

129
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,900
Fall in love with him?

130
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,360
How is that possible?

131
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,060
How is that impossible?

132
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,270
Young Master

133
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,580
is so eye-catching

134
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,790
and handsome.

135
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,970
He's an excellent man.

136
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,740
Of course you would fall in love with him.

137
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,370
Fine.

138
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,790
I've fallen in love.

139
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,400
You...

140
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,030
How could you have

141
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,360
such dangerous feelings?

142
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,990
Young Master is not someone you can covet.

143
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,620
Then should I fall in love

144
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,640
or not?

145
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,920
You're wrong either way.

146
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,480
Young Master

147
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,960
is the eagle in the sky.

148
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,350
And you

149
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,360
are nothing but a worm on the ground.

150
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,070
You must always revere

151
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,340
Young Master.

152
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:24,930
Understand?

153
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,430
Don't worry.

154
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,950
I know

155
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,730
Young Master is beyond my reach.

156
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:31,950
By the way,

157
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,590
I don't know

158
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,480
what your job is.

159
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:35,540
Me?

160
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,080
I'm not bragging,

161
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,190
but I am

162
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,350
Young Master's favorite baker.

163
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,950
I've chatted with you for so long.

164
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,470
I need to go back to make desserts

165
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,290
for Young Master.

166
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,290
How is it going today?

167
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,080
I could only have him drink half of the soup in the bowl.

168
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,300
If it goes on like this,

169
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,180
the ginseng soup

170
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,610
won't be able to

171
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,450
bring this dying man back.

172
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,290
It seems

173
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,570
that only Fengchi can wake him up.

174
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,080
The doctor said

175
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,460
we can force him to be awake

176
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,210
for about five minutes.

177
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,910
It'll be enough for you

178
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,770
to find out your parentage.

179
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,070
-Why… -Don't mention it again.

180
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,830
I want to find out

181
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,660
my parentage,

182
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,470
but I can not

183
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,940
let Luo Hexuan's life be the cost.

184
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,140
Lord Luo.

185
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,299
Lord Luo.

186
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,870
Where are you?

187
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,809
Besides,

188
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,280
if it weren't for me,

189
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,900
the Luo family wouldn't have been...

190
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,250
Besides Fengchi,

191
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,190
keep looking for

192
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,060
Luo Hexuan's sister.

193
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,380
I owe them this.

194
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,140
Yes, Young Master.

195
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,210
Yunxi.

196
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,870
Pepper.

197
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,240
Aren't you baking

198
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:08,760
for Young Master?

199
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,500
Why are you here?

200
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,610
I'm done.

201
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,980
I'm about to send this to Young Master.

202
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:13,820
What a coincidence.

203
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,900
I'm going to see Young Master about work.

204
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,830
Let me bring it to him.

205
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,020
Don't bother.

206
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,170
I'm not bothered.

207
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,760
Pepper,

208
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,010
you can see Young Master

209
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:23,890
every day.

210
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,930
Please give this chance to me.

211
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,590
We are good friends, aren't we?

212
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,590
You said

213
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,380
you would take care of me.

214
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,790
We're not good friends.

215
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,920
I don't even know you well.

216
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,010
Pepper.

217
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,790
Please.

218
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,470
Okay.

219
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,760
I'll help you just once.

220
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,550
It won't happen again.

221
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,010
Go. Fetch the ball.

222
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,030
Young Master ordered you to fetch the ball.

223
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,080
How could you let Wuyan

224
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,830
fetch the ball?

225
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,580
Greetings, Young Master.

226
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,450
I'm here to discuss with you

227
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,200
my duty.

228
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,650
You recruited me.

229
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,510
I need to do my job.

230
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,380
Young Master,

231
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,180
do you have any work for me?

232
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,350
You're right.

233
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,570
I didn't hire you to sit about in my mansion.

234
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,660
Great.

235
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,250
Planning Room has been busy

236
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,190
designing the water supply

237
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,210
and sewage system of the city.

238
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,590
What's your opinion?

239
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,680
First, we should build

240
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,820
more ditches in the city

241
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,780
to make clean water available.

242
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,010
The sewage system should be built underground.

243
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,650
What's more…

244
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,120
Stop.

245
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,330
I don't want to hear the details.

246
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,560
These things give me a headache.

247
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,060
You just

248
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,880
go back to your room and draw the drafts.

249
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,110
If they are feasible,

250
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,380
I'll order someone to work on them.

251
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,090
Yes, Young Master.

252
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,390
Young Master,

253
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,340
I brought you desserts.

254
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,770
Try them when they are hot.

255
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,460
Young Master,

256
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,140
they won't taste good if they get cold.

257
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,140
Eat them now.

258
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,340
Bacon, try this.

259
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:25,430
Young Master,

260
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,790
these desserts were made for you.

261
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,260
How can you give them to a pig?

262
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,050
What are you talking about?

263
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,190
These desserts

264
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,770
were specially made for the pig.

265
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,420
Look at the shape of them.

266
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,410
They're for the pig!

267
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,550
Pepper should've told me about it.

268
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,500
If Bacon dies,

269
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,990
Jiang Chaoxi will be alert.

270
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,380
Here.

271
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,860
Bacon, good boy.

272
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,550
Have some desserts.

273
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,630
Bacon, good boy.

274
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,380
Eat it.

275
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,830
Sorry, Young Master.

276
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,670
It's all my fault.

277
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,480
I'm so clumsy.

278
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,980
You meant it, didn't you?

279
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,610
You're looking at me so lewdly.

280
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,590
How dare you

281
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,640
covet your Young Master?

282
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,750
I...

283
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,380
Young Master, I need to correct you.

284
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,530
What I covet is the dessert.

285
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,510
It's a new stunt I learned for you.

286
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,560
It's called…

287
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,690
Bloody Romance.

288
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,650
Yeah, Bloody Romance.

289
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,520
If there's nothing else,

290
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,630
I'll take my leave.

291
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,400
Fate is unpredictable.

292
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,210
The poison of heartburn makes

293
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,320
any other poison less fatal.

294
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,840
Or I would've been dead.

295
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,540
I know you were expecting

296
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,960
someone else.

297
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,820
Sorry to disappoint you.

298
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,380
You're dressed in such a bright color.

299
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,270
Before I came close,

300
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,430
I thought you were a girl.

301
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,820
Get changed.

302
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,200
Get rid of those pink clothes.

303
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,120
No.

304
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,460
Yunxi likes

305
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,400
me wearing pink clothes.

306
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,100
But she's not here.

307
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,260
Why don't you sneak into

308
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,490
the Young Master's Residence to see her?

309
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,030
So you don't have to take it out

310
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,130
on these stones.

311
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,350
It's fine if you don't wanna go.

312
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,480
You'll only get in her way of finding a good husband.

313
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,250
Aunt!

314
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,460
I'm leaving.

315
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,010
Jiang Chaoxi,

316
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,600
in three days,

317
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,350
you will die quietly

318
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,280
without anyone knowing.

319
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,290
And I

320
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,990
will leave unscathed.

321
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,070
Why hasn't he gone to bed?

322
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,230
The pills can only kick in

323
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,260
when he's asleep.

324
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,220
Young Master,

325
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,060
there are so many drafts.

326
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,850
I'm afraid you can't

327
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,630
finish reading them any time soon.

328
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,270
Why don't you…

329
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,780
Time is ticking. There's lots of work to do.

330
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,100
Even if I have to stay up all night,

331
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,330
I'll finish reading them.

332
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,240
How about this?

333
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,500
Tonight,

334
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,660
I'll stay here with you.

335
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,540
No need!

336
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,350
I'll skim through them myself.

337
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,060
Skim through?

338
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,660
How dare you be so irresponsible?

339
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,260
Sorry.

340
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,550
I mean,

341
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,860
I will review all the drafts

342
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,330
carefully.

343
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,100
Forget it.

344
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,610
I'll go back to sleep.

345
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,140
Jiang Chaoxi,

346
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,260
in three days,

347
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,070
you'll find yourself in the netherworld.

348
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,740
Yunxi.

349
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:46,500
Yunxi.

350
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,890
Slow down.

351
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,350
Why are you dressed so?

352
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,800
Do you know how conspicuous you are in the dark?

353
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,300
I just want to see you.

354
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,050
No one has noticed you yet.

355
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,510
Leave now.

356
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,090
How are you doing here?

357
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,050
Has anyone messed with you?

358
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,099
Have you felt uncomfortable again?

359
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,380
Don't worry.

360
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,930
I'm having a good time here.

361
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,660
No one dares to mess with me.

362
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:08,700
I'm so worried.

363
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:09,569
Go back with me.

364
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,200
I eat meat and desserts

365
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,030
every meal here.

366
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,420
If I go back,

367
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,349
I'll be busy running around

368
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,970
for the people in Jianjia Alley.

369
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:16,910
I won't leave.

370
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,410
I'm fine here.

371
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:19,650
Liar.

372
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,599
You just want to kill Jiang Chaoxi, right?

373
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,960
I'll kill him for you now.

374
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,339
We're all adults.

375
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,540
Don't be so impulsive.

376
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,540
Besides,

377
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,430
there's no problem

378
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,260
that can't be solved with money.

379
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,620
I work here.

380
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,790
He pays me every day.

381
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,630
It's great.

382
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,230
You're lying again.

383
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,620
By the way,

384
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,750
it's time for you to shoulder

385
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,020
the burden of taking care of Jianjia Alley.

386
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,300
Making money to support the family

387
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,340
can't be done only by talking.

388
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,040
You need to do something practical.

389
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:42,920
I...

390
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,620
I can make money myself.

391
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,170
I can escort goods with caravans.

392
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,280
I can also deliver letters.

393
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,550
I can afford

394
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,340
the whole Jianjia Alley

395
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,760
and you.

396
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,430
Okay.

397
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,300
Then prove it to me

398
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,380
with practical actions.

399
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,430
Okay.

400
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,830
The medicine should be working.

401
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,590
Young Master.

402
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,230
You're quite diligent.

403
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,830
Please have a seat.

404
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,630
Young Master, are you feeling unwell?

405
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,090
I'm sleepy.

406
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,390
You worry about the country and the people

407
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,020
and work hard

408
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,560
to build the Cangyue City day and night.

409
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,870
I feel inspired.

410
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,460
You're quite good.

411
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,910
You know mapping,

412
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:06,900
planning,

413
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,930
feng shui

414
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,530
and how to flatter others.

415
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,880
All of my words are sincere.

416
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,580
It's annoying to hear too much flattering.

417
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,030
Have you finished

418
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,820
the plan of water diversion and sewage discharge?

419
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,070
Tell me about it.

420
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,420
As for water,

421
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,470
we can dig

422
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,020
more artificial rivers inside the city.

423
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,670
It can solve

424
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,610
people's difficulties in using water.

425
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,170
As for pollution,

426
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,140
we can dig more drainage ditches.

427
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,410
The ponding in the ditches

428
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,230
will finally flow into

429
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,540
the Zhaohe River in the west of Cangyue City.

430
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,270
With the help of the terrain high in the east and low in the west,

431
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,700
we can quickly get the ponding out of Cangyue City.

432
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,720
Then

433
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,570
how can you drain off water

434
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,740
where it is inconvenient to dig ditches?

435
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,580
Please have a look.

436
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,700
I've marked it here.

437
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,480
We can dig a drainage culvert

438
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,680
like a shaft.

439
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,860
Young Master.

440
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,580
You may leave now.

441
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,700
Young Master.

442
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,750
Commander Xiao is using the demolition of the city

443
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,420
to count the population.

444
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,550
He seems to be looking for

445
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,500
Luo Hexuan.

446
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,470
Brother.

447
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,030
He has spent eight years looking for a Fengchi

448
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,940
with a sheer waste of energy and money.

449
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,460
I just don't get it.

450
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,540
Why must he seek immortality?

451
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,780
Now Luo Hexuan

452
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,110
is unconscious here,

453
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,710
and his sister is missing.

454
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,510
We've completely lost

455
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,620
the clue of Fengchi.

456
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,550
My brother is not dead.

457
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:34,820
Who's outside?

458
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,320
Pig!

459
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:06,950
Young Master.

460
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,880
I'm drying your pillow.

461
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,220
But it's cloudy.

462
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,940
Young Master, there's something you don't know.

463
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,390
Cloudy or sunny,

464
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,860
it's actually based on

465
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,580
how much

466
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,870
the clouds block the sun.

467
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,140
But the effect is the same.

468
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,420
You are so noble.

469
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,070
Your health also concerns

470
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,060
the whole mansion.

471
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,180
I care about your health.

472
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,350
It's a responsibility I cannot relinquish

473
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,160
and I'm at my service around your horse.

474
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,810
There is a full-time maid

475
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,690
responsible for drying my pillow.

476
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,170
You don't have to

477
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,400
worry about it.

478
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,000
How can a maid know how to dry the pillow?

479
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,580
A maid doesn't know the Eight Diagrams of Yin and Yang

480
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,460
and feng shui.

481
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,330
You need to put the pillow in the correct direction

482
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,530
when drying it.

483
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,900
Once the direction is wrong,

484
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,040
it not only doesn't work,

485
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,730
but also will backfire.

486
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,790
Nonsense.

487
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,250
♫I like being behind you♫

488
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:39,110
♫Even the evening wind has become very gentle♫

489
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:47,520
♫The feeling of happiness bit by bit♫

490
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,430
You...

491
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,010
What are you doing?

492
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,720
♫Time seems to be stopped♫

493
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,110
I'm afraid you'll feel uncomfortable

494
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:51,880
to inhale these silk cotton.

495
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,470
Don't you feel I will feel bad

496
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,840
if you press on me like this?

497
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:07,880
Tell me.

498
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,020
Why did you

499
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,790
steal my pillow?

500
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,230
I...

501
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,360
Of course I care about you.

502
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,040
I want to get along with you day and night.

503
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,650
I stole a pillow because I missed you so much.

504
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,520
You want to get to the bottom of the matter,

505
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,620
but you really don't know my feelings.

506
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:41,900
Young Master.

507
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,080
Are you okay?

508
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,660
I'm fine.

509
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,180
What's the matter?

510
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:53,860
Young Master.

511
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,050
What exactly is going on

512
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,390
with Yunxi?

513
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,890
Didn't she want to kill you?

514
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,460
Why did she destroy

515
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,420
the pillows with medicine?

516
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,880
Listen,

517
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,620
it's rare for me to meet

518
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,590
such an interesting person.

519
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,620
A toad needs to be boiled in warm water.

520
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:07,610
Understand?

521
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,440
Cousin.

522
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,760
Cousin.

523
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,780
I'm back.

524
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,290
Why is Fengyi back?

525
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,870
Let's go! Hurry up!

526
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,290
Cousin.

527
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,260
What are you doing?

528
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:20,780
Go away!

529
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,050
Cousin.

530
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,580
Where are you going?

531
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,210
Hide and seek.

532
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,420
-There you are. -Cousin.

533
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,630
Wuyan. Why are you stopping me?

534
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:33,860
That's right.

535
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,390
Cousin, ignore him.

536
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,550
Cousin.

537
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,150
I just came back from grandma's house.

538
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,740
I heard about it on the way.

539
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,990
If you save someone three times,

540
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,310
she'll be your destiny.

541
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,450
No need to say.

542
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,860
This person must be me.

543
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Let's start now.

544
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,080
Start what?

545
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,570
Help me!

546
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:53,700
Help...

547
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,140
Weapons are not allowed in the Young Master's Residence.

548
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,810
Cousin.

549
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,970
I'm here.

550
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,960
Cousin.

551
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,260
Miss.

552
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,150
-Miss. -My butt!

553
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,600
It hurts!

554
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,780
Miss Fengyi...

555
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:25,980
To be frank,

556
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,020
she has already been designated

557
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,740
to be Young Master's wife.

558
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,290
If you marry her,

559
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,070
it will be more lively

560
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,900
in the Young Master's Residence.

561
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,070
Exactly.

562
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,080
Maybe Young Master

563
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,940
is too picky.

564
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,840
After all,

565
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,380
Miss Nangong Siyan

566
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,340
is talented and good-looking.

567
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,150
Nangong Siyan?

568
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,570
She is the granddaughter of Chairman Nangong.

569
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,180
She is the famous beauty

570
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,260
recognized by all people in the Cangyue City.

571
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,810
She's good at everything.

572
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,710
Even if I stand in front of her,

573
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,220
I'm a little inferior, too.

574
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,580
You're so modest.

575
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,690
Cousin, give me a hug.

576
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,700
It hurts.

577
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,220
Young Master.

578
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:01,630
I...

579
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,750
My hair.

580
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,360
Gosh.

581
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,280
It hurts.

582
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,860
What can I do for you?

583
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,300
Cousin.

584
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,530
Let me introduce.

585
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,860
This is Yunxi.

586
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:35,960
She just came here.

587
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,270
She's my right-hand assistant now.

588
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,940
No matter what I do now,

589
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,080
I can't do it without her.

590
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,450
She is so important to me.

591
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,520
Yunxi.

592
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,140
Miss Fengyi. How are you?

593
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:50,980
I'm not good.

594
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,580
Young Master.

595
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,600
Aren't you very mean

596
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,830
to do this?

597
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,180
The melon seeds are delicious, right?

598
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,170
I think

599
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,230
it's definitely not enough for you

600
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,150
to just watch it aside.

601
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,570
The highest level of being a looker-on

602
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,340
is to participate.

603
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,270
I'll leave this to you.

604
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,080
Cousin.

605
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,940
I have something to do.

606
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,140
If you have any questions,

607
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,180
you can ask Yunxi.

608
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,220
I can rest assured

609
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:21,990
if she does things.

610
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,140
What's your name?

611
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,770
What is your relationship with my cousin?

612
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,060
Why does he value you so much?

613
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,030
Tell me.

614
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,620
Did you poison my cousin?

615
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,710
You must be joking.

616
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,110
Jiaobai.

617
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,710
Give this stubborn mouth

618
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,260
ten slaps first.

619
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:54,700
Yes.

620
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,320
The one Young Master likes is you.

621
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,780
Wait.

622
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,430
What did you say?

623
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,010
My cousin likes me?

624
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,060
You are so delicate and cute.

625
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,110
Even a woman like me

626
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,940
can't help falling in love.

627
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,720
Young Master...

628
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,800
How could he not feel anything?

629
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,730
Besides,

630
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,040
look at my face.

631
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,400
Is it comparable to yours?

632
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,830
You said Young Master liked me.

633
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,180
Isn't that self-descending?

634
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,850
That's true.

635
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,390
Few people in the Cangyue City

636
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,750
are prettier than me.

637
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:22,730
Wait.

638
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,420
Then why did he say

639
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,250
that you two had a relationship?

640
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,410
He wants you to be jealous.

641
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,020
Jealous?

642
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,420
But why hasn't he never said

643
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,280
that he likes me?

644
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,410
Instead,

645
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,300
he's always avoiding me.

646
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,830
Miss, think about it.

647
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,610
A man is broad-minded.

648
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,470
How can he

649
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,210
speak freely

650
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,160
about his love affair?

651
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,090
Besides,

652
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,190
he is

653
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,230
such a noble man

654
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,720
who cares about the world.

655
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,300
You have a point.

656
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,660
But

657
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,180
from now on,

658
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,460
you must leave here.

659
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,580
You are not allowed to see him again.

660
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,260
Young Master.

661
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,610
Did they quarrel

662
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,710
because of me?

663
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,830
They did.

664
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,230
But then Miss Fengyi

665
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,830
was subdued.

666
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,430
No.

667
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,580
No.

668
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,090
Did she punish Yunxi?

669
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,610
Didn't I ask you to watch her?

670
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,730
No.

671
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,140
They have already

672
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,170
become good sisters.

673
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,450
Yunxi promised

674
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,690
to be the little magpie of love

675
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,720
between you and Miss Fengyi.

676
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,880
Little magpie of love?

677
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,900
I will break

678
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,680
her little wings.

679
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,540
Rumor has it

680
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,920
that my daughter Fengyi

681
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,080
has been saved by Young Master three times in a row.

682
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,670
Commander Xiao.

683
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,100
If committing suicide

684
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,770
and waiting to be saved

685
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,880
can also be called as fate,

686
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,900
then Siyan and Young Master

687
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,540
have been close friends for a long time.

688
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,190
This is true fate.

689
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:00,660
You...

690
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,800
It's the so-called matchmaking

691
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,950
of beauty and talent.

692
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,800
How about this?

693
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,540
Let's hurry to find a time

694
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,920
to finish the marriage

695
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,380
between Young Master and Fengyi.

696
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,250
Uncle,

697
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:15,850
I can't decide

698
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,270
my marriage.

699
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,750
It all depends on my parents,

700
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,950
all the lords and you

701
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,760
to discuss.

702
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,140
Father.

703
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,540
I promised you

704
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,920
to focus on

705
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,180
the construction work

706
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,240
of the Cangyue City.

707
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,520
You're right.

708
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,190
It's rare that Xi has such an ambition.

709
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:43,980
How about this?

710
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,180
Let's put marriage aside

711
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,630
for now.

712
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,950
We'll discuss it after the city is completed.

713
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:50,860
Jiang Chaoxi.

714
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,630
You are so disrespectful to me.

715
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,190
I will

716
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,820
teach you a lesson.

717
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,480
[Eastern Mansion of Xiao'ao]

718
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,360
Slow down.

719
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,100
Young Master.

720
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,770
This way, please.

721
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,390
Let's watch it here.

722
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,030
You are so busy.

723
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,550
It's already a blessing for people in Cangyue

724
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,240
that you can inspect Zhaohe River in person.

725
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:25,900
Young Master.

726
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:26,830
It's dangerous by the river.

727
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:27,930
You'd better not go.

728
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:28,840
We're not going.

729
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:30,980
Young Master.

730
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,670
The position of the culvert

731
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,730
is related to the drainage system

732
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,750
of the whole Cangyue City.

733
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,600
It's very important.

734
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,270
Please choose carefully.

735
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,000
Let's go there.

736
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:39,790
Let's go.

737
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,250
This place is nice.

738
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,740
The terrain is low enough.

739
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:50,640
The soil is not good.

740
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,030
The culverts need overall strength

741
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,730
and stability.

742
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,200
The soil here

743
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,600
is not good enough to support the design load.

744
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,560
Wuyan. Prepare the boat.

745
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,320
How long will it take

746
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,620
if we have to walk?

747
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,460
Yes.

748
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,600
Young Master.

749
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,400
We've enjoyed the scenery

750
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,330
and caught the fish.

751
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,130
Time to work.

752
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,030
We have to continue to survey

753
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,220
along the downstream.

754
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,840
We...

755
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,960
You can measure it yourself.

756
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,510
I have deigned

757
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,420
to come here with you.

758
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,810
I advise you not to push your luck.

759
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:30,760
Fine.

760
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,580
I won't force you if you don't want to do it.

761
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:33,990
Let's

762
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,050
drift on the river for a few days.

763
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,090
The bamboo pole.

764
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,410
Oh no.

765
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,240
Is it useful to look at me?

766
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,230
Hurry up and think of a way.

767
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,460
I do mapping.

768
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,290
I'm not the Dragon King.

769
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,160
What can I do?

770
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,240
How dare you answer back?

771
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,380
Do you believe

772
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,030
that I will throw you down to feed the fish?
