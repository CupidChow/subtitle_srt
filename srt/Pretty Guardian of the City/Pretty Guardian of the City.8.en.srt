4
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,250
Here.

5
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,650
Great.

6
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,060
I'm free now.

7
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,220
Let me help you.

8
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,009
Qing,

9
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,800
do it yourself.

10
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:55,860
Young Master, let's go.

11
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:56,940
Yunxi.

12
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:00,940
Yunxi.

13
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,310
What is your relationship

14
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,350
with Guard Tang?

15
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,820
You two acted so intimately in my mansion,

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,440
which was very insolent.

17
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,940
Young Master,

18
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,570
Don't get us wrong.

19
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,650
Tang Qing and I

20
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,820
grew up together.

21
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,070
He's like my brother.

22
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,660
You take Tang Qing as your brother?

23
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,300
Yes.

24
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,820
There are two suitable locations

25
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,260
in Cangyue City for the market.

26
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,130
One is the manor land to the north.

27
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,230
The other

28
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,740
is Winding Alleys to the south.

29
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,340
Roads there

30
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,579
lead everywhere,

31
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,850
with complete infrastructure.

32
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,340
The shortcoming is its dense population.

33
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,110
Relocation and demolition costs

34
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,980
will be very high.

35
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,880
You know that place well.

36
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,740
Of course.

37
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,410
The Jianjia Alley I once lived in

38
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,990
is there.

39
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,290
Besides, it's my job

40
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,880
to walk around and remember

41
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,380
every detail of the city

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,380
in my mind.

43
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,540
This is

44
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,460
the manor land I mentioned before.

45
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,590
Its advantages are the beautiful scenery,

46
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,980
vast space, and sparse population.

47
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,060
It's a better site for the market.

48
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,260
What's more,

49
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,160
we can make use of

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
both water and road transport

51
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,060
to make goods exchange fast and efficient.

52
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,710
This place

53
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,500
is far from downtown.

54
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,800
But in terms of other aspects,

55
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,380
it's a better location for the market

56
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,760
than Winding Alleys.

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,260
Young Master,

58
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,470
why are you staring at me?

59
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,460
Nothing.

60
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,340
What you said

61
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,860
reminds me of Luo Daoan.

62
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:49,960
Father.

63
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,620
My father once said that

64
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,860
20 years ago, Lord Luo proposed

65
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,420
to redesign Cangyue City

66
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,540
and exploit the northern lands.

67
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,140
It was a turbulent time,

68
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,960
so his plan wasn't carried out.

69
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,220
Some of your ideas

70
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,740
are exactly the same as his.

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,080
What's wrong?

72
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,350
Nothing.

73
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,440
I'm just excited

74
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,340
that you mentioned Lord Luo.

75
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,380
He's my favorite surveyor.

76
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,620
I admire him very much.

77
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,130
Rumor has it

78
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,880
that after Luo Daoan

79
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,540
embezzled the construction funds,

80
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,000
he and his family committed suicide for fear of punishment.

81
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,860
But I've seen

82
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,730
his works.

83
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,870
I don't think he was someone

84
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,220
who would debase himself for money.

85
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:31,790
The dead doesn't

86
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,159
tell stories.

87
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,810
So we can hardly know

88
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,100
what really happened.

89
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,260
You have a point.

90
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,990
You wouldn't ride with me the other day.

91
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,710
Let's see how you can refuse me

92
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,840
this time.

93
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,490
My horse!

94
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,500
-I'll go get it back. -Wuyan, wait!

95
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,670
Young Master.

96
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,580
Why are you always the unlucky one?

97
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,470
I don't think

98
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,140
they will come back anytime soon.

99
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,300
I'll do you a favor

100
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,460
and let you ride with me.

101
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,490
I'm not going to ride with you.

102
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,220
Fine.

103
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,100
I prefer riding alone anyway.

104
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,640
You said no but hurried to mount my horse.

105
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,130
Good for you, Yunxi.

106
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,130
Why are you turning back?

107
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,409
How dare you abandon me?

108
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,500
Not that way!

109
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,460
Young Master,

110
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,380
I just had

111
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,820
a test ride.

112
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,330
Wait.

113
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,090
It's improper for us to be too close.

114
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
You should not get on the horse.

115
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,620
If you don't want to ride with me,

116
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,500
that's okay.

117
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,180
I believe you can

118
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,260
run back to my mansion

119
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,470
before dawn tomorrow.

120
00:05:59,380 --> 00:05:59,820
Come down.

121
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,650
Take a look.

122
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:14,940
Don't move.

123
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,040
You may fall.

124
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,980
Candied haws!

125
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,740
Take a look!

126
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,670
Take a look!

127
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,500
Take a look!

128
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,020
It smells so good.

129
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,710
Take a look.

130
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,900
Wait.

131
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,080
I need to buy something.

132
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,150
I'll go back by myself later.

133
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,060
What are you going to buy?

134
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,790
Let me go with you.

135
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:40,790
I haven't visited the market

136
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,490
in a long time.

137
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:42,380
No need.

138
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,550
I'm going to buy

139
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,490
girls' stuff.

140
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,170
I'd feel uncomfortable if you came along.

141
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,890
Sir,

142
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,760
can this incense

143
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
make a man who doesn't have feelings for me

144
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,600
fall in love with me?

145
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,090
Sure.

146
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,330
It can do more than that.

147
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,290
Look at this.

148
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,720
As long as you use my incense,

149
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,000
you can get any man you want.

150
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,830
This incense will make

151
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,110
Jiang Chaoxi and Xiao Fengyi

152
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,700
have an unforgettable night.

153
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,300
Sir,

154
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,170
I'll buy it.

155
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,410
Okay. Thank you.

156
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,010
Here.

157
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,500
Thank you.

158
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,110
Take care.

159
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,500
No man can resist.

160
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,910
Hot Night Incense.

161
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,980
What a surprise!

162
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,380
Young Master.

163
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,740
How is it?

164
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,309
I can only have him

165
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,059
drink some soup.

166
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,140
There's no clue about Fengchi.

167
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,380
I'm afraid Luo Hexuan

168
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,570
won't last long.

169
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,100
Young Master,

170
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,630
this is the blueprint

171
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,540
just sent by the Planning Department.

172
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,780
Wait.

173
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,020
In my mansion,

174
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,030
men and women

175
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,620
are forbidden from getting too close.

176
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,380
Be careful.

177
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,630
Don't be a bad influence

178
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,900
on other people here.

179
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,020
Young Master,

180
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,540
are you talking about me and my sister?

181
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,580
Sister?

182
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,200
That's an intimate way of addressing her.

183
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,420
Of course.

184
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,990
Yunxi and I

185
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,780
grew up together.

186
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,200
We've never separated.

187
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,350
We're indeed

188
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,260
closer to each other than to others.

189
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,300
I don't care about the past you shared.

190
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,580
In my mansion,

191
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,270
men and women

192
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,980
should keep a distance.

193
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,950
Anyone violating that rule

194
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,900
will be kicked out!

195
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:55,970
Yes, Young Master.

196
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,060
What are you looking at?

197
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,610
You got anything to say?

198
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,460
I don't have the nerve.

199
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,930
I'm going on patrol.

200
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,620
Yunxi,

201
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,700
how could you plan to make advances to me

202
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,260
and in the meanwhile

203
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,080
be another man's sweetheart?

204
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,730
That's not what a lady should do.

205
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,900
You've found the secret room?

206
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,100
Take me there.

207
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:43,780
No hurry.

208
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,660
We need the key to get in.

209
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,690
It's Young Master's jade badge.

210
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:50,970
Good.

211
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,970
I spend lots of time with him during the day.

212
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,300
I'll find a chance to get it.

213
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,570
Let me do it.

214
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,590
I'm more skilled.

215
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,180
It's my call.

216
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,290
Don't rush into anything.

217
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,020
Yun'er,

218
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,520
I'm afraid

219
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,870
I can't protect you anymore.

220
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,590
No, Brother.

221
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,240
I'll do as you say in the future.

222
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,980
I won't go down the mountain again.

223
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,130
It's not your fault.

224
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,360
Don't blame yourself.

225
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,370
The Swing Painting at home

226
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,750
is a map that leads to Fengchi.

227
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,110
You must go back to get it.

228
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,460
Also,

229
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,260
keep this white jade comb

230
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,820
with you.

231
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,640
Brother,

232
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,700
after I get the jade badge,

233
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,540
I'll go save you.

234
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,630
Is there a problem with this one?

235
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,360
No.

236
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,620
How about this one?

237
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,460
No problem.

238
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,330
This one?

239
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,490
She's staring at me

240
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,510
so boldly.

241
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,860
She's not shy at all.

242
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,550
How can I get

243
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,180
his jade badge?

244
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,620
Since you're so obsessed with me,

245
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,410
I'll give you a chance.

246
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,500
The incense today

247
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,880
doesn't smell so good.

248
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,840
It's a bit pungent.

249
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,820
I think it's good.

250
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,200
Expensive incense like this

251
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,100
smells of money.

252
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,770
You fool.

253
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,460
Use that Hot Night Incense you bought!

254
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,420
Seize the opportunity!

255
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,600
The ink has gone dry.

256
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,900
Let me grind the ink for you.

257
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,140
Are you alright?

258
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,330
It's all my fault.

259
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,610
Let me fix it.

260
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:33,810
Stop!

261
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,210
You wanna feel me up?

262
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,290
You're a girl.

263
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,660
Restrain yourself.

264
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:42,780
Zhu Wen.

265
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,340
Steward Zhu is not here.

266
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,230
Why don't you

267
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,180
get changed first?

268
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,020
She followed me all the way here.

269
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,550
So persistent.

270
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,170
I'll go wash the clothes.

271
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,210
Where is the jade badge?

272
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,300
Stupid woman.

273
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,180
Even if Cupid shot a bullet

274
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:09,880
into your heart,

275
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,980
you wouldn't feel a thing.

276
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,180
I'll give you

277
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,290
one last chance.

278
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,580
If you can't seize it either,

279
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,330
you can only blame yourself

280
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,230
for not being blessed.

281
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,070
What are you doing?

282
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,210
I was cutting the loose threads

283
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,620
on your clothes.

284
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,960
Loose threads?

285
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,130
My clothes

286
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,050
are of high quality.

287
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:11,770
There are no loose threads.

288
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,600
That's crap.

289
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,580
No matter how expensive your clothes are,

290
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,300
they are sewn by threads.

291
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,370
Of course there are loose threads.

292
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,880
I just saw one.

293
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,690
Where is it?

294
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,690
This is improper.

295
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,020
Maybe I was mistaken.

296
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,580
I'll leave you to rest.

297
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll go.

298
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:28,830
Come back!

299
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,660
You can't fool me again!

300
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,200
He gave the order yesterday

301
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:51,170
♫I like to be behind you♫

302
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,110
that men and women in this mansion

303
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,940
shouldn't get too close.

304
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,590
But now he's holding her in his arms?

305
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,560
It turns out that the rule maker

306
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,670
♫Even the night breeze becomes gentle♫

307
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,690
doesn't have to abide by his own rule.

308
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:07,609
♫I feel so happy♫

309
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,970
Yunxi.

310
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,300
♫Time seems to have stopped♫

311
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,010
I was holding her in my arms,

312
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,130
but she just got up and ran away?

313
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,180
Is that some new trick?

314
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,450
♫I wish to hold your hand♫

315
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:28,359
♫Till the end of the day♫

316
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,050
Yunxi,

317
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,579
Young Master just hugged you.

318
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,230
Then you don't care about me

319
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,980
anymore.

320
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:36,850
♫But I can't escape from fate♫

321
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,360
I was holding my pastry,

322
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,490
and I saw Yunxi

323
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,890
lunge at our Young Master.

324
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,860
In broad daylight,

325
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,360
Yunxi was too bold.

326
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:45,950
She was.

327
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,370
Pepper.

328
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,530
Don't spread rumors.

329
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,100
There's no way Yunxi has a feeling

330
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,970
for Young Master.

331
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,000
Tang Qing,

332
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,960
there's no impossible for feelings

333
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,280
between men and women.

334
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,730
Besides,

335
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,700
Young Master is an outstanding one.

336
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,610
It's normal if Yunxi can't hold

337
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,320
her feelings.

338
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,820
Tang Qing!

339
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,590
My waist!

340
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,190
My cousin didn't even mention paying a visit.

341
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,290
Miss.

342
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,340
Bad news!

343
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,710
Quiet!

344
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,470
Is it the end of the world?

345
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,620
It's worse.

346
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,020
Yunxi hugged Young Master.

347
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,090
They have fallen in love with each other.

348
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,300
What did you say?

349
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,500
What did you say?

350
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,510
Miss.

351
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,830
Take it easy.

352
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,300
No.

353
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:45,800
Take it easy.

354
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,300
I can't  believe it.

355
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,500
Really?

356
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,630
This has spread around

357
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,540
in the mansion.

358
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,790
Everyone knows it.

359
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,950
Damn Yunxi. Let's go.

360
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,180
Find her.

361
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,560
Yunxi.

362
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,420
The whole mansion is talking about

363
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,540
you hugging Young Master.

364
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,220
I'm afraid if this continues,

365
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,540
it will disgrace your name.

366
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,300
I accidentally bumped into him

367
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,760
just because I was trying to steal the jade badge.

368
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,740
Yunxi!

369
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,840
Trouble is coming.

370
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,760
Miss Fengyi,

371
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,980
have you recovered?

372
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,330
How dare you hug my cousin

373
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
during my recuperation?

374
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,830
Looks like you don't want

375
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,580
your arms anymore.

376
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,500
Don't think I won't hurt you,

377
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,320
just because you're good-looking.

378
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,820
Miss,

379
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,590
you can't accuse me

380
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,210
without confirming reason.

381
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,390
I hugged Young Master

382
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,560
for you.

383
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,360
For me?

384
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,660
This is Hot Night Incense I bought for you.

385
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,780
It can definitely let Young Master

386
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,540
fall in love with you.

387
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,280
So magical?

388
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,840
No.

389
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,150
But you still can't

390
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,100
hug my cousin.

391
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,270
I did that to protect the incense.

392
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,450
To keep it from Young Master.

393
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,090
But someone misunderstood and spread the rumor.

394
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,870
If you

395
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,870
don't believe me,

396
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:08,980
what's the point

397
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,810
for me to do this?

398
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,470
Miss,

399
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,580
this will be helpful.

400
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,860
Have a try.

401
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,830
Do you think Yunxi

402
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,550
has been flirting with me lately?

403
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:37,950
No.

404
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,560
I think you've been

405
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:41,820
amorous lately.

406
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,800
Me?

407
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,870
It's no use asking you.

408
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,460
After all, no woman

409
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,020
has ever liked you.

410
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,440
What is this?

411
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,970
Three quarter past 7 p.m.

412
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,550
Feiyu Pavilion.

413
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,570
I will be waiting for you.

414
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,660
I won't go.

415
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,120
Why are you so narcissistic?

416
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,330
Who wants to take you there?

417
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,740
Look.

418
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,600
She is still flirting with me.

419
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,680
Now she wants to meet me in private.

420
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,760
Why is she

421
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,700
so bold?

422
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,820
Does she really believe I am what she thinks?

423
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,410
You are a real gentleman.

424
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,660
Your character is worth learning.

425
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,840
Can you idiot learn this？

426
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,940
Get me some night snacks.

427
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,050
Yes.

428
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,790
Where are you going?

429
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,300
The washroom.

430
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,610
But why have you changed clothes?

431
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,140
Young Master.

432
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,250
You're going the wrong way.

433
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,450
The washroom is over there.

434
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,790
As long as we succeed tonight,

435
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,200
I will give you rich rewards.

436
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,600
Thank you, Miss.

437
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,260
With the help of Hot Night Incense,

438
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,700
we definitely can make it.

439
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:34,740
I'll wait outside

440
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,240
later.

441
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,190
As soon as he comes in,

442
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,490
I'll close the door.

443
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,580
So he won't be able to leave.

444
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:39,830
Then,

445
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,080
you can lift the gauze curtain,

446
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,900
and call his name.

447
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,900
With the effect of Hot Night Incense,

448
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,520
as long as he approaches you,

449
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,660
his lust

450
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,760
will be awakened.

451
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,310
Is he really gonna like me

452
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,660
because of this Hot Night Incense?

453
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,100
Be confident.

454
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,390
Don't doubt it.

455
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,260
Doubt?

456
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,220
Under the candlelight,

457
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,120
your charming appearance

458
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,040
is more attractive

459
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,070
than a fairy's.

460
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,820
Even without the incense,

461
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,900
Young Master will still have a crush on you.

462
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,900
He has arrived.

463
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,460
Let's go.

464
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,080
Arrive?

465
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,390
Go. How does he come so fast?

466
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,380
This way.

467
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,100
Hurry.

468
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,370
I'll go out first.

469
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,070
OK. Go ahead.

470
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,380
Yunxi, I'm coming.

471
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,250
Oh, no.

472
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,170
The incense is pleasant.

473
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,680
The atmosphere is good too.

474
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,300
You're really good at planning.

475
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,620
Good.

476
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,460
Since you like it,

477
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,460
please have fun.

478
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,170
I won't bother you then.

479
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,660
At this moment,

480
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,710
you really want to leave?

481
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,910
Or

482
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,090
you want to get something?

483
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,680
I'll wait for you.

484
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,050
Tell me.

485
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,440
How do you want to play the act?

486
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,400
Act?

487
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:45,820
Young Master.

488
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,630
So you've already known.

489
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,100
He has found out?

490
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,470
You're making it

491
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,540
so obvious, so straightforward.

492
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,550
Even a fool knows it.

493
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,290
How could I not understand?

494
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,560
Since you know,

495
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,730
it's easy now.

496
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,260
The effect is amazing.

497
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,600
Looks like the money is worth it.

498
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:09,780
Young Master,

499
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,970
please.

500
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,570
Let's begin.

501
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,500
What are you going to do?

502
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,820
To do what you want to do the most.

503
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,610
Oh, no.

504
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,150
The effect of Hot Night Incense

505
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,300
is beyond magical.

506
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,010
Young Master even has a feeling for me.

507
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,240
Young Master.

508
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,530
Look carefully.

509
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,400
It's me. Yunxi.

510
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,600
I know.

511
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,840
I know you are Yunxi.

512
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,720
You're a special person.

513
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,350
You helped me a lot

514
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,420
in the city construction.

515
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,180
I appreciate that.

516
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,110
But in love,

517
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,910
you are a miss.

518
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,990
You should be more missish.

519
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:01,760
Young Master.

520
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,250
I know.

521
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,370
These days,

522
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,000
you've been trying to flirt with me.

523
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,270
All this implies

524
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,660
that you like me.

525
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,760
Young Master, you misunderstood.

526
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,850
How could I like...

527
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,720
Don't explain.

528
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,230
Don't explain.

529
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,130
Alright.

530
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,940
Let me tell you the truth.

531
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,690
I'm here today

532
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,540
not to give you hope.

533
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,530
I just don't want

534
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,870
to waste your time.

535
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,770
I have to tell you something.

536
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,850
You have to follow the rules in my mansion.

537
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,860
You should be patient sometimes.

538
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,370
In the future,

539
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,940
you are expected to be gentler,

540
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,660
and more reserved.

541
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,040
I'll give you another chance.

542
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,090
Young Master, stop it.

543
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,840
You two have gone too far!

544
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:01,990
Oh my god.

545
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,040
You...

546
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,670
Why are you here?

547
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,130
Miss, listen to me.

548
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:09,870
Shut up!

549
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:10,890
You liar!

550
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,100
You lied to me

551
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,070
that you would set me up with my cousin.

552
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,350
And you are flirting with him at the same time.

553
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,070
All my trust is in vain.

554
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,060
You have played with my feelings.

555
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:18,940
Today,

556
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,250
you embarrassed me even more.

557
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:21,980
You...

558
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:22,900
What?

559
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,320
Don't be rude.

560
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,450
Just you wait.

561
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,330
Miss.

562
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,110
My shoes.

563
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,650
Fine.

564
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,140
It is not you who want to express obsession.

565
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,230
Young Master, you misunderstood.

566
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,300
I was helping Miss...

567
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:56,930
Forget it.

568
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,430
Miss Fengyi

569
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,610
can't forgive me now.

570
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,450
Young Master,

571
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,890
please help me.

572
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,260
You deserve it.

573
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,850
Why am I so unlucky?

574
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,530
I have offended two great lords.

575
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,470
It's all Jiang Chaoxi's fault today.

576
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,540
He was out of his mind and speaking nonsense.

577
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:31,940
In the future,

578
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,500
you are expected to be gentler,

579
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,010
and more reserved.

580
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,260
I'll give you another chance.

581
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,060
Yunxi!

582
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,780
Yunxi!

583
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,630
I thought about it all night.

584
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,460
Finally, I figured it out.

585
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,180
You've been treating me like an idiot.

586
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,260
You can't stay here anymore.

587
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,240
Jiaobai, go!

588
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:10,550
Yes.

589
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,020
Miss!

590
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,250
Miss, let me go!

591
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,400
Lie down. None of your business.

592
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,500
I'm not going to get up.

593
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,330
Let go of me!

594
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,510
Come here.

595
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,680
I'm not leaving.

596
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,620
Leave!

597
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,610
Let go of me!

598
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,340
I'm not leaving.

599
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,230
I was invited by Young Master.

600
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,600
So only he can force me to leave.

601
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,700
You're here for my cousin indeed.

602
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,320
Since you don't want to leave.

603
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,780
Jiaobai,

604
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,270
come.

605
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,010
Since you don't want to leave,

606
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,860
you have to kneel

607
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,210
until I'm not angry.

608
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,280
Yunxi.

609
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,430
Yunxi.

610
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,520
What happened?

611
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:50,430
Get up.

612
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,340
Qing, I'm fine.

613
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,020
Leave now.

614
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,340
I'll kneel for her.

615
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,140
Since you care about her so much,

616
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,520
you can kneel with her.

617
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:03,440
-You... -Qing.

618
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,600
Calm down.

619
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,940
I have to find my brother.

620
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:16,820
Young Master.

621
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,350
Why are you so angry?

622
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,970
It's raining.

623
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,440
You...

624
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,270
Young Master.

625
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,370
Bad news!

626
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,300
Miss Fengyi is punishing Yunxi.

627
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,170
That means Yunxi deserves it.

628
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,320
What has she done to Young Master?

629
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:44,930
Yunxi,

630
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,740
you are frail. Get up.

631
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,080
It's raining heavily.

632
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,220
You can't take it.

633
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:51,980
I'm fine.

634
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,990
Leave me alone.

635
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,280
I've told Commander Xiao and the Chairman

636
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,700
to demolish Jianjia Alley

637
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,310
and build a commercial market.

638
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,470
They showed no objection.

639
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,130
Since there is no objection,

640
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,250
it's settled.

641
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:26,940
Young Master.

642
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:29,940
Young Master.

643
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,320
Anything else?

644
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,650
What should we do

645
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,100
about the people in Jianjia Alley?

646
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:37,910
Young Master,

647
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,990
Commander Xiao has already chosen a place

648
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,950
outside the city

649
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,740
for those people.

650
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,910
At the same time, the Planning Department

651
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,840
will pay compensation

652
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,110
to them.

653
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,400
When will the compensation be paid?

654
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,590
Young Master.

655
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,600
Tang Qing wants to see you.

656
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,060
What's the matter?

657
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,360
He

658
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,410
wants you to save Yunxi.

659
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:02,490
I don't want to meet him.

660
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:04,980
And I don't want to save Yunxi.

661
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,230
Yes.

662
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,900
How is it?

663
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,930
He said he didn't care about Yunxi.

664
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,620
Go back.

665
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,220
I'll talk to him myself.

666
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,420
Stop!

667
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,550
Don't put me in a dilemma.

668
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:36,790
Fine.

669
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:38,970
I will not.

670
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,820
Get out of my way!
