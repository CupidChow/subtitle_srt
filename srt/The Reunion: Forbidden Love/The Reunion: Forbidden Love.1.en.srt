00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:42,634
My wife was also a dancer.

129
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:45,637
What? Is it true? It's a story from the old days

130
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:48,640
Wife, you have a good figure

131
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,642
I thought it wasn't just jogging

132
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:52,644
Even your wife

133
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:56,982
(Yachihiko) Why did he go from dancer to construction? Ah... I didn't have the talent

134
00:10:56,982 --> 00:11:00,586
It's weird to say it, but I think he had a talent.

135
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:04,590
But my father couldn't get a wife if he had such an unstable job.

136
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,593
(Yaohiko) So it's good for your father's company.

137
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:10,596
If you're getting married, you're forced to work at home.

138
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:13,599
Stop talking like that

139
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,601
I want to see my wife's dance

140
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:18,604
Oh, that's right, why don't you dance together?

141
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:20,606
This guy sometimes dances alone

142
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:23,609
Ah... Stop it (Yahiko) isn't it?

143
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:27,613
If you like, I'll improvise (Saeko) Ah, come on, hey, hurry up

(Locking sound) Woo... But he's a bright wife

181
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:31,590
Have you been drunk? "Dance"

182
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,593
That's fine, they're the same dancer

183
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:38,593
It was embarrassing, it was wonderful

184
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:48,607
Ah, good morning! good morning

185
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:50,609
(Saeko) Thank you for the meal yesterday

186
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,609
Are you going to run? Let's go, that's right

187
00:15:57,616 --> 00:16:00,552
Ah, why not eat at lunch today?

188
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:04,552

I've gone but... what?

204
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:45,577
I thought it was a bad thing after all

205
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:49,581
You're a selfish person, but I've invited you

206
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:52,584
Of course... I'll meet you again suddenly➡

207
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:55,587
There were a lot of things I wanted to talk about

208
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:57,589
Do something like that in front of my husband➡

209
00:19:57,589 --> 00:19:59,591
If that were the case, did you think you'd have a conscience?

210
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:03,928
You're married, so you're right!

211
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:05,928
Hmm...

212
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:14,606
Can you tell me your mobile number? I've probably changed my phone

213
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:18,606
I called since then but couldn't get in.

214
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:25,617
I've never forgotten about you

215
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,617
Stop it really

216
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:32,624
I couldn't listen to what I said ➡

217
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:35,627
I could listen to what my wife said

218
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:39,631
Haa... Haa

219
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:43,635
Did you quit to marry your wife?

220
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:45,635
dance

221
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:52,644
My parents also said the same thing as their wife's dad.

222
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:56,648
But you didn't quit dancing

223
00:20:56,648 --> 00:21:00,585
I thought you would understand because you were dancing too.

224
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:05,590
Yes, that's what I thought back then

225
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,592
To marry me ➡

226
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:10,595
I didn't want to destroy your dreams

227
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:13,598
But you're going to marry your wife.

228
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:17,602
You just gave up on your dreams, right?

229
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:21,606
With you gone, I don't care anymore

230
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:23,606
Haa...

231
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:33,618
Are you okay at work? ah…

232
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:37,618
I'm back now, if someone sees me...

233
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:48,631

(Sugimoto) Huh? From my husband? (Miiko) Yes

247
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:30,602
You and I are becoming a rumor

248
00:23:30,602 --> 00:23:35,607
Maybe my husband heard it

249
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:38,610
Hmm, did you say something?

250
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,612
Hmm, not that's true ➡

251
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:44,616
You're calling me even though I don't have anything to do

252
00:23:44,616 --> 00:23:47,619
If you find out, you should break up and join me

253
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:53,625
Hmm, you're not stupid, there's no way you can do it

254

365
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:32,569
When is it? (Eiko) 2-3 days ago He's handsome

366
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:35,572
So maybe he's not his master

367
00:38:35,572 --> 00:38:37,574
No, are you cheating? Ah

368
00:38:37,574 --> 00:38:39,576
It would be a pain if that aunt found me

369
00:38:39,576 --> 00:38:41,578
What is an aunt? (Eiko) is there

370
00:38:41,578 --> 00:38:44,581
The Rumor-loving Auntie (Miiko) I am also a victim

371
00:38:44,581 --> 00:38:48,585
(Eiko) This person was also seen walking with a young man.

372
00:38:48,585 --> 00:38:51,588
That's how people like you spread the rumors.

373
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:53,590
I'm just talking as I listened

374
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:56,593
Ando-san is seeing something strange, so he's not tweeting

375
00:38:56,593 --> 00:38:59,530
I'm not doing anything strange when I'm seen

376
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,530
Hey?

377
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:10,541
Yeah

00:39:43,574 --> 00:39:46,577
It's no good, why?

382
00:39:46,577 --> 00:39:50,581
I shouldn't see you again, has something happened?

383
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:52,581
Please do as you say

384
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,590

What about your meal? I've finished it

389
00:40:32,623 --> 00:40:34,625
I'll put a bath

390
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:37,625
Sometimes I say whether I'll join together

Thank you

409
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:09,573
yes

410
00:44:09,573 --> 00:44:14,578
Did you see him with Miyazawa?

411
00:44:14,578 --> 00:44:16,578
Huh?

412
00:44:22,586 --> 00:44:27,586
Ando-san, I was talking about it, I heard it

413
00:44:31,595 --> 00:44:33,597
((The person I was riding with was Odajima))

414
00:44:33,597 --> 00:44:35,599
(Women) (Huh? Odajima-san?)) (Shizuka) ((That's right))

415
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,602
((It's weird, I live across the street ➡

416
00:44:38,602 --> 00:44:40,604
I mean, getting into the car my husband is in))

417
00:44:40,604 --> 00:44:42,606
((It's not like that park is a dead end))

418
00:44:42,606 --> 00:44:44,608
((If there's nothing to be bothered ➡

419
00:44:44,608 --> 00:44:46,610
It's not strange to come down to say hello))

420
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,612
((This is the victim)) (Women) ((Yeah))

421
00:44:48,612 --> 00:44:51,615
Are you saying that? Hmm...

422
00:44:51,615 --> 00:44:55,619
I'm sure the story will become more and more interesting

423
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:58,555
I just happened to have it sent me by car

424
00:44:58,555 --> 00:45:01,558
That means we met somewhere else?

425
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:06,563
Yes, I happened to meet him in Shinjuku.

426
00:45:06,563 --> 00:45:10,567
That kind of mood will become more and more rumors

427
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:13,570
You're a troubled person

428
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,572
Is it really a coincidence? Huh?

429
00:45:15,572 --> 00:45:18,575
What are you talking about Miyazawa-san?

430
00:45:18,575 --> 00:45:22,579
Ha, there's no need to hide it

431
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:26,583
I've seen it once, so I guess I told Ando-san?

432
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:31,588
Haha, there's no way I'd say it, I'd be really pleased if you ask me

433
00:45:31,588 --> 00:45:35,592
I'm also a victim, so ha...

434
00:45:35,592 --> 00:45:39,596
Well, let me know if there's anything I can do

435
00:45:39,596 --> 00:45:41,596
You're both

436
00:45:45,602 --> 00:45:50,607
Come to think of it, what did Miyazawa say?

437
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:54,611
Come and eat

438
00:45:54,611 --> 00:46:01,551
Did you say something? When is it best? I said that but

439
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:05,555
I think I'll be free anytime, I'll be bored for a while

440
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:10,560
Yes... good night

441
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,560

Good morning Good morning

445
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:55,605
Is it bad even if it's feeling? Why?

446
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:58,541
Because I'm not wearing jogging clothes

447
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:02,545
I don't want to run so...

448
00:47:02,545 --> 00:47:06,549
The last story is just my husband, I'm fine at any time.

449
00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:10,553
What? Meal talk

450
00:47:10,553 --> 00:47:16,559
Ah, I think I'm getting worse...

Did your wife say something?

456
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,543
You met Ando the other day?

457
00:48:06,543 --> 00:48:08,545
It's like he's been saying a lot

458
00:48:08,545 --> 00:48:13,550
Ah, there's been rumors about you

459
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,552
Haa... I guess so

460
00:48:15,552 --> 00:48:19,556
Don't worry about rumors, it's not a rumor

461
00:48:19,556 --> 00:48:22,556
It's true about me and you

462
00:48:24,561 --> 00:48:29,566
So what did you say? I said "Nothing"

463
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:32,569
You probably don't believe it

464
00:48:32,569 --> 00:48:38,569
I met my wife today and it looked different than usual.

465
00:48:41,578 --> 00:48:43,580
You're kidding you're planning on breaking up with your wife, right?

466
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,582
Seriously, that's not good

467
00:48:45,582 --> 00:48:48,582
why? Haa

468
00:48:50,587 --> 00:48:52,587
Haa...

469
00:48:56,593 --> 00:48:59,529
Let's stop meeting now

470
00:48:59,529 --> 00:49:01,531
Are you planning to run away from me again?

471
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:06,531
We both grow up a little and we both have a family.

Before that, there's something I want to talk about

477
00:50:08,598 --> 00:50:11,601
what?

478
00:50:11,601 --> 00:50:13,601
Sit down

479
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,620
I heard some strange rumors

480
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:38,628
You and Miyazawa are cheating

481
00:50:38,628 --> 00:50:41,631
From who? It's fine from anyone

482
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:45,635
Why is there such a rumor?

483
00:50:45,635 --> 00:50:49,639
The other day I happened to meet Miyazawa in Shinjuku.

484
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:52,642
So I was sent by car and Ando-san saw it ➡

485
00:50:52,642 --> 00:50:56,642
Ando is saying something casual

486
00:51:03,586 --> 00:51:09,586
Miyazawa-san was also a dancer in the past, is that a coincidence?

487
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:19,599
Tell me the truth

488
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:29,609
Weren't you a friend?

489
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:40,623
Why were you silent? I was thinking of saying that but...

490
00:51:40,623 --> 00:51:43,623
Was it a relationship that you couldn't say?

491
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,630
What do you think?

492
00:51:52,635 --> 00:51:56,639
I've been dating

493
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,577
But it was 10 years ago when my parents opposed it and broke up.

494
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:05,581
He wasn't the only one, there were other people I had

495
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,584
You too, right? Before you got married, there were a lot of things going on.

496
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:10,584
I'm not listening to that kind of story

497
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,588
Woo...

498
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:21,594

514
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:18,581
I bought a watermelon and then I left it.

515
00:54:18,581 --> 00:54:20,583
It's tasty than I thought, and it's a supermarket there

516

Yay, I thought it was a win

517
00:54:24,587 --> 00:54:29,592

520
00:54:45,608 --> 00:54:47,608
Please part with me

When you have a complicated broken leg ➡

522
00:55:08,564 --> 00:55:12,564
You were worried if you could return to dancer.

523
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:18,574
I said, "It's okay."

524
00:55:18,574 --> 00:55:22,578
And my legs healed ➡

525
00:55:22,578 --> 00:55:25,581
Marry me ➡

526
00:55:25,581 --> 00:55:28,581
In the end, you quit being a dancer

527
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:51,607
When I asked you to marry you, you were snuggling

528
00:55:51,607 --> 00:55:54,607
I thought it was because I wanted to continue being a dancer.

529
00:55:56,612 --> 00:56:02,552
But was he the reason?

530
00:56:02,552 --> 00:56:04,554
It's not

531
00:56:04,554 --> 00:56:07,557
(Yaohiko) Didn't you really want to be with him?

532
00:56:07,557 --> 00:56:11,557
I love you so I got married

533
00:56:14,564 --> 00:56:19,564

534
00:56:23,573 --> 00:56:27,573
Anyway, let's calm down before we talk

535
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:34,584
Does time solve the problem?

536
00:56:34,584 --> 00:56:37,584
You've done that way before

537
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:43,593
It's becoming a rumour all over the city

538
00:56:43,593 --> 00:56:46,596
Huh has nothing to do with people...

539
00:56:46,596 --> 00:56:49,596
It's our problem

540
00:56:55,605 --> 00:57:00,543

541
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:02,543

<<(Door Chame)

547
00:58:19,555 --> 00:58:23,559
(Saeko) Have you heard from your wife?

548
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:26,562
(Yaohiko) No

549
00:58:26,562 --> 00:58:32,562
I've called many times and it doesn't come

550
00:58:35,571 --> 00:58:39,575
I'm not calling

551
00:58:39,575 --> 00:58:42,575
Maybe they're together

552
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:47,583
perhaps…

553
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:51,587
That's weird, this is what we'll do together

554
00:58:51,587 --> 00:58:53,587
Woo...

555
00:58:55,591 --> 00:59:00,529
I think there's a way to do it, like GPS...

556
00:59:00,529 --> 00:59:05,534
Yes (Yoshihiko) There's also a way to send it to the police.

557
00:59:05,534 --> 00:59:09,534
you? Are you not interested in looking for it?

558
00:59:12,541 --> 00:59:16,541
If it's as it is now, even if I come back...

559
00:59:20,549 --> 00:59:23,552
That's right

560
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:28,557
I also said I was going to divorce myself.

561
00:59:28,557 --> 00:59:32,557
But when I went to the hospital today...

562
00:59:35,564 --> 00:59:41,570
Once I have a child, my feelings will change

563
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,570
(Sound of slurping)

564
00:59:46,575 --> 00:59:48,575

Do you regret it? you?

569
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,600
I said that this is what it was like

570
01:00:16,605 --> 01:00:21,605
(Email reception sound)

571
01:00:24,613 --> 01:00:27,613
what happened? It's nothing

572
01:00:37,626 --> 01:00:42,631
What are you going to do? You became a father

573
01:00:42,631 --> 01:00:44,633
I love you

574
01:00:44,633 --> 01:00:49,633
Can you abandon your wife and children and start a new life with me?

575
01:00:55,644 --> 01:00:59,582
Please just keep quiet, I'm thinking now
