Disclaimer

00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,440
The series "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,640
was inspired by
the history of Thao Sri Sudachan.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,880
The events, characters, behaviors,
and details in this story

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,200
are interpreted, expanded upon,
or newly created

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,080
for entertainment purposes

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,079
and are not entirely based on
true historical events.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,560
The creators are aware that some events

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,120
or actions may spark criticism,

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,840
but we affirm that the production

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,280
of "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,640
was made with good intentions.
Beyond entertainment,

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,320
the aim is to encourage viewers
to take an interest in history.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,160
After watching, if viewers are interested,

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,880
they can seek
additional knowledge from experts

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,920
or historians to gain accurate
understanding of Ayutthaya history.

17
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,960
These two are Khun Phong,
who oversees the inner shrine,

18
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,560
and Khun Ban,
who takes care of the outer shrine.

19
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,960
My name is Wamon,

20
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,280
a Brahmin descendant from Lavo.

21
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,680
So, you’re the one

22
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,720
the Royal Brahmin teacher recommended.

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,320
You seem strong

24
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,920
and clever.

25
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,360
I have studied the three Vedas,

26
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,960
mastered historical records,

27
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,160
and can read and write fluently
in both Khmer and Sanskrit.

28
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,760
Very well. You shall assist Khun Ban here

29
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,080
in overseeing the outer shrine

30
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,640
and translating the Devanagari texts

31
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,720
into Thai for the King.

32
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,800
I shall serve the King with all my might.

33
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,640
Brahmin Wamon,

34
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,200
the Queen Consort has arrived.

35
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Brahmin,

36
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,800
I’ve come to seek blessing.

37
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,120
I will prepare the ritual, Your Majesty.

38
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,480
You may leave now.

39
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,520
I never thought
you’d make it into the palace.

40
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,680
My father introduced me

41
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,440
to the Royal Brahmin.

42
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,680
-Do they know about us?
-No.

43
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,360
Only as acquaintances.

44
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,800
Ever since you gave birth to the Prince,

45
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,280
we haven’t seen each other.

46
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,280
-I cannot go anywhere.
-I know.

47
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,080
That’s why I risked coming to see you.

48
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Jinda,

49
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,960
the time has come.

50
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,560
Jinda,

51
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,200
I didn’t call for you.

52
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,680
Why are you here?

53
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,000
Because it’s time, Your Majesty.

54
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,640
Prince Yod Fah is about to rest,

55
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,200
so I brought him to bid goodnight to you.

56
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,440
Look my Son.

57
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,600
This vast land

58
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,520
will one day

59
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,160
be yours.

60
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,160
Hongsawadi and Lan Chang

61
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,640
are expanding their power southward,

62
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,080
aiming to capture Ayodhaya
as their port city.

63
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,040
Do you know that?

64
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,480
And the northern cities

65
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,760
show signs of rebellion as well.

66
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,960
But you have nothing to fear.

67
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,400
As long as I am here,

68
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,480
no one will harm you.

69
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,920
Please allow me to take
Prince Yod Fah back, Your Majesty.

70
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,799
Take the Prince to his cradle.

71
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,280
I’ll be there shortly.

72
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,800
I shall prepare a special tea
for you, Your Majesty.

73
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,600
Go ahead and do it.

74
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,240
You’ve been taking care of both me

75
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,920
and Prince Yod Fah,

76
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,120
even staying up late.

77
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,640
I’m grateful.

78
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,880
It is my duty, Your Majesty.

79
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,480
Here is your tea, Your Majesty.

80
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Jinda,

81
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,800
what worries your heart?

82
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,800
Is it the thought of war?

83
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,840
Even if our enemies charge in,

84
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,400
as long as I’m here,

85
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,920
Ayodhaya

86
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,400
will never fall.

87
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,960
Our son, Yod Fah,

88
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,800
will sit on the throne

89
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,600
as the next King.

90
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
What's wrong?

91
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,440
This is the wrong tea.

92
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,960
This isn’t what I asked for.

93
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,360
-I--
-Silence!

94
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,400
This tea

95
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,800
is unworthy to serve.

96
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,320
Throw it out.

97
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,160
My apologies, Your Majesty.

98
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,680
I will prepare

99
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,960
a new one immediately.

100
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,520
Never mind.

101
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,840
There’s no need.

102
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,640
Jinda,

103
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,000
you must be very tired.

104
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,840
It’s alright.

105
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

106
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,720
Wait.

107
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,520
Lady Tanyong.

108
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,000
Aren’t you a royal maid
from the King’s chambers?

109
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,160
Why are you crying?

110
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,080
You should have finished it.

111
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,520
Acting all confused like this,

112
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,680
if the King suspects it,

113
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,640
-we’ll all lose our heads.
-I couldn’t do it.

114
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,280
If the King dies,

115
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
who will protect Ayodhaya?

116
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,560
My child is still so young.

117
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,080
How can he survive such dangers?

118
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,160
By hesitating like this,
the maids will become suspicious.

119
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
What will you say to justify your actions?

120
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,360
Your Majesty.

121
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,520
Here you are.

122
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,400
I just

123
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,840
misunderstood earlier.
Please don't mind me.

124
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

125
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,640
Did you throw out

126
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,240
the remaining tea?

127
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Uh, well…

128
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,560
I told you to throw it away.

129
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,600
Well,

130
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,040
I was about to,

131
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,360
but…

132
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,920
Lady Tanyong took the tea.

133
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,600
What should we do now?

134
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,080
If Lady Noi takes the tea for inspection,

135
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,080
she’ll discover the poison.

136
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,520
Then she will know

137
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,120
I tried to assassinate the King.

138
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,480
That is dangerous.

139
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,840
We can’t leave it like this.

140
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,160
I never thought

141
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,040
the Queen Consort
would invite me to go rowing.

142
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,600
There’s something I wish to discuss.

143
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,840
Let’s go quickly.

144
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,520
My Lady.

145
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,920
It’s alright Thongdee.

146
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,200
I wish to talk with the Queen Consort too.

147
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,080
While the nobles are conversing,

148
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,800
we shall wait here.

149
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,200
No one else is here.

150
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,200
You can call me Jinda as before.

151
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,880
What do you want to discuss, Lady Jinda?

152
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,040
I noticed

153
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,079
you’ve taken an interest in my tea.

154
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,640
So, I thought

155
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,520
I’d brew you a special cup.

156
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,160
The cat is dead now, my Lady.

157
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,360
If I drink this tea

158
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,760
and nothing happens,

159
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,720
then that’s fine.

160
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,720
But if I drink it

161
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,080
and something goes wrong,

162
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,360
the secret message I found
on Heuang’s body

163
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,920
will be delivered to the King immediately.

164
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,120
You…

165
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,480
You secretly communicated
with someone outside the palace.

166
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,600
Heuang found out and was murdered.

167
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,520
If the King reads
the contents of the message,

168
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,800
he will undoubtedly know

169
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,960
that the owner of the letter

170
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
is none other

171
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,320
than your lover.

172
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,640
He is not my lover.

173
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,440
He is

174
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,240
my first

175
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,480
and only love.

176
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,800
We were forced apart

177
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,560
because of my duty here.

178
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,360
Duty?

179
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,360
Is your duty to assassinate the King?

180
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,720
Or are you

181
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,040
-not afraid of losing your head?
-Being born into royalty

182
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,600
is like being a piece
on a chessboard, Lady Noi.

183
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,800
If we don’t kill them,

184
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,160
they’ll kill us.

185
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,960
So why should I be afraid?

186
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,560
You aim to take the throne,

187
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,080
and I,

188
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,280
a mere pawn in your way,

189
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,880
-am meant to die, right?
-Lady Noi…

190
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,920
Lady Noi.

191
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,640
-Let go of it.
-Let go of it.

192
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,760
Let go of it!

193
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,680
You are not my enemy.

194
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,400
Even if the Suphannaphum dynasty falls

195
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,720
and the Lavo dynasty rises to power,

196
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,960
Nakhon Si Thammarat

197
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,960
will still remain an ally.

198
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,160
Lady Noi,

199
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,240
the pieces on this chessboard

200
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,160
don’t kill from the same side.

201
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,240
Then,

202
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,840
this tea is no longer needed.

203
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,280
We're in trouble!

204
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,240
-The boat is leaking!
-Lady Noi!

205
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
Help! The boat is leaking!

206
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,280
-Lady Noi!
-Help! The boat is leaking.

207
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,680
Lady Noi, stay calm.

208
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,600
-Stay calm, Lady Noi!
-Help!

209
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,120
Lady Noi.

210
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,080
Lady Noi.

211
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
It’s alright now.

212
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,880
You’re alright now.

213
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,280
Lady Noi, Lady Noi.

214
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,720
Lady Noi.

215
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,040
Calm down Lady Noi.

216
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,160
Everything is fine now. It’s all okay.

217
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,360
Lady Noi.

218
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,920
Lady Noi, everything’s alright.

219
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,200
Everything’s fine.

220
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,440
It's alright.

221
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,120
It's alright.

222
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,800
Don’t scream.

223
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,760
Everything is fine now.

224
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,280
It's alright.

225
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,240
I’m glad
we didn’t have to harm each other.

226
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,080
I didn’t want to hurt you.

227
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,480
He was your first love,

228
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,360
and as for you,

229
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,160
you are my first.

230
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,480
Lady Noi…

231
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,280
Since the day I was born,

232
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,160
I never felt affection for anyone

233
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,760
until I met you.

234
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,200
If you report this

235
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,200
to the King,

236
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,720
I will be severely punished.

237
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,200
But I tell you this,

238
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,080
to show my sincerity.

239
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,400
From this day on,

240
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,080
your secret is safe with me,

241
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,720
and my secret will be safe with you.

242
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,480
Let us be

243
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,440
as sworn siblings, Lady Noi.

244
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,480
I don’t understand.

245
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,840
We sacrificed

246
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,880
and parted ways,
hoping to accomplish something great.

247
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,120
Or have all these years
changed your heart?

248
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,280
I have never changed.

249
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,280
I keep my word.

250
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,280
-I love only you.
-Then why didn’t you kill him?

251
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,000
You said we would reclaim
the throne for our dynasty.

252
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,000
Or have you forgotten your promise,

253
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,800
-now that you are Queen Consort?
-No.

254
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,080
I haven’t forgotten.

255
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,680
But now,

256
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,920
the northern cities
are showing signs of rebellion.

257
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,360
If the King dies,
Ayodhaya will surely fall into chaos.

258
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,480
Wamon,

259
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,400
my child is still so young.

260
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,040
If the King dies,

261
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,320
Khun Phirenthorathep

262
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,560
may raise his army

263
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,800
and take the throne.

264
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,560
I beg of you,

265
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,880
please wait

266
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,200
until my child is older.

267
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,760
Please.

268
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,520
Wamon…

269
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,560
Fine,

270
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,280
I will wait.

271
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,080
When the time comes, if you cannot do it,

272
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,800
then I will do it myself.

273
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,320
THREE YEARS LATER

274
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,120
Mother, let's return to the palace.

275
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,160
Prince Yod Fah,
are you afraid of the cannons?

276
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,000
It’s always like this the first time.

277
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,280
If he hears it often,
he will grow accustomed to it.

278
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,360
Hear it often?

279
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,240
Do you really suggest
I purchase cannons from Sezias?

280
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,160
Portuguese cannons are powerful.

281
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,360
Ayodhaya needs them

282
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,760
to prevent anyone
from defying Your Majesty.

283
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,560
Let's go.

284
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
What's the matter?

285
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,160
You seem troubled, as if keeping secrets.

286
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,120
Military affairs are not for women.

287
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,960
The Queen Consort
meddling in state matters

288
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,560
defies tradition.

289
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,200
The Queen Consort is wise

290
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,640
and learned in governance.

291
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,200
The King appreciates her greatly.

292
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,920
You know well

293
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,480
that the King, being a warrior,

294
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,920
does not strictly
follow the old traditions.

295
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,040
A woman too clever is dangerous to men.

296
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,840
The Queen descends
from the Lavo-Ayodhaya line.

297
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,480
Even though Lopburi
no longer wields power,

298
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,640
her knowledge of politics

299
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,440
has been nurtured from a young age,

300
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,960
and for what purpose?

301
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,560
The Queen is like a sharp blade

302
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,200
sent from Lopburi

303
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,360
to serve at the King’s side.

304
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,280
I'm afraid

305
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,400
if the King isn’t careful,
it could become dangerous.

306
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,480
I also

307
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,080
have never fully trusted her either.

308
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,160
If you feel this way,

309
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
keep a close watch on her.

310
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,880
If anything seems suspicious,

311
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,240
we will stop it before it grows.

312
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,880
What's wrong with me
taking an interest in political matters?

313
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
One day,

314
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,520
my son will sit on the throne.

315
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,000
How could I simply stand by?

316
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Wamon…

317
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,080
Wamon,

318
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,280
are you listening to me?

319
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,840
Chaophraya Mahasena

320
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,440
commands the military,

321
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,040
and Khun Phirenthorathep
is the King’s favorite.

322
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,280
Whatever they suggest, the King follows.

323
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,760
We cannot spare them.

324
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,760
I fear they may become a threat to us.

325
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,080
Then deal with them.

326
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,080
Khun Phirenthorathep

327
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,560
holds the title
of Chief of the Royal Guard,

328
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,040
and he’s a skilled warrior.

329
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
Getting rid of him

330
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,520
won’t be easy.

331
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,960
Don’t worry,

332
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,360
I already have a plan.

333
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,680
I must discuss important matters
with Mr. Seixas,

334
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,400
head of the mercenary forces.

335
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,520
The Governor of Chiang Kran
behaves this way?

336
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,840
Does he dare defy me?

337
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,520
Your Majesty,

338
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,719
the Governor of Chiang Kran
has failed to send the required tribute.

339
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,840
This is a blatant act
of rebellion against Ayodhaya.

340
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,280
If left unchecked,

341
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,880
others may follow.

342
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,679
Chiang Kran is a strategic city,
close to the Gulf of Mottama,

343
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,199
which is an important trading port.

344
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,760
If we don’t keep it under our control,

345
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,080
in the future,

346
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,840
if someone else takes it,

347
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,080
it could become
a powerful competitor in trade.

348
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,960
Khem,

349
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,840
take my command

350
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,080
and prepare the troops.

351
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,760
We march on Chiang Kran.

352
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,120
At your command, Your Majesty.

353
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,240
Is Ayodhaya going to war?

354
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,080
Jinda,

355
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,680
why are you here at the front?

356
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,760
Your Majesty has been
working tirelessly here

357
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,520
without rest or food.

358
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,560
As your wife,

359
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,480
how could I remain
in the palace in comfort?

360
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,200
It’s good that you’ve come.

361
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,520
Go and command the palace

362
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,560
to prepare provisions.

363
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

364
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,040
I will ensure everything
is ready by next month.

365
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,000
The Royal Astrologer
has not yet chosen an auspicious date.

366
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,200
How do you know I will march next month?

367
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,680
Next month begins the eleventh month,

368
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,960
the dry season

369
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,640
with no rain.
The water levels will be high.

370
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,600
Ideal for both land

371
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,400
and naval warfare.

372
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,800
King Tabengshweti
also has his eye on Chiang Kran.

373
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,920
We must strike first,

374
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,400
as soon as possible.

375
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,560
The best time to act

376
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,720
is when victory is certain.

377
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,200
If you want to win,

378
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,000
you must march

379
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,640
next month.

380
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,840
Look at that Khem.

381
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,200
I have Jinda as my precious wife,

382
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,640
and you as my most trusted general.

383
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,480
With the two of you,

384
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,840
I fear no one.

385
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,600
That’s not enough.

386
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,120
You need

387
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,240
Portuguese cannons

388
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,600
to ensure

389
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,960
Ayodhaya’s victory.

390
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,280
With all due respect

391
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,320
Your Majesty.

392
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,560
The auspicious date

393
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,880
for the march has been set.

394
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,320
It will be on Saturday, the 12th day
of the waxing moon in the eleventh month,

395
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,000
at the third hour.

396
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,800
Khun Phirenthorathep

397
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,680
will lead the vanguard,

398
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,320
while I will follow
with the main Royal Army.

399
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,520
Phraya Mahasena,

400
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,720
you will command the rearguard

401
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,720
to reinforce the main forces.

402
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,960
At Your Majesty’s command.

403
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,560
Domingos de Seixas,

404
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
head of the Portuguese mercenaries,

405
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,360
will accompany me
with the Portuguese troops.

406
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,520
Your men, armed with matchlock guns,

407
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,360
will strengthen Ayodhaya's forces.

408
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,000
Together,

409
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,520
we shall crush

410
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,480
Chiang Kran.

411
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,000
I congratulate you Seixas,

412
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,800
on serving closely with the King.

413
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,360
I owe my success

414
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,840
to you.

415
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,800
Not at all.

416
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,800
Your success

417
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,040
is due to the grace of Queen Srisudachan.

418
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,600
Remember this well.

419
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,080
Queen Srisudachan has shown mercy to you.

420
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,920
Soon,

421
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,800
you will be entrusted with great tasks.

422
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,680
If you remain loyal

423
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,360
and follow her commands,

424
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,400
your fame and fortune in Ayodhaya

425
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,560
will rival anyone's.

426
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,680
The King will lead the fleet

427
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,960
from Ayodhaya,

428
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,040
heading towards Phromburi

429
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,720
to rendezvous with Khun Phirenthorathep’s
forces at Bang Phutsa.

430
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,680
BANG PHUTSA

431
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,400
You must station our men in ambush there.

432
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,760
Act as if you intend to attack
upon His Majesty’s arrival.

433
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,000
We don’t have enough men

434
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,600
to harm the King.

435
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,400
My target

436
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,840
is Khun Phirenthorathep.

437
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,200
You must prepare the gunmen

438
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,480
to feign defense of the King.

439
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,440
In doing so,

440
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,440
the Portuguese
will earn His Majesty’s favor,

441
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,880
and Khun Phirenthorathep
will be eliminated in the process.

442
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,360
Instead of wasting our own Lopburi men,

443
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,840
we will use Seixas
to assassinate both the King

444
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,240
and Khun Phirenthorathep at once.

445
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,960
Will you really have the Portuguese

446
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,360
kill the King?

447
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,080
All I ask is that

448
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,440
you promise them titles

449
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,120
and permission to build churches

450
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,120
to worship their God freely.

451
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,640
With that, the Portuguese and their guns

452
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,920
will follow your every command.

453
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,120
No.

454
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,200
-Why not?
-Because I said no.

455
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,000
We can’t kill the King yet.

456
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,000
-The time hasn’t come.
-When will it come?

457
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,760
You’ve delayed this so many times.

458
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,880
When exactly will you act?

459
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,680
What's wrong?

460
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,280
I could hear from outside.

461
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,160
Khun Phirenthorathep
is the King’s favorite

462
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,480
and a maternal relative.

463
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,480
If he’s killed,
the King won’t remain silent.

464
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,000
He’ll tear the kingdom apart
to find the culprit.

465
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,000
Brahmin Wamon is right.

466
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,840
If you kill Khun Phirenthorathep,

467
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,200
you must also kill the King.

468
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,200
-I told you already--
-Why are we here?

469
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,880
You know it.

470
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,800
You’ve postponed for years without acting.

471
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,960
Or have you grown too soft-hearted?

472
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,640
-Don’t insult me like that.
-Then explain yourself

473
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,280
why…

474
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,760
Your Majesty,

475
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,440
I heard loud noises.

476
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,520
Did Brahmin Wamon

477
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,920
do something to displease you?

478
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,880
I was performing a lamp offering ceremony,

479
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,800
and

480
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Brahmin Wamon was assisting me

481
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,200
in praying for the King.

482
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,760
-But I heard--
-The ceremony is over.

483
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,560
Tubtim, let’s go.

484
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

485
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,960
Your Majesty,

486
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,760
I saw

487
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,480
Brahmin Wamon

488
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,480
act disrespectfully toward you.

489
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,480
Brahmin Wamon is my father's man.

490
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,000
I see him

491
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,680
as a brother.

492
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,000
His standing beside me

493
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,280
is no offense.

494
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,720
Your Majesty may show mercy,

495
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,000
but this violates palace law

496
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,080
and cannot be overlooked.

497
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,360
The Queen has asked

498
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,920
for clemency,

499
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,600
so I only flogged you as a lesson.

500
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,600
From now on,

501
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,200
you are dismissed

502
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,680
from overseeing the outer shrine.

503
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,880
You must leave the royal court of Ayodhaya

504
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,400
before dawn tomorrow.

505
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,360
Where are you going, Your Majesty?

506
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,120
I’m going to see Wamon.

507
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,880
If you are seen,

508
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,920
everyone involved will face execution,

509
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,320
including you.

510
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,400
Are you willing to risk it?

511
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,800
Please think carefully before you act.

512
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,240
Do not let your emotions lead.

513
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,960
He suffers because of me,

514
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,280
both in body and spirit.

515
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,040
If I don’t go apologize,

516
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,280
how could I live with myself?

517
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,720
-Move aside.
-No.

518
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,760
-Move, let me pass.
-No.

519
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,640
If you step over this threshold,

520
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,880
I won't be alive when you return.

521
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:45,920
Tubtim!

522
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,080
Wamon,

523
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,280
I have not yet had the chance

524
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,880
to request clemency for you.

525
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,680
His Majesty

526
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,680
is going to war.

527
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,320
When he returns,

528
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,760
I will find a way

529
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,680
to have you reinstated.

530
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,720
You are my strength.

531
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,400
Without you by my side,

532
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,200
I can’t go on alone.

533
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,720
My heart

534
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,360
belongs to you and you alone.

535
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,840
Is it done?

536
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,040
Is this my name?

537
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,960
Your name is Jinda,

538
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,880
and this seal bears
the image of a precious gem.

539
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,280
When we are apart,

540
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,280
if I wish to send you a letter,

541
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,040
I will use this seal

542
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,080
to ensure you know
the messages are truly from me.

543
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,520
Wamon.

544
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Wamon.

545
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,520
The King’s forces

546
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,240
are nearing Chiang Kran.

547
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,280
Father, please send our men
to deliver this message to Seixas.

548
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,920
A message?

549
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,760
A message from Queen Srisudachan.

550
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,680
IF YOU SUCCEED, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DESIRE,
I WILL GRANT IT TO YOUR SATISFACTION.

551
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,520
Queen Srisudachan

552
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,280
has issued an order to Domingo de Seixas,

553
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,880
the leader of the Portuguese mercenaries.

554
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,520
"You are to assassinate the individuals
who are my enemies,

555
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,000
as instructed by Brahmin Wamon.

556
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,840
If you succeed,

557
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,200
no matter what you desire in Ayodhaya,

558
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,760
I will grant it to your satisfaction."

559
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,920
Your Majesty,

560
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,880
there is a message from Chiang Kran.

561
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,840
As a token of gratitude to all

562
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,080
who have fought alongside me,

563
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,160
enduring hardships without complaint,

564
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,400
I shall reward

565
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,400
every general, officer, and soldier

566
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,800
with an amount equal

567
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,400
to your yearly wages.

568
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,120
It is a great royal kindness,
Your Majesty.

569
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,520
King Chairachathirat has won the battle

570
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,400
and killed the King of Chiang Kran.

571
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,960
Did you not order the Portuguese

572
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,400
to assassinate the King?

573
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,680
Why has this happened?

574
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,200
Someone has betrayed me.

575
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,400
Brahmin Wamon,

576
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,960
I requested a young man to attend to me,

577
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,600
but I never expected it to be you.

578
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,760
Traitor,

579
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,000
why did you not follow orders?

580
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,880
What are you saying?

581
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,880
-I did--
-If you did,

582
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,960
why is the King victorious
and returning from war?

583
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,520
-I followed the Queen’s orders.
-Lies.

584
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,160
The content of the message

585
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,640
was to kill the King.

586
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,880
No, that is not true.

587
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,960
Listen to me, Brahmin Wamon.

588
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,280
I did not lie.

589
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,000
There were two messages.

590
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,040
After the first one arrived,
this second message

591
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,000
followed a few days later.

592
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,240
I order you

593
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,120
to use your skills

594
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,000
and the power of your firearms

595
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,320
to fully protect

596
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,360
King Chairachathirat.

597
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,560
If the king returns to Ayodhaya

598
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,680
victorious and unharmed,

599
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,920
I shall reward you

600
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
and your companions

601
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,640
to your satisfaction.

602
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,080
I don’t understand.

603
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,360
You are now the Queen consort,

604
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,880
more powerful than any woman in Ayodhaya.

605
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,120
What more do you seek
to gain by claiming the throne?

606
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,200
I am not doing this for myself.

607
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,680
I do it for my father.

608
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,440
Sooner or later,

609
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,960
Ayodhaya will have a king
with half Lavo blood,

610
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,160
which is Prince Yod Fah.

611
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,760
Or are you not satisfied?

612
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,560
Do you intend

613
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,600
to kill the King

614
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,200
to reunite with your lover?

615
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,280
Is that your true goal?

616
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,160
She told me she only needed time

617
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,440
to wait for Prince Yod Fah to grow up.

618
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,320
That’s just a lie to deceive fools.

619
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,960
You were arrogant and ignored what I said.

620
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,040
If Prince Yod Fah were your child,

621
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,320
she wouldn’t have delayed this long.

622
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,080
But I don’t believe she’s changed.

623
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,120
I will speak to her
and discover the truth.

624
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,800
How will you get there?

625
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,680
You’ve been banished
from the Royal Palace.

626
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,040
Ok Khun, this way Sir.

627
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,960
This way.

628
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,800
I still have a way.

629
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,760
Here, harder.

630
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,080
Huh.

631
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,160
You…

632
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,080
You two, leave.

633
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,880
So, this is the one in charge of the outer

634
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,120
and inner shrines?

635
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,160
If the Lord Chamberlain finds out

636
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,080
that you two

637
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,760
have secretly indulged in forbidden acts,

638
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,440
you’ll both be flogged with leather whips

639
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,160
and branded around your necks for shame.

640
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,080
I surrender! I surrender!

641
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,600
What do you want?

642
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,640
I’ll give you anything.

643
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,560
Since returning from the battlefield,

644
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,560
Your Majesty hasn’t had
a proper night’s sleep.

645
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,880
I must have committed many sins.

646
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,360
Your Majesty, I’ve obtained
special incense from the Portuguese.

647
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,520
They say it has extraordinary properties.

648
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,800
The smoke can heal

649
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,520
and bring relaxation.

650
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,560
What else?

651
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,400
With your royal permission,

652
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,040
I wish to summon
the Royal Musicians, Your Majesty.

653
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,400
I have arranged

654
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,840
for the Royal Musicians
to perform a lullaby

655
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,680
to help ease you into sleep.

656
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,320
Who are you?

657
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,000
I don’t recognize your face.

658
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,840
With all due respect,

659
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,400
I am

660
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,440
Wamon, ranked Phanbutsrithep,

661
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,720
caretaker of the outer shrine.

662
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,960
With your permission,
I will perform a musical piece

663
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,080
and tell a tale for your entertainment.

664
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,120
To claim the throne of Ayodhaya,
many more must die.

665
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,200
If they do not die, then we will.

666
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,200
People in the palace have died
without any trace or cause.

667
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,000
Chom is not the first.

668
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,040
I humbly request royal permission

669
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,880
to bring someone in
to be presented before you, Your Majesty.

670
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,160
Wait for the day
when the bloodline of Lavo

671
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,480
shall sit upon the throne of Ayodhaya.

672
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,040
Prince Yod Fah is not
in the royal chamber, Your Majesty.

673
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,960
Your Majesty, Chuen and I
will search for him immediately…

674
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,600
My child has disappeared.

675
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,840
Why can’t I go too?

676
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,720
