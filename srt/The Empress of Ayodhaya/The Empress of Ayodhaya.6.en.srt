00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,440
The series "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,640
was inspired by
the history of Thao Sri Sudachan.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,880
The events, characters, behaviors,
and details in this story

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,200
are interpreted, expanded upon,
or newly created

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,080
for entertainment purposes

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,079
and are not entirely based on
true historical events.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,560
The creators are aware that some events

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,120
or actions may spark criticism,

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,840
but we affirm that the production

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,280
of "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,640
was made with good intentions.
Beyond entertainment,

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,320
the aim is to encourage viewers
to take an interest in history.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,160
After watching, if viewers are interested,

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,880
they can seek
additional knowledge from experts

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,920
or historians to gain an accurate
understanding of Ayutthaya history.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,080
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,280
My apologies, Your Majesty.

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,640
That's enough for now.

20
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,280
What story are you going to tell?

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,040
The story I will tell tonight

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,480
comes from the Kakati Jataka.

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,800
Once, the Bodhisattva was born as a King

24
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,320
of Benares,

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,360
with a queen named Kakati,

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,760
who was of extraordinary beauty.

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
One day,

28
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,240
a Garuda king

29
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,560
disguised as a man,

30
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,800
played dice with the King.

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,400
Upon seeing Kakati, he became enamored

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,920
and abducted her to his Vimana Chim Phli.

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,440
The

34
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,200
Bodhisattva

35
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh

36
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,600
Oh

37
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,800
Was reborn

38
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,280
Oh

39
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,480
as Suparna

40
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,680
Oh

41
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,920
Nara

42
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,960
Upon hearing the song,

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,240
the Garuda King realized
it was about Queen Kakati.

44
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,560
Mockingly, he remarked that

45
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,880
no human could cross the seven seas
to reach his Vimana.

46
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,800
Nata Kuvera the Gandharva

47
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,680
then retorted with a laugh,

48
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,640
saying that he had crossed the seven seas
to reach Vimana Chim Plhi…

49
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
carried by a foolish bird.

50
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,400
The assembly, upon hearing this

51
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,360
Broke into laughter

52
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,920
Inserting

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,040
A mocking remark

54
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,680
To reveal the truth

55
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,600
My Queen!

56
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,480
I heard a scream. What’s happening?

57
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,600
The Queen Consort Srisudachan

58
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,640
sent me to inform Lord Phan Butsrithep

59
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,680
that she will come to pray.

60
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,880
Please prepare
the ceremonial items for the ritual.

61
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
How insolent! The Queen Consort is coming,

62
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,800
yet Lord Phan Butsrithep
is not here to receive her?

63
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,520
Do you know where he is?

64
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,640
I truly do not, Your Majesty.

65
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,520
Wamon is purposely avoiding me.
He must be angry.

66
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,000
Please, calm down first.

67
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,800
Since he left Ayodhaya,

68
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,600
he hasn’t responded to my letters.

69
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,480
Now that he has returned,
he’s been appointed

70
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,160
as Phan Butsrithep,
yet he didn’t inform me.

71
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,520
When I went to see him

72
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
he purposely avoided me.

73
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,840
Could it be

74
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,200
that he knows I betrayed him?

75
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,160
Please, calm down.

76
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,680
I will speak with him this evening
to clarify everything.

77
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,280
No.

78
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,880
I need to take Prince Yod Fah

79
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,320
to see the King this evening.

80
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,400
Chuen!

81
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Chuen!

82
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,320
Yes, Your Majesty?

83
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,120
Go fetch Prince Yod Fah for me.

84
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,160
Prince Yod Fah is not
in the chamber, Your Majesty.

85
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,560
He went out with Chom.

86
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,080
Where did Chom take Prince Yod Fah?

87
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,680
I do not know, Your Majesty.

88
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,160
Chom has also disappeared.

89
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,320
Wait!

90
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,720
You cannot go without an escort.
It is improper.

91
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,760
You are too slow. My child is missing

92
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,640
and Wamon has disappeared as well.

93
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,520
Are you worried that
Prince Yod Fah is with Wamon?

94
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
I don’t know.

95
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,240
Perhaps Prince Yod Fah
simply went out to play.

96
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,720
But I don’t feel at ease.

97
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,400
Your Majesty.

98
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,960
Your Majesty.

99
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,360
Please stay here.

100
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
Chuen and I will find him

101
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,960
-and bring him back immediately.
-My child is missing.

102
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,520
Why can't I go too?

103
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,880
Your Majesty,

104
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,880
with all due respect

105
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,760
I didn’t mean any disrespect,

106
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,960
but I heard you say
Prince Yod Fah is missing.

107
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,680
Prince Yod Fah just went out to play.
I’m sending people to bring him back.

108
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,320
But I heard he was missing.

109
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,880
You cannot forget

110
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,160
that Prince Yod Fah is
within the inner royal court.

111
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,160
It is my duty to ensure his protection.

112
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,960
No need to worry Madame Sae.

113
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,240
Prince Yod Fah only went out
to play as children do.

114
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,560
Then

115
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,160
let him enjoy himself for now.

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,160
He is still a child.

117
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,880
No harm will come to him now.

118
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,680
However, once he is declared Crown Prince

119
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,840
danger will come from all sides.

120
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,600
I will keep that in mind.
Come Tubtim, let’s go.

121
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,840
Once we find Prince Yod Fah,
I’ll discipline him properly.

122
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,240
Someone saw Chom

123
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,760
heading toward Nong Wai Pond.

124
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,160
There she is!

125
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
Who gave you permission to come
to the front court? Where is my child?

126
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
He went down to play
in the boat, Your Majesty.

127
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,800
Prince Yod Fah!

128
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Mother!

129
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
Hold my hand.

130
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,280
Watch your step, Your Highness.

131
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,800
Mother!

132
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,320
This is beautiful my Son.
Let’s offer it to the temple later.

133
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,720
Chuen, escort Prince Yod Fah
back to the chamber.

134
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,880
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-You too.

135
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,320
Next time, take me
to pick more lotus flowers.

136
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,440
Yes, Your Highness.

137
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,320
I will keep watch.

138
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,360
The Queen Consort should discuss
whatever you need now.

139
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,440
Prince Yod Fah wanted
to go on a boat, so I arranged it.

140
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,840
You should not do this.

141
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,280
I just wanted to foster a bond.

142
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
If we are to become family,

143
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,920
it would be better
not to harbor ill feelings.

144
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,880
Why are you so worried?

145
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,320
Prince Yod Fah is still a child.
Once the king passes,

146
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,440
will you leave him fatherless?

147
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,720
Let’s discuss us instead.

148
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,800
You’ve been gone
without responding to my letters.

149
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,560
Now that you’ve returned,
why didn’t you inform me?

150
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,360
I didn’t answer because I wanted
to speak with you face to face.

151
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,200
PROTECT KING CHAIRACHATHIRAT

152
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,960
By acting this way,
what are you trying to achieve?

153
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,240
Are you angry with me

154
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,640
because you acted in my name
to assassinate the King?

155
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,920
Seixas, that two-faced fool…

156
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,080
-He must have told you everything.
-Yes.

157
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,000
Otherwise, how would I know

158
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,960
-you disobeyed my orders?
-I grew tired of waiting.

159
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,200
From the time you became a concubine

160
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,280
it’s been almost five years.

161
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,440
How long do you expect me to wait?

162
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,080
Does your heart still belong to me?

163
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,360
Since the day
we released the sky lanterns…

164
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,240
my heart has belonged to no one but you.

165
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,760
Let’s make a wish together

166
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,480
hoping all bad Karma
floats away with this lantern.

167
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,240
You took a long time to make a wish.

168
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
What burden weighs so heavily on you?

169
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,840
Loving you

170
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,160
when I shouldn’t,
already weighs heavily enough.

171
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,160
Then if loving you is a sin

172
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,160
I’m willing to suffer in hell
for all eternity.

173
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,240
If you go to hell

174
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,400
I will no longer wish to ascend to heaven.

175
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,720
My love for you

176
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,760
remains the same

177
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,240
but Ayodhaya is surrounded by war.

178
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,080
-We cannot do as we please.
-Ayodhaya will never be free of war.

179
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,360
With its wealth and resources,
everyone desires it.

180
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,320
You wait for Prince Yod Fah to grow,

181
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,400
but what if something happens
to him in the meantime?

182
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,080
-Are you cursing my child?
-I’m only speaking the truth.

183
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,400
If you delay any longer

184
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,640
it will ruin everything.

185
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,840
Someone is coming. You must leave now.

186
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,160
Your Majesty,

187
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,400
why have you come to the front court?

188
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,480
Didn’t I just explain to you?

189
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,000
Or is your hearing not good?

190
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,600
Searching for the Prince
in the front court

191
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,319
is already inappropriate.

192
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,680
But I just

193
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,119
met Chuen and Chom.

194
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
They were escorting the Prince back.

195
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,359
Why are you

196
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,880
still here
in this improper place by yourself?

197
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,160
I am not a child.

198
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,880
I am the Queen Consort

199
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,880
and I know what is proper and what is not.

200
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,640
Do not overstep your boundaries Sae.

201
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,880
Pack your things and leave the palace

202
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,280
for the crime of taking
Prince Yod Fah to the front court.

203
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,040
But Brahmin Wamon--

204
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,360
Shut up!

205
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,720
Do not speak anyone’s name.

206
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,720
It’s because of you

207
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,240
that the Queen
had to go to the front court.

208
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,360
If anyone suspects whom she met,

209
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,600
we will all be ruined.

210
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,440
Now, go pack and leave!

211
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,200
Come Chom, I’ll see you to the gate.

212
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,000
No need.

213
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,440
It will cause a fuss.

214
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,320
Chom knows the way to the gate.

215
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,040
I bid you farewell.

216
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,800
Here, take this with you.

217
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,440
When you reach Lopburi, you won’t starve.

218
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,480
Hello.

219
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,920
Come on.

220
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,840
Alright.

221
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,080
Come here.

222
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,880
-Alright?
-Not yet.

223
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,880
Is it alright?

224
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,320
Where will you follow her to?

225
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,360
I’ll follow until she stops.

226
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,720
She has stopped.

227
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,040
Eat first,

228
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,880
then I have some questions for you.

229
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,840
You are a servant who followed
Queen Srisudachan from Lopburi,

230
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,440
so you should know
what is proper and what is not.

231
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,560
Why did you dare to take Prince Yod Fah
out so far to the front court?

232
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,200
Who did you meet?

233
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,520
I…

234
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,040
I didn’t…

235
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,440
Answer me. Stop stammering.

236
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,280
Chom.

237
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,200
Chom, what’s wrong?

238
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,880
Chom! Chom!

239
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,480
What’s happening to you?

240
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,960
Chom! Chom!

241
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,240
She's dead.

242
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,200
She just collapsed and died.

243
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,800
That is strange.

244
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,960
Go and inform Khun Phirenthorathep.

245
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,600
Tell him I wish to discuss something.

246
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,800
Yes, my Lady.

247
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,360
I sent people to examine Chom’s body

248
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,880
but they couldn’t find any cause of death.

249
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,440
She was young and healthy.
How could she just die like that?

250
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,520
But…

251
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,360
But what?

252
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,240
People in the palace have died

253
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,120
without any trace or cause.

254
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,560
Chom is not the first.

255
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,960
Who do you think is behind

256
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,720
these sudden, unexplained deaths?

257
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,760
I’m not sure

258
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,280
but from now on, everyone in the palace

259
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,880
should be cautious.

260
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,480
I don’t know what caused Chom’s death.

261
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,440
You are wise. Can you not make a guess?

262
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,720
You’re the one who sent Chom to die
outside the palace. How would I know?

263
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,680
Buy some fermented rice from me Dear.

264
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,240
Grandma!

265
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,320
Brahmin Wamon has ordered you
to wait at the city gate.

266
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,320
There will be a merchant’s cart
heading to Lopburi.

267
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,320
Go with them. You'll be safe.

268
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,840
Thank you.

269
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,280
Here, take this

270
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,040
and wait at the city gate.

271
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,200
If I had to guess,

272
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,200
I’d say she choked to death
on something she ate.

273
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,840
Like Khun Pong and Khun Ban, right?

274
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,760
What do you mean?

275
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,760
I heard that Khun Pong and Khun Ban
also died without cause.

276
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,600
Perhaps the thing that got stuck
in Chom’s throat is the same as theirs.

277
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,360
Open the door!

278
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,840
I apologize for disturbing you
at this late hour.

279
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,040
If it’s the King’s business,
I am happy to oblige.

280
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,040
Then let’s go now.

281
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,120
Wait, Khem.

282
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,160
Though I am no longer the favored consort
of King Chairachathirat,

283
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,200
I am still the daughter
of Ok Ya Sukhothai.

284
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,520
Please don’t make me
meet anyone in such a manner.

285
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,040
I, La-Ongkham, humbly ask for forgiveness

286
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,000
from you, Thao Intharasurenthorn.

287
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,560
I have repented for my past wrongdoings

288
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,000
and will no longer commit such evils.

289
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,800
Please,

290
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,280
grant me your forgiveness.

291
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,760
You’ve paid for your misdeeds.

292
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,360
Let bygones be bygones.

293
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,200
I forgive you.

294
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,200
Since Lady La-Ongkham has shown remorse,

295
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,600
I believe

296
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,880
she should be allowed to serve the King

297
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,360
to atone for her past sins.

298
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,760
If it is for the King’s benefit,

299
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,600
I will serve

300
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,640
without hesitation.

301
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,240
Sae, you’re the one with the plan.

302
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,280
Speak.

303
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,680
Recently, people in the palace

304
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
have been dying mysteriously.

305
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,880
Khun Phirenthorathep and I suspect that

306
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,320
someone is using poison
in the royal court.

307
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,160
Thao Intharasurenthorn fears that
this threat may reach the King

308
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,600
and wishes to prevent it.

309
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,000
What would you have me do?

310
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,040
This task

311
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,640
may cost you your life.

312
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,040
Are you willing to take it?

313
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,520
Keep the ribs.

314
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,640
Wash this carefully.

315
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,640
Take this.

316
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,880
Alright, chop this.

317
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,680
Today seems busier than usual.
What’s going on?

318
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,680
A Chinese merchant

319
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,240
gifted us an entire pig,

320
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,360
so we’re cooking up a feast with it.

321
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,000
I’ll help with the cooking.

322
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,200
No need to trouble yourself,
Thao Inthratevee.

323
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,880
Thao Intharasurenthorn, are you
cooking for the King yourself today?

324
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,200
Not just today. From now on

325
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,800
I’ll be preparing

326
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,560
the King’s meals personally.

327
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,440
Take the troops from this side
and move them to that side.

328
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,720
Over here, it’s the waterway.

329
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,840
I’ve made

330
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,760
a Buan curry for you, Your Majesty.

331
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,360
Perfect. That’s my favorite.

332
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,360
Thank you.

333
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,400
This is not all my loyalty yet,
Your Majesty.

334
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,920
I humbly ask

335
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,440
to bring someone before you.

336
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,720
Who?

337
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,000
Chittrawadee!

338
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,760
What is this?

339
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,960
Lady La-Ongkham

340
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,280
was stripped of her title
as Thao Si Chulalak

341
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,000
and sent to be imprisoned as punishment.

342
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,560
She has now repented,

343
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,400
and I ask Your Majesty

344
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,840
to pardon her and allow her to serve

345
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,120
as a way to atone.

346
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,560
Chittrawadee,

347
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,080
you bear no grudge against her.

348
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,680
That’s good of you.

349
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,720
But do you expect me to accept
the person who killed my child

350
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,560
back into the palace as a concubine?
I cannot.

351
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,120
With all due respect, Your Majesty.

352
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,440
I don’t dare dream
of being your concubine again.

353
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,080
I only wish to serve you faithfully.

354
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,080
That's all I wish.

355
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,280
Thao Intharasurenthorn,
why did you bring Lady La-Ongkham here?

356
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,720
What task do you intend for her?

357
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,960
There have been mysterious deaths
in the palace,

358
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,880
possibly

359
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,040
due to poison.

360
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,000
I fear for the King’s safety.

361
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,320
So, I would like Lady La-Ongkham to serve.

362
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,200
From now on,

363
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,640
Lady La-Ongkham

364
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,040
will taste all the King’s meals

365
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,760
before they are served.

366
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,800
What is this madness?

367
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,560
-Summon Khem immediately.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

368
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,760
How are you managing this palace,
letting poisoners slip in like this?

369
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,640
It’s true some palace members have died,
but they all died outside the palace.

370
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,360
Thao Intharasurenthorn

371
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,360
bringing Lady La-Ongkham
to test the King’s meals

372
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,760
seems to be an overreaction.

373
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,400
Better to be safe than sorry.

374
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,840
Enough!

375
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,200
No more talking.

376
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,240
La-Ongkham,

377
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,200
if someone tries to poison me,

378
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,080
you will die in my place?

379
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

380
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,400
Eat it.

381
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,600
Eat it.

382
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,960
Eat it.

383
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,520
Swallow it.

384
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,120
Swallow it.

385
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,960
The King no longer trusts anyone.

386
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,199
He keeps calling for La-Ongkham.

387
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,440
And it’s your fault.

388
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,080
Don’t think I’m naive.

389
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:50,760
I know you were the one
who poisoned those people.

390
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,960
How else could I have returned
if Khun Pong and Khun Ban were alive?

391
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,280
-And what about Chom?
-If we had let Chom live,

392
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,360
Madame Sae would have whipped her

393
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,720
until she spilled all our secrets.

394
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,880
To claim the throne of Ayodhaya,

395
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,200
many more will have to die.

396
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,960
If they do not die,

397
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,000
then we will.

398
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,400
Or do you not understand?

399
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,240
Stop.

400
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,240
Who is this Phan Butsrithep?

401
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,920
He’s a Brahmin from Lopburi,
the same place as the Queen Consort.

402
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,200
Let's go.

403
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,520
Saen,

404
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,880
assign three or four men
to guard this place.

405
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,920
What’s going on here?

406
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,880
Ugh!

407
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,000
What's happened?

408
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,840
I…

409
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,240
The Chinese brothel owner mentioned that

410
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,000
a man dressed as a Brahmin

411
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,160
visited Khun Pong and Khun Ban
before they died.

412
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,600
A few days later,

413
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,800
a Brahmin named Wamon

414
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,920
was promoted to Phan Butsrithep,

415
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,040
taking charge of the outer shrine
in place of Khun Ban.

416
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,320
It seems suspicious.

417
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
Follow me.

418
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,360
Ok Phra!

419
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,640
Ok Phra!

420
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,520
Ok Phra!

421
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,480
Go summon Wasuthep immediately.

422
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,000
Yes Sir.

423
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,680
Teacher, how is my father?

424
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,880
Father, it’s me.

425
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,480
It's me.

426
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,600
It's me, Jinda.

427
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,160
Jin… Jinda.

428
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,520
My father is gravely ill,
why didn’t anyone tell me earlier?

429
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
It was Ok Phra’s order.

430
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,560
He didn’t want the Queen Consort to know.

431
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,080
Why not?

432
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,400
Because

433
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,960
he no longer wishes to live.

434
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,720
What?

435
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,920
Teacher Wasuthep,
you’re a respected elder.

436
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,960
Why are you saying such nonsense?

437
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,120
For the five years

438
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,120
since the Queen Consort
gave birth to Prince Yod Fah,

439
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,640
Ok Phra has counted the days.

440
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,640
Longing for you
to return to Ayodhaya as a victor.

441
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,160
I was waiting for Prince Yod Fah
to grow up before taking action.

442
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,520
For every year that Prince Yod Fah grows,

443
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,080
Ok Phra ages.

444
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,200
If Your Majesty continues waiting
for Prince Yod Fah to grow,

445
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,160
Ok Phra may not live long enough.

446
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,600
Living without hope

447
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,160
is worse than dying.

448
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,800
JINDA

449
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Hurry back to Ayodhaya

450
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,360
and present this letter to the King

451
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,240
and inform him that I request permission

452
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,920
to stay and care for my father
until his condition improves.

453
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

454
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,680
And tell Wamon too.

455
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

456
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,560
Tell him to come quickly.

457
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,880
I have important matters to discuss.

458
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,440
Don’t be hasty, Your Majesty.

459
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,320
Ok Phra’s condition might improve
with the right medicine.

460
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,120
-Please don’t rush into anything.
-It’s my fault.

461
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,720
It's all my fault.

462
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,560
I’ve been delaying too long.

463
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,600
We’ve wasted so much time.

464
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,520
Jinda.

465
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,040
Father.

466
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,720
Father.

467
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,880
I promised you.

468
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,120
I will keep my promise.

469
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,000
You must take care of yourself.

470
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,280
Wait for the day when our Lavo bloodline

471
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,720
shall sit upon the throne of Ayodhaya.

472
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,880
Did you hear me Father?

473
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,360
Please hurry, Thao Inthratevee.

474
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,400
The mango trees
are heavy with fruit this year.

475
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,840
There’s so much we’ve had
to pickle some to preserve it.

476
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,880
Yes, my Lady.

477
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,840
Sweet and sour,

478
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,800
the Queen Consort would love it
if she tasted it.

479
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,240
The Queen Consort is in Lopburi.

480
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,840
By the time she returns,
there might not be any left.

481
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,760
You’re right. She’s not here now.

482
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,720
What's the matter, my Lady?

483
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,680
I have a stomachache.

484
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,760
Perhaps that pickled mango
I tasted earlier

485
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,080
was cursed.

486
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,880
Kawao,

487
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,680
go summon the Royal Physician to prepare
some medicine for Thao Inthratevee.

488
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,560
No need.

489
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,640
Thank you my Lady. I have some medicine
back at my residence.

490
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,160
-Let’s go Thongdee.
-Yes, my Lady.

491
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,720
Phan Butsrithep, Thao Inthratevee is here.

492
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,640
How may I serve you, Thao Inthratevee?

493
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,880
Queen Thao Srisudachan and I

494
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,760
are like sisters.

495
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,160
I noticed that she often visits
this sacred site for blessings.

496
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,920
I thought I might do the same.

497
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,560
The Queen Consort
is not here at the moment.

498
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,720
Can you conduct a ceremony for me

499
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,600
similar to the one you perform for her?

500
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,920
This way please. I will do it for you.

501
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,080
Wait.

502
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,640
The Queen consort told me that in Lopburi,

503
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,680
you use Khmer script. Is that true?

504
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,560
-Yes, my Lady.
-How does it look?

505
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,160
Can you write something for me

506
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,440
Phan Butsrithep?

507
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,080
What would you like me to write?

508
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,080
Perhaps a prayer.

509
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,320
Yes my Lady.

510
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,360
The script looks strange indeed.

511
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,600
My Lady, what was that about earlier?

512
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,840
What do you mean?

513
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,280
You seem

514
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,720
so fond of Phan Butsrithep.

515
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,280
That was my intention,
to keep him from suspecting

516
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,400
why I suddenly became interested
in Khmer script.

517
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,960
It’s unmistakable. The handwriting,

518
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,120
the scent of incense on the paper.

519
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,840
Phan Butsrithep is the author
of this secret letter.

520
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,840
He is Jinda’s lover.

521
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,720
The Queen Consort
brought her lover into the palace.

522
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,720
Such audacity!

523
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,640
The plan is unfolding as expected.

524
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,680
Jinda is preparing to act
against King Chairachathirat.

525
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,800
I know my daughter well.

526
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,840
She isn’t after power,

527
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,920
but she does everything
for the people she loves.

528
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,160
Luang Kai, Luang Suk,

529
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,600
Lord Wasuthep,

530
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,880
prepare our men.

531
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,600
Sooner or later

532
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,400
we will kill King Chairachathirat

533
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,240
and reclaim the throne of Ayodhaya

534
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,880
for ourselves.

535
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,480
I have resolved that

536
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,480
even if I wasn’t born

537
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,520
under the royal canopy,
I will die beneath it

538
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,360
like royalty.

539
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,880
Let all of you be witnesses.

540
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,280
After killing King Chairachathirat,

541
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,280
I will crown myself

542
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,080
as the next king of Ayodhaya.

543
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,680
Tubtim,

544
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,360
I’ve been looking for you.

545
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,080
Lady Jinda…

546
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,320
Queen Consort.

547
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,600
I’ve had the servants
prepare lots of ripe fruits.

548
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,800
Tomorrow when you return, take them to
Prince Yod Fah. Tell him they are from me.

549
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,160
From here to Ayodhaya,

550
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,600
it’s only half a day by cart and boat.

551
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,360
Why don’t you return to Ayodhaya with me?
You can come back later.

552
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,480
Teacher wants me to stay
a day or two longer

553
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,640
so I can think about what to do next.

554
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,360
Walls have ears. Doors have eyes.

555
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,080
Once Prince Yod Fah grows up,

556
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,320
if he learns

557
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,800
that his mother and her lover
conspired to kill his father,

558
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,160
what will you say?

559
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,920
Parents are owed
the greatest debt of gratitude,

560
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,240
but Ok Phra cannot live forever.

561
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,920
Before you act,

562
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,560
please think carefully.

563
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,760
If your actions for your father’s sake
cause you to lose your son,

564
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,200
will you still do it?
Please think carefully.

565
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,280
What? Stop!

566
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,760
What’s going on?

567
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,560
It looks like bandits.

568
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,400
This is a royal procession.
Don’t be insolent!

569
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,280
Hey!

570
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,320
-Ugh!
-Go!

571
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,880
-Hey!
-Ugh!

572
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,800
May the Queen Consort succeed

573
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,720
in whatever she undertakes.

574
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,920
Use this oil.

575
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,600
These betel nuts are specially scented

576
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,240
to be offered to Your Majesty.

577
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,760
Anything offered for consumption

578
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,800
must be checked by me first.

579
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,440
