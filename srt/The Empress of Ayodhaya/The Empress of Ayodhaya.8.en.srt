00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,480
The series "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,800
was inspired by
the history of Thao Sri Sudachan.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,520
The events, characters, behaviors,
and details in this story

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,600
are interpreted, expanded upon,
or newly created

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,880
for entertainment purposes

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,240
and are not entirely based on
true historical events.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,360
The creators are aware that some events

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,160
or actions may spark criticism,

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,000
but we affirm that the production

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,960
of "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,840
was made with good intentions.
Beyond entertainment,

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,120
the aim is to encourage viewers
to take an interest in history.

14
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,400
After watching, if viewers are interested,

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,600
they can seek
additional knowledge from experts

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,920
or historians to gain accurate
understanding of Ayutthaya history.

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,680
Go!

18
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
-Go!
-Go!

19
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,360
Go!

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,040
-Go!
-Get away!

21
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,200
Get out!

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,200
Go! Get out!

23
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,600
Get out of the way!

24
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,920
-Go!
-Sit down!

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
Get down!

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,800
-Go!
-Go!

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,960
Sit down!

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,600
Your Majesty.

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,480
Muen Decho, you don’t need to do all this.

30
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,320
Go on with your task
of gathering the people.

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,640
I am here by royal permission
to meet with only one person.

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,080
Teacher, where is Tubtim?

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,520
Teacher,

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,000
where is Tubtim?

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,560
Fak is also gone.

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,320
Fak neglected her duties
until Tubtim became gravely ill.

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,320
On the night Ok Phra
was struck by the cursed poison,

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,880
everything turned to chaos,

39
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,680
and Fak seized her chance to flee.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,320
And Tubtim?

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,480
She has passed.

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,480
This is my fault.
I should never have left you here.

43
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,560
Because of me,

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,280
you met this fate.

45
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,880
Tubtim…

46
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,960
It's all because of me.

47
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,480
If this letter reaches you,

48
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,440
read it and then destroy it.

49
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,600
Let no one know about it,

50
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,880
for those around you

51
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
are two-faced,

52
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,480
deceiving you to serve their own ends.

53
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,840
Ok Phra Lopburi aspires to the throne,

54
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,800
and if he succeeds,

55
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,600
he will raise Wamon to his position
as Ok Phra Lopburi

56
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,360
and offer you as a reward.

57
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
As for Prince Yod Fah,

58
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,960
if he is not stripped of his title

59
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,920
and demoted,

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,280
then there will surely be lives at stake.

61
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,120
So this is what my father

62
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,320
intended for his own bloodline?

63
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,560
Brahmin Wasuthep hoped that
Brahmin Wamon would reign alongside you.

64
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,440
When he realized
Ok Phra Lopburi had betrayed him,

65
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,080
he nursed a grudge

66
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,760
and persuaded your father
to create a cursed potion

67
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,120
to kill King Chairachathirat.

68
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,000
He prepared it with ghost bone

69
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,360
but also added
your father’s hair and nails.

70
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,720
If His Majesty dies
from the potion, so be it.

71
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,640
But if he survives,

72
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,480
then the one who must die

73
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,480
will be Ok Phra Lopburi.

74
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,360
Father.

75
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,000
Teacher.

76
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,120
Who can I trust?

77
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,160
My Dear.

78
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,760
Did you know of this too?

79
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,160
Let go of me.

80
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,000
I am no different from you,

81
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,760
just another pawn in the game.

82
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,160
No one loves me.

83
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,320
Everyone has used me.

84
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,160
Not a single person truly loves me.

85
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
You have me.

86
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,360
I have loved you unwaveringly,

87
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,640
even though you have changed.

88
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,600
I had no choice.

89
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,200
I had no choice.

90
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,720
I had to do everything

91
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,760
to make His Majesty consume
the cursed potion from Father and Teacher.

92
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,360
I fought, I did everything.

93
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,280
I fought with all my might.

94
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,800
The more I think,

95
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,280
the more it torments me.

96
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,680
My Love,

97
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,160
now Ok Phra is gone,

98
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,720
and my father is in hiding,
fearing royal retribution.

99
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,520
No one dictates our lives any longer.

100
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,760
Let us plan our future,
just the two of us.

101
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,400
Do we even have a future left?

102
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,600
I can’t see it.

103
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,240
I am sentenced

104
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,200
to confinement in my quarters.

105
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,240
I won't see the sun or the moon

106
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,320
for two years.

107
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,720
Let me go.

108
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,000
Jinda,

109
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,280
you swore before the holy Buddha that

110
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,400
you would seize Ayodhaya’s throne
from King Chairachathirat

111
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,160
and return to be with me.

112
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,480
Would you break your vow, my Jinda?

113
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
I have sought forgiveness.

114
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,640
I beg you

115
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,920
and the divine forces

116
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
to forgive me.

117
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,080
Jinda, you…

118
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,080
You are the love of my life.

119
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,880
But in this lifetime,
my fate is too narrow.

120
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,680
I cannot be the wife of the man I love.

121
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,240
I surrender to fate.

122
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,000
All I want is
to fulfill my duty as a mother

123
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,160
and raise Prince Yod Fah to grow strong

124
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,520
and become

125
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,880
the next King of Ayodhaya.

126
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
That alone will bring me peace.

127
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,680
I knew it.

128
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,320
This is exactly what I expected.

129
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,560
Women are too fickle

130
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,280
to be entrusted with significant matters.

131
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,520
You’ve hurt her enough already.

132
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,720
Let her go Father.

133
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,520
If her resentment grows, she might
reveal the truth to King Chairachathirat,

134
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,160
which would bring us trouble.

135
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,200
So, what will we do next?

136
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,480
We have an escape route prepared,
don’t we?

137
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,920
Father, Father!

138
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,560
Where did you get this earring?

139
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,120
Brahmin Wamon.

140
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,520
Even though we have different mothers,
we share the same father.

141
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,920
You may call me Brother.

142
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,520
I had Chan gather people

143
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,240
because I knew that one day

144
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,600
we’d have to take bold action.

145
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,640
I am ready.

146
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
It just depends on when you are,

147
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,560
Brother Wamon.

148
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,520
SIXTH MONTH, 2084 BE

149
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,480
My Lady.

150
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,160
Wait, my Lady.

151
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,120
Thao Inthratevee.

152
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,320
-Are you planning to fly there?
-Come on Thongdee.

153
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,000
If we take our time like this,
we’ll never make it.

154
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,440
The baby has been born.

155
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,800
Lady Jinda.

156
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,960
A healthy little boy,

157
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,960
as charming as can be.

158
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,120
This pregnancy

159
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,560
has taken a toll on me.

160
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,600
I’ve had constant nausea,

161
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,360
and I couldn’t eat or sleep well.

162
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,240
That’s why he’s so small.

163
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,760
Has he been named yet?

164
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,680
What shall we call him?

165
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
I’ve sent a request to the King

166
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,560
for a name

167
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,160
for our Son.

168
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,760
But since I was punished

169
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,960
and confined here,

170
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,280
he hasn’t set foot here once.

171
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,200
I’m not sure

172
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,440
if he will grant a name for our Son.

173
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,520
Even if he’s angry with you,

174
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
he wouldn’t reject his child.

175
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,800
The King will surely come to see him.

176
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,800
Be prepared, Your Majesty.

177
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,200
When he does come,

178
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,720
you must request a pardon.

179
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,280
Bring out this ring,

180
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,360
and then you may ask anything of me once.

181
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,520
-It is Your Majesty's grace.
-It is Your Majesty's grace.

182
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,760
One day,

183
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,880
you will be a warrior,
brave and strong like them.

184
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

185
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,120
I want you

186
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,960
to teach Prince Yod Fah

187
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,960
all the sciences and arts,

188
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,400
everything.

189
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,839
Not just fighting skills.

190
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,760
So he can become a wise ruler.

191
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,079
Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,640
Phan Butsrithep,

193
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,400
you are knowledgeable and skilled.

194
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,359
I appoint you as Prince Yod Fah’s

195
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,760
Royal Tutor,

196
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,440
to teach my son

197
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,200
all subjects,

198
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,480
and make him knowledgeable

199
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,840
in both sciences and arts,

200
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,160
from this day forth.

201
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,720
As Your Majesty commands.

202
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,640
Your Majesty, Queen Srisudachan

203
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,880
has given birth prematurely.

204
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,000
Now,

205
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
she has given birth to a Son.

206
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,760
The Queen Consort

207
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,680
requests that this be presented
to Your Majesty.

208
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Wait until 14 days have passed,

209
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,600
then have the Royal Astrologer
cast his horoscope,

210
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,120
and I shall name him.

211
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,520
Your Majesty.

212
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,880
It is Your Majesty’s grace.

213
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,240
And as for you,

214
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,760
you sent my ring

215
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,040
without specifying what you desire.

216
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,880
I…

217
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,840
I wish for a pardon, Your Majesty.

218
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,240
I can endure confinement,

219
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,160
but now that Prince Yod Fah
is growing quickly,

220
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,360
I desire to be with him.

221
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,080
I promised,

222
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,440
so I shall grant your request.

223
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Go ahead and care for your Son.

224
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,960
You remain Queen Consort

225
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,040
and the mother of Prince Yod Fah.

226
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
But to trust you as before…

227
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,760
I cannot.

228
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,920
Being able to stay with my child

229
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,480
is grace enough, Your Majesty.

230
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,360
The Sanskrit language

231
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,720
has 48 characters,

232
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,640
of which 34 are consonants

233
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,400
and 14 are vowels.

234
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,000
The consonants

235
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,840
are divided into five rows.

236
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,200
The row of gutturals is produced
at the back of the throat.

237
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,440
Ka,

238
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,960
Kha,

239
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,800
Ga,

240
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Gha,

241
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Nga.

242
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,920
Repeat after him so you’ll remember.

243
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,840
Mother!

244
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,000
I missed you.

245
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,680
I missed you too.

246
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,680
I came to watch my Son study.

247
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,080
It brings me great joy,

248
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,280
Your Majesty.

249
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,080
I’m concerned for Prince Yod Fah.

250
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,000
Being Crown Prince is good,

251
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,000
but it comes with dangers.

252
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,520
As you said yourself,

253
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,680
to be born into royalty

254
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,480
is to become a piece on the chessboard,

255
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,440
and even the smallest pawn

256
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,120
is not safe.

257
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,600
But my child is still young,

258
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,760
and I am no longer favored.

259
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,280
I ask you

260
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
to look after Prince Yod Fah

261
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,520
until he is old enough to become
King of Ayodhaya. Can you do that?

262
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,040
If Prince Yod Fah becomes King,

263
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,360
will you then agree

264
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,360
that we both

265
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,920
get back together?

266
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,240
If my Son remains safe,

267
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,720
I would accept anything.

268
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,640
Prince Yod Fah.

269
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,280
FOUR YEARS LATER

270
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,400
A message for His Majesty.

271
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,280
The King of Chiang Mai,
Phra Muang Ketklao,

272
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,520
has been murdered by rebels.

273
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,360
Currently,

274
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,760
Chiang Mai is in chaos

275
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,400
with factions fighting for the throne.

276
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,680
Who sent this message?

277
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,240
Is it reliable, Your Majesty?

278
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
Muen Hua Khian

279
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,400
asks us to lead our army there
to suppress the rebels.

280
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,040
Good.

281
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,640
I shall seize the chance
to attack Chiang Mai.

282
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,880
At this moment, Chiang Mai is leaderless.

283
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,800
The noble faction

284
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,520
of the Sen Khao has assassinated

285
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,120
Phra Muang Ketklao,

286
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,640
hoping to put
the Prince of Kengtung on the throne.

287
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,560
However, Muen Sam Lan

288
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,360
and Muen Hua Khian are resisting,

289
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,240
dividing Chiang Mai into warring factions.

290
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,880
This is a perfect opportunity for us

291
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,160
to conquer Chiang Mai.

292
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,280
Phra Horadhibodi,

293
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,840
when is an auspicious time to set out?

294
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,560
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

295
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,840
an auspicious time to set out

296
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,680
is on Saturday, the 14th waxing moon
of the seventh month,

297
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
at 8:15, Your Majesty.

298
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,680
Khun Phirenthorathep,

299
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,160
I reinstate you as Phaya Phitsanulok

300
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,160
and Commander

301
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,360
of the Vanguard.

302
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,040
I

303
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,400
shall lead the main force,

304
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,400
with Phaya Mahasena commanding the rear.

305
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Prepare weapons
and provisions according to plan.

306
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,920
-As you command, Your Majesty.
-As you command, Your Majesty.

307
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,480
This will be the first time

308
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,400
that Chiang Mai

309
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,840
is subjugated under Ayodhaya.

310
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,560
How is it, Lady La-Ongkham?

311
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,400
In the letter, Khem says that

312
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,160
as the King’s army approached Chiang Mai,

313
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,600
the Sam Lan faction
had already killed the Sen Khao

314
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,880
and crowned Queen Chiraprapha,

315
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,640
consort of Phra Muang Ketklao,

316
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,440
as the new ruler of Chiang Mai.

317
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,160
How about the King?

318
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,080
His army reached
the outskirts of Chiang Mai,

319
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,920
where Queen Chiraprapha
presented tribute to him.

320
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,520
Seeing her submissiveness,

321
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,240
he accepted her friendship.

322
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,880
He plans to stay in Chiang Mai
for two months

323
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,880
before returning to Ayodhaya.

324
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,920
So, no war?

325
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,840
Praise be to Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.
This is fortunate.

326
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,920
With no fighting,
no one is hurt or killed.

327
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,760
Everyone,

328
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,600
His Majesty will soon return to Ayodhaya.

329
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,840
Are you not overjoyed?

330
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,760
Who is this Great Queen?

331
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,120
How did she come
to sit on the throne like a man?

332
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,320
She is the Queen Consort
of Phra Muang Ketklao,

333
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,840
King of Chiang Mai.

334
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,560
Supported by her noblemen,

335
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,280
she was able to ascend to the throne.

336
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,640
The people of Chiang Mai are remarkable,

337
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,080
allowing a woman to be their ruler.

338
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,200
But even so,

339
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,560
she must still bow to a man from Ayodhaya.

340
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,760
Just wait and see, Lady Noi.

341
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,160
This victory gained so easily

342
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,040
may be a trap.

343
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,520
Is there a problem, Your Majesty?

344
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,280
King Chaiyachettha of Lan Chang

345
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,280
has come to rule over Chiang Mai,

346
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,120
replacing the Great Queen Chiraprapha.

347
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,120
Was I deceived by a woman?

348
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,760
It turns out

349
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,920
the people of Chiang Mai
used a woman as a front

350
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,400
to trick Ayodhaya into retreating.

351
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,760
Take my orders

352
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,560
and prepare the troops.

353
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,560
Tomorrow,

354
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,800
I shall lead an army to attack Chiang Mai.

355
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,120
This time,

356
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,440
I won’t back down for anyone,

357
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,920
and they will face the consequences.

358
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,280
Father, Brother,

359
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,640
come in!

360
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,960
Is everything I ordered in place?

361
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,040
All is ready,

362
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,160
both swords and men.

363
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,760
Hey, you all, come down!

364
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,800
-Let’s go, hurry up!
-Hurry up.

365
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,440
Good.

366
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,880
Wait.

367
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,640
What is this?

368
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,120
Why did you brand them
with Jinda’s personal mark?

369
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,720
The plan was for them to
disguise themselves as Chiang Mai soldiers

370
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,920
and assassinate the King on his journey.

371
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,600
Then what is this?

372
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,600
Mistakes happen.

373
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,760
If they get caught,

374
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,800
this symbol will mark them

375
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,760
as servants of the Queen Consort.

376
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,360
Father,

377
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,600
if so,

378
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,960
then Jinda is guilty
of treason and will face execution.

379
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,600
Or do you want it to be me and Chan?

380
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,440
Don’t be so quick to anger.

381
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,440
I’m simply considering an escape plan.

382
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,400
Your men

383
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,960
must cover their faces with soot

384
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,760
and disguise their marks.

385
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,840
Disguised as Chiang Mai soldiers,
they will attack in the dark,

386
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,520
and most importantly,

387
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,040
make sure no one is captured.

388
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,920
Understood Brother.

389
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,520
Come on, come on!

390
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
We’re on a big mission.

391
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,600
Let’s keep our spirits up.

392
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,760
Hey, bring the food!

393
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,400
Father, Brother, enjoy!

394
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,880
Although I’m from the forest,

395
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,720
our food is second to none.

396
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,560
This fish curry was made just for you two.

397
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,040
Give it a try.

398
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,680
Stop frowning already.

399
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,040
I’ve checked
King Chairachathirat’s horoscope.

400
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,160
Comparing it to Ayodhaya’s,

401
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,760
there’s certain

402
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,080
to be a change in reign.

403
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,880
Hey,

404
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,200
bring me some alcohol.

405
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,639
Why do you want to meet my cook?

406
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,199
That was Ngao Ngod curry.

407
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,040
I'm sure people
from the forest don't know it.

408
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,960
I’m curious who your new cook is.

409
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,480
I’ve never seen her either.

410
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,640
I only know she replaced the last one.

411
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,920
The maid who fetched her
also disappeared. Strange.

412
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,200
There.

413
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,040
This won’t do.

414
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,680
My name is Tubtim,

415
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,320
servant of Queen Srisudachan,

416
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,120
here to request an audience

417
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,400
about an urgent matter.

418
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,400
Don’t let anyone know about this.

419
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,240
Tubtim!

420
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,360
She's woken up!

421
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,840
Tubtim.

422
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,880
Where have you been?

423
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,760
What happened to you?

424
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,360
Who did this?

425
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,720
When I tried to escape,

426
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,920
I fought with a servant,

427
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,880
and she stabbed me.

428
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,520
And…

429
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,040
Where did you go?

430
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,240
Where have you been?

431
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,080
Why did Teacher say…

432
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,720
Why did he say you were dead?

433
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,200
I was investigating

434
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,240
who tried to kill me,

435
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,040
but I found something else.

436
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,680
Brahmin Wamon

437
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,600
and Brahmin Wasuthep

438
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,480
are plotting to assassinate the King

439
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,200
on his way to Chiang Mai.

440
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,720
Really?

441
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,160
You must stop them.

442
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,640
What must I do?

443
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,320
Tubtim said that

444
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,880
when Wamon
has Prince Yod Fah as a hostage,

445
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,840
he will launch fireworks as a signal,

446
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,080
which will then be passed along

447
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,720
so those outside can take action.

448
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,320
I’ll find a way to send word to the King.

449
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,440
And you,

450
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,800
go warn Prince Yod Fah

451
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,720
and stop Brahmin Wamon
from setting off the signal.

452
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,280
Let's go Thongdee.

453
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,280
Chuen.

454
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

455
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,840
A messenger awaits outside.

456
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,360
-Is this the special item you spoke of?
-Yes, Your Highness.

457
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,400
Inside this box are special fireworks.

458
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,000
When set off, it will be large

459
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,320
and very beautiful.

460
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,040
-I want to see it.
-Wait a bit.

461
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,400
Prince Yod Fah.

462
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,600
Let’s wait for it to get dark.
It will be more beautiful then.

463
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,800
In the meantime,
please study here in the sacred hall.

464
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,200
The sugarcane juice, Your Majesty.

465
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,400
-Take it.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

466
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,080
It’s time, Your Highness.

467
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,000
Everyone, quickly help carry this out.

468
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,600
Stop.

469
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,320
No fireworks are allowed
within the royal grounds.

470
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,040
You, as an adult,

471
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,920
should know better.

472
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,960
It was the Crown Prince’s command,
Your Majesty.

473
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,360
Mother, I want to see them.

474
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,840
No.

475
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,000
Escort Prince Yod Fah back
to the inner chambers.

476
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,480
Go.

477
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,640
And take these fireworks away.

478
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,000
Wait.

479
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,720
I brought fresh sugarcane juice.

480
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,160
Sweet and fragrant,
I’d like you to try it.

481
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,080
You won't refuse, will you?

482
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
Take it away!

483
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,400
This way please, Your Highness.

484
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,480
Here it is.

485
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,160
Chuen.

486
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,040
Now that no one else is here,

487
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,560
let’s drink together.

488
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,640
Stop,

489
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,160
put it down.

490
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,400
I order you to put it down.

491
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,200
You first.

492
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,520
Chuen, go check on Prince Yod Fah.

493
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

494
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,720
Let go of me.

495
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,160
Let go!

496
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,080
Let go of me!

497
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,840
Let go of me Wamon.

498
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,240
I won't.

499
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,640
Oh no. This is terrible.

500
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,360
We can’t get out.

501
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,720
This isn’t our business.

502
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,080
If we get too involved,
we’ll all be ruined.

503
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,680
Go!

504
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,440
Go!

505
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,680
Let go of me.

506
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,080
Let go of me!

507
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,800
Let go of me!

508
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,160
I, Thao Inthratevee,

509
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,360
have urgent news to report
to Khun Phirenthorathep.

510
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,400
This is a matter of utmost importance
concerning the King’s safety.

511
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,480
Retreat, retreat!

512
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,680
Retreat!

513
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,760
After them!

514
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,680
Go!

515
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,840
After them!

516
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,280
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

517
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,840
-Follow them!
-Don’t follow!

518
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,360
Those assassins

519
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,960
didn’t look like
they were from Chiang Mai.

520
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,160
Who could they be?

521
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,840
Your Majesty,

522
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,680
please go inside first.

523
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,680
Your Majesty!

524
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,840
Saen, hurry up.

525
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,160
-Understood
-Hey, keep an eye on them.

526
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,000
Tubtim.

527
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,480
I am already old.

528
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,400
But,

529
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,760
if you’re no longer here,

530
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,720
what will I do?

531
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,800
You are clever.

532
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,920
You’ll find a way.

533
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,080
Remember my words.

534
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,560
Trust no one

535
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,240
but yourself.

536
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,080
Tubtim.

537
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,880
Tubtim.

538
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,560
Since giving birth to Prince Sri Sin,

539
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,240
you’ve been constantly ill.

540
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,520
Did you take proper care after the birth?

541
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,640
Did you get the right medicine?

542
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,480
You speak

543
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,760
as if you’ve had
a whole flock of children.

544
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,000
I’m saying this out of concern.

545
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,440
I’ll have Thongdee
call the Royal Physician.

546
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,760
-No
-Thong…

547
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,760
No.

548
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,320
What is it?

549
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,600
You’re a grown woman,

550
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,360
yet still afraid of doctors?

551
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,840
I’ve made a mistake.

552
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,760
I’m pregnant.

553
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,320
I'm pregnant with Wamon’s child.

554
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,640
Hey, what happened?

555
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,960
I didn’t expect

556
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,680
that the arrows would be poisoned.

557
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,400
Khem,

558
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,960
if it doesn't get better,

559
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,120
you can cut my left arm off.

560
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,640
Don’t let it spread.

561
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,120
The battle in Chiang Mai

562
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,840
is still uncertain,

563
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,440
and Your Majesty's condition

564
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,800
hasn’t improved.

565
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,120
In fact, it’s getting worse.

566
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,280
With all due respect,

567
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,800
I humbly request permission

568
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,640
for us to return to Ayodhaya.

569
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,040
The King is returning to Ayodhaya?

570
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,240
Khun Phirenthorathep sent word
to Lady La-Ongkham this morning.

571
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,400
What should we do?

572
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,520
The King hasn’t summoned you
for duties in years,

573
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,480
yet you are pregnant.

574
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,200
If he returns and finds out,

575
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,440
you’ll surely be executed
and your head displayed in the city.

576
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,120
Don’t go in yet, Your Highness.

577
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,400
Mother.

578
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,800
Thao Inthratevee.

579
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,960
What’s the matter, Prince Yod Fah?

580
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,360
I see that Her Majesty
hasn’t been well for a long time

581
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,280
and won’t see a doctor.

582
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,080
So, I asked the Royal Teacher
to prepare medicine for her.

583
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,800
It’s kind of you to care for me, my Son.

584
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,400
This medicine is
from Phan Butsrithep, right?

585
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,760
Let me take a look.

586
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,120
What kind of medicine is it?

587
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,200
This medicine

588
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,640
seems suitable for the illness.

589
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,280
Take a look, Your Majesty.

590
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,360
I love you dearly.

591
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,960
This medicine will help you.

592
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,160
I’m still angry.

593
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,520
I despise him.

594
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,600
Go talk it over.

595
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,880
I’ll wait outside.

596
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,760
Wamon.

597
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,320
Wamon!

598
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,920
Jinda,

599
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,320
you’re not pleased, are you?

600
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,800
Pleased?

601
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,000
Look at what you’ve done.

602
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,680
You’ve hurt me deeply.

603
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,120
Don’t you know what you did

604
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,360
-could get us all killed?
-This time,

605
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,160
the one who deserves to die is not us

606
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,520
but the King.

607
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,920
This poison

608
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,520
is colorless

609
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,640
and odorless.

610
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,000
Put it in his food

611
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,280
or drink,

612
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,280
and it will stop his heart in an instant.

613
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,640
This time, it’s not just for us

614
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
but for the child in your womb,

615
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,080
our child.

616
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,120
And for the throne of Ayodhaya.

617
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,400
My beloved Jinda,

618
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,680
don’t hesitate any longer.

619
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,920
What’s that noise?

620
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,000
It sounds like buzzing bees.

621
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,640
It's so annoying.

622
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,240
Whoever has something to say, say it.

623
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,240
There’s a rumor
that the Queen Consort is pregnant,

624
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,920
but the King isn’t here.

625
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,480
So people are gossiping
that she’s having an affair.

626
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,880
My goodness.

627
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,480
But now that I think about it,

628
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,200
for the past few months,

629
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,280
the Queen Consort has been ill

630
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,000
and hiding from people.

631
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,760
There might be some truth to it.

632
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,720
This is a serious matter.

633
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,000
Madame Sae, you can’t ignore it.

634
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,080
It should be reported
to Thao Intharasurenthorn.

635
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,840
She’s at the temple observing precepts.

636
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,800
I don’t want to bother her
with such an ill omen.

637
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,600
We’ll inform the King when he returns.

638
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,120
Wamon.

639
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,360
Wamon.

640
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,000
Have you heard the rumors?

641
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,800
Those rumors are true.

642
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,480
Jinda is pregnant with my child.

643
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,160
Then who started spreading the rumor?

644
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,560
How did they know?

645
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,800
I did.

646
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,600
I’m the one who spread the rumor.

647
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,800
Wa… Wamon.

648
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,800
Wamon, you’ve lost your mind.

649
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,960
If the King hears of this,
what do you think will happen?

650
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,160
The more people talk, the better.

651
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,320
Jinda won’t be able to deny it anymore.

652
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,680
If she doesn’t want to die,

653
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,440
she’ll have to kill the king.

654
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,240
Khem.

655
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,840
His Majesty was hit by a poisoned arrow.

656
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,560
The Royal Physician gave him medicine,

657
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,880
but he still hasn’t recovered.

658
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,080
I have urgent news.

659
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,480
The Queen Consort has taken a lover.

660
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,880
There’s even a rumor

661
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,440
that she’s pregnant.

662
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,320
Don’t speak recklessly,

663
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,720
or you’ll lose your head.

664
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I’ve been observing for a while.

665
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,400
I’m sure the Queen Consort is pregnant.

666
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,400
It’s as if all troubles
have descended at once.

667
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,440
Now,

668
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,320
the King is still gravely ill.

669
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,920
Let’s wait until he recovers, Madame.

670
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,680
I don’t want to disturb His Majesty,

671
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,520
but this matter can’t be ignored.

672
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,600
It’s a disgrace to the throne.

673
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,320
Once the King recovers,

674
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,800
I’ll arrange for you

675
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,880
to present your report.

676
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,400
Khem.

677
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,560
Jinda, come with me.

678
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,440
-Lady Noi, where are you going?
-Jinda.

679
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,480
-Lady Noi.
-You cannot stay here any longer.

680
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,680
Any woman who takes a lover
and betrays her husband

681
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,360
must have her face marked with lime,
wear a hibiscus around her neck,

682
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,760
and be paraded in disgrace
throughout the city.

683
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,520
It’s shameful.

684
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,640
-You should escape.
-Where can I go?

685
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,080
Where can I hide?

686
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,960
There’s no place on the chessboard

687
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,920
for a piece to run, Lady Noi.

688
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,680
But if you don’t flee,

689
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,000
there’s only death waiting for you.

690
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,480
On the chessboard,

691
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,200
if we don’t kill them,

692
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,840
they’ll kill us.

693
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,720
There are only those two choices.

694
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,520
Phan Butsrithep.

695
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,440
-Thao Inthratevee. I didn’t know you–
-Listen.

696
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,840
This disgraceful incident,

697
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,640
you started it, so you must fix it.

698
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,840
The Queen Consort would rather
face death than lose her dignity.

699
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,440
But I will not allow it.

700
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:14,720
Use your wit
and find a way. Do whatever it takes.

701
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,600
The Queen Consort
must make it out of this.

702
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:22,640
Otherwise,

703
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,439
if the Queen has to suffer,

704
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:27,319
I

705
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,080
will make you pay

706
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,600
a hundredfold.

707
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,080
As you command,

708
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,319
my Lady.

709
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,080
It's almost done.

710
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,880
Almost done.

711
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,120
Done.

712
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,200
I made this scented water myself.

713
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,800
When the two of you

714
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,920
smell it,

715
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,520
you’ll feel like I’m right beside you.

716
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,840
Mother, I would like a kiss and a hug
with the scented water too.

717
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,120
Prince Yod Fah,

718
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:51,960
Prince Sri Sin, come here.

719
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,160
Remember,

720
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,240
no matter what happens,

721
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,560
I love you both

722
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,360
more than anything in this world.

723
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,360
Khun Phiren.

724
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,080
His Majesty is unwell.
What matter do you have?

725
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,760
Why didn’t you come report directly to me?

726
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,680
Why did you have someone call me here?

727
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,120
I have news on the attackers

728
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,480
who raided our camp.

729
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,640
It’s over here.

730
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,520
My men tracked them down and caught them.

731
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,520
They fell in the river, so we found that
they had charcoal covering their body.

732
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,320
Look at their wrists.

733
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,920
The Duang Kaew mark.

734
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,000
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

735
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,240
it’s time to change
the poultice for your wound.

736
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,760
Phan Butsrithep.

737
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,400
I volunteered to assist
the Royal Physician

738
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,160
because I know what poison has afflicted

739
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,320
Your Majesty.

740
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,320
You know?

741
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,440
I also know

742
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,560
who did it.

743
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,520
Your Majesty would never guess

744
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,240
who ordered it.

745
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,080
Who?

746
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,720
Everyone,

747
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,000
leave.

748
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,560
Guard!

749
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,400
No one can save you, Your Majesty.

750
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,920
I…

751
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
will take my woman back.

752
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,160
You’re her lover.

753
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,080
Yes,

754
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,360
I am.

755
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,080
Open the gate!

756
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,240
Why can’t we go in?

757
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,000
The King ordered no one to enter.

758
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,760
He wishes to discuss matters
with Phan Butsrithep

759
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,560
privately.

760
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,200
What is it about?

761
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,400
You.

762
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,560
Die now!

763
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,400
Die!

764
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,680
Jinda belongs to me.

765
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,680
Both Jinda

766
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,640
and the throne of Ayodhaya are mine.

767
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,720
Before I left,
I changed the poultice for his wound.

768
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,680
His condition is stable.

769
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,440
Do not worry, Khun Phiren.

770
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,800
According to tradition, the Kingdom
must not be left without a King.

771
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,720
We must announce the new sovereign’s name.

772
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,240
With the Royal Court
in such corruption and decay,

773
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,560
I may not be able to stand by idly.

774
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,440
Now, with the throne within reach,

775
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,600
what need is there for fear?

776
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,400
Prepare the troops to enter Ayodhaya.

777
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,640
You must make them understand

778
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,240
that you are not an ordinary woman
to be commanded.

779
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,480
What other path is left?

780
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,280
We must finally come to an agreement

781
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,240
on who will serve as regent
on behalf of the new King.

782
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,800
