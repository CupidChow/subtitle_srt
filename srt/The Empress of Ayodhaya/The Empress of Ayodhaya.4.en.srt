00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,440
The series "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,640
was inspired by the history
of Thao Sri Sudachan.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,880
The events, characters, behaviors,

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,200
and details in this story are interpreted,

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,080
expanded upon, or newly created
for entertainment purposes

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,079
and are not entirely
based on true historical events.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,560
The creators are aware that some events
or actions may spark criticism,

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,120
but we affirm that the production

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,840
of "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,280
was made with good intentions.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,640
Beyond entertainment,
the aim is to encourage viewers

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,320
to take an interest in history.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,160
After watching, if viewers are interested,

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,880
they can seek additional knowledge
from experts or historians

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,920
to gain an accurate understanding
of Ayutthaya history.

17
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,760
How magnificent!

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,360
This prang

19
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,360
stands as a symbol of myself,

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,880
a beacon of hope and prosperity

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,360
for the people of Ayodhaya,

22
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,880
for generations to come.

23
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,400
Lady Jinda.

24
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,040
Lady Jinda.

25
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
-What's wrong?
-I had a dream.

26
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,880
I don't know if it's good or bad.

27
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,160
In my dream--

28
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,320
Alright.

29
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,960
Tell your dream to the water.

30
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,200
Speak to Mother Ganga,

31
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,360
and ask the water
to carry away anything ill.

32
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,480
Tubtim,

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,080
I dreamed

34
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,640
the King and I visited that prang,

35
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,000
and then it was struck
by lightning and collapsed.

36
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,960
You're just dreaming about the old thing.

37
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,360
No.

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,680
There's more.

39
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,520
Suddenly, I was holding a dagger,

40
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,160
a beautiful one.

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,680
Dreaming of a dagger

42
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,760
means victory over your enemies.

43
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,560
But I used the dagger

44
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,480
to stab the King,

45
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,440
and blood was everywhere.

46
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,320
Pray quickly,

47
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,200
ask the water to wash away your sins.

48
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,520
Then go inside and chant
the Yan Tun mantra three times.

49
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,480
I'll pour the water away for you.

50
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,280
Now, go and pray.

51
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,960
Lady Jinda.

52
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,600
Lady Jinda, what's wrong?

53
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,800
I… I feel strangely dizzy.

54
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,120
You should have the Royal Physician
take a look at you

55
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,560
to see if it's a fever.

56
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,680
For the past few days,

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,200
I've been feeling dizzy and nauseous
in the mornings.

58
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,880
Lady Jinda,

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,720
did you have your cycle last month?

60
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Go!

61
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,280
Move aside!

62
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
Go!

63
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,320
From now on,

64
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,680
in private,
there's no need to bow before me.

65
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,960
Take care of yourself.

66
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

67
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,600
I was just about to go

68
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,600
and inform you.

69
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,760
The Royal Physician has already told me.

70
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,400
You are carrying my child.

71
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,880
Everyone, see to it that
the concubine is well cared for.

72
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,920
If anything happens to her,

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
I will have your heads.

74
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
And you,

76
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,720
take care of my child.

77
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,800
Let it be a boy,

78
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,360
so Ayodhaya

79
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,400
may have an heir at last.

80
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

81
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,840
You can race boats,

82
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,320
but you cannot compete with fate.

83
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
I know I will never win.

84
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,880
No, it cannot be.

85
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,480
Phra Lokthip foretold that

86
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,080
if Lady Jinda rises to power,

87
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,560
Ayodhaya will be consumed by flames.

88
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,680
What do you want me to do?

89
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,000
Kill the child in her womb,

90
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,680
as Lady La-ongkham once tried with me?

91
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,680
I cannot do that.

92
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,200
Your heart is noble,

93
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,400
and I commend you for it.

94
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,840
Don't mock me.

95
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
Just watch over her closely.

96
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,760
The King is hoping for an heir.

97
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,280
If anything happens to the child,

98
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,600
your head may roll without warning.

99
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,040
My name is Heuang,

100
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,280
I've come to see Khun Phiren.

101
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,320
He ordered me to come.

102
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,159
Once you're inside, don't linger.

103
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,080
Even though

104
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,240
Khun Phiren has people
watching over this area,

105
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,159
be cautious. Don't let anyone catch you.

106
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,200
It will bring trouble upon him.

107
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
Of course.

108
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,080
Is there really Tao Yai Mom
growing here, Thongdee?

109
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,320
Yes. The kitchen staff said

110
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,080
Thao Intharasuriya planted several.

111
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,080
Be careful, my Lady.

112
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Where is it?

113
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,760
Here it is, my Lady.

114
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,880
Wait.

115
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,320
Not yet.

116
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,040
Just mark it for now.

117
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,760
Yes, my Lady.

118
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,680
Lady Jinda has released her hawk again.

119
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,800
She's probably sending word
about her pregnancy.

120
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Sending it to whom?

121
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,280
If she wanted to send news
to Ok Ya Lopburi,

122
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,280
she would use a fast horse.

123
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,200
Hawks are for spies.

124
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,280
Thongdee,

125
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,640
go find out

126
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,240
who she's sending messages to.

127
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,600
It's beyond me, my Lady.

128
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,240
I can't follow a hawk.

129
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,800
If you want to uncover
Lady Jinda's secrets,

130
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,440
you'll need to find another way.

131
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,200
Let's return to the chamber.

132
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes, my Lady.

133
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Heuang.

134
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,760
My dear Lady,

135
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,280
does it hurt much?

136
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,920
Not as much as the first day.

137
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,680
My dear,

138
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,880
I'll have the Royal Physician

139
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,000
tend to your wounds

140
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,480
and have someone change your bandages.

141
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,600
Khem,

142
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,880
have you asked for my royal pardon yet?

143
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,800
I'd rather die

144
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,120
than live in shame,

145
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
bound and chained like this.

146
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,000
What you've done

147
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,840
deserves death.

148
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,920
But when I think of Ok Ya Sukhothai,

149
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,800
your father,

150
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,360
and the future of the kingdom,

151
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,080
I cannot stand by idly.

152
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,560
I did what I did,

153
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,000
seeking power,

154
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,080
for our dynasty, not myself.

155
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,960
You killed an innocent child.

156
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
You don't even know right from wrong.

157
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,440
Remember,

158
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,840
your head remains on your shoulders

159
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,680
only because I fear Ayodhaya

160
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,520
will clash with Sukhothai.

161
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,960
Otherwise, I would let you die.

162
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,200
-Let go of me!
-Alright.

163
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,120
Just as rivers change their course,

164
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,280
so do hearts.

165
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,440
Preserve your life, Lady La-ongkham.

166
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,560
If I ever have a chance,

167
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,080
I will ask for your royal pardon,

168
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,960
so you may be free.

169
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,320
I survive with the hope

170
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,080
that one day, I will rise above all.

171
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,960
But Hueang,

172
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,600
now that Lady Jinda is pregnant,

173
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,240
if she bears a son,

174
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,120
she will become Queen Consort.

175
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,400
I see no reason to live anymore.

176
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,440
My Lady,

177
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,600
today is our chance.

178
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,520
I've found a way

179
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,600
to destroy Lady Jinda.

180
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,720
What is it?

181
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,240
I overheard Lady Tanyong say

182
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,640
that Lady Jinda uses a hawk
to send messages

183
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,600
to someone outside the palace.

184
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
What would you like?

185
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,480
Have you ever seen a hawk
flying around here?

186
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
No I haven't.

187
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,600
And do you come to this market every day?

188
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,880
Yes, but I've never seen a hawk.

189
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,440
Brother,

190
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,680
have you ever seen a hawk?

191
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,160
Hawks live in the forest.

192
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,200
Well, if someone kept one,
it could be in the city.

193
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,680
-So, you've never seen one?
-No, never.

194
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,480
What a shame. I was about to offer

195
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,200
a reward to anyone who had seen one.

196
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,760
I've seen one.

197
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,400
Really? Where?

198
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,680
Over there, over there.

199
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,520
Come on, take me there quickly.

200
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,200
I'm pregnant now.

201
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,280
I will make the preparations.

202
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,960
Soon, we'll be together again.

203
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,560
Wait for me.

204
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,000
-This is the Brahmin village.
-Hey.

205
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,600
Have you seen a hawk flying around here?

206
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,280
Yes, it flew to the Brahmin's house.

207
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,360
The Brahmin?

208
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,360
Take me there.

209
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,480
There it is!

210
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,720
Hurry up.

211
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,760
Why did you shoot it?
It was flying peacefully!

212
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,680
Hey!

213
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,320
-Where did it fall?
-I saw it drop around here.

214
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,520
Boy.

215
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
Wait,

216
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,000
what's going on?

217
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,480
I didn't know they wanted to shoot it.
I just brought them here to see.

218
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
I didn't know they'd shoot it.

219
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,360
-Shoot what?
-The hawk.

220
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,400
Someone was looking for it,

221
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,680
so I brought them here, and they shot it.

222
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
There, over there.

223
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,920
What is it Heuang?

224
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,400
I can't read this,

225
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,920
but for Lady Jinda

226
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,400
to secretly send messages outside
the palace, this can't be good.

227
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,480
What will you do?

228
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,760
I'll take it to my Mistress,

229
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,520
and we'll find out what it says.

230
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,960
The concubine secretly sending
messages to a man,

231
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,960
this can't be about anything
other than an affair.

232
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,240
It's late. No one is allowed
to enter or leave.

233
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,200
Please,

234
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,480
I have an urgent matter

235
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,560
and must see the concubine immediately.

236
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,880
Didn't you just come in earlier today?

237
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,920
What could be so urgent now?
Leave it for tomorrow.

238
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,280
Please, I beg of you.

239
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,920
I beg you.

240
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,640
It's truly important. I can't wait.

241
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,960
I am a messenger from Ok Phra Lopburi,
father of Lady Jinda.

242
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,360
I bring an urgent message
from him to the concubine.

243
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,600
It's late.

244
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,680
You can't deliver messages
to the inner court at this hour, Brahmin.

245
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,280
I know the rules,

246
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,480
but Ok Phra is gravely ill.

247
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,160
If something happens

248
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,400
and the concubine doesn't make it in time,

249
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,920
you'll be at fault.

250
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,480
Wait here at the guardhouse.

251
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,080
I am Madame Sae,

252
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,280
head of the inner court.

253
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,760
As a man,
you cannot see the concubine directly.

254
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,080
If you have a message,
give it to her maid.

255
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,920
What message has Ok Phra sent?

256
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,680
This matter is extremely important.

257
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
It's a secret between father and daughter.

258
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
No one else should hear it.

259
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,160
The hawk has been shot dead.

260
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,520
The one who killed it
is Lady La-ongkham's servant.

261
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,560
Right now,

262
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,000
she's taking my message
to Lady La-ongkham.

263
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,280
You must inform the concubine immediately.
This is critical.

264
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,000
It must be handled right away.

265
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,520
Oh no!

266
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,160
That letter may be written in Khmer,

267
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,200
but if it falls into
Lady La-ongkham's hands,

268
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,640
she will find a way to read it.

269
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,400
Heuang knows that

270
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,520
you've sent messages
to a man outside the palace.

271
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,880
That poses an even greater threat.

272
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,600
We must stop her,

273
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,800
or I'm doomed.

274
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,080
This is a matter of utmost urgency.

275
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,640
Please understand.

276
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,000
Please.

277
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,000
Please, help me.

278
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,360
Hurry then.

279
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,800
Where is it, my Lady?

280
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,640
It's so dark, I can't see anything.

281
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,640
I marked the tree earlier in the day,

282
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,240
but I forgot
how dark it would be at night.

283
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,840
Then why come searching in the night?

284
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,400
You don't understand.

285
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,120
Tao Yai Mom roots
harvested at night are more potent.

286
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,880
Where's Thongdee? Why isn't she helping?

287
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,960
Let's go.

288
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,560
Heuang?

289
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,160
She snuck into the palace at this hour.

290
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,360
It's very suspicious.

291
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,800
She's probably here to meet her mistress.

292
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Lady La-ongkham was detained,

293
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,520
but it seems she hasn't given up.

294
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,160
What could she be planning now?

295
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,960
Someone's coming.

296
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,800
Tubtim,

297
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,600
that light…

298
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,960
It must be Heuang.

299
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,520
Heuang.

300
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,560
She's still alive. Who did this to her?

301
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,160
Search for Wamon's letter quickly

302
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,560
before she wakes up.

303
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,680
You look around while I check her.

304
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,360
Heuang!

305
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,040
Hey!

306
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,400
Let go.

307
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Lady Jinda!

308
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,000
Let go of her!

309
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,160
Let go!

310
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,880
Heuang, let go of her!

311
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,240
Don't you dare!

312
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,080
Your Mistress secretly sends messages
to a man outside the palace.

313
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,400
I'll report this to the King,

314
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,480
and both you and your Mistress
will lose your heads.

315
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,000
You wish.

316
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,640
You wish.

317
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,160
Get up.

318
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,440
At 8:00 PM, the palace guards
will change shifts.

319
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,120
At the back gate, they are less strict.

320
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,800
Chom,

321
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,400
you will drag the body
to the Udomkongka gate

322
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,440
and throw it into the river
so it will float far away.

323
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
Yes.

324
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,560
I'll help.

325
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,160
How did it go?

326
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,600
I've already dumped the body in the river.

327
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,040
You don't need to worry.

328
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,560
And what about Wamon's letter?

329
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,960
I searched everywhere

330
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,480
but couldn't find it.

331
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,400
How is that possible?

332
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,560
If it wasn't on Heuang,

333
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,440
it must be somewhere nearby.

334
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,600
Is anyone there?

335
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,400
Come see me.

336
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,120
Aunt, Khem.

337
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,280
What's troubling you, Lady La-ongkham?

338
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,640
Heuang, my maid, has gone missing.

339
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,640
I sent her to investigate
Lady Jinda's misdeeds,

340
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,200
but she hasn't returned.

341
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,720
I don't understand.
Why are you so anxious?

342
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,440
This is the situation.

343
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,040
Heuang asked to
come into the palace at night,

344
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,560
saying she had something important
to bring to Lady La-ongkham.

345
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,840
So I let her in.

346
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,000
But she never came to see me.

347
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,080
She's disappeared.

348
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,160
Khem, please help me.

349
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,760
I have no idea what's happened to her.

350
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,000
Heuang must have entered through here.

351
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,480
Madame, you can ask the guards

352
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,080
if anyone has seen her.

353
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,480
Did you find it?

354
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,040
Did you find it?

355
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,480
Lady Jinda.

356
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,200
Khun Phirenthorathep.

357
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,680
What brings you here, my Lady?

358
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,040
-I'm…
-Picking mushrooms.

359
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,400
Yes, I heard Kai mushrooms grow here,

360
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,880
so I wanted to try some.

361
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,800
I came to see if I could find any.

362
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,760
Did you find any?

363
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,920
No,

364
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,360
I must have been mistaken.

365
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,880
Let's go Tubtim.

366
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,960
Right this way my Lord.

367
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,360
Around noon, the villagers
found the body of a woman floating.

368
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,040
Did she drown?

369
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,160
No my Lord.

370
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,440
Her skull was crushed.

371
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,800
It appears she was murdered

372
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,320
before her body was dumped in the water.

373
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,560
The deceased is Heuang,

374
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
the servant of Lady La-ongkham.

375
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,800
It must be them. They killed Heuang.

376
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,880
Khem, you must drag Lady Jinda to justice.

377
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,239
Lady La-ongkham,

378
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,239
she is favored by the King now.

379
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,239
If you accuse her without solid proof,

380
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,280
you'll be accusing a royal family member,

381
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,800
a crime punishable by death.

382
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,760
Heuang may be dead,

383
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,720
but she left something behind,

384
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,880
something that could
help us find her killer.

385
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,200
Before she died,

386
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,000
she was clutching this tightly.

387
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,840
It must belong to her murderer.

388
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,200
I feel sorry for Heuang,

389
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,800
but I know nothing of her death.

390
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,320
Heuang was killed,

391
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,760
and before her death,
she entered the inner court.

392
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,400
Did you meet with her at any point?

393
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,960
Why would I meet with a servant?

394
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,400
Let's go Tubtim.

395
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,960
Has the wound on your ear

396
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,000
healed?

397
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,200
Khun Phirenthorathep,

398
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,160
isn't it rather inappropriate
to ask the concubine such a question?

399
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,320
Don't try to lecture me.

400
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,840
I know what's appropriate.

401
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,440
I'm asking

402
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,880
because it's my duty.

403
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,840
Please answer, my Lady.

404
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,680
How did you get that wound on your ear?

405
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,200
The earrings I wore

406
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,160
cut my ear.

407
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,800
May I see

408
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,800
-those earrings?
-Khun Phirenthorathep!

409
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,400
Don't think

410
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,120
that just because the King favors you,
you can insult my dignity.

411
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,040
Or are you envious

412
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,800
that I'm carrying the King's child?

413
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,160
I'm only doing my duty.

414
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,280
A death in the royal residence
is no small matter.

415
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,640
If I cannot resolve it,

416
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,760
I will have to report this to the King.

417
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,480
Khun Phirenthorathep

418
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,200
deliberately looked at my ear.

419
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,840
I've made a mistake.

420
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,560
The earring that Heuang tore off
must have ended up with him.

421
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,400
If this reaches the King,

422
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,600
there will be a full investigation
into Heuang's death,

423
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,760
and it will lead back

424
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,680
to her search for the hawk.

425
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,640
What will we do then?

426
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,600
These gold earrings

427
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,280
were given to the concubines
along with other regalia

428
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,560
when we were formally offered to the King.

429
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,360
The one who killed Heuang is none other

430
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,920
than Lady Jinda.

431
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,760
Move aside.

432
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,000
Clear the way!

433
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,080
Move!

434
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,040
-Hey!
-Move!

435
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,720
Hey!

436
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,880
Take him!

437
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,880
This man is Jin Hong,

438
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,280
he sells fabrics
and goods from Chinese ships.

439
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,800
Someone reported that
he was caught selling stolen royal gold.

440
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,960
Where did you get these earrings?

441
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,840
A thief sold them to him, my Lord.

442
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,720
At first, I didn't know he was a thief.

443
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,280
He told me

444
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,440
someone paid him to melt
the royal gold into bars,

445
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,360
but he couldn't bear
to destroy the craftsmanship,

446
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,120
so he sold it to me instead.

447
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,280
Come on!

448
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,200
-Come on!
-Come on!

449
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,760
-Hey!
-Come on!

450
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,080
Who was this man? Where is he?

451
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,600
I don't know.

452
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,440
He said a woman refused him

453
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,960
and even insulted him.

454
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,160
He got angry

455
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,000
and hit her with a hammer until she died,

456
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,680
then took the gold.

457
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,960
Who was

458
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,160
this woman?

459
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,760
He said she was a palace servant.

460
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,760
She could go in and out of the palace.

461
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,280
She's stolen many things
and sold them several times.

462
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,000
These gold items belong to me.

463
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,000
If these were truly stolen from you,

464
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,200
why did you not report to me

465
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
that Heuang had taken your possessions?

466
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,920
Khun Phirenthorathep,

467
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,480
who would dare?

468
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,360
You are a relative of Lady La-ongkham,

469
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,760
her Mistress, aren't you?

470
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't believe it.

471
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,280
Are you accusing the concubine of lying?

472
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,280
What she says is true.

473
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,760
Heuang snuck into the palace

474
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,640
and stole from many people,

475
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,800
not just from Lady Jinda.

476
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,040
Even some of my gold jewelry

477
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,800
is missing too.

478
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,200
This bracelet,

479
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,960
for example, is mine.

480
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,720
Isn't that right,

481
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,720
Lady Jinda?

482
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,680
Yes it is.

483
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,880
Heuang

484
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,440
had Khun Thao Srisajja backing her up,

485
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,320
allowing her to move freely
in and out of the palace.

486
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,720
She used that opportunity

487
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,600
to steal from everyone.

488
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,560
What do you have to say?

489
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,760
Heuang is dead now,

490
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,080
and you have your possessions back.

491
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,120
Let's just leave it at that.

492
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,160
Don't escalate this to the King.

493
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,960
Very well.

494
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,680
This time,

495
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,040
I'll leave it at that.

496
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,680
I believe you're satisfied now?

497
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,040
I'll be going now.

498
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,800
Wait a minute.

499
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,960
Wait.

500
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,800
That bracelet isn't yours.

501
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,800
Why are you falsely claiming it is?

502
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,800
If you're unhappy,

503
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,800
I'll confess to Khun Phirenthorathep

504
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,520
that I lied.

505
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,600
Wait.

506
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,680
Khun Phirenthorathep

507
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,760
couldn't have gone far.

508
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,280
If I shout, he'll still hear me.

509
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,880
Do you want me to tell him

510
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,440
this bracelet

511
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,480
isn't mine?

512
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,480
Let's go,

513
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,440
-Thongdee.
-Yes my Lady.

514
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,080
Lady Tanyong must know about us.

515
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,760
What should we do?

516
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,520
All it took was one word,

517
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,400
and I got a new bracelet.

518
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,960
Totally worth it.

519
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,200
You shouldn't get involved

520
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,160
with a person like Lady Jinda.

521
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,720
If you're not careful,
trouble may come to you.

522
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,560
I'm not afraid.

523
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,360
Lady Jinda can't do anything to me.

524
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,040
Heuang?

525
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,760
She's probably here to meet her mistress.

526
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,720
Someone's coming.

527
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,440
-Father!
-It's me.

528
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,680
Well done.

529
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,920
My teachings were not in vain.

530
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,240
Father,

531
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,920
what brings you to Ayodhaya?

532
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,800
I came to congratulate you.

533
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,960
News has reached Lopburi
that Lady Jinda is expecting.

534
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,480
I…

535
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,400
I've come to offer prayers,
hoping that you will have a son.

536
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,360
The child Jinda carries is not mine.

537
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,760
What about the day
Jinda returned to visit home?

538
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,480
-It was at my command.
-I didn't do it.

539
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,120
I didn't do anything at all.

540
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,160
Jinda.

541
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,360
Even if I love you,

542
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,160
for better or for worse,

543
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,720
I am now someone else's wife.

544
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,920
But we promised

545
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,240
that we would be together again.

546
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,640
I won't let anyone accuse me

547
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,760
of being unfaithful.

548
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,760
Wait until
King Chairachathirat is no more,

549
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,080
and then I will be yours completely.

550
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,000
Why?!

551
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,120
I ordered you,

552
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,920
and you dared to disobey?

553
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,840
Father, I won't force a woman's heart.

554
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,800
And let her carry
King Chairachathirat's child?

555
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,640
Father,

556
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,080
Jinda loves me.
To this day, she still loves me.

557
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,960
She doesn't desire
King Chairachathirat in the least.

558
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,760
-Why should you worry?
-Wamon, Wamon.

559
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,000
You are too proud of your masculinity.

560
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,280
You don't understand women at all.

561
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,840
You don't understand

562
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,760
that what matters most to a mother

563
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,640
is her child.

564
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,360
Today, you may be
the love of Jinda's life,

565
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,920
but once the child in her womb is born,

566
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,600
a child of King Chairachathirat's blood,

567
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,720
I fear everything will change.

568
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,960
NINE MONTHS LATER

569
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,240
The ruler

570
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,520
Of the city

571
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,960
Of Ayo

572
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,640
Dhaya

573
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,040
Jinda!

574
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,400
Thao Srisudachan,

575
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,320
the Royal Decree has been issued.

576
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,680
I hereby appoint you

577
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,400
as the Queen Consort,

578
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,320
the Queen of Ayodhaya,
from this moment forth.

579
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,280
I humbly accept, Your Majesty.

580
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,640
Hey!

581
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,960
-Hey!
-Hey!

582
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,880
The holy shrine has sent word to you,
Queen Consort.

583
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,240
They informed that today
is an auspicious day,

584
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,560
and the new Brahmin

585
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,400
invites you to offer
your prayers to the gods

586
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,840
and receive their blessings.

587
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,680
A new Brahmin?

588
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,960
Yes,

589
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,360
he arrived just yesterday.

590
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,080
The Brahmin has sent word that…

591
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,000
It is time, Your Majesty.

592
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,560
Jinda,

593
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,680
I didn't summon you. Why are you here?

594
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,200
Because it's time, Your Majesty.

595
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,760
The time has come. You must do it.

596
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,760
By hesitating like this,
the maids will become suspicious.

597
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,920
Keep a close eye on her.

598
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,120
If anything seems amiss,

599
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,160
we will stop it before it grows.

600
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,840
-I am meant to die, right?
-Lady Noi…

601
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,080
Noi.

602
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,080
No!

603
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,040
Go!

604
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,800
A message from Queen Srisudachan.

605
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,360
