Disclaimer

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,440
The series "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,640
was inspired by
the history of Thao Sri Sudachan.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,880
The events, characters, behaviors,
and details in this story

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,200
are interpreted, expanded upon,
or newly created

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,080
for entertainment purposes

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,079
and are not entirely based on
true historical events.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,560
The creators are aware that some events

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,120
or actions may spark criticism,

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,840
but we affirm that the production

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,280
of "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,640
was made with good intentions.
Beyond entertainment,

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,320
the aim is to encourage viewers
to take an interest in history.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,160
After watching, if viewers are interested,

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,880
they can seek
additional knowledge from experts

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,920
or historians to gain accurate
understanding of Ayutthaya history.

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,640
-Father.
-Yes?

18
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
I heard that the Queen Consort
has yet to return to the palace.

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,200
Is something happening in Lopburi?

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,640
Tubtim was ambushed.

21
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,920
Shot by a crossbow in a critical spot,
leaving her gravely wounded.

22
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,040
Who could have done such a thing?

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
It was one of my own people.

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,640
Ok Phra Lopburi overheard that

25
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,240
Tubtim had changed her allegiance,

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,000
urging Jinda to prioritize her family.

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,200
Leaving her unchecked would be dangerous,

28
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,520
so she had to be eliminated.

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
But that’s not why I came to see you.

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,600
Then what brings you here?

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,040
Ok Phra Lopburi is a cunning man.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,640
His health may waver,

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,920
but his ambition burns fiercely.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,360
He desires the throne,

35
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,920
aiming to be ruler of Ayodhaya.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,920
How could that be? And what about Jinda?

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,520
Sometimes, the hunger for power

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,120
makes people betray
even their own children.

39
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,240
Jinda is my daughter.

40
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,600
Once King Chairachathirat is gone,

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,880
I’ll have her

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,120
raise me to the throne as King.

43
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,160
Who would dare criticize that?

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,880
But Ok Phra, you must not forget

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,840
that Jinda is where she is today

46
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,200
because of Wamon's help.

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,440
I haven’t forgotten, Wasuthep.

48
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,160
Since Wamon and Jinda

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,600
have feelings for each other,

50
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,680
as a reward,

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,640
I’ll allow Jinda to be with your son

52
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,080
and elevate him to succeed me

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,680
as Ok Phra Lopburi.

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,480
I have endured all the hardships
with the hope of you rising to greatness,

55
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,280
but I didn’t anticipate Ok Phra Lopburi

56
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,760
would try to seize this opportunity.

57
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,839
You need not worry Father.

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,360
I will claim
the Ayodhaya throne with Jinda

59
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,560
as you have wished.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,040
No one will stand in my way.

61
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,240
I did not know you were here.

62
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,920
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

63
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,600
Did you see me?

64
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,240
My eyes aren’t so sharp,

65
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,360
but the fragrance
from Your Majesty’s presence,

66
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,000
even if I were blind,
I would recognize it.

67
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,520
I came to bid farewell to Tubtim.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,400
When dawn breaks

69
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,040
I will leave.

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,160
Will you

71
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,880
leave Tubtim here?

72
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,200
I must return to complete a great task,

73
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
one fraught with danger.

74
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Bringing Tubtim along
may only lead to a needless death.

75
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,080
Please take care of her for me.

76
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

77
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,160
May you be blessed

78
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,720
with luck and victory

79
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,160
and succeed

80
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,760
in whatever you undertake.

81
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,720
Your Majesty.

82
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,880
From the Sanphet Maha Prasat Throne Hall,
this shortcut

83
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,440
leads to two exits.

84
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,880
One to Tha Wasukri

85
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,280
and the other to Phra Si Sanphet temple.

86
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,040
If any danger befalls me,

87
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,960
take Prince Yod Fah

88
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,560
and escape along this route.

89
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,680
Who else

90
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,840
is aware of this shortcut?

91
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,440
Only you

92
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
and I.

93
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,120
Go secretly to the Royal Chamber

94
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,200
and make a copy
of the King’s horoscope for me.

95
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,440
What do you intend to do
with the King’s horoscope?

96
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,520
To determine an opportune moment.

97
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,880
Whenever the King’s fate reaches its
lowest point, the moment of ill fortune,

98
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,600
we will act.
It will ensure success with ease.

99
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,160
Her Majesty Queen Srisudachan arrives.

100
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,840
Get out.

101
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,600
What is the King’s horoscope like?

102
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,400
The King’s horoscope is strong,
protected by sacred forces.

103
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,960
No wonder
he has escaped danger all this time.

104
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,400
Then, what must I do?

105
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,200
-You must wait.
-Wait?

106
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,960
If you act with malice, you will be
defeated by your own intentions.

107
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,680
Jinda,

108
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,920
you must wait.

109
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,520
According to the horoscope,

110
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,760
King Chairachathirat

111
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,040
will only fall in war.

112
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,240
You’re quite something,

113
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,600
using the King’s horoscope
to hold Jinda back.

114
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,920
In the meantime, we need to find
a way to eliminate Ok Phra Lopburi.

115
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,840
Once he is gone,

116
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,480
then we can end the King’s life.

117
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,320
By doing this,

118
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,600
Jinda and I can finally
ascend the Ayodhaya throne.

119
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,920
Leave Ok Phra Lopburi to me.

120
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,680
If ever the King
desires intimacy with you,

121
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,560
use this oil

122
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,600
to anoint yourself beforehand.

123
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,760
It will prevent you
from conceiving with the King again.

124
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,600
TWO YEARS LATER

125
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,440
King Chantharacha
has dared to act brazenly.

126
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,720
When rebellion struck his land,

127
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,600
he sought my favor,

128
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,160
and I gave him men and weapons,

129
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,080
helping him reclaim the throne of Lawaek.

130
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,960
Now, he fails to send tribute as required.

131
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,480
Royal Astrologer!

132
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

133
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,680
Find an auspicious date
to mobilize our forces.

134
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,240
As you command, Your Majesty.

135
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,920
Order all divisions

136
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,960
to prepare the troops.

137
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,080
We shall move our forces to show him

138
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,760
that I am not one

139
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,440
to be insulted.

140
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,440
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

141
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,880
All consorts

142
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,200
and court attendants,

143
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,520
the King has now declared war

144
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,960
on King Chantharacha of Lawaek.

145
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,080
The inner court

146
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,680
must prepare provisions without delay.

147
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,800
Thao,

148
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,000
lower the flame a little,
or the coconut will burn.

149
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,280
Yes, my Lady.

150
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Thao Intharasurenthorn,
what are you working on?

151
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,079
The Queen has ordered me
to make chili salt.

152
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,200
Let me help.

153
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,360
It’s all rough work here.

154
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,760
The servants and I
can handle it ourselves.

155
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,480
No worries,

156
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,800
everyone needs to pitch in anyway.

157
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Come along Thongdee.

158
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,840
Look.

159
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,960
The King is preparing for war,

160
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,080
and both the outer
and inner courts are busy

161
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,000
preparing supplies and medicines.

162
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,960
But I wonder,

163
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,320
where might the Queen Consort
be at this time?

164
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
This is the cursed poison.

165
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,600
Have Jinda give it to the King
before he departs for battle.

166
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,640
Once the war is over,

167
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,640
Jinda should prepare a meal
with clarified butter for the King.

168
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,440
When the King eats the clarified butter,
it will lead to his immediate death.

169
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,520
The Queen Consort has arrived,
Your Majesty.

170
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,320
What brings you here?

171
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,360
I went to pay homage to the deities

172
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,800
and offered them betel nut and areca.

173
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,560
This betel is considered sacred

174
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,920
and auspicious.

175
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,320
So, you brought it for me?

176
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

177
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,640
The King has decreed that

178
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,200
anything offered for consumption,

179
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,240
regardless of the giver,

180
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,360
must be checked by me first.

181
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,400
-Even betel?
-Yes.

182
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,400
These betel nuts are specially scented

183
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,720
to be offered to Your Majesty.

184
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,080
It wouldn’t be proper
for someone else to chew it.

185
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,880
I’ve examined it on your behalf.

186
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,680
Now,

187
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,800
you may leave.

188
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,240
I have matters to discuss with the King.

189
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,760
The cursed poison is working.

190
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,680
We have taken Phra Nakhon.

191
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,120
Our next target

192
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,440
is Bodhisattva.

193
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,920
King Chantharacha
has marched his army from Lawaek

194
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
to position his forces at Bodhisattva,

195
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,160
refusing to set up
his defense in the capital.

196
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,600
Perhaps he fears we might

197
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,720
take the local villagers as hostages.

198
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,720
King Chantharacha knows this terrain

199
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,320
as well as the lines on his own palm.

200
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,280
For us to launch an attack,
we must plan carefully, Your Majesty.

201
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,640
With all due respect, Your Majesty.

202
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,600
What is it Saen?

203
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,160
The scouting division reports that

204
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,080
the Khmer army

205
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,640
has set up camp on the western plains,

206
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,560
approximately fifty sen away,
Your Majesty.

207
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,920
That's good.

208
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,160
This way, we won’t waste time
moving out. Khem,

209
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,800
lead the troops to welcome them!

210
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,560
At your command, Your Majesty.

211
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,200
Attack!

212
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,800
Hey!

213
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,440
The Khmer forces are retreating!

214
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,680
They’re falling back! Go!

215
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,600
Don’t pursue them.
Withdraw and return to camp!

216
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,200
Hey!

217
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Chao Phraya Suwannakamon,

218
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,040
you are a brave warrior.

219
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,720
But your Master

220
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,240
sees you as nothing

221
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,440
more than bait to trap me.

222
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,160
I chose the wrong Master.

223
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,000
If my life is to be forfeited,

224
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,640
I accept my fate.

225
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,720
I respect your warrior’s heart.

226
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,880
You are a good man,

227
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,000
unlike your Master.

228
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,920
If one day you decide to reclaim your city

229
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
from King Chantharacha,

230
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,520
come to me.

231
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,000
I will help you. Khem, release him.

232
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,120
Can he be trusted, your Majesty?

233
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,640
By doing this,

234
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,240
we risk a future betrayal.

235
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,840
The sword is in my hand.

236
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,720
If the snake turns to bite,

237
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,880
I’ll cut off its head without hesitation.

238
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,800
I have no intention of returning.

239
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,080
If Your Majesty shows me mercy,

240
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,600
I will offer my life to serve you

241
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,760
as long as I live.

242
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,680
Your Majesty.

243
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,320
I can prove my loyalty.

244
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,960
What is it?

245
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,200
Now,

246
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,720
you have been afflicted

247
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,200
with a powerful

248
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,840
and deadly ghost-bone poison.

249
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,720
If left untreated,

250
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,160
this poison will surely
lead to your demise,

251
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,360
Your Majesty.

252
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,920
Lady La-Ongkham, Khun Phirenthorathep
has sent an urgent message to you.

253
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,560
There must be an urgent matter.

254
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,280
He is at war beside His Majesty.

255
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,400
To send an urgent message like this,
I wonder if it’s good news or bad.

256
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Lady La-Ongkham, what does it say?

257
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,000
Is it good news or bad?

258
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,360
It’s not favorable news.

259
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,480
If I share this with you Madame Sae,

260
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,040
you must promise

261
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,400
not to reveal it to anyone.

262
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,360
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

263
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,600
Khem.

264
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,800
The curse is gone, Your Majesty.

265
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,880
The ghost-bone poison

266
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,000
has a Master.

267
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,840
Only its Master

268
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,080
can command it to take full effect.

269
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,920
Go find out

270
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,280
who did this to me.

271
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,800
I’ve already ordered
an investigation, Your Majesty.

272
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,720
When an antidote

273
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,240
is given,

274
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,720
the poison returns to its Master.

275
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,480
Within a day or two,

276
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,360
if anyone suffers from the effects,

277
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,120
that person will be our answer,
Your Majesty.

278
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,080
Chuen.

279
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,840
Chuen.

280
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,560
Chuen!

281
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,000
Yes, Your Majesty?

282
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,160
What's happening, Your Majesty?

283
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Your Majesty.

284
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,400
Lady La-Ongkham.

285
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,040
Have you heard the news
of the Queen Consort this morning?

286
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,560
It appears the Queen Consort
may have been behind the poison.

287
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,600
We must inform him immediately.

288
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,440
Madame Sae,

289
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,040
please help me find a swift horse.

290
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,320
I must write a message
to Khun Phirenthorathep.

291
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,320
Hey! Stop!

292
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,360
Hey, what’s happening?

293
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,520
Move aside!

294
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,200
With all due respect, Your Majesty.

295
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,000
Urgent news has arrived from Ayodhaya.

296
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,960
Jinda…

297
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,240
Jinda was behind
the poison that cursed me.

298
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,240
Khem!

299
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,240
Order the troops

300
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,960
to prepare to march back to Ayodhaya.

301
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,240
We will travel

302
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,480
day and night without stopping.

303
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,520
I’m going back to sever the head

304
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,000
of this traitor!

305
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Ugh!

306
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,960
Ok Phra!

307
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,280
Ok Phra!

308
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,240
Ok Phra!

309
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,480
No, please Ok Phra.

310
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,640
Ok Phra!

311
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,400
Who’s out there?

312
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,600
-Go fetch the Brahmin immediately!
-Get out!

313
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,360
Get out!

314
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,320
We're in trouble! Help! Brahmin!

315
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,880
Help! Brahmin!

316
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,280
-Brahmin!
-Help!

317
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,800
Let go of me!

318
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,360
-Ok Phra!
-Why are you holding me?

319
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,560
-Get out!
-Ok Phra!

320
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,120
-Let go of me!
-No!

321
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,680
Ok Phra!

322
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
-Please don't do this.
-Let go of me.

323
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,240
Let go of me!

324
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,960
-Let go of me!
-Ok Phra!

325
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,280
Please don't do this.

326
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,080
-No!
-Let go of me!

327
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,760
Let go of me!

328
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,360
-Get out!
-Please, no!

329
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,760
-Get out!
-Ok Phra!

330
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,600
-Get out!
-Please don't!

331
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Ok Phra, please don't do that.

332
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,240
-Get out!
-Please don't do that.

333
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,880
-Get out!
-My goodness!

334
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,200
Get out!

335
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,160
Please don't.

336
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,640
Ok Phra likely won’t survive this.

337
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,320
What goes around

338
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,040
comes around.

339
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,640
I know you’re well enough now.

340
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,760
Go, flee while you can.

341
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,000
-Brahmin!
-What's happening?

342
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,880
Ok Phra has gone mad.
He’s completely lost his mind.

343
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
What?

344
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,040
It appears to be due to a curse.

345
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,520
This is disastrous!

346
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,800
Father.

347
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,720
The King has broken free
from the poison’s effects.

348
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,000
Ok Phra Lopburi has died

349
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,920
from the curse reversing back onto him.

350
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,080
And what about Jinda?
Will she be affected as well?

351
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,360
She hasn’t stepped out
of her quarters in days.

352
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,720
I don't know how she's doing.

353
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,680
I… I don’t know.

354
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,720
But the King is aware of the poison now,

355
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,960
and when he returns,
he’ll surely seek out the one responsible.

356
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
You

357
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,080
need to warn Jinda to be cautious.

358
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,120
Open the gate!

359
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,240
Open the door!

360
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,120
I said open the door!

361
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,640
Where is your Mistress?

362
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,480
Huh!

363
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,000
Your Majesty, forgive me

364
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,640
for not coming out to greet you in person.

365
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,920
You traitor.

366
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,600
After all my trust,

367
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,640
you plotted to kill me?

368
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,680
Before you die,

369
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,080
I want to ask you something.

370
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,480
You were my wife,

371
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,680
the mother of my child.

372
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,520
Why did you plan to kill me?

373
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,320
Answer me!

374
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,440
Why did you plan to kill me?

375
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,720
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

376
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,600
please release her.

377
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,400
Sae!

378
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,680
Take her away.

379
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,680
She will be judged according to the law.

380
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,400
As you command, Your Majesty.

381
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,440
Thao Srisudachan

382
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,880
intended to have me killed.

383
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,160
I am the King.

384
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,800
This offense

385
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,960
warrants execution

386
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,360
by beheading, and displaying the head

387
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,680
as an example to all.

388
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,480
As you command, Your Majesty.

389
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,560
If I may, Your Majesty,

390
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,200
do you have any proof

391
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,760
that I am the one responsible

392
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,240
for the poison?

393
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,240
With all due respect, Your Majesty.

394
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,360
Madame Sae can testify that

395
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,320
following the ritual
to dispel the cursed poison,

396
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,720
the Queen Consort immediately fell ill

397
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,880
and has not

398
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,680
recovered since.

399
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,000
It is a mere coincidence

400
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,320
that I fell ill.

401
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,520
Who is it?

402
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,320
I am the constable of Lopburi

403
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
and I bring urgent news
for the Queen Consort.

404
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,400
With all due respect, Your Majesty.

405
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,720
Proceed, Meun Decho.

406
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,720
The constable of Lopburi reports that

407
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,560
Ok Phra Lopburi
has passed away, Your Majesty.

408
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,400
How did he die?

409
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,840
He succumbed to a cursed poison,

410
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,480
falling into a delirious state
and bleeding from all orifices.

411
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,240
It was a tragic sight, Your Majesty.

412
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,440
Isn’t that proof

413
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,880
enough, Your Majesty,

414
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,840
that the Queen Consort

415
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,680
worked with Ok Phra Lopburi

416
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,080
to plan to kill Your Majesty?

417
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,280
To think I trusted you.

418
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,480
Such a snake in the grass.

419
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,960
Thao Srisudachan,

420
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,440
do you have anything else
to say in your defense?

421
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,080
I…

422
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,360
I…

423
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,680
Your Majesty.

424
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,480
Your Majesty.

425
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,120
Your Majesty.

426
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,600
I've caught you.

427
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,760
You can't run away from me Jinda.
What will you say?

428
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,320
This time I surrender.

429
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,320
But next time,

430
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,640
I’ll run faster. No one will catch me.

431
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,480
Come on.

432
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,720
I made rice gruel for you.

433
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,000
Just take a spoonful of it.

434
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,080
It will give you some strength.

435
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,280
I…

436
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,920
I can’t eat.

437
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,480
I need to get to the outer shrine.

438
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,400
You are now a prisoner

439
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,280
awaiting judgment.

440
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,720
You cannot go anywhere.

441
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,560
Whatever you need, just command,

442
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,960
and I will arrange it.

443
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,560
That Phan Butsrithep,

444
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,400
I know

445
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,680
who he is.

446
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,520
I am here on behalf of the Queen Consort
to talk with you.

447
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,320
How is the Queen Consort?

448
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,200
The punishment of Ok Phra Lopburi,

449
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,120
according to the laws governing rebellion,

450
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,160
is the confiscation of all property
and execution for seven generations.

451
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,680
But last night, the Queen Consort
lost her senses.

452
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,480
So her case will be presented

453
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,480
to the King for judgment today.

454
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,000
It must be the death penalty.

455
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,400
Is there anything you could do

456
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,600
to lessen her sentence?

457
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,960
Thongdee and I know the depth of your ties

458
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,160
to the Queen Consort.

459
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,840
Now, in this hour of crisis,

460
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,480
we must save her.

461
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,200
If you have any plan, please share it.

462
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,360
We bear you no ill will.

463
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,400
Could you arrange a way for me
to speak with the King?

464
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,240
Your Majesty,

465
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,680
the heads of military and governance,

466
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,720
Lord Worachak, and Lord Srisatcha

467
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,160
are all gathered

468
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,400
and await your decision on the punishment

469
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,640
of Queen Srisudachan.

470
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,160
Shall they be admitted to an audience?

471
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,000
With all due respect, Your Majesty.

472
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,520
Thao Inthratevee, the senior consort,

473
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,560
has requested royal permission

474
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,040
to bring in the Royal Musicians
to perform for Your Majesty.

475
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,240
I see that

476
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,000
Your Majesty appears troubled

477
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,000
and I sought to find a way

478
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,960
to ease Your Majesty’s burdens.

479
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,440
Your Majesty, with all due respect,

480
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,280
music serves as a bridge
between humans and deities.

481
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,560
It can also bring mindfulness

482
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,240
and wisdom.

483
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,160
But at the moment…

484
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,960
Go and tell them to wait.

485
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,280
I will join them shortly.

486
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,120
Now go!

487
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,000
The tale I shall tell, Your Majesty,

488
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,480
comes from the Pabbatutthara Jataka,

489
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,880
which speaks of forgiveness.

490
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,480
Once, King Kosala of the city of Savatthi

491
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,080
came to see the Buddha

492
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,520
at Jetavana Monastery.

493
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,560
Oh

494
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,160
Oh

495
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,880
In honor of life

496
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:11,080
In reverence

497
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,640
Oh

498
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,240
King Kosala

499
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,840
Listened to the Buddha

500
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,360
Oh

501
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,680
At the right time

502
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,360
This tale teaches us

503
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,720
that those who are not inherently evil

504
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,240
deserve forgiveness,

505
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,920
allowing them to turn over a new leaf.

506
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,880
Such individuals may bring benefit
in times to come, Your Majesty.

507
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,320
Would you have me spare
the one who plotted to kill me?

508
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,840
Yes, Your Majesty,

509
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,200
for your own benefit.

510
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,440
How so?

511
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,800
Ok Phra Lopburi committed treason,

512
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,680
intending to take Your Majesty’s life.

513
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,440
According to the laws on treason,

514
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,080
he should be stripped of his titles

515
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,640
and sentenced to death
for seven generations.

516
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,440
If Your Majesty
orders the Queen’s execution,

517
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,280
you would also
have to execute Prince Yod Fah,

518
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,360
who is also Ok Phra Lopburi's grandson.

519
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,200
That's the thing.

520
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,720
I can't think of a solution yet.

521
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,640
Executing the mother is one thing,

522
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,120
but if I do,
I would have to kill the Son as well.

523
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,560
I can’t do that.

524
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,800
The Queen

525
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,440
acted under her father’s orders.

526
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,080
She is not your enemy.

527
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,560
To punish her

528
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,800
means losing Prince Yod Fah,
your heir to the throne,

529
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,760
and Ayodhaya would lose
more than it gains.

530
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,120
Please, think carefully

531
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,840
and consider the best interests
of the Kingdom, Your Majesty.

532
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,080
But I am the King.

533
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,600
If my wife commits a crime

534
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,080
and I show her leniency,

535
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,800
who will listen to me then?

536
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,960
How will I rule this Kingdom?

537
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,720
I can’t do it.

538
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,080
Ok Phra Lopburi

539
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,720
poisoned me with the intent to kill.

540
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
The law for treason

541
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,960
demands

542
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,600
his family lose their titles

543
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,440
and their lives across seven generations.

544
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,160
But now,

545
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,320
Ok Phra Lopburi

546
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,560
has paid for his crime with his life.

547
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,800
As for Queen Srisudachan,

548
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,640
she has served me

549
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,200
with her loyalty,

550
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,360
and I am convinced

551
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,760
she had no part

552
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,480
in her father’s plot.

553
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,600
Thus, I sentence her
to the removal of her pension

554
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,720
and confinement in the palace

555
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,400
for two years.

556
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,960
Your Majesty, with all respect,

557
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,360
such a judgment

558
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,920
is against the law.

559
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,320
Khun Phirenthorathep,

560
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,360
do you wish me to execute Thao Srisudachan

561
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,440
and my Son, Prince Yod Fah?

562
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,800
If Prince Yod Fah perishes,

563
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,360
Ayodhaya

564
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,480
will lack an heir,

565
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,560
and chaos will surely follow.

566
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,040
Then,

567
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,840
would your Phra Ruang dynasty

568
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,160
step in to rule

569
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,480
in my place Khem?

570
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,600
That was never my intention, Your Majesty.

571
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,920
But as the Queen

572
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,720
presented Your Majesty
with betel nut with poison,

573
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,680
how can we be certain

574
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,040
she wasn’t conspiring

575
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,520
with her father, Ok Phra Lopburi?

576
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,120
That same betel nut, I consumed as well.

577
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,040
If I’d known it was poisoned,
why would I risk my own life?

578
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,320
The nausea

579
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,960
I experienced

580
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,440
wasn’t due to the poison
turning on me, Your Majesty.

581
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,160
But it's because…

582
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,920
I am two months pregnant.

583
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,640
Is this true?

584
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,040
A woman’s heart is too fickle.

585
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,120
She cannot be trusted with grand affairs.

586
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,720
-Hurry up!
-Have my orders

587
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,840
been carried out successfully?

588
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,280
I am ready,
both sword and men are in place.

589
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,400
We’ve set up an escape route as well,
haven’t we?

590
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,000
Signals will be relayed
from one to another,

591
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,240
so those outside can take action.

592
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,320
I will find a way to inform His Majesty.

593
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,280
Go!

594
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,160
