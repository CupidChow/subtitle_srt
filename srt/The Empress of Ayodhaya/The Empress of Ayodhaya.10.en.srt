EVENTS AND CHARACTERS IN THIS STORY
ARE CREATED FOR ENTERTAINMENT,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,920
NOT BASED ON ACTUAL HISTORICAL EVENTS.
PLEASE SEEK EXPERTS FOR ACCURACY.

3
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,320
Today, you look beautiful.

4
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,320
It’s because of Your Majesty’s blessings

5
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,440
that I’ve been cured of all my ailments.

6
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,040
But you don’t seem so joyful.

7
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,760
I’ve just lost my child, Your Majesty.

8
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,960
Think of it as a stroke of bad luck.

9
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,840
As for the bearers who carried the litter,
I’ve had them all executed,

10
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,280
for negligence, allowing a snake
to come close enough to bite King Yod Fah.

11
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,200
Unfortunately,

12
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,840
they died too quickly.

13
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,600
So I couldn't find out
who was truly behind it.

14
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
Poisonous snakes can be anywhere,

15
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,200
not always under someone’s command.

16
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,200
Perhaps

17
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,760
they’re right by our side, unnoticed.

18
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,640
-Where are you going?
-To eliminate the poisonous snakes.

19
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,920
There are far too many of them here.

20
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,640
Hurry up!

21
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,280
Hurry up!

22
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,040
Hurry up!

23
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,000
You all may not be aware yet.

24
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,520
Today, I’ve appointed Chancellor Chan

25
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,880
as Viceroy, to assist

26
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,080
in overseeing state matters.

27
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,040
Today, he’ll assist me
in interrogating the guilty parties.

28
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,000
Thao Intratevee,

29
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,880
you led the Queen Consort,

30
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,320
Queen Mother Srisudachan,

31
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,920
out of the palace at night,

32
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,720
with Madame Sae aiding you.

33
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,560
This is a crime.

34
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,640
With all due respect.

35
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,480
If I hadn’t helped,

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,400
the Queen Mother might have lost her life.

37
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Is that what Your Majesty
would have wanted?

38
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,240
Both Madame Sae and I

39
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,240
should be rewarded for our loyalty.

40
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,960
With all due respect,

41
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,520
the true culprit

42
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,440
is the one who gave Her Majesty
the opium-laced medicine.

43
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
The Royal Physician
has received his punishment.

44
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,680
-Go!
-Let go of me!

45
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,000
Huh!

46
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,680
Ugh!

47
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,040
-But both of you--
-Thao Inthratevee

48
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,880
and Madame Sae

49
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,960
have saved my life.

50
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,320
They do not deserve punishment.

51
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,360
When one strikes a blow,
the other feels it.

52
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,080
If Thao Inthratevee
is punished for aiding me,

53
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,880
her father, Phraya Nakhon Si Thammarat,

54
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
would not be pleased.

55
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,200
Ayodhaya, having just
undergone a transition,

56
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,520
Your Majesty needs allies,

57
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,200
not enemies.

58
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,800
Out of respect for the Queen Mother,

59
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,880
this time,

60
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,200
I’ll grant leniency.

61
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,600
But as for you, La-Ongkham…

62
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,080
What have I done wrong, Your Majesty?

63
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,120
This letter is yours.

64
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,280
You know well to whom you sent it.

65
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,920
Your words in that letter

66
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,320
encouraged Khun Phirenthorathep to rebel,

67
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
plotting against me and the Queen Mother.

68
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,520
The punishment for this crime

69
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,840
is death.

70
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,320
Kill me if you would like.

71
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,120
I’m not afraid.

72
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,120
This woman is as unruly
as a wild stallion.

73
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,280
To kill her would be a waste.

74
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,320
Will Your Majesty grant her to me?

75
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,200
You scoundrel!

76
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,600
I’m the daughter of Phraya Sukhothai,

77
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,760
the Chief Concubine
of King Chairachathirat.

78
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,000
You’re not even worthy

79
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,800
of carrying my litter.

80
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,560
But I am the King.

81
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,040
I can give you
to an elephant feeder if I wish.

82
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,680
Viceroy Chan,

83
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,280
if you want her, she’s yours.

84
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,600
Do with her as you please.

85
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,960
Your Majesty.

86
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,880
Ming, Muang,

87
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,640
take her

88
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,640
to the Viceroy’s quarters.

89
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,160
Don’t touch me!

90
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
Let go!

91
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,960
I’m the daughter of Phraya Sukhothai.

92
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,200
Don't think that
just because you’re the King,

93
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
you can do as you please with people.

94
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,360
Let’s see if I can or not.

95
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,160
Chan, take her away.

96
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,480
Hey!

97
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,480
Hey!

98
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,960
Stop! Don’t come closer.

99
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,240
With my blood that falls upon this ground,

100
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,400
I curse

101
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,360
this place with disgrace

102
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,200
and ruin.

103
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,520
May you never find

104
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,040
happiness.

105
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,760
I once aspired

106
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,200
to seize the throne of Ayodhaya

107
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,400
for the one I loved,

108
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,600
to wrest power from the wicked

109
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,000
for the good. But now,

110
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,400
I’ve just realized

111
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
that when power is in hand,

112
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,400
the righteous can become vile,

113
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,920
and those we love
can turn into those we despise.

114
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,560
Why do you look at me like that?

115
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
I once thought

116
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,960
King Chairachathirat was ruthless.

117
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,160
For the throne,

118
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,360
he was capable of killing the innocent,

119
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,120
even children.

120
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,000
In the end,

121
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,640
you’re no different.

122
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,080
King Chairachathirat died from his wounds.

123
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,160
King Yod Fah was bitten by a snake.

124
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,560
And what of my father and Tubtim?

125
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,960
You yourself said that

126
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,880
there are no witnesses.

127
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,600
Before she died,
Tubtim told me everything.

128
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,120
Wasuthep

129
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,160
tricked my father
into making the cursed potion.

130
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,120
It was Chan who hunted and killed Tubtim.

131
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,440
She only had this hairpin

132
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,680
to protect herself.
Yet he still killed her.

133
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,720
And the opium…

134
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,000
The opium I consumed

135
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,520
was from you.

136
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,520
I love you deeply.

137
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,000
How could I ever do such a thing?

138
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,320
No matter how many times
you've betrayed me,

139
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,920
I still love you.

140
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,360
I want us

141
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,160
to rule Ayodhaya together.

142
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,800
But I don’t.

143
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,840
You’re no longer my Wamon.

144
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,520
Now,

145
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,920
you’re Khun Worawongsa

146
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,760
who is ruthless.

147
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,040
You're Khun Wowawongsa,

148
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,200
who is wicked and cruel.

149
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,040
I have no wish to be with you,

150
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,840
and you are

151
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,000
unworthy of Ayodhaya’s throne.

152
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,400
Jinda!

153
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,400
Do you remember the vow you made?

154
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
What was your vow?!

155
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,720
I vowed that

156
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,000
I would be loyal

157
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,200
and love Wamon,

158
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,680
the one and only.

159
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,520
-If I stray from this promise,
-If I stray from this promise,

160
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,400
-may the heavens punish me.
-may the heavens punish me.

161
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,320
It's good you remember it.

162
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,720
From now on,

163
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,040
be the loyal wife

164
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,280
that you swore to be.

165
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,680
Otherwise,

166
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,520
not only the heavens will punish you.

167
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,920
Mother Earth,

168
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,560
now that the vile have seized power

169
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,440
and oppress the people,

170
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,360
I can no longer stay silent.

171
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,040
I will destroy these vile foes

172
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,800
and restore peace to the land.

173
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,880
May the gods

174
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,240
bless me with victory.

175
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,800
As for those two wretched traitors,

176
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,120
I’ll take their heads,
and stain the land with their blood.

177
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,760
If I don’t fulfill this vow,

178
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,000
may I never find peace, even in death.

179
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
-No!
-Don't take my things!

180
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,839
-Give back my things!
-No!

181
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,160
-Give back my things!
-No!

182
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,920
-Give it back!
-Don't take my things!

183
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,119
Don't take it!

184
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,720
Hey!

185
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,960
Father!

186
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,480
No!

187
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,000
Stop, please.

188
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,440
Don't hurt my child.

189
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,360
Please, take anything you want,
but don't hurt my child.

190
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,920
Take it!

191
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,200
Anyone, please help my child!

192
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,120
My child!

193
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,800
Anyone, please help!

194
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,480
Villagers have been crying out,

195
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,080
troubled by a scarcity of food.

196
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,200
They’re also harassed every day

197
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,920
by officials, Your Majesty.

198
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,040
And who exactly
are you accusing, Phraya Chakkri?

199
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,840
The Viceroy, Chan, has abused his power,

200
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,400
accusing commoners of offenses,

201
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,960
extracting arbitrary fines.

202
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,040
Those who resist
are punished as he pleases,

203
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,920
seizing their property
under the pretense of it

204
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,360
being confiscated by the crown.

205
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,000
And why then, are the people
saying that these are my people?

206
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,560
Thongdee.

207
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,520
Don’t be afraid.
My mistress is a good person.

208
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,160
She's a relative of high officials.

209
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,080
She can help you.

210
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,160
Tell her who those men are.

211
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,840
They claimed
they were Queen Mother's people.

212
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,880
And you believed them?

213
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,960
Why would Queen Mother
send anyone to rob you?

214
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,880
Jinda.

215
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,760
At first, I didn’t believe it,

216
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,160
but they had the mark on their wrists.

217
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,960
Like this?

218
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,960
Yes.

219
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,680
They said it is the Royal Insignia
of the Queen Mother.

220
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,960
They say she is ruthless and merciless,

221
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,200
killing like it is nothing,

222
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,320
and that’s why no one
dares to help the villagers.

223
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,080
The Viceroy Chan has been using my name

224
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,160
and my Royal Insignia
to terrorize the people.

225
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,080
What will you do to punish him,
Your Majesty?

226
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,880
Let's hear all sides
before judgment is passed.

227
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,880
Viceroy Chan,

228
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,720
why have you done such things?

229
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,080
They claimed that trade was stagnant,
waters were low,

230
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,160
and placed the blame

231
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,520
on the King.

232
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,240
I saw their actions
as a disgrace to the Crown

233
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,120
and a threat to the throne.

234
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,040
I felt it was necessary to act swiftly.

235
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,920
Villagers cry out

236
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,640
because they’re suffering.

237
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,280
How can a cry for help
be a threat to the throne?

238
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,920
What you have done

239
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,640
is use royal authority

240
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,800
to oppress the people.

241
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,480
That is

242
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,200
what deserves demotion

243
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,480
and harsh punishment as a lesson.

244
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,400
Enough!

245
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,000
Listen.

246
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,160
From this moment,

247
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,600
I command Phraya Chakkri

248
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
to increase the guard
to keep watch over the people.

249
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,280
If anyone is caught oppressing villagers,

250
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,520
deal with them swiftly,

251
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,600
regardless of whose people they are.

252
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,000
You cannot do that.

253
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,200
Chan is bold.
If we do not put him in his place,

254
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,840
how can I rule?

255
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,160
You’re wrong.

256
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,800
If you want to rule,
you must give Chan power.

257
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,320
Have you forgotten Chan is your weapon?

258
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,080
The more fearsome he is,

259
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,760
the more powerful you become.

260
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
I am no longer the old Wamon.

261
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Now I am King.

262
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,120
I cannot keep someone
who acts like a bandit.

263
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,160
But this throne you sit upon

264
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,200
was gained by bandits' hands.

265
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,600
It is only by bandits' hands

266
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,520
that your throne is upheld.

267
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,600
There is no other way.

268
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,520
Chan is like Wamon’s arm,

269
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,800
and no matter how corrupt,
he won’t cut it off.

270
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,560
If you cannot cut off the arm,

271
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
then you must cut off the head.

272
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,400
Without the head,

273
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,640
the limbs lose their power.

274
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,600
I had hoped

275
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,720
for Prince Sri Sin to grow a little older,

276
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,440
but I can’t bear to see that
the people of Ayodhaya

277
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,400
have to suffer

278
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,680
because of Chan.

279
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
It seems we can no longer wait, Lady Noi.

280
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,440
The task I once asked you to carry out,

281
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,240
please proceed.

282
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,120
The people live in fear,

283
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,520
and if this goes on,
the kingdom will weaken.

284
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,040
All because the King
has raised a bandit to power.

285
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,640
If we leave it unchecked,
disaster is certain.

286
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,600
Those in power,

287
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,120
if they betray,
lose the legitimacy of their authority.

288
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,480
The reign of King Worawongsathirat

289
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,800
won't last long.

290
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,080
You must all prepare.

291
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,680
Hey!

292
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Who are you? Why are you here?

293
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,520
Ok Khun.

294
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,840
Stay quiet. No one must know
I’ve returned to Ayodhaya.

295
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,720
The senior officials

296
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,320
all agree that
it's time to reclaim our kingdom.

297
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,040
Khun Phirenthorathep,
what action do you propose?

298
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,560
Eliminate Khun Worawongsa

299
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,800
and Queen Mother Srisudachan.

300
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,000
It’s easy to say, but how will we do it?

301
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,520
Tonight is the new moon night.

302
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,320
Everything is perfect.

303
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,000
Where is the item?

304
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,520
This hairpin

305
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,320
has the blood of Khun Worawongsa.

306
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,840
Madame Sae.

307
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
Here.

308
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,720
A piece of soil from his footprint,

309
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,680
a thread from his robe,

310
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,880
and a strand of his hair.

311
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,920
In truth,

312
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,040
this dark magic should not be used,

313
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,560
for it is dangerous.

314
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,840
I don’t wish to use it.

315
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,120
I've thought about it,

316
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,520
but I see no other way.

317
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,080
You understand,

318
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,320
if it fails,
the consequences will be dire.

319
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
So be it.

320
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,120
Since righteousness
cannot conquer wickedness,

321
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
let evil destroy evil.

322
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,560
All that's left now is to wait.

323
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,840
Heaven is on our side.
Today I received a letter from Lopburi.

324
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,040
Ok Phra Nakhon Brahmin, Ruler of Lopburi,

325
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,640
and the officials of Lopburi

326
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,720
send important news
to Phraya Chakkri, the Chancellor.

327
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,960
They report that a great bull elephant,
standing six sok tall,

328
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,520
with auspicious ears, trunk, and tail,
the attributes of a royal elephant,

329
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,000
has wandered from the forest near Lopburi.

330
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,880
They request that Phraya Chakkri
present this news to the King,

331
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Your Majesty.

332
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
The sighting of
such an auspicious elephant

333
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,040
at the beginning of a new reign

334
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,440
is a good omen,

335
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,160
signifying the merit
and glory of the King,

336
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,600
which will bring

337
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,680
prosperity to the land.

338
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,480
This is indeed a blessing

339
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,360
and an auspicious sign.

340
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,040
Where is the elephant now?

341
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,320
The officials of Lopburi

342
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,360
have corralled the herd
at the edge of the forest,

343
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,840
awaiting Your Majesty’s orders.

344
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,040
Thao Intharatevee.

345
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,960
What's happening, Your Majesty?

346
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,480
Come with me for a moment.

347
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,960
The time has come, Lady Noi.

348
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,040
For what, Your Majesty?
I don’t understand.

349
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,880
Khun Worawongsa

350
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,920
is going to catch the elephant.

351
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,360
Your fortune is not favorable right now.

352
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,160
It would be unwise to travel.

353
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,720
An auspicious elephant
has appeared under my reign.

354
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,920
How can my fortune be bad?

355
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,240
The stars foretell it. Trust me.

356
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,480
Don’t leave the royal palace.

357
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,680
I cannot ignore this.

358
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,440
Now,

359
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,560
the nobles and the people are
growing bold, losing their respect for me.

360
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,280
The appearance of an auspicious elephant

361
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,480
is a sign that
I am truly meant to be King.

362
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,080
I must capture that elephant

363
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,560
and celebrate its capture in grandeur.
Then,

364
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,280
they will accept my legitimacy.

365
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,760
In seven days, the mahouts will guide
the herd near Mae Nang Pleum Temple,

366
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,320
heading to the stockade at Song Temple.

367
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,360
Khun Worawongsa will travel by water

368
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,400
to conduct the elephant capture ceremony.

369
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,840
I have prepared people for this.

370
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,080
But it seems they are on alert.

371
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,360
Brahmin Wasuthep ordered Viceroy Chan

372
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,760
to assemble a grand procession of guards,

373
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,680
as if they were marching to war.

374
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,640
Though outnumbered, I am not afraid.

375
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,160
I have invited

376
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,480
a skilled warrior to aid us.

377
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,040
Please come in.

378
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,400
MEUN RATCHASANEHA

379
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,280
Meun Ratchasaneha?

380
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,199
I am glad that noblemen
still love their land.

381
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,239
Let me join you.

382
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
Give your orders.

383
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,920
In the Royal Palace, guardian spirits

384
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,080
protect the white umbrella of state.

385
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,880
We cannot defile it.

386
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,679
I will seize the opportunity

387
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,080
when Khun Worawongsa
leaves to capture the elephant.

388
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,760
I'll have him take this pill.

389
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,920
But he no longer trusts you.

390
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,880
Everything he eats and drinks
is inspected by others.

391
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Will you make it?

392
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,760
There will be few people on the barge.

393
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,920
I believe I can.

394
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,720
Be careful.

395
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,720
Don't risk your life.

396
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,480
Promise me

397
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,520
that you’ll stay safe.

398
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,080
On this journey to capture the elephant,

399
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,440
besides Chan,

400
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,400
trust no one,

401
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,520
especially Queen Mother Srisudachan.

402
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,040
Khun Worawongsa
and Queen Mother Srisudachan

403
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,920
will proceed to capture
the auspicious elephant by river.

404
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,960
The royal barge
will depart from Wasukri Pier…

405
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,520
and will pass through Sabua Canal.

406
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,360
I

407
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,360
will wait here,

408
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
ready to intercept,

409
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,440
once the royal barge comes close.

410
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,880
Khun Inthrathep,

411
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,160
as the head of the
Royal Police Department,

412
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,920
you are responsible for maintaining
security in the Royal Procession.

413
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,280
Take your boat alongside theirs

414
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,000
and capture those two.

415
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,000
And what of Viceroy Chan’s men?

416
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
I’ll have Meun Ratchasaneha

417
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,800
take a force to handle them
and kill them all.

418
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,000
If I go to kill Viceroy Chan,
who will assist you, Ok Khun?

419
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,120
Do you think you can intercept
the royal barge on your own?

420
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,760
Several days ago,

421
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,760
Khun Worawongsa ordered me
to summon Phraya Pichai

422
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,680
and Phraya Sawankhalok
to Ayodhaya for royal duties,

423
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,440
replacing them
with his own men as governors.

424
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,680
This greatly angered them both.

425
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,280
The enemy of our enemy is our friend.

426
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,000
Perhaps we could invite them
to join us in this cause.

427
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,120
I’ve already taken the liberty
of inviting them.

428
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,960
Phraya Pichai, Phraya Sawankhalok,
please come in.

429
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,360
I ask everyone here to swear an oath

430
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,640
before this sacred water

431
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,800
that we will act with integrity,

432
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,120
seeking no personal gain,

433
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,960
but acting solely
for the people of Ayodhaya.

434
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,000
Should any of us break this vow,

435
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,240
may this sacred water

436
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,280
turn to acid

437
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,120
and may those

438
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,720
who betray the land

439
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,000
die painfully.

440
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,240
You don’t need to go.

441
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,560
If anything happens to me,

442
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,920
take Prince Sri Sin

443
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,440
and the Princess to Thao Inthatevee.

444
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,360
She will take care of you

445
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,760
and my children.

446
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

447
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,400
Where are you taking them?

448
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,480
The King has ordered

449
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,040
Prince Sri Sin and the Princess
to join the procession.

450
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,280
No.

451
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,520
Escort them back inside.

452
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,600
They cannot go.

453
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,640
Why not?

454
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,200
An auspicious elephant is a rare sight,

455
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,800
appearing only once in a great while.

456
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,720
The Prince and Princess

457
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,440
should see it as a blessing.

458
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,160
But my children are still young.

459
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,680
Taking them along

460
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,640
will be difficult.

461
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,440
I'll take good care of them.

462
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,560
Staying with me

463
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,960
on the royal barge should be safe, right?

464
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,000
With the Prince and Princess
going along, what will Your Majesty do?

465
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,800
Where is Viceroy Chan?
Why isn’t he here to ensure security?

466
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,040
With all due respect,

467
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,960
Viceroy Chan has assessed that

468
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,480
the royal procession is sufficiently
protected by the Royal Guard

469
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,880
and has taken another detachment ahead

470
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,560
to secure the area
around the elephant enclosure.

471
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,600
Prepare to move.

472
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,240
Go!

473
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,320
The royal barge
should be approaching soon.

474
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,520
Let’s board our boats.

475
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,640
Royal attendant,

476
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,880
escort the Prince to play outside.

477
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,720
Go watch the birds and the fish my Son.

478
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,880
I'm not going.

479
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,040
Go, my Son.

480
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,240
I'm not going. I don't want to go.

481
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,360
Go, my Dear.

482
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,640
I'm not going.

483
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,560
What is that?

484
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,640
Balsam.

485
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,520
In that case, hand it over to me.

486
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,400
Your Majesty.

487
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,080
Khun Phirenthorathep

488
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,120
has taken a boat
to intercept the royal barge.

489
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,520
Go!

490
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,400
Bring the boat to shore.

491
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,200
-Go, my Dear. Hurry up!
-Are you going out there to die?

492
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,240
-Hurry up!
-My children!

493
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,120
My children!

494
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,520
-Hurry up!
-My children!

495
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,680
My children!

496
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,760
Hurry up!

497
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,280
Let go of me! My children!

498
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,360
-Hurry up!
-Let go of me!

499
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,800
Hurry up!

500
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,640
Mother!

501
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,000
Don’t harm my children!

502
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,880
The Prince is the heir of King Chairacha.

503
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,600
I honor him above all.

504
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,640
Escort Prince Sri Sin back to the palace.

505
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,600
I'm not going!

506
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,840
My child!

507
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,760
Kill all the others!

508
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,080
Let go of me!

509
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,080
Let go of me!

510
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,680
My child!

511
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,720
-Let go of me!
-Stay still!

512
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,080
Hold him.

513
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,960
-Hey!
-Mother!

514
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,800
My child!

515
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,800
Go!

516
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,200
-Hand him over!
-No! Don't harm my child!

517
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,120
Stop!

518
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,680
Stop!

519
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,880
Your Highness!

520
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,320
Don't harm my child.

521
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,800
Don't harm my child.

522
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,520
Step back!

523
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,320
-My child!
-Mother!

524
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,440
Step back!

525
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,360
-My child! Let go of my child.
-Get on the horse!

526
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,080
I said get on!

527
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,720
Step back!

528
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,200
What about my child?

529
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,760
-My child!
-Mother!

530
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,880
-Mother!
-Your Highness!

531
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,600
My child!

532
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,760
Go!

533
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,120
Mother!

534
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,000
Mother!

535
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,040
-Mother!
-Take the Prince back to the palace.

536
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,680
The rest, follow me!

537
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,680
Could their horse be injured,
unable to go on, and thus abandoned?

538
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,960
Check everywhere.

539
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,440
I see footprints.

540
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,200
-They went this way.
-Hurry up!

541
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,920
Don’t feel downhearted.
We’re fortunate to have found this cave.

542
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,600
Khun Phirenthorathep won’t find us here.

543
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,480
But we must wait for nightfall
before leaving.

544
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,280
Where to?

545
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,600
Is there any place
left for us in this land?

546
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,160
We have merit and wisdom.

547
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,880
If we work together, we’ll reclaim power.

548
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,600
You may have merit and wisdom,

549
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,480
but you lack virtue.

550
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,520
If someone like you were to hold power,

551
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,280
many innocent people would suffer.

552
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,120
Wamon…

553
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,520
We have committed many sins together.

554
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,880
It’s time for us to stop.

555
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,360
I know

556
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,560
I won't survive today.

557
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,280
So before I die,

558
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,680
I will atone for the sins
I’ve committed against this land.

559
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,840
What are you going to do?

560
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,600
Khun Worawongsa is here!

561
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,400
Silence!

562
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,040
We followed their trail,
but it has disappeared.

563
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,080
The horse appears unharmed.

564
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,080
They were merely trying to mislead us.

565
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,160
I suspect

566
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,480
they are hiding nearby.

567
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:36,960
Go.

568
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,720
Are you out of your mind, Jinda?

569
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,600
If they find us,
it won’t be just me who dies.

570
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,120
You’ll die too.

571
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,600
I know.

572
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,920
Yet you still do it?

573
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,960
Do you want me to die?

574
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,280
Do you hate me that much?

575
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,800
As much as I once loved you,

576
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,280
I now hate you with equal intensity.

577
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,400
-Let go!
-Give it to me!

578
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,200
This poison.

579
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,960
Don’t think I don’t know.

580
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,000
You bear a grudge against me.

581
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,360
You want to kill me.

582
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,480
Such a waste, for I once loved you.

583
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,000
But if you truly want to die,

584
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,960
I will help you achieve it.

585
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,840
-Come here!
-Let go of me!

586
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,520
Let go of me!

587
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,360
Let me go!

588
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,960
I'll help you achieve what you want.

589
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,560
What poison is this?

590
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,040
This is not poison,

591
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,960
but a cursed potion

592
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,840
made from your own blood.

593
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,760
It only harms you.

594
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,400
This potion

595
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,360
cannot kill me,

596
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,360
but it has shown me

597
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,760
that a person like you

598
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,120
deserves death.

599
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,280
Jinda.

600
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,080
Thao Srisudachan!

601
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,720
Surrender yourself

602
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,560
and face the judgment of the land!

603
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,320
What is my crime?

604
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,960
You consorted with a lover,

605
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,120
elevating him to a position of power,
oppressing and exploiting the people,

606
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,840
and committing treason.

607
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:27,560
That’s not true.
I never did what you said.

608
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,080
It’s not true.

609
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,000
I didn't do what you said!

610
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,680
It's not true.

611
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,040
I didn't do it.

612
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,160
Khun Worawongsa,

613
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,520
you despicable tyrant,
guilty of atrocities.

614
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,040
Slaughtering the royal bloodline
and usurping the throne of Ayodhaya.

615
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,840
Come out now and accept your punishment!

616
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,520
You speak boldly,

617
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,680
but what I did is no different
from King Chairacha.

618
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,640
But whatever.

619
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,800
Victory defines the King.
Defeat defines the villain.

620
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,560
Since I have lost,

621
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,320
I will accept my fate.

622
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,000
Kill them!

623
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,480
No!

624
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,800
Even if across the entire land,

625
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:59,080
there are only voices
of curses and reproach.

626
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,560
But you

627
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,440
will forever be beautiful in my heart.

628
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,520
This is the end of me,

629
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:05,440
a woman blessed
with power above all others.

630
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,800
On a path tainted by sin,

631
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,280
people fell,

632
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,480
no matter friend

633
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,720
or foe.

634
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,600
I do not know how my story

635
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,560
will be told from this day forward,

636
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,040
but let it stand as a reminder

637
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,000
to not be misled and abandon virtue.

638
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,360
And let none forget

639
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,960
that once, Ayodhaya had me,

640
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,000
the Queen Mother,

641
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,320
Thao Srisudachan.

642
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,439
THE END

643
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,160
