Disclaimer

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,140
The series "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,340
was inspired by the history
of Thao Sri Sudachan.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,580
The events, characters, behaviors,

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,900
and details in this story are interpreted,

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,780
expanded upon, or newly created
for entertainment purposes

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,780
and are not entirely
based on true historical events.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,260
The creators are aware that some events
or actions may spark criticism,

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,820
but we affirm that the production

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,540
of "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,980
was made with good intentions.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,340
Beyond entertainment,
the aim is to encourage viewers

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,020
to take an interest in history.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,860
After watching, if viewers are interested,

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,580
they can seek additional knowledge
from experts or historians

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,620
to gain an accurate understanding
of Ayutthaya history.

17
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,320
As for you, Jinda,

18
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,840
you have violated palace law.

19
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,800
Your sentence

20
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,480
is death.

21
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,400
However,

22
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,640
since it seems you acted out of necessity,

23
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,240
I have decided

24
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,040
to impose a lighter punishment

25
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,480
of 20 lashes with a cane

26
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,240
and confinement in the palace

27
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,240
for one month.

28
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,840
It is a great mercy, Your Majesty.

29
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,800
Cane her.

30
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,720
Phra Lokthip,

31
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
the Chief Astrologer,

32
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,960
you lied to the King,

33
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,400
which is a crime equivalent to treason

34
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,560
and punishable by death.

35
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,960
However, palace law forbids
the killing of Brahmins,

36
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,760
so you are to be removed
from your position

37
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,080
and exiled from Ayodhaya.

38
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,400
No, no, no!

39
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,720
-Stay still!
-No! Let go of me!

40
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,280
-Let go of me.
-I said, stay still!

41
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,160
Cut the Thuram necklace

42
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,320
and put a conch shell rosary

43
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,560
around Phra Lokthip’s neck

44
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,840
as a mark of shame.

45
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,560
Escort Phra Lokthip

46
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,240
out of Ayodhaya immediately.

47
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,240
Stay still!

48
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,920
Wait.

49
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,760
May I speak with Phra Lokthip
for just a moment?

50
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,520
I’m sorry Madame,

51
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,920
but we have orders to escort Phra Lokthip

52
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,840
until he is beyond
the borders of Ayodhaya.

53
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,120
Lady.

54
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,120
Help me!

55
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,680
This is compensation

56
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,320
for the trouble you’ve gone through
because of me.

57
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,240
Take this ring

58
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,640
back to my home in Suphan,

59
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
and someone will look after you

60
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,360
and ensure your comfort.

61
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,920
Don’t worry.

62
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,520
I will never forget

63
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,120
your kindness.

64
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,080
Safe travels.

65
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,080
Wait.

66
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,320
Get rid of Lady Jinda.

67
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,000
Do not let her live.

68
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Get rid of her?

69
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,640
Are you asking me

70
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,760
to kill her?

71
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,800
I have studied Lady Jinda’s fate.

72
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,520
Her sun star is strong,

73
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,000
and she is destined to rise to power.

74
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,480
But if that happens,

75
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,440
she will bring ruin

76
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,920
to Ayodhaya.

77
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,160
Are you awake?

78
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,680
Take it slow. Your wounds are still fresh.

79
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,880
Tub… Tubtim,

80
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
how did I end up here?

81
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
The King carried you back.

82
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,200
He is waiting outside now.

83
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,440
It is Your Majesty’s mercy

84
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,200
that you brought me back.

85
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,920
I saw you near death

86
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,480
and pitied you.

87
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,200
Do you still have

88
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,840
the ring I gave you?

89
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
I have kept it close,

90
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,160
never letting it out of my sight.

91
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,240
Then why didn’t you use the ring?

92
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,360
Anyone

93
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,800
who holds this ring

94
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,960
has a favor from me.

95
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,040
Present it,

96
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,720
and you may ask for anything from me once.

97
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,880
I kept silent

98
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,480
because I wanted to see

99
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,480
how Your Majesty
would judge the situation.

100
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,560
And what if I had ordered your execution?

101
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,120
Then it wouldn’t have been
too late for me to ask.

102
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,000
But I am

103
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,760
certain that

104
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,640
Your Majesty, being virtuous,

105
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,480
would not order the execution
of someone loyal to you.

106
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,360
Lady Jinda is fortunate to have survived.

107
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,040
Madame Sae knew from the start

108
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,200
that Lady Jinda had snuck out

109
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,560
but did nothing to stop her.

110
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,960
Instead, she sent people to catch her,

111
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,160
likely hoping she would face death.

112
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,000
Still waters run deep, indeed.

113
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,120
No one here can be trusted.

114
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,480
Eh?

115
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,480
What is it my Lady?

116
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,720
I saw a hawk.

117
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,040
You’re imagining things.

118
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,000
How could there be a hawk
within the palace grounds?

119
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,720
But I saw it with my own eyes.

120
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,160
It flew from

121
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Lady Jinda’s place.

122
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,480
Lady Jinda was flogged with a cane

123
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,880
and confined
to her residence for one month,

124
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,840
but the King showed her mercy.

125
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,800
Once the four main concubines
are appointed,

126
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,520
our plan

127
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,920
will come to fruition.

128
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,760
I have studied Lady Jinda’s fate.

129
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,480
Her sun star is strong,

130
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,040
and she is destined to rise to power.

131
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,600
But if that happens,

132
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,360
she will bring ruin

133
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,880
to Ayodhaya.

134
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,840
Lady,

135
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,560
the King is coming.

136
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,720
No need for formalities.

137
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
You arrive without notice.

138
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,520
Is there something I can help with?

139
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,640
Phra Lokthip is guilty,

140
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,760
and you know the reason why.

141
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Today, I spare you

142
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,720
out of consideration.

143
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,640
It is Your Majesty’s great mercy.

144
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,960
The appointment of four main concubines

145
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,680
is an ancient royal tradition

146
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,920
meant to uphold the throne.

147
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,800
If you wish to compete for favor,

148
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,320
I won’t interfere.

149
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,160
But if your actions harm the kingdom,

150
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,680
you will lose your head,

151
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,160
no exceptions.

152
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,080
Remember that.

153
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,880
I

154
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,640
have served Your Majesty

155
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,240
since you were the Viceroy

156
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,040
of Phitsanulok.

157
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,560
And now

158
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,960
that you are King of Ayodhaya,

159
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,920
if a Queen Consort is to be appointed,

160
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,200
shouldn’t it be me?

161
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,960
I understand

162
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,120
your loyalty,

163
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,240
but only the concubine who bears a son

164
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,080
as the heir

165
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,720
will be appointed Queen Consort.

166
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,720
Then

167
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,560
grant me a Royal Son,

168
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,360
Your Majesty.

169
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,480
Please.

170
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,600
The King left Lady Chittrawadee’s chamber

171
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,560
just this morning.

172
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,160
How frustrating!

173
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,760
That old hen managed to win his favor.

174
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,520
I’ve come to visit Lady Jinda.

175
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,520
How is your mistress?

176
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,800
Her condition has improved.

177
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,400
She is resting inside.

178
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,400
This way please.

179
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,400
Thongdee, wait outside.

180
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,560
I won’t be long.

181
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,200
Yes my Lady.

182
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,680
Thank you so much

183
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,720
for visiting me.

184
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,400
Have you heard any news
of the King, Lady Jinda?

185
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,400
I’ve been hearing people talking
since this morning.

186
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,640
They say Madame Sae has been praying

187
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,520
for Lady Chittrawadee to bear a son.

188
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,800
Doesn’t this concern you at all?

189
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,640
Why do you seem so unbothered?

190
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,320
I didn’t want to offer myself
to the King in the first place.

191
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,800
I’m only here because I had no choice.

192
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,320
I didn’t want to either.

193
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,520
But what Lady Chittrawadee
has done to both of us is not right.

194
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,760
Don’t be so upset.

195
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,400
For now, you can’t fight anyone.

196
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,000
Focus on recovering first.

197
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,880
Here,

198
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,040
I brought you some medicine.

199
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,320
It’s a balm from my home,

200
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,640
better than the royal remedies.

201
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,560
It heals wounds quickly

202
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,200
and leaves no scars.

203
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,200
Thank you so much.

204
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,440
I’ll apply it for you.

205
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,480
Don’t worry Lady Jinda.

206
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,240
You are so beautiful.

207
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,200
Once you present yourself to the King,

208
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,240
you’re sure to become his favorite.

209
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,400
Behind Lady Jinda’s chamber,

210
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,520
there’s an empty bird perch my Lady.

211
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,960
Lady Jinda is raising
a hawk to send messages.

212
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,120
She must have been
secretly communicating with outsiders.

213
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,200
-If the King discovers this--
-Don’t tell anyone.

214
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,440
Then why did you ask me to check?

215
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,560
Secrets are valuable

216
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,320
only when revealed at the right time.

217
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,280
There can only be one Queen Consort.

218
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,960
If I can’t rise to power,

219
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,640
I’ll be left with nothing.

220
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,680
But if I hold everyone’s secrets,

221
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,800
no one can ever oppress me.

222
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,240
On this day,

223
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,720
in the year

224
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,600
896 of the Chula Sakkarat calendar,

225
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,360
during the auspicious 12th day
of the ninth month,

226
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,400
under the royal command

227
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,440
of King Chairachathirat,

228
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,640
the four main concubines are appointed.

229
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,960
Lady Chittrawadee
as Thao Intharasurenthorn,

230
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,920
Lady La-ongkham,

231
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,240
daughter of Ok Ya Sukhothai,

232
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,360
as Thao Si Chulalak,

233
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,280
Lady Tanyong,

234
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,400
daughter of Ok Ya Nakhon Si Thammarat,

235
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,160
as Thao Inthratevee,

236
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,440
and Lady Jinda,

237
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,040
daughter of Ok Phra Lopburi,

238
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,240
as Thao Srisudachan.

239
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,320
The ceremony for appointing
the four main concubines is complete.

240
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,480
-My Lady.
-My Lady.

241
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,040
My Lady.

242
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,040
My Lady.

243
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,240
How is she Tubtim?

244
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,400
Lady Chittrawadee merely fainted.

245
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,040
She recovered quickly after a short rest.

246
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,640
What a coincidence.

247
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,840
An incident occurs
during the royal ceremony,

248
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,840
and the King is called away.

249
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,760
We don't know which concubine

250
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,680
he will favor tonight.

251
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,560
Don't talk much.

252
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,160
Where is the prisoner?

253
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,680
-Where is he from?
-With all due respect, Your Majesty,

254
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,360
I found a suspicious merchant

255
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,680
outside the city walls.

256
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,360
I thought

257
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,680
they were suspicious.

258
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
So I ordered my men to search their cart.

259
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,000
Search everything.

260
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,800
-Hey, grab him!
-Come down!

261
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,920
-I’m just a merchant! Don’t harm me!
-Get down!

262
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,040
-Quickly! Move!
-No! No!

263
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,360
Open it!

264
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,200
Hey!

265
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Run!

266
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,480
Get up!

267
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,720
What did you find out
from the interrogation?

268
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,040
Who sent him?

269
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,480
He hasn’t said a word, Your Majesty.

270
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,960
Tell me,

271
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,320
who sent you.

272
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,280
What were you planning?

273
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,640
I asked what you were planning!

274
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,960
Kill…

275
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,000
Who sent you?

276
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,160
Who sent you?

277
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,440
Tell me!

278
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,080
You’ll know

279
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,720
when you meet your end.

280
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,960
Your Majesty,

281
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,920
he’s dead.

282
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
He’s dead.

283
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,320
Now how will I ever know

284
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,960
who sought to kill me?

285
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,160
My name is Fak.

286
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,800
I’ve been a servant

287
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,280
to Ok Phra Lopburi.

288
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,080
I raised Lady Jinda since she was a child.

289
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,760
Your Lady Jinda

290
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,120
is now Thao Srisudachan.

291
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,200
You cannot see her.

292
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,360
If you have business, leave a message,

293
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,560
and I will see that it reaches her.

294
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,080
I raised her since she was a child.

295
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,240
When she left,

296
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,240
it was so sudden

297
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,000
we didn’t even say goodbye.

298
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,080
Before I die,

299
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,680
I want to see her

300
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,240
once more.

301
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,960
And who is that woman,

302
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,960
with her face covered like that?

303
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,840
Why don't you answer? Are you mute?

304
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,200
Her name is Pan.

305
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,120
She has been mute

306
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,280
since birth.

307
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,480
She was born

308
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,480
with marks on her face.

309
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,480
I covered her because

310
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,200
I didn’t want her face to trouble anyone.

311
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,280
I miss you so much.

312
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,440
I miss you even more.

313
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,640
You took such a risk

314
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,960
sneaking in here.

315
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,960
What if someone sees you?

316
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,840
You were just appointed
as Thao Srisudachan.

317
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,760
Our plan is almost completed,

318
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,680
so I wanted to come and congratulate you.

319
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,960
Thao Srisudachan

320
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,920
has been ordered

321
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
to present herself tonight.

322
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,360
Lady Somsak has brought attendants

323
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,760
with royal robes and perfumes

324
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,920
to help prepare Thao Srisudachan

325
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,160
according to royal tradition.

326
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,080
Where is Thao Srisudachan?

327
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,960
The lady attendants…

328
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,840
The attendants are coming
to help me get dressed.

329
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,200
Lady,

330
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,360
when you’re finished, hurry and come out.

331
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,600
What should I do, Madame?

332
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,720
Cleanse your body thoroughly,
from head to toe.

333
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,120
Apply the perfumes,

334
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,480
and wear the royal robes provided.

335
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,360
When the auspicious moment arrives,

336
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,760
the attendants will escort you
to the royal chambers.

337
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Would you allow the attendants

338
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,600
to come in and assist you?

339
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,440
Lady?

340
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,880
Since I was a child,

341
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,080
I’ve never let anyone bathe me Madame Sae.

342
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,480
Leave everything outside,

343
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,720
and Tubtim will help me.

344
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,880
-But--
-Please understand.

345
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,000
Don’t push me any further.

346
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,680
I thought we were going to get caught.

347
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,520
Lady Jinda,

348
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,800
go and prepare yourself.

349
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,560
Sooner or later,

350
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,000
you knew this day would come.

351
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,880
You’ll have to present yourself
as a concubine

352
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,160
and bear a son, the heir to the throne.

353
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,480
Is there no other way?

354
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,160
The wounds from the flogging have healed.

355
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,600
The invulnerability ointment you gave me

356
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,040
made my skin numb,

357
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,280
but I was sore for days.

358
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,920
You must have suffered greatly.

359
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,120
I love you so much.

360
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,720
Remember my vow.

361
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,880
There will be no one else in my heart,

362
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,160
but you.

363
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,560
I trust you.

364
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,360
When King Chairachathirat is gone,

365
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,920
it will be our time.

366
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,320
Those who seek to kill me

367
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,840
must be from the major cities,

368
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,040
with strong armies,

369
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,160
ready to seize the throne of Ayodhaya

370
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,640
once I'm dead.

371
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,840
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

372
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,920
today is an auspicious day.

373
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,880
The new concubines are to be presented.

374
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,160
I suggest

375
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,480
you return to the palace, Your Majesty.

376
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,400
How can I simply go back now Khem?

377
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,240
They must be from one of the major cities,

378
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,120
Sachanalai,

379
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,600
Sukhothai,

380
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,520
Kamphaeng Phet,

381
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,480
or Lopburi.

382
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,680
These rulers, whom I have reduced in ranks

383
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,880
and made answerable directly to Ayodhaya,

384
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,480
paying taxes and providing troops,

385
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,120
must be feeling uneasy.

386
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,960
Do you recall Phra Lokthip’s words?

387
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,920
It’s possible

388
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,920
that one of the concubines they sent

389
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,280
has come to kill me.

390
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,160
Herbal steaming.

391
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,440
You need to be fragrant all over,

392
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,160
no matter where he touches.

393
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,840
Those who seek to kill me

394
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,640
must be from the major cities.

395
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,720
They must be

396
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,920
from one of the major cities,

397
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,080
Sachanalai,

398
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,680
Sukhothai,

399
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,720
Kamphaeng Phet,

400
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,960
or Lopburi.

401
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,280
With all due respect,

402
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,360
I humbly request to serve,

403
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,920
to repay Your Majesty’s kindness

404
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,960
in the inner court

405
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,840
from now on,

406
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,480
Your Majesty.

407
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,520
Someone intends to kill me today.

408
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,480
Are you plotting to kill me?

409
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,760
I have proven my loyalty to Your Majesty

410
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,440
with my life.

411
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,080
The cane marks on my back

412
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,520
are the proof, Your Majesty.

413
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,280
Since I’ve sat on this throne,

414
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,360
there hasn’t been a single night

415
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,280
where I could sleep soundly.

416
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,160
People are always plotting to kill me,

417
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,880
to seize power.

418
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,480
Servants,

419
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,920
soldiers,

420
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,240
children,

421
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,000
and wives.

422
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,840
Who can I trust?

423
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,720
Can I trust you?

424
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

425
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,200
I’m so exhausted.

426
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,920
Lord Shiva

427
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,640
witnessed the suffering of mankind

428
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,560
and shed tears,

429
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,320
which gave rise to a sacred tree

430
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,400
called Rudraksha.

431
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,080
Rudraksha

432
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,520
will protect you from evil

433
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,640
and soothe your sorrow.

434
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,320
Keep it close to you.

435
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,720
How are you my Lady?

436
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,760
My Lady,

437
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,080
take a look.

438
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,840
She can't eat again?

439
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,600
That's strange.

440
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,520
Everything she eats, she says smells bad,

441
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,000
and she has morning sickness.

442
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,320
Could it be good news?

443
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,120
Khem.

444
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,880
Thank you Aunt,

445
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,920
for bringing Khem here so quickly.

446
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,920
We are family.

447
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,880
Tell me, what’s the matter?

448
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,440
It’s been three months now,

449
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,960
and I haven’t had
a single audience with the King.

450
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,800
He always calls for Lady Jinda.

451
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,680
I want you to help me.

452
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,280
I’m not a member of the inner court.

453
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,960
What can I do?

454
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,680
Besides,

455
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,800
right now,

456
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,840
the King is not even in the palace.

457
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,160
-He’s outside Ayodhaya--
-You must help me nonetheless Khem,

458
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,560
because if I don’t become Queen Consort,

459
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,840
I won’t have the fortune and influence

460
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,920
to restore Sukhothai’s power.

461
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,640
Khem,

462
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,520
you’re the King’s favorite.

463
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,760
Think about

464
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,400
what you can do.

465
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,960
Tomorrow, you must go out

466
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,400
and say you’re getting medicine
from a Chinese doctor for me.

467
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,400
What do you want me to do?

468
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,920
Go find Wamon,

469
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,160
and you’ll understand.

470
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,440
There it is.

471
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,200
What is it?

472
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,800
I just saw a hawk fly by.

473
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,600
Thongdee,

474
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,280
be prepared.

475
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,280
Tomorrow, you will have to
track down Lady Jinda’s people.

476
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,680
I want to know

477
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,240
who she’s been sending messages to.

478
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,720
You said you were going
to get medicine for the concubine.

479
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,360
The Chinese medicine shop is that way.

480
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,160
Why are you walking this way?

481
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,920
Just follow me.
Stop asking so many questions.

482
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,400
Keep an eye on her.

483
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,080
I’m sure she’s meeting someone
at this market.

484
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,000
Let’s go.

485
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,080
-Wamon.
-Don’t worry.

486
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,080
There’s no one here but me.

487
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,360
Jinda sent me a message.

488
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,040
She wants me to help her get pregnant,

489
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,160
but I have a better idea.

490
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,000
Wamon sent this for you.

491
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,360
How should I take it?

492
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,080
You don’t take it.

493
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,280
This isn’t medicine to help you conceive.

494
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,360
The herbs in this bottle are bitter.

495
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,760
Mix them with strong-tasting food
and no one will notice.

496
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,600
If Lady Chittrawadee is truly pregnant,

497
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,880
this will cause her to miscarry.

498
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,880
This is a miscarriage-inducing drug?

499
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,760
Give it to Lady Chittrawadee.
