00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,140
The series "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,340
was inspired by the history
of Thao Sri Sudachan.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,580
The events, characters, behaviors,

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,900
and details in this story are interpreted,

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,780
expanded upon, or newly created
for entertainment purposes

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,780
and are not entirely
based on true historical events.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,260
The creators are aware that some events
or actions may spark criticism,

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,820
but we affirm that the production

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,540
of "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,980
was made with good intentions.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,340
Beyond entertainment,
the aim is to encourage viewers

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,020
to take an interest in history.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,860
After watching, if viewers are interested,

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,580
they can seek additional knowledge
from experts or historians

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,620
to gain an accurate understanding
of Ayutthaya history.

17
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,770
Brahmin Wamon has a message for you.

18
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,050
If Lady Chittrawadee is truly with child,

19
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,770
and the child is a boy,

20
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,570
that child will become
the heir to the throne

21
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,250
and rule Ayodhaya in the future.

22
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,650
Jinda's sacrifice in offering herself
to Ayodhaya will be in vain.

23
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,050
Please ask her to consider carefully.

24
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,450
It seems I have no other choice now.

25
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,570
The prisoner we captured yesterday

26
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,170
was hiding among these merchants.

27
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,930
I ordered my men

28
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,650
to bring them in for questioning.

29
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,370
Who are they?

30
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,650
I'm just a merchant.

31
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,650
I didn't know

32
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,850
those two had snuck in, I swear.

33
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,010
Release them.

34
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,410
Release them!

35
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,530
It is Your Majesty's great mercy.

36
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,770
Do you want to die like him,

37
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,490
or will you tell me
who sent you to kill me?

38
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,450
I'll talk! I'll talk!

39
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,090
Khem,

40
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,330
prepare the troops.

41
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,050
I'm marching to Kamphaeng Phet.

42
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,010
I'm going to confront Ok Ya Narai.

43
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,930
He's plotting rebellion against me.

44
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,930
With all due respect,

45
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,850
we cannot declare war

46
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,410
based solely on a prisoner's word,
Your Majesty.

47
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,890
Huh?

48
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,810
I believe Your Majesty

49
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,290
should first demand a tribute

50
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,050
to test their loyalty.

51
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,450
If they refuse,

52
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,610
then we march.
That would be wise, Your Majesty.

53
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,850
Ayodhaya is like a city of gold.

54
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,450
Everyone covets it.

55
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,250
I have

56
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,530
no heir to secure the throne.

57
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,210
The kingdom is unstable.

58
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,730
How can I ever sleep soundly?

59
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,450
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

60
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,730
while you've been

61
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,650
waging wars,

62
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,010
securing an heir

63
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,890
is just as important

64
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,530
and must not be neglected.

65
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,770
Of course, Khem.

66
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,410
What are you doing, Khem?

67
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,170
I see that

68
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,570
Your Majesty has had little time
with the concubines.

69
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,210
Today is an auspicious day,

70
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,250
so I humbly request permission

71
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,810
to present someone to serve Your Majesty.

72
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,250
You two may rest now.

73
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,330
Yes Sir.

74
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,850
Your Majesty,

75
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,250
you've fought tirelessly in battles,

76
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,450
but I am just a woman.

77
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,530
I cannot serve Your Majesty
on the battlefield like Khem,

78
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,130
so I humbly offer to attend
to Your Majesty

79
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,930
and bring you comfort.

80
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,090
Your Majesty!

81
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,050
With all due respect,

82
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,690
what has happened?

83
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,090
Someone shot an arrow at me,
but it missed.

84
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,930
I'll send my men to hunt them down
immediately, Your Majesty.

85
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,090
Wait!

86
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,850
Send men to track them down,

87
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,410
but you must accompany me
back to the palace.

88
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,970
The arrow didn't hit me,

89
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,330
but it struck La-ongkham.

90
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,290
Hey!

91
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,570
What are you gossiping about?

92
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,530
It's time! Why haven't you brought
the food up yet?

93
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,850
Come on, lower the fire!

94
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,170
It's boiling over, it will burn soon.

95
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,890
Ah, Heuang, just in time.

96
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,770
Bring up your mistress's meal.

97
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,690
Is it just rice and salted fish?

98
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,370
I prepared it myself.

99
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,730
I heard Lady La-ongkham

100
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,530
was struck by an arrow,

101
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,850
and if she eats anything unsuitable,
it could worsen her condition.

102
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,450
So I got permission from Madame

103
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,330
to serve only rice and salted fish.

104
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,970
By the grace of her fortune,

105
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,890
the arrow only grazed her.

106
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,530
It's nothing serious.

107
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,690
Though the arrow only grazed her,

108
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,930
sneaking out of the royal grounds

109
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,490
is no small offense.

110
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,490
Well then, take my meal up.

111
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,330
Let your mistress enjoy it

112
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,530
before facing the consequences.

113
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,930
The King is here.

114
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,210
Lady Jinda comes to visit Lady La-ongkham.

115
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,450
Thank you, Lady Jinda,
for your kindness in visiting.

116
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,770
I was reminded
of when I made the same mistake.

117
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,290
Your Majesty punished me with a cane,

118
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,690
and I was bedridden for days.

119
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,370
I thought Lady La-ongkham

120
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,930
must be in similar pain.

121
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,210
Don't speak in riddles.

122
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,130
Do you think I'm unfair,
sparing La-ongkham from punishment?

123
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,450
She went out and got injured on my behalf.

124
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,250
That's an act of merit.

125
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,170
I repaid her kindness

126
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,770
just as I did yours.

127
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,890
You have a ring I gave you
but you chose not to use it.

128
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,490
So why complain?

129
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,730
You're lucky

130
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,570
it turned out to be good.

131
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,610
This only succeeded

132
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,010
because you agreed to help me.

133
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,650
You better play your part well, Samet.

134
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,330
Do not shoot the King.

135
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,970
Yes my Lord.

136
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,770
I only took a small risk,

137
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,130
and now I'm one of the King's favorites.

138
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,090
Don't get too excited.

139
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,850
Do you know

140
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,930
why the King rushed back
to the inner court?

141
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,330
Just tell me.

142
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,570
The Royal Physician informed His Majesty

143
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,250
that Lady Chittrawadee

144
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,770
is three months pregnant.

145
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,650
She told the King

146
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,610
she dreamt of a large Buddha statue

147
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,250
and believes it's a sign
that it will be a son.

148
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,050
The King is overjoyed,

149
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,690
saying when the child is born,

150
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,890
he will reward Lady Chittrawadee

151
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,930
with gold equal to

152
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,450
the weight of the baby prince.

153
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,450
Do it, Lady Jinda.

154
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,530
Brahmin Wamon was right.

155
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,090
You don't have the courage to do it.

156
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,330
What did you say?

157
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,930
That day, Brahmin Wamon told me.

158
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,530
Jinda is too soft-hearted.

159
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,330
She won't be able
to poison the child in the womb.

160
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,130
I agree.

161
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,170
You have to do it in her place.

162
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,730
No, no!

163
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,930
You can't take this risk for me.

164
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,450
But if Lady Chittrawadee
truly gives birth to a son,

165
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,570
that child will be the heir.

166
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,970
By then,

167
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,210
no matter how many sons you bear,
it will be too late.

168
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,410
I know.

169
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,170
I know!

170
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,290
Let's do it this way.

171
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,450
If it must be done,

172
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,250
I'll do it myself.

173
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,650
Phat.

174
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,570
Phat.

175
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,530
Come here.

176
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,490
-Does it hurt?
-It hurts.

177
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,810
You're grown up,
but still falling like a child.

178
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,010
Phut, don't scold your brother.

179
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,170
I'll put some medicine on it.

180
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,770
-Mother!
-Ouch!

181
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,890
Mother!

182
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,330
-My Lady!
-Mother!

183
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,290
-Yes, my Lady.
-Go call the Royal Physician.

184
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,330
Yes, my Lady.

185
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,690
Mother!

186
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,250
-Your Majesty.
-Stay still.

187
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,970
How could this happen?

188
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,770
All of a sudden, I had stomach pains,

189
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,970
and then I started bleeding.

190
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,370
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

191
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,890
Lady Chittrawadee has been poisoned.

192
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,410
Sae,

193
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,450
what did you just say?

194
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,250
Say that again.

195
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,690
Sae, what are you saying?

196
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,570
I believe

197
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,130
that Lady Chittrawadee
is in this condition because

198
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,570
she was poisoned, Your Majesty.

199
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,930
Interrogate everyone
who entered the kitchen.

200
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,170
Bring me the one who killed my child.

201
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,250
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

202
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,570
Did Lady Chittrawadee miscarry?

203
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,530
She was poisoned

204
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,610
out of jealousy.

205
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,770
What are you implying, Madame Sae?

206
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,970
Do you really not know?

207
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,930
Why should I know?

208
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,570
The King said that

209
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,050
if he finds out who did this,

210
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,690
they will be beheaded.

211
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,770
Search everything thoroughly.

212
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,930
If anything suspicious is found,
bring it out.

213
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,130
Don't fear the consequences.

214
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,930
You don't need to worry, Lady Jinda.

215
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,930
There's nothing for you to fear.

216
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,010
Has anything suspicious been found?

217
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,410
Nothing at all, Madame.

218
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,090
Madame Sae, what are you hoping to find?

219
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,730
Can you tell me?

220
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,930
Lady Chittrawadee had her meal
in the late morning,

221
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,210
and miscarried by the afternoon.

222
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,530
The royal physician
believes she was poisoned.

223
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,050
The King ordered a search

224
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,730
in hopes of finding clues
about who poisoned her.

225
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,490
So she was poisoned,

226
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,650
and now you're searching for the poison?

227
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,650
The poison in her food.

228
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,730
If nothing is found, you can all go.

229
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,930
Wait a moment.

230
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,610
In the late morning,

231
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,650
do you happen to know

232
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,450
what Lady Chittrawadee ate?

233
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,570
The attendants said

234
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,490
she complained about the smell of fish
and couldn't eat it.

235
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,570
So, she only had chili paste
with vegetables.

236
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,090
She commented that the chili paste
smelled strangely good,

237
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,090
even though it was unusually spicy.

238
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,090
Someone poisoned the chili paste.

239
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,250
I hid the poison here, but now it's gone.

240
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,170
Did you take it?

241
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,530
Luckily,

242
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,930
I kept it with me.

243
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,850
I was so scared the guards would find it.

244
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,690
How did you get it?

245
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,690
Don't tell me

246
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,970
you poisoned Lady Chittrawadee,

247
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,530
did you?

248
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,130
-Lady Jinda, I…
-Why did you do it?

249
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,730
Lady Jinda, listen to me.

250
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,370
Madame Sae,

251
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,930
what is it now?

252
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,130
I almost fell for the trick,

253
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,730
but the heavens don't favor the guilty.

254
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,690
With such evidence, there's no escape.

255
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,610
Surround the chamber,

256
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,650
and don't let anyone leave.

257
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,770
I'll bring this poison to the King.

258
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,410
Hey!

259
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,970
Let me go!

260
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,130
Lady Jinda.

261
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,970
Lady Jinda.

262
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,690
-I swear I didn't do it!
-Then why did Lady Chittrawadee miscarry?

263
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,890
I didn't do it. That's the truth.

264
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,970
But why did you take the poison?

265
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,370
I only thought about it,

266
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,930
but you didn't command me.

267
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,210
How could I have dared?

268
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,810
Even if you didn't do it,

269
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,530
if Madame Sae
brings the poison to the King,

270
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,090
the Royal Physician will know
it can cause miscarriage.

271
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,690
We'll both

272
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,330
be in trouble.

273
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,850
What have you discovered? Speak.

274
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,530
Upon investigation, I found that this box

275
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,850
contains medicinal herbs
used for treatment,

276
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,730
but in large doses,
they can be deadly, Your Majesty.

277
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,570
By royal command, Lady Jinda
is to be brought before the King

278
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,490
for interrogation.

279
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,770
Follow me, Lady Jinda.

280
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,010
Is this your drug?

281
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

282
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,090
You brought poison into the palace.

283
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,970
Who were you planning to kill?

284
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,570
Poison?

285
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,410
Kill someone?

286
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,930
This powder

287
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,330
is ground from gok galangal seeds.

288
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,850
It's medicinal,

289
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,850
but if used excessively,

290
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,010
it can cause convulsions,

291
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,130
heart palpitations,

292
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,450
and even death.

293
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,250
Did you give this poison
to Lady Chittrawadee?

294
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,450
Answer me.

295
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,130
With all due respect,

296
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,890
the guards searched the entire inner court

297
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,970
and found no one else with poison,

298
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,290
only Lady Jinda, Your Majesty.

299
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,450
I never thought

300
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,010
you would be so envious

301
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,650
that you would kill

302
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,690
even my child.

303
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,250
Someone as wicked as you

304
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,370
deserves the death penalty,

305
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,290
to die as a consequence of your crime!

306
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,530
Please listen to me, Your Majesty.

307
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,370
I didn't do it.

308
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,770
Lady Chittrawadee's miscarriage

309
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,810
wasn't caused

310
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,730
by the medicine in this box.

311
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,650
Ok Khun Khem said himself

312
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:36,650
that the herbs can cause death,

313
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,610
but Lady Chittrawadee

314
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,890
is still alive, isn't she?

315
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,530
I believe someone else

316
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,770
is behind her miscarriage.

317
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,970
Who?

318
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,250
I don't know yet,

319
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,410
but I'm willing to stake my life on it.

320
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,890
By noon tomorrow,

321
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,050
if I cannot find the culprit

322
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,210
for you to punish,

323
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,530
I will take the medicine in this box

324
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,570
and end my own life.

325
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,810
I will wait.

326
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,010
Lady Jinda.

327
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,930
Tubtim.

328
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,010
How was it?

329
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,930
We have until tomorrow noon

330
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,170
to find the one
who poisoned Lady Chittrawadee.

331
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,930
I'm so angry with Wamon

332
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,050
for lying that it was
a miscarriage-inducing drug

333
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,290
when it's actually deadly poison.

334
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,050
-Good thing I didn't use it.
-Lady Jinda.

335
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,330
Don't think about anything else.

336
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,650
Focus on

337
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,330
how we find the one
who poisoned Lady Chittrawadee,

338
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,410
especially in the dead of night like this.

339
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,050
I think I know

340
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,810
where to start.

341
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,690
The poison was put
in the food this morning.

342
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:11,250
You should go search
the leftover dishes and see what you find.

343
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,330
Someone's coming.

344
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,650
Someone's there.

345
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,130
Lady Tanyong, what is she doing here?

346
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,890
-Lady Jinda.
-Lady Tanyong.

347
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,530
What's in your hand?

348
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,210
What's in my hand will reveal

349
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,490
who poisoned Lady Chittrawadee.

350
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,650
And if I want it,

351
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,130
what must I exchange for it?

352
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,810
The chili paste?

353
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,330
The one you made this morning.

354
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,170
Do you also think I'm the one who did it?

355
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,970
This chili paste

356
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,970
is what's left
from Lady Chittrawadee's meal.

357
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,730
Madame Sae said that
Lady Chittrawadee complimented

358
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,610
that it smelled strangely good.

359
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,850
I grew suspicious,
so I asked for the leftovers.

360
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,570
It's true that this is my chili paste,

361
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,330
but the smell,

362
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,330
there's something odd about it.
Some unfamiliar spice was added.

363
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,490
Right, Tubtim?

364
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,050
Or perhaps

365
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,690
someone mixed in poison.

366
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,570
But after the meal,

367
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,650
the maids usually eat the leftovers.

368
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,450
If there was poison in this,

369
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,250
-why hasn't anyone fallen ill?
-Someone has.

370
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,290
The maid who ate this paste

371
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:45,810
complained of stomach pain,

372
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,690
saying her period came early.

373
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,890
I've figured it out.

374
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,690
If it wasn't poison,

375
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:58,650
but an herb that induces menstruation,

376
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,170
an ordinary person would be fine.

377
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,450
But for someone newly pregnant,

378
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,930
it would cause bleeding

379
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,250
and miscarriage.

380
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,130
The mastermind behind this is both clever

381
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,250
and cruel.

382
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,250
Neither Lady Chittrawadee,

383
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,250
you, nor I

384
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,330
are familiar with this herb.

385
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,650
It must have come

386
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,890
from the north.

387
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,930
Thank you, Lady Noi,

388
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,770
for helping me.

389
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,850
I don't help for free.

390
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,050
One day, you'll repay me.

391
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,370
Lady Chittrawadee has already miscarried.

392
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,210
If we wait for Lady Jinda
to be executed first,

393
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,650
then reveal the truth

394
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,010
that Lady La-ongkham was behind this,

395
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,050
you'll receive merit

396
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,490
and eliminate a rival at the same time.

397
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,930
Thongdee,

398
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:35,370
the positions of the 4 main concubines are
never-ending. Even if we kill each other,

399
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,930
the King will just appoint new ones.

400
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,810
There's no end to it.

401
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,330
Why should I bother?

402
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,250
It's better to sit back
and watch the tigers fight.

403
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,330
Isn't that better?

404
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,930
Lady Jinda said

405
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,650
she'd bring the culprit
before the King tomorrow.

406
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,130
Who do you think she's referring to?

407
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,050
She's probably just trying to buy time.

408
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,970
She might be looking for

409
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,770
a scapegoat as we speak.

410
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,330
It will be morning soon.

411
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,330
I just want the King to punish her quickly

412
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:48,130
so I can finally sleep soundly.

413
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,850
-Be careful, my Lady.
-Walk faster.

414
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,330
-Hurry up.
-What was that sound?

415
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,850
Does it hurt?

416
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,730
Walk carefully, my Lady.

417
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,450
Walk faster.

418
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,330
-Be careful, my Lady.
-Walk faster.

419
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,410
Does it hurt?

420
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:05,330
The guards are taking Lady Jinda.

421
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,490
Lady Jinda,
why has fate been so cruel to you?

422
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:13,730
What fate?

423
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:17,170
Your mistress committed a crime
and must be punished according to the law.

424
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,410
I didn't do it.

425
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,530
I wasn't the one
who poisoned Lady Chittrawadee.

426
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,450
Someone else did.

427
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,530
Don't think of running away.

428
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,130
My people

429
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,850
are already gathering evidence
for the King.

430
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,330
When the time comes,

431
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,490
the true culprit will be punished.

432
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,410
What evidence?

433
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,850
There's no evidence left.

434
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,650
Everything has been discarded.

435
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,610
Whatever you discarded,

436
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,450
my people will find.

437
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,250
Perhaps Tubtim

438
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,570
has already discovered it.

439
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,490
Nonsense. Take her away.

440
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,250
Be careful.

441
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,490
-Be careful, my Lady.
-Walk carefully, my Lady.

442
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:18,290
What has Tubtim found?

443
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,610
Nothing, my Lady.

444
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,250
Wait.

445
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:03,850
Lady Jinda was right.

446
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:07,010
If you heard that someone
was coming to find the evidence,

447
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:11,090
you wouldn't sit idle.
You would come to see for yourself.

448
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:12,890
You followed me, didn't you?

449
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,170
Your mistress won't get away this time.

450
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:17,890
Seize her!

451
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,570
-Seize her!
-No, no!

452
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,890
Hey!

453
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:25,610
Let me go!

454
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,130
Give it back!

455
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:30,490
Let me go!

456
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,570
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

457
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:40,810
the inner court has conducted
a thorough investigation.

458
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,970
It was Thao Si Chulalak

459
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,370
who secretly added Makwaen,

460
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,130
an herb that induces menstruation,

461
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:48,650
into the chili paste served

462
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,410
to Thao Intharasurenthorn.

463
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:53,930
That caused the miscarriage.

464
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:57,530
The culprit is not Thao Srisudachan,

465
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,130
but Thao Si Chulalak.

466
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,170
Let go of me!

467
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:17,770
Let go of me!

468
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:23,730
Thao Si Chulalak

469
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:26,210
has violated Royal Criminal Law

470
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,730
by harming the people of the land,

471
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:31,010
a crime punishable by death.

472
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:34,170
Furthermore, you committed treason

473
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,530
by poisoning a member of the royal family,

474
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,050
also punishable by death.

475
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,330
I ordered your execution.

476
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,690
If you had not defended yourself,

477
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,370
I would have committed a great sin.

478
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,570
I never meant
any harm to anyone, Your Majesty.

479
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,930
If you had no ill intentions,

480
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,370
then why were you carrying poison?

481
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:26,970
Being a woman is difficult.

482
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,450
Our comfort or suffering

483
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,930
depends entirely on men.

484
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,170
But as long as I live,

485
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,570
I refuse to let anyone oppress me.

486
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,850
If I am ever shown no mercy,

487
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:49,410
I will end my own life

488
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,810
rather than let anyone harm me.

489
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,850
I am your King.

490
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,050
As long as I am here,

491
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,530
you have nothing to fear.

492
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,690
No one will harm you.

493
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:11,330
ONE MONTH LATER

494
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,090
It was really chaotic in the palace.

495
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:29,930
Now that we can come outside,
I feel much more at peace.

496
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:35,810
The King saw that I was wrongly accused,

497
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,850
so when I requested to return to Lopburi
to visit my father and make merit,

498
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:43,250
he kindly granted my wish.

499
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:48,450
Now that you are the King's favorite,

500
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:51,010
whatever you ask for, he grants.

501
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,410
I'm so happy for you.

502
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,290
Father.

503
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,610
Please rise, Teacher.

504
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:32,450
Please don't do that.

505
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:36,090
You are no longer Jinda my daughter.

506
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,490
You are Thao Srisudachan,

507
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:42,970
the King's chief concubine.

508
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:48,210
But you will always be my father.

509
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,930
I've heard that

510
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:57,850
now you are in the King's favor,

511
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,050
is that true?

512
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,610
The King is focused on warfare.

513
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:10,290
The military strategies you taught me
since I was a child

514
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,970
have made me his favorite.

515
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,490
Now, he consults me

516
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,930
on all state matters,

517
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:02,370
trusting me more than anyone.

518
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:05,130
All that remains

519
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,930
is for you to bear a son

520
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,850
and become the Queen Consort.

521
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,410
It won't be long, believe me.

522
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:23,970
It won't be long.

523
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:41,730
Stop here.

524
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,650
The Lady wishes to pay her respects
to the Buddha statue here.

525
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:57,930
I will be meditating.

526
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,810
No one is to disturb me
under any circumstances.

527
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:04,490
Yes, Lady Jinda.

528
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,210
What will you be praying for,

529
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,250
Lady Jinda?

530
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:41,730
I have a question for you.

531
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,730
Why didn't you tell me

532
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:49,370
that the powder in the box was poison,
capable of killing someone?

533
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,730
If you knew it was poison,
would you have used it?

534
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,130
And what if I had?

535
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:03,170
Lady Chittrawadee bled. If she had died,

536
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:05,610
wouldn't you be afraid that I'd be caught

537
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:08,530
-and sentenced to death?
-I had already planned for that.

538
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,770
That's why I told Tubtim to do it.

539
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,330
But Tubtim is my nursemaid!

540
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:16,050
That's why she must sacrifice for you.

541
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:25,690
We had only one chance.

542
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,450
This time, the heavens favored you.

543
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:35,290
Lady Chittrawadee miscarried
because of someone else.

544
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,530
But if no one had acted,

545
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:42,450
in a few months,
she would have given birth to the heir

546
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,130
and become Queen Consort in your place.

547
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,250
What would you have done then?

548
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,570
But I don't like it.

549
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,810
I don't like that you didn't tell me

550
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:02,970
and manipulated Tubtim.

551
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,610
I know you too well.

552
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:11,130
You're stubborn but soft-hearted.

553
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,930
You would never be able
to accomplish such a significant task.

554
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:19,850
That's why I had to stay close,
helping you along the way.

555
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:34,250
Now, the other concubines
have fallen under your influence.

556
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:38,370
All that remains is for you

557
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:40,970
to conceive a son,

558
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:46,010
and you'll become Queen Consort.

559
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:50,130
Then, our time will finally come.

560
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,690
Today is an auspicious day.

561
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,450
May the Royal Heir
to the throne of Ayodhaya

562
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,930
be born today.
