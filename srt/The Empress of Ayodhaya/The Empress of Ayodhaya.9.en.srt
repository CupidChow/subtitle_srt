PLEASE SEEK EXPERTS FOR ACCURACY.

3
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
The crown

4
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,680
of the Lavo Ayodhaya dynasty.

5
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,200
I once hoped

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,120
to wear this crown

7
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,640
and ascend the throne.

8
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,120
But my destiny
didn’t turn out as foretold.

9
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,000
Look,

10
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,960
even the heavens
and earth have deceived me.

11
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,760
Your Majesty.

12
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
Your Majesty.

13
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,400
Your Majesty.

14
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,840
Your Majesty.

15
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,640
Your Majesty.

16
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,120
Move aside.

17
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,800
If His Majesty is angry,
I will take responsibility.

18
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,920
Phan Butsrithep.

19
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,600
His Majesty is asleep. Do not make noise.

20
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,240
His Majesty requested your presence alone.

21
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,400
What was it about?

22
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,160
His Majesty ordered me to recite chants.

23
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,399
He found peace, free from suffering,

24
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,520
and fell asleep.

25
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,440
You have done well, Phan Butsrithep.

26
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,600
A small boat awaits at the riverbank.

27
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,600
Take this chest to the ship

28
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,480
and deliver my letter to the captain

29
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,720
and this one to my father.

30
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,880
If you get caught,

31
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
it’s not only you who'll be in trouble,

32
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,320
but Nakhon will be at odds with Ayodhaya.

33
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,240
Is it worth the risk?

34
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,520
Please let me do what I want for once.

35
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,640
I only hope there are no regrets.

36
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,600
Let’s go.

37
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,080
Wait!

38
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,520
What are you carrying and where?

39
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,520
These are my belongings
I am sending back to Nakhon.

40
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,720
Then why sneak around here?

41
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
You look suspicious.

42
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,560
Should we check it?

43
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,640
What business is this of yours?

44
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,800
If there’s suspicion,

45
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,960
it’s my duty to know. Open it.

46
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,280
-Thongdee.
-Yes, my Lady.

47
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,520
No, you can’t.

48
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
What do you think you’re doing? I said no!

49
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,240
Stop, you can’t!

50
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,440
You can't open it!

51
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Stay away!

52
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,280
What’s inside?

53
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,880
I said you can't open it.

54
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,800
The Queen Consort?

55
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,960
How did I get here?

56
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,440
My goodness, look!

57
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,240
A fire comet.

58
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,280
The King.

59
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,320
Today the sky seems strange.

60
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,320
With all due respect, Your Majesty.

61
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,960
His Majesty…

62
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,600
has passed.

63
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,040
You two may leave.

64
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,840
You’re lucky Chuen called me just in time.

66
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,160
You’re lucky the cursed potion
had an antidote.

67
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,040
You were wise once,

68
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,880
how could you be so foolish now?

69
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,120
I chose death
rather than assassinate the King

70
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,560
because I feared a power struggle
if His Majesty is gone.

71
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,840
My child is too young

72
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
and could die if the throne is contested.

73
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,880
I was willing to die.

74
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,840
I was willing to die
to keep my child and Ayodhaya safe.

75
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,080
What use is a dead person?

76
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,760
Look at the King.

77
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,880
Gone, he can protect no one.

78
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,320
Had you died,

79
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,960
Prince Yod Fah would now be an orphan.

80
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,840
I'm sorry, Lady Noi.

81
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Thank you so much.

82
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
From now on,

83
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,120
I will not die.

84
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,480
I will live

85
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,080
to protect those I love.

86
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,960
Then rise.

87
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
The King has passed.

88
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,880
The council is searching for a new heir.

89
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,920
Whether Prince Yod Fah
inherits his father’s throne

90
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,520
depends on you.

91
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,200
With the King’s passing

92
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,880
and no royal decree naming a successor,

93
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,240
I have called you to deliberate together.

94
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,560
Traditionally, the land
must not remain without a King.

95
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
Before dawn tomorrow,

96
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,280
a new King must be named.

97
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,960
If you believe anyone suitable,

98
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,920
speak now without fear.

99
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,520
Khun Phirenthorathep

100
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,680
has shown unwavering loyalty.

101
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,200
The intention to elevate Prince Yod Fah
to the throne is unquestionable.

102
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,440
King Chairachathirat

103
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,400
desired for Prince Yod Fah,

104
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,160
his eldest son,

105
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,240
to inherit the throne of Ayodhaya.

106
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,000
I believe

107
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,040
we should honor his wishes.

108
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
That seems fitting,

109
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,080
but Prince Yod Fah is still very young.

110
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,840
How will he handle the affairs of state?

111
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,680
According to custom,

112
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,200
a regent must be appointed

113
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,240
to manage the kingdom.

114
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,080
Whom do you deem

115
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,120
suitable for this grand task?

116
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,040
Phraya Mahasena,
the Chief of the Military,

117
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,480
descends from the Suphannaphum dynasty.

118
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,120
I fear

119
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,240
he may bring a royal relative

120
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,240
to assume the regency.

121
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Khun Phirenthorathep

122
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,760
is a maternal relative of the King.

123
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,280
He may be a distant relative,

124
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,400
but he may claim the right to be regent.

125
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,880
If it is Khun Phirenthorathep,
I may rest easy.

126
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,680
But if it is another royal relative,

127
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,800
when they assume the regency,

128
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,240
they might seize power.

129
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,360
My child is still young,

130
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,320
and he will be in danger.

131
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,800
Khun Phirenthorathep despises you deeply.

132
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,240
If he rises,

133
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,880
neither you nor your unborn child

134
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,440
will survive.

135
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,400
It’s true.

136
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,400
But…

137
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,040
What choice is left?

138
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,960
Time has already passed considerably.

139
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,080
I believe

140
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,040
we must settle

141
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,040
who shall be the regent.

142
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,240
As consensus seems out of reach,

143
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,160
-I shall offer myself--
-I'll do it.

144
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,000
I, Thao Srisudachan,

145
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,800
Queen Consort of King Chairachathirat

146
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,920
and mother of Prince Yod Fah,

147
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,600
will be regent,

148
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,040
guiding Prince Yod Fah

149
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,920
to rule Ayodhaya

150
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,120
and to alleviate

151
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,280
the kingdom's suffering

152
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,680
after King Chairachathirat,

153
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,120
his father,

154
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,920
from now on.

155
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,040
Hail to His Majesty King Yod Fah,

156
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
King of Ayodhaya!

157
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,280
I never thought

158
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,840
Jinda would dare to act like this.

159
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,760
I know she will do anything
for those she loves.

160
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,640
Then what shall we do next?

161
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,000
Wait for my command.

162
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,680
Prepare to march into Ayodhaya.

163
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,880
Ok Khun, Sir.

164
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,640
Ok Khun, Sir.

165
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,520
There’s nothing Sir. We searched the city
for anyone with a ring-shaped tattoo

166
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,680
but found nothing.

167
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,800
I don't know where they're hiding.

168
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,520
They…

169
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,520
might not be in Ayodhaya.

170
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,720
Saen, send scouts to Lopburi.

171
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,400
If they truly belong to the Queen Consort,

172
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,560
they may be from there.

173
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,920
If they are found, what do we do?

174
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,200
Capture them alive. I need a confession

175
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,000
on who ordered this. If I can prove

176
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,040
the Queen orchestrated the assassination
of King Chairachathirat,

177
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,920
I will personally see to her punishment.

178
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,360
The royal astrologer
has determined an auspicious date.

179
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,040
The auspicious date is in seven days.

180
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,760
A ceremony shall be held to crown
King Yod Fah as King of Ayodhaya.

181
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,160
I’ve heard that the court officials
are all against me.

182
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,520
It’s because of
Phraya Mahasena inciting them.

183
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,880
Go tell King Yod Fah,

184
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,640
after his coronation,

185
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,080
to immediately appoint you as Regent

186
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,400
without delay

187
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,920
and to make Phan Butsrithep

188
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,560
your consort.

189
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,040
What?

190
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,400
The late King’s body
has not yet been laid to rest,

191
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,160
and you want me too--

192
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,120
You are four months pregnant, Jinda.

193
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,440
While it may not show now,

194
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,720
soon

195
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,240
it will be noticeable.

196
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,240
If you don’t seek the King’s permission
to appoint a consort,

197
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,000
your child

198
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,960
will be born an illegitimate child

199
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,160
without a father.

200
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,160
Aren’t you afraid of the ridicule?

201
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,160
He hopes to manipulate you into obedience.

202
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,040
But you must show him

203
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,760
that you are no ordinary woman
to be controlled.

204
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,440
You are the Regent,

205
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,640
wielding power equal to the King.

206
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,240
And what of the child in my womb?

207
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,720
If born without a father,

208
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,360
my child will be shamed.

209
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,720
Having a husband
won’t stop people’s tongues.

210
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,720
Having the power to silence them

211
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,800
does make them stop.

212
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,240
Your Majesty.

213
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,920
In the name of the King of Ayodhaya,

214
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,040
I appoint

215
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,720
Thao Srisudachan, my mother,

216
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,400
as Queen Srisudachan,

217
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,320
the Regent,

218
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,880
to uphold

219
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,680
and govern Ayodhaya.

220
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,720
I also take this auspicious moment

221
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,880
to appoint Phan Butsrithep,

222
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
caretaker of the outer shrine,

223
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,400
and my teacher,

224
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,400
to the rank of Khun Chinnarat,

225
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,800
in charge of the inner shrine

226
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,960
and advisor to me

227
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,440
in royal affairs.

228
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,320
My teacher,

229
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,320
I am still young
and have never slept alone.

230
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,160
Why can’t I sleep with my mother?

231
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,400
With all due respect.

232
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,320
Although still young,

233
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,520
Your Majesty is now the King of Ayodhaya

234
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,440
and should reside in your father’s chamber

235
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,680
to command the respect of all the nobles.

236
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,440
You shall go.

237
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,920
Who are these two people?
I’ve never seen them before.

238
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,800
Ming and Muang,
your new attendants, Your Majesty.

239
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,880
Please sleep, Your Majesty. `

240
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,520
Ming and Muang will keep watch,
so there is nothing to fear.

241
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,160
Please sleep, Your Majesty.

242
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,200
-Keep an eye on him.
-Yes, Sir.

243
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,120
Chuen,

244
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,080
I feel

245
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,320
uncomfortable.

246
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,680
It's hot and humid today.

247
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,280
I feel strange

248
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,600
and feverish.

249
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,360
Please rest, Your Majesty.

250
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,680
What’s happening? Chuen?

251
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,520
Chuen.

252
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,200
The sound of the elephants, Your Majesty.

253
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,440
My stomach hurts, Chuen.

254
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,720
-Your Majesty.
-My stomach hurts.

255
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,080
-Your stomach hurts?
-Yes.

256
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,800
Ugh!

257
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,080
Does it hurt badly?

258
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,280
I’ll go fetch the Royal Doctor.

259
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,800
The noise is coming from
the elephant stable.

260
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,920
A cry from the elephants
at night like this…

261
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,560
Something must be happening.

262
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,560
They say the Lord of the White Elephant
is warning us.

263
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,280
I don't know if the kingdom is in danger.

264
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,520
Yesterday, Queen Mother
gave birth to a daughter.

265
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,960
My goodness.

266
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,080
They say the child

267
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,200
isn’t the late King’s,

268
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,360
but an illegitimate child.
That may be true.

269
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,160
Such rumors must be true.

270
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,200
That’s why there have been
such strange occurrences.

271
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,200
Your Majesty's fever is so high.

272
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,520
I’ve already reduced the firewood.
Please hold on, Your Majesty.

273
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,360
I’m thirsty.

274
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,160
Is anyone outside?

275
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
I’m here, Your Majesty.

276
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,680
Water, bring me water.

277
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,080
Do you remember Pan, granddaughter of Fak?

278
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
When she heard about the birth,

279
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,560
she asked me to bring her here.

280
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,360
She would like to see
the baby’s greatness.

281
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,040
My child.

282
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,160
Don’t say such things.

283
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,480
Even if I may be unworthy
to be your husband,

284
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,440
I am still the father
of this little Tharika.

285
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,680
Don’t you want her to know her father?

286
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,280
If our daughter grows

287
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,760
and asks who her father is,
what will you say?

288
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,440
She is the daughter of me

289
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,280
and King Chairachathirat.

290
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,840
If anyone dares to say otherwise,

291
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,680
I will tear out their tongue,

292
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,440
no matter who they are.

293
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,000
Then,

294
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,159
I wish Your Majesty

295
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,000
and your daughter great happiness.

296
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,600
I take my leave now.

297
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,239
No!

298
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,199
You can’t do this to me!

299
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,280
No!

300
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,239
-Enough, Chan.
-Let go of me!

301
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,719
No!

302
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,560
Go!

303
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,440
Khun Chinnarat,
did they capture you as well?

304
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,880
It’s good that you’re here.

305
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,480
Follow my orders.

306
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,880
Give this medicine to the Queen Mother.

307
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,520
One pill a day.
When seven days have passed,

308
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,040
I will release your child.

309
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,080
-Come here.
-My son!

310
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,000
Come here!

311
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,560
Silence! I said be silent!

312
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,560
Silence!

313
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,640
Do as this man orders,

314
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,880
and your child will be safe.

315
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,280
-But if she consumes this, then--
-This medicine is good.

316
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,960
There’s nothing wrong with taking it.

317
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,440
After seven days,

318
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,880
she might even request more of it.

319
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,160
Do as you’re told,

320
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,600
and your child will be safe.

321
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,560
-My son…
-Take him away.

322
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,680
-Father, help me!
-My son!

323
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,600
Father!

324
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,160
Father!

325
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,880
ONE MONTH LATER

326
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,240
Chuen,

327
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,400
tell the steward

328
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480
that I’m almost out of medicine.

329
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,640
Your Majesty.

330
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,320
Lady Noi.

331
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,880
What medicine are you referring to?

332
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh.

333
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,320
Honey herbal pills.

334
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,960
Ever since giving birth,
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

335
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,280
I have no energy. Some days there is pain.

336
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,600
I don't know where it's from.

337
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,600
But luckily,

338
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,720
I have this medicine.

339
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,840
It makes me feel much better.

340
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,320
But tell me,

341
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,720
are you here just to visit,
or do you have some other matter?

342
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,800
I see that you
stay in the palace all the time,

343
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,840
so I wanted to invite you out
for a boat ride

344
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,040
and to make merit, to ease your mind.

345
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,160
I don’t feel like going anywhere.

346
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,000
You go ahead.

347
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,480
I’ll rejoice in your merit from here.

348
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,640
Ugh!

349
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,880
It’s true, as Chuen said.

350
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,440
The Queen Mother seems very weak.

351
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,680
The Palace Physician says

352
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,120
it’s a deficiency in the fire element.

353
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,240
They give Her Majesty medicine.

354
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,360
But after a month of treatment,

355
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,680
there’s no sign of improvement.

356
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,880
Thongdee,

357
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,840
go and ask Chuen
to steal the medicine for me.

358
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,840
Yes, my Lady.

359
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,280
Take it.

360
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,280
If she finishes it all, it should work.

361
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,120
You can continue our plan.

362
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,240
Chan, take your people to Phitsanulok

363
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,800
and wait for my orders.

364
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,640
Yes, Brother. Let’s go!

365
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,240
With all due respect, Your Majesty.

366
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,760
At this time in Phitsanulok,

367
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,960
forest bandits are causing chaos.

368
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,800
The commander of Phitsanulok
was sent to subdue them

369
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,240
but was killed by a crossbow.

370
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,760
Khun Phirenthorathep,

371
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,120
since you hold the title
of the ruler of Phitsanulok,

372
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,560
what do you say? Who did this?

373
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,120
This matter requires
a thorough investigation.

374
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,680
It is too early to presume
who is responsible.

375
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,400
With all due respect, Your Majesty.

376
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,880
Khun Phirenthorathep speaks rightly.

377
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,840
Phitsanulok is a major city

378
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,600
of great importance.

379
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,800
And since you hold the position
of the ruler of Phitsanulok,

380
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,400
during this turmoil,

381
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,400
it is only fitting that you should
return to manage Phitsanulok.

382
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,280
This matter is not yours to address.

383
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,040
What do you think, Queen Mother?

384
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,000
Queen Mother?

385
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,720
DISPENSARY

386
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,480
What was he doing?

387
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,240
Ah-Long.

388
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,440
I already know what the medicine is.

389
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,320
The master already knows
what the medicine is.

390
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,080
It’s opium.

391
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,560
It’s opium.

392
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,120
My medicine.

393
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,280
Cheun.

394
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,360
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-My medicine.

395
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,400
Why is my medicine finished?

396
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,640
Go get more, go!

397
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,600
Why can’t I enter the chamber?
Who are you? I don’t recognize your faces.

398
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,280
Do you know who this is?
This is Thao Inthratevee,

399
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,400
a beloved friend of the Queen Mother.

400
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,120
How dare you stop us?

401
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,200
If it wasn’t by royal command,
we wouldn’t dare.

402
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,120
Huh?

403
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,480
So you’re even claiming
a royal command now?

404
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,360
Step aside.

405
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,320
Wait, please, Thao Inthratevee.

406
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,200
The royal attendants are not lying.

407
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,880
Her Majesty is severely ill

408
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,720
and has commanded that no one disturbs her

409
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,680
under any circumstances.

410
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,840
NO ONE SHALL DISTURB ME
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

411
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,200
How could that be? I don’t believe it.

412
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,800
Your Majesty.

413
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,680
It's me. Can you hear me?

414
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,240
-Your Majesty.
-Whose voice is that?

415
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,840
It’s me. Can you hear me?

416
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,320
Thao Inthratevee, Your Majesty.

417
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,760
Your Majesty.

418
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,680
Your Majesty, it's me.

419
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,440
Can you hear me?

420
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,960
Thao Inthratevee,

421
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,280
this is the Royal Residence.
You can’t shout

422
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,720
like you’re in the market.

423
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,240
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

424
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,400
Move aside.

425
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,040
Your Majesty!

426
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,880
Let go of me! Who do you think you are?

427
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,720
Your Majesty!

428
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,840
Your Majesty! Let go of me!

429
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,280
You are ill.

430
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,280
If you goes outside,
your fever will only worsen.

431
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,200
I can't get up. Let Lady Noi in.

432
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,800
Please rest first, Your Majesty.

433
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,880
When you wake, your strength will return.

434
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,920
I have royal duties.

435
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,160
His Majesty ordered you
to rest until your condition improves.

436
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,760
About the duties,

437
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,480
there is nothing urgent, Your Majesty.

438
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,600
I'm worried…

439
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,040
Ok Khun, the Chamberlain is here

440
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,360
with a royal command.

441
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,600
Khun Phirenthorathep
receives the royal command.

442
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,000
There is a royal command

443
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,560
from His Majesty

444
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,880
to Khun Phirenthorathep,
Ruler of Phitsanulok,

445
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,000
to travel to Phitsanulok

446
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,240
and maintain order.

447
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,960
You are to leave tomorrow

448
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,400
in the morning.

449
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,040
YOU ARE TO LEAVE TOMORROW IN THE MORNING

450
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,040
I brought this royal command myself,

451
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,600
hoping to speak with you.

452
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,080
Such an urgent command

453
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,200
is unusual.

454
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,720
They are using the regent’s power

455
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,360
to push me out of Ayodhaya.

456
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,280
They? Who do you mean?

457
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,920
The Queen Mother and Khun Chinnarat.

458
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,400
I think I’m not mistaken.

459
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,240
The wicked woman and the treacherous man
are conspiring together.

460
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
If Her Majesty is presiding
over the royal court in this state,

461
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,200
it’s not a good thing.

462
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,520
I’m worried about my mother,

463
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,840
but what can I do?

464
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,160
Affairs of war and government

465
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,160
are beyond me.

466
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,160
I believe that

467
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,400
Her Majesty

468
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,640
should refrain from royal duties
until she recovers.

469
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,640
If there is anything,

470
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,080
I will report to her

471
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,200
and then issue proclamations

472
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,560
under her seal and signature.

473
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,360
Would this not be better?

474
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,960
His Majesty arrives.

475
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,080
What state matters are there today?

476
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,720
Your Majesty,

477
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,040
I am here on behalf
of the Queen Mother Srisudachan

478
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,480
to inform everyone
of an important announcement.

479
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,600
In the name of Queen Mother Srisudachan,

480
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,440
the Regent,

481
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,160
I appoint Khun Chinnarat,

482
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,480
caretaker of the inner shrine

483
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,560
and teacher of King Yod Fah,

484
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,240
to the position of Khun Worawongsa.

485
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,360
To review the assigned ranks
and affiliations

486
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,320
and establish an administrative residence

487
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,360
at Pratu Din by the Mahn Tree.

488
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,400
Since King Yod Fah is still young,

489
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,960
governing

490
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,600
is beyond his ability.

491
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,800
Therefore,

492
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,880
Brahmin Wasuthep
will be appointed as Royal Advisor.

493
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,800
Your Majesty,

494
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,920
I present Brahmin Wasuthep.

495
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,840
I, Wasuthep,

496
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,840
humbly greet Your Majesty.

497
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,640
I was at the temple, yet news
of turmoil has reached even there.

498
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,560
What now, Sae?

499
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,480
Ever since Queen Mother
took power as the Regent,

500
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,120
she has issued endless decrees,

501
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,560
replacing officials
both within and outside the palace.

502
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,160
Anyone who criticizes her

503
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,520
is expelled from the court.

504
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,840
Some are even found dead

505
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,760
or have disappeared.

506
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,600
Since the passing of my beloved King,

507
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,680
I never wished to involve myself
in these matters again.

508
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,960
But now that the court
has become so corrupt,

509
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,120
I cannot remain silent.

510
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,840
I must see the Queen Mother

511
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,080
even if it defies her orders.

512
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,960
I will ask

513
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,440
why she acts this way.

514
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,840
Yes, my Lady.

515
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,040
Thao Inthrasurenthorn, Madame Sae,

516
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,040
I have an urgent matter.

517
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,640
Urgent matter again? What is it?

518
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,880
The Queen is being drugged

519
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,320
and has lost her senses.

520
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,360
The proclamations issued
are forged in her name.

521
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,600
How do you know this?

522
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,400
I stole her medicine
and took it to the Chinese doctor.

523
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,960
It’s opium.

524
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,560
They have locked the Queen Mother
in her chambers,

525
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,160
so no one knows of her severe illness.

526
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,200
We must help her.

527
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,760
I can’t do this alone.

528
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,200
Please, I ask for your help.

529
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,760
-Lady Noi.
-Be careful, Your Majesty.

530
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,400
I’m here now, Your Majesty.

531
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,480
Let's take her out.

532
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,200
Please take care of things here.

533
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,040
I have to give her opium antidote

534
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,520
and acupuncture.

535
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,520
The opium addiction should be cured

536
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,680
in just seven days.

537
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,600
The doctor says she must take an
opium antidote along with acupuncture.

538
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,480
She will recover in seven days.

539
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,280
You conspired with traitors
to harm the Queen Mother.

540
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,760
That’s punishable by death
for seven generations.

541
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,880
It’s fortunate that I’ve been
observing the percepts for months

542
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,720
and I don't want to commit sins.

543
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,080
I’ll give you a chance
to redeem yourselves.

544
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,640
From now on,

545
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,600
do not tell anyone
the Queen Mother is absent

546
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,920
until she returns.

547
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,040
Understand?

548
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,560
-Yes, my Lady.
-Yes, my Lady.

549
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,760
Go!

550
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,560
If Khun Worawongsa comes to visit,
what will we do?

551
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,920
He visits every seven days.

552
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,400
He just came yesterday,

553
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,720
so we have six days left.

554
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,440
DISPENSARY

555
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,720
Lady Noi.

556
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,320
Your Majesty. Take it slowly.

557
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,160
You can smile now.

558
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,600
The other day, I vomited everything.

559
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,040
I thought I would die.

560
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,040
Who knows

561
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,000
how much poison Khun Chinnarat
has been feeding me.

562
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,400
Khun Worawongsa.

563
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,880
You raised him to be Khun Worawongsa.

564
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,120
I did?

565
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,160
You didn’t know?

566
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,360
Know that while you were
under the influence of opium,

567
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,760
someone impersonated you
to commit many misdeeds.

568
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,200
In three more days, you’ll recover.

569
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,600
Think about

570
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,240
how you will handle
the venomous snake close to you.

571
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,960
Where are you going, Your Majesty?

572
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,880
I’m going to see my mother.

573
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,360
You can’t, Your Majesty.

574
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,400
The Queen Mother

575
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,240
ordered that no one may visit her.

576
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,080
I don’t believe my mother
wouldn’t want to see me.

577
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,480
Even if you are the King,

578
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,960
you must not act solely on your whims

579
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,960
and not follow the rules.

580
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,120
Others might find it improper.

581
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,320
I am not being willful. My mother is ill,

582
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,440
and as her son,
it’s my duty to care for her.

583
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,280
The rules do not outweigh love and duty.

584
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:06,200
Royal advisor, Teacher, please step aside.

585
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,760
By command of King Yod Fah

586
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,360
of Ayodhaya,

587
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,120
I will see my mother,

588
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,960
Queen Mother Thao Srisudachan.

589
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,760
Any who block me
shall be considered traitors,

590
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,400
punished unto seven generations.

591
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,280
-Who killed my child?
-No, please.

592
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,200
No, please.

593
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,960
-No, please.
-Who killed my child?

594
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,520
I’ll kill them!

595
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,040
I'll kill them!

596
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,080
No, please, hold on.

597
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,320
No, please, hold on.

598
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,040
Don’t let anger overpower reason. Hold on.

599
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,400
Think of when we played chess.

600
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,600
Now, we have lost pieces.

601
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:54,680
If we make a reckless move,
we might lose the King too.

602
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,440
Why? My child…

603
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,880
I understand.

604
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,000
I understand your grief.`

605
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,880
My child.

606
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,080
But if we rush back now,

607
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,720
we'll only die.

608
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,800
I won’t let myself die.

609
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,640
In this chess game,

610
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,720
I will win.

611
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,280
If you go back, what will you do?

612
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,520
He deceived me.

613
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,320
I can deceive him too.

614
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,000
Hey, leave!

615
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,440
I said leave!

616
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,160
Go!

617
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,680
Travel both day and night
without stopping.

618
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,280
Tell Khem to return
to Ayodhaya immediately.

619
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,280
Yes, my Lady.

620
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,000
Guardian spirits,

621
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,000
please protect Ayodhaya

622
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,880
from these wicked people.

623
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,800
Flee, please.

624
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,280
The city is overrun by demons.

625
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,480
If they find out
you helped the Queen Mother escape,

626
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,680
they will surely seek revenge.

627
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,960
I will flee to Suphan
to be with my children.

628
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,800
Then become a nun to end all this.

629
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,120
How about you, Sae?

630
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,560
Will you not come with me?

631
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,000
I will stay and wait for someone good
to restore this kingdom.

632
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,200
Queen Mother Srisudachan,

633
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,640
the Regent,

634
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,160
has been ill for many years.

635
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,280
Although her health has somewhat improved,

636
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:58,120
her body has not fully recovered.

637
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:03,440
Therefore, she cannot fulfill her duties.

638
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,600
To ensure

639
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,240
a peaceful future,

640
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,200
she has decreed

641
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,720
the enthronement of Khun Worawongsa

642
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,920
as the King of Ayodhaya

643
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,040
to bring peace and stability

644
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,279
to the kingdom.

645
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,359
I,

646
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,399
Khun Worawongsathirat,

647
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,800
King of Ayodhaya,

648
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,240
appoint Queen Mother Srisudachan

649
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,439
as the Queen Consort.

650
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,279
It is a royal grace, Your Majesty.

651
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,920
Those two vile traitors.

652
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,280
I’ll behead them.

653
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,480
It seems we can wait no longer, Lady Noi.

654
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,720
The task I once asked you to carry out,

655
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,360
please proceed.

656
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,280
All that’s left now is to wait.

657
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,640
