00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,110
the series "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,310
was inspired by the history
of Thao Sri Sudachan.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,550
the events, characters, behaviors,

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,870
and details in this story are interpreted,

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,750
expanded upon, or newly created
for entertainment purposes

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,750
and are not entirely
based on true historical events.

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,230
The creators are aware that some events
or actions may spark criticism,

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,790
but we affirm that the production

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,510
of "The Empress of Ayodhaya"

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,950
was made with good intentions.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,310
beyond entertainment,
the aim is to encourage viewers

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,990
to take an interest in history.

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,830
After watching, if viewers are interested,

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,550
they can seek additional knowledge
from experts or historians

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,590
to gain an accurate understanding
of Ayutthaya history.

17
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,390
Ayodhaya

18
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,990
was founded by two royal dynasties,

19
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,670
Suphannaphum and Lavo.

20
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,350
The two dynasties joined forces
to establish Ayodhaya.

21
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,270
The first King of Ayodhaya

22
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,270
came from the Lavo-Ayodhaya dynasty.

23
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,310
However,

24
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,990
the throne was eventually seized
by the Suphannaphum dynasty.

25
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,070
The power struggle for Ayodhaya’s throne

26
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,030
between these two dynasties continued

27
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,590
until the final defeat
of the Lavo dynasty.

28
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,510
After that, for over 100 years,

29
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,230
the Lavo dynasty
never regained the throne of Ayodhaya.

30
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,070
We, the people of Lavo, have had
to endure and wait for the right moment.

31
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,270
That moment came last year

32
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,990
when King Borommaracha No Phutthangkun

33
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,550
passed away.

34
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,190
King Ratsadathirat ascended to the throne

35
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,070
at the young age of five.

36
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,390
But only the strong

37
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,870
can rule Ayodhaya.

38
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,870
King Chairachathirat
of the Suphannaphum dynasty,

39
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,750
who was at that time

40
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,870
the Viceroy ruling Phitsanulok,

41
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,750
marshaled his forces to seize the throne

42
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,590
from King Ratsadathirat

43
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,830
He ordered the execution of the young king
using a sandalwood club

44
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,630
and then crowned himself

45
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,790
as King Chairachathirat of Ayodhaya.

46
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,390
Today,

47
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,270
I see a path

48
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,510
to reclaim everything
for the Lavo dynasty.

49
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,790
Now is the time my child.

50
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,430
You must offer yourself

51
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,590
as a concubine to King Chairachathirat.

52
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,670
Afterward,

53
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,470
find a way to reclaim the throne for us.

54
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,110
JINDA

55
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,790
TUBTIM

56
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,030
WASUTHEP

57
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:13,390
WAMON

58
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,510
-Wamon.
-Father already told me.

59
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,870
What should we do?

60
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,470
I never knew that

61
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,430
to seize the throne,

62
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,430
I would have to do it this way.

63
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,150
If…

64
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,950
I know.

65
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,510
Sooner or later, you would have to be
a concubine to King Chairachathirat.

66
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,710
Father always warned me

67
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,030
that I must keep you pure,

68
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,550
like a lotus offered in worship.

69
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,590
But if I must belong to someone,

70
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,270
I want to belong to you.

71
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,310
We both have duties.

72
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,870
We cannot

73
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,270
do as we please.

74
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,630
-But I love you.
-And I love you too,

75
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,750
and I always will.

76
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,310
Once King Chairachathirat is killed

77
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,230
and I ascend to the throne of Ayodhaya,

78
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,230
we will be together.

79
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,270
But by then,

80
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,270
I will be another man’s wife,

81
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,630
a tainted woman.

82
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,510
The black mark
on Lord Shiva’s neck is not a stain.

83
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,430
You are making a sacrifice.

84
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,270
How could that be a stain?

85
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,830
I, Jinda,

86
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,590
swear that from this moment on,

87
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,350
I will remain true to Wamon, and only him,

88
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,870
forever.

89
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,070
If I break this vow,

90
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,310
may the heavens and earth punish me.

91
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,110
Raise both arms,

92
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,990
stretch them over your head,

93
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,710
and press your palms together.

94
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,070
When performing Saptavajrasana,

95
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,950
your body must be still

96
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,630
and firm,

97
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,710
your pelvis open,

98
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,870
your tendons relaxed,

99
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,870
and your breath subtle

100
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,150
and calm.

101
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,430
Why must it be this hard?

102
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,430
Because feet are considered low.

103
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,230
When the ruler comes close with affection,

104
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,110
a woman’s feet
must not touch the royal body.

105
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,950
But he is not my ruler.

106
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,630
The law decrees

107
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,350
that they will select
women from four royal dynasties,

108
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,830
Suphannaphum,

109
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,510
Sukhothai,

110
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,310
Lopburi, and Nakhon Si Thammarat,

111
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,950
as the four principal concubines,
representing the four directions,

112
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,870
to enhance the King’s power.

113
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,430
In reality, they are sent as hostages

114
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,710
to ensure

115
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,350
that these four major cities

116
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,630
remain loyal to Ayodhaya.

117
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,950
You know that

118
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,710
offering yourself is a matter of politics,

119
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,430
and it cannot be avoided.

120
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,350
But what if I kill him?

121
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,150
Killing someone
is not as easy as you think.

122
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,750
How cruel King Chairachathirat is.

123
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,190
Have you forgotten?

124
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,710
Is this Ayodhaya?

125
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,710
Lady Jinda,

126
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,070
please close the curtains.

127
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,030
The law forbids anyone from seeing you.

128
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,430
Are you Lady Jinda?

129
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,430
Yes.

130
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,870
My name is Sae.

131
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,790
MADAME SAE

132
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,350
I am the Madame,

133
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,110
responsible for overseeing
the palace gates and the inner court.

134
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,270
I bow to you.

135
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,990
This is Tubtim, my nursemaid.

136
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,870
These are Chuen and Chom, my servants.

137
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,910
There is an order for you to rest here.

138
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,710
You’ve just arrived,

139
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,630
so take some time to rest.

140
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,750
Soon, someone will come to get you.

141
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,870
Where are we going?

142
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,270
Madame.

143
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,390
To the court.

144
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,950
To meet Lady Chittrawadee.

145
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,750
Ah.

146
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,110
What would you like to eat Mother?

147
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,230
May I please have it?

148
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,070
Could you please put it on a plate?

149
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,350
Hello.

150
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,030
LADY CHITTRAWADEE
SUPHANNAPHUM DYNASTY, SUPHANBURI

151
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,710
They have arrived, haven’t they?

152
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,030
Yes my Lady.

153
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,510
So, I will have rivals now, won’t I?

154
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,550
LA-ONGKHAM

155
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,990
PHRA RUANG DYNASTY, SUKHOTHAI

156
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,870
Lady La-ongkham, you are so beautiful.

157
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,430
If you rise to the position

158
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,990
of Queen consort,

159
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,190
it will

160
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,310
truly be a blessing for you.

161
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,550
My father hopes so too.

162
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,310
If I become the Queen consort,

163
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,750
the bond between
the Sukhothai and Ayodhaya dynasties

164
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,390
will be solidified and strengthened.

165
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,710
My name is Tanyong,

166
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,590
from Nakhon.

167
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,310
What is your name?

168
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,590
My name is Jinda,

169
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,910
from Lopburi.

170
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,390
You are beautiful, and so is your name.

171
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,310
We are both far from home.

172
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,670
I don’t know anyone here either.

173
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,830
Could I consider you my sister,

174
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,790
Lady Jinda?

175
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,470
It would ease my heart.

176
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,310
Step aside please.

177
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,230
Lady Tanyong,

178
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,030
Lady La-ongkham,

179
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,790
Lady Jinda,

180
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,910
I am pleased

181
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,990
that you have come to serve the King.

182
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,590
As I arrived here first

183
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,070
and am older,

184
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,870
if you encounter any troubles
while staying here,

185
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,950
please come to me.

186
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,230
Think of me

187
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,350
as an elder sister.

188
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,310
Mother.

189
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,950
Mother.

190
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,030
From what I can see,

191
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,630
If Lady Jinda gets close to the King,

192
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,310
she will surely bear a son.

193
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,390
Among the four main concubines,

194
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,550
whoever gives birth to the first royal son

195
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,830
will be elevated
to the position of Queen consort.

196
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,310
So, do not be complacent.

197
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,150
I am not complacent.

198
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,430
Take this to Phra Lokthip

199
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,150
as proof that it comes from my command.

200
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,950
Do whatever it takes

201
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,430
to stop anyone else
from offering themselves,

202
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,230
especially Lady Jinda.

203
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,270
Yes my Lady.

204
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,110
Your Majesty.

205
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,270
Take him out.

206
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,110
Yes my Lord.

207
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,110
Order the troops to break camp.

208
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,350
At dawn,

209
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,070
I will return to Ayodhaya.

210
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

211
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,110
The King has returned to the palace.

212
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,510
Prepare yourself.

213
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,630
What more preparation is needed?

214
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,350
There’s no sign I'll get to offer myself.

215
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,710
I’m so frustrated.

216
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,070
I’ve been waiting for five days and
haven’t even caught a glimpse of the King.

217
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,710
What is going on?

218
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,990
The King has returned, it’s true,

219
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,110
but there has been
no order for an audience.

220
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,390
When will he call for an audience?

221
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,390
It depends on fate.

222
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,230
Phra Lokthip, the chief astrologer,

223
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,670
will check the stars

224
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,870
of the new concubines.

225
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,790
If the timing is not auspicious,

226
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,830
an audience cannot be granted.

227
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,390
I’ve been in Ayodhaya for a month now

228
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,630
and still haven’t had an audience.

229
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,910
Phra Lokthip,

230
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,510
the chief astrologer, claims that

231
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,270
there has been no auspicious time
for an audience.

232
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,390
But I don’t believe that.

233
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,030
If I do not have an audience
and offer myself,

234
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,670
our plan cannot succeed.

235
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,110
If you have any way to help me,

236
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,790
please let me know.

237
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,870
Brahmin,

238
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,550
where do you come from?

239
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,030
You are so handsome.

240
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,430
I’ve never seen you before.

241
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,470
I come from Lopburi.

242
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,350
I’ve heard that

243
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,830
Ayodhaya is grand,

244
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,750
so I came to see it for myself.

245
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,270
Yes.

246
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,190
Look.

247
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,110
So handsome.

248
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,270
Hey! Speed it up you all!

249
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,230
How’s it going up there?

250
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,590
Hey, put more effort into it!

251
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,910
Move faster!

252
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,870
What is this prang called Sir?

253
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,270
This prang doesn’t have
a name yet, Brahmin.

254
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,150
We must wait for the celebration ceremony

255
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,070
before the King comes to give it a name.

256
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,990
The King will come himself?

257
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,110
Yes, the King will come.

258
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,110
This prang is said
to be of great importance.

259
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,350
I’ve had craftsmen working day and night.

260
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,790
It should be ready in less than a month.

261
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,630
Hey!

262
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,150
I told you to hurry up!

263
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,990
The villagers are saying

264
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,830
that the collapse of the prang

265
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,830
was a sign from the guardian spirits,
showing a bad omen

266
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,750
PHRA LOKTHIP, CHIEF ASTROLOGER

267
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,630
as a warning, Your Majesty.

268
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,510
Huh.

269
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,350
Is the war going to happen?

270
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,870
I have considered the matter.

271
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,670
The calamity stemmed from the prang,

272
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,110
which symbolizes Your Majesty.

273
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,590
The disaster is likely to befall

274
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,150
Your Majesty

275
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,750
rather than the kingdom, Your Majesty.

276
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,870
Who dares?

277
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,550
Who dares to harm me?

278
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,350
I have examined it again.

279
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,470
The cause of all this

280
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,830
is the arrival of new concubines.

281
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,110
It is possible that one of them

282
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,390
brings ill fortune

283
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,790
and may cause harm to you,

284
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,950
Your Majesty.

285
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,110
So, what do you want me to do?

286
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,590
What should I do?

287
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,430
Should I send them back?

288
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,910
With all due respect,

289
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,110
doing so

290
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,070
would insult the three major cities,

291
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,990
which could lead to their discontent.

292
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,430
In the future,

293
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,270
it may cause rebellion, Your Majesty.

294
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,230
So what do you want me to do Khem?

295
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,270
With all due respect,

296
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,030
I would like

297
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,190
to suggest that Your Majesty

298
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,350
postpone the appointment
of the four main concubines

299
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,510
until I have examined the fates
of the three new concubines

300
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,950
more thoroughly, Your Majesty.

301
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,190
So?

302
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,430
What do all of you think of this?

303
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,510
Let’s go with that plan.

304
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,550
Take this to Phra Lokthip

305
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,830
and tell him I am grateful for his help.

306
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,550
In the meantime,

307
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,950
you should seize the opportunity

308
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,110
to serve the King

309
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,870
and bear a son as the heir to the throne
before the others do.

310
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,990
I know.

311
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,670
I have already sent a message.

312
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,350
I have invited the King to come here

313
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,910
tonight.

314
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,950
What do you say, Kawao?

315
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,950
I didn’t make it in time.

316
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,910
The King had already left
to oversee the repairs of the prang.

317
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,790
Wamon.

318
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,030
Jinda.

319
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,630
I thought you wouldn’t make it out.

320
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,150
The King went to oversee the repair
of the prang, just as expected.

321
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,750
Let’s hurry, or we’ll be too late.

322
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,190
Wait.

323
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,950
Jinda.

324
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,750
You know coming out like this
is punishable by death,

325
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,230
-don’t you?
-I know,

326
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,550
but since we have no other way,

327
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,670
let’s risk it and face whatever comes.

328
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,350
In front of King Chairachathirat,

329
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,190
the only way you’ll survive

330
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,390
is by using your wits.

331
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,670
Is the sky not willing to
let me atone for my sins?

332
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,430
Or is my life

333
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,550
destined to end like this prang?

334
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,150
Go and see

335
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,310
what that noise is.

336
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,710
Surround the area.

337
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,590
Who are you?

338
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,870
What are you doing here?

339
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,990
Don’t you know

340
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,350
the King is present?

341
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,670
I heard the prang collapsed,

342
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,430
so I came to find out why.

343
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,990
What did you discover?

344
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,430
With all due respect,

345
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,950
this is the rainy season,

346
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,110
and the top of the prang is high,

347
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,550
so it naturally attracts lightning.

348
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,150
However, for the prang to collapse
after just one strike

349
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,550
suggests that the foundation
was built with poor-quality bricks.

350
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,870
Do you have any proof
to support what you’re saying?

351
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,230
This brick, Your Majesty.

352
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,390
I took it from the base of the prang.

353
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,910
If you break it, you will see
that its color is inconsistent.

354
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,590
It wasn’t fired properly,

355
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,790
and the clay wasn’t fully cured,

356
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,310
making it fragile.

357
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,310
When the lightning struck,

358
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,470
it cracked the foundation,

359
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,350
causing the prang to collapse.

360
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,230
This is the reason,

361
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,830
not a supernatural omen
or curse, Your Majesty.

362
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,230
You speak sharply.

363
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,550
I like that.

364
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,270
But you’re not a brick mason.

365
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,110
How do you know about these things?

366
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,230
Who are you?

367
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,830
I am Jinda,

368
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,750
daughter of Ok Phra Lopburi,

369
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,550
sent to serve as one of
your main concubines, Your Majesty.

370
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,230
Turn around.

371
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,390
You’re a woman.

372
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,910
How did you run all the way out here?

373
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,430
I had an urgent matter, Your Majesty.

374
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,390
What matter?

375
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,030
Wait! Stop.

376
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,910
The King is present.

377
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,070
Lord Chamberlain,

378
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,070
what is the matter?

379
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,830
With all due respect,

380
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,950
Lady Chittrawadee reports that

381
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,590
someone has violated palace law

382
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,350
and escaped from the palace.

383
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,950
I have brought the guards
to apprehend her,

384
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,030
Your Majesty.

385
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,070
You bring me this news of the prang.

386
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,070
Do you know

387
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,910
that your offense

388
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,150
is punishable by death?

389
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,550
I am well aware of palace law,
Your Majesty.

390
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,550
Take her away.

391
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,030
Lady Jinda.

392
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,990
Keep her under guard.

393
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,270
Do not let her escape.

394
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,870
Yes Madame.

395
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,030
This is a death sentence Lady Jinda.

396
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,470
What shall we do?

397
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,830
I still have a way out.

398
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,750
Don’t worry.

399
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,790
What do you say,

400
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,230
Lord Chamberlain?

401
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,510
With all due respect,

402
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,150
Lady Jinda,

403
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,990
the daughter of Ok Phra Lopburi,

404
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,510
has committed the offense
of escaping from the palace.

405
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,550
According to palace law,

406
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,190
she must be executed, Your Majesty.

407
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,270
-I request to defend myself.
-With all due respect,

408
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,910
Your Majesty,

409
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:34,150
palace servants leaving the palace

410
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,990
without royal permission

411
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,750
is a severe crime

412
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,230
that does not require
a disciplinary hearing, Your Majesty.

413
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,990
What do you have to say
for yourself Jinda?

414
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,710
I heard

415
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,310
rumors that

416
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,950
the collapse of the prang
was a supernatural omen,

417
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,110
but I do not believe
in such superstitions.

418
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,870
I left the palace to uncover the truth.

419
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,710
Everything I did

420
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,430
was out of loyalty to you, Your Majesty.

421
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,670
With all due respect,

422
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,670
loyalty to the King

423
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,870
is one thing,

424
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,270
but breaking palace law is another.

425
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:22,790
They cannot cancel each other out,
Your Majesty.

426
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,350
What do you mean,

427
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,790
Phra Lokthip?

428
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,630
I request

429
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,030
that Your Majesty sentence

430
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,030
Lady Jinda

431
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,350
to death

432
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,070
to set an example, Your Majesty.

433
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,910
Jinda,

434
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,950
do you have anything to say?

435
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,390
In front of King Chairachathirat,

436
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,990
the only way you’ll survive

437
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,270
is by using your wits.

438
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,750
I broke palace law

439
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,470
because I wanted an audience

440
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,550
to inform Your Majesty

441
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,870
that Phra Lokthip has been using
the prang collapse as an excuse

442
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,430
to slander the new concubines
as bearers of ill fortune.

443
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,350
He is doing this

444
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,230
to prevent our appointment, Your Majesty.

445
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,630
We, the new concubines, have been
in Ayodhaya for over a month,

446
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,670
and the chief astrologer

447
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,870
has not arranged an audience,

448
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,670
claiming there has been
no auspicious time, Your Majesty.

449
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,990
With all

450
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,110
due respect,

451
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,750
choosing an auspicious time

452
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,990
for the concubines’ presentation
is essential, Your Majesty.

453
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,910
And not a single day

454
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,630
has been auspicious in all this time?

455
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,670
Phra Horadhibodi?

456
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,790
The appointment
of the four main concubines

457
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,670
is vital for the kingdom’s stability.

458
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,310
It is of great importance.

459
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,590
I ask

460
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,310
that you speak the truth to the King.

461
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,590
Over the past half month,

462
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,750
there have been

463
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,750
several auspicious days, Your Majesty.

464
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,670
How dare you!

465
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,430
A court official

466
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,870
lying

467
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,990
to the King

468
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,510
is the real threat

469
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,310
to the kingdom, Your Majesty.

470
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,590
With all due respect,

471
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,070
I only sought
the most auspicious time for you,

472
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,070
out of genuine loyalty, Your Majesty.

473
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,830
Breaking the law is one thing.

474
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,030
Loyalty to the King is another.

475
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,670
They cannot cancel each other out.

476
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,230
You said so yourself, didn’t you?

477
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,390
Everyone acted out of loyalty.

478
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,590
Let it go.

479
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,830
No!

480
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,750
You are a high-ranking official,

481
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,590
and yet you lied,

482
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,670
neglected your duties,

483
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,270
and caused harm to the kingdom.

484
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,870
Not only that,

485
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:10,590
you fabricated stories
of ill fortune to deceive me.

486
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,590
Your crime is severe.

487
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,990
I order you to be stripped of your title

488
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,870
and exiled

489
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,630
from Ayodhaya

490
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,390
immediately.

491
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,630
Your Majesty.

492
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,870
Take him away.

493
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,430
-Go!
-Go!

494
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,230
-No, Your Majesty.
-Go!

495
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,750
-Go!
-Your Majesty.

496
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,230
-Go.
-Your Majesty.

497
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,750
Let go of me.

498
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,870
As for you,

499
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:46,550
Jinda,

500
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:51,710
you have violated palace law.

501
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,630
Your sentence

502
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,910
is death.

503
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,990
If a Queen Consort is to be appointed,

504
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,510
shouldn’t it be me, Your Majesty?

505
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,110
Please grant me a royal son, Your Majesty.

506
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:38,910
Huh, I see a hawk.

507
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,470
I want you to help me,

508
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,510
because if I don’t become Queen Consort,

509
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:46,190
I won’t have the fortune and prestige

510
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,310
to restore Sukhothai’s power.

511
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,990
I have served as Lady Jinda’s nursemaid
since she was a child.

512
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,030
And that woman over there,
why does she have her face covered?

513
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,670
They might have sent one of the concubines

514
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,590
to kill me.

515
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:04,110
Jinda informed me in her letter,
but I have a better plan.

516
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:12,070
I humbly request to serve in order

517
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,550
to repay the King’s kindness,

518
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,470
from this moment forward, Your Majesty.

519
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,710
