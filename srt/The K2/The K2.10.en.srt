1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,040
(The K2)

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,880
(Ji Chang-wook)

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,120
(Song Yoon-a)

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,080
(Im Yoon-a)

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,520
(Cho Seong-ha)

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,080
(The K2)

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,436
(Previously)

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,760
(Park Gwan-su caused this
man to lose his beloved Rania)

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,196
I was falsely accused of murdering Rania

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,840
and arrested by the
police, but fortunately,

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,320
I was able to escape within a week.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,276
That guy hanging the banner.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,996
The thing is,

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,756
that guy saw my face.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,400
A man hanging a banner?

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,116
(After escaping from danger,
he is once again on the run)

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,880
So in the end, you couldn't
catch that banner hanger?

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,756
Anna is the only means
of controlling Jang Se-jun.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,036
Whether through an accident or whatever!

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,996
(Yu-jin needs Anna in
order to control Se-jun)

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,156
If something happens to that girl,

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,356
everything you've planned all your life

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,956
will come crumbling down in a moment.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,836
(Yu-jin decides to keep
watch over Anna by her side)

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,796
You're all grown up.

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,600
You're pretty. You take after your mom.

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,756
Devil!

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,680
Who? Me?

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,920
I remembered everything.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,400
My mom didn't commit suicide.

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,916
When I come to see you a second time,

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,800
you'll end up dead.

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,796
(He intends to kill Yu-jin)

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,880
This is the second
meeting I told you about.

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,080
Shoot.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,080
Shoot!

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,800
Shoot!

38
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,480
Kill her already! Kill her!

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,320
(He saves Yu-jin's
life in a deadly crisis)

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,676
(He comes face-to-face with Park Gwan-su)

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,236
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,076
(Choi Yu-jin suggests they get
rid of Park Gwan-su together)

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,076
At the right time,

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,796
JSS will become a gun for you.

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,396
You'll become the bullet.

46
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,760
And I'll pull the trigger.

47
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,876
This is Kim Je-ha, who will
work on our VIP security team.

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,316
His pager code is K2.

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,040
What are you looking for?

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,160
Ah! Ramen?

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,120
(Je-ha feels sympathy when
he sees Anna's innocence)

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,760
But this kid read me.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,040
He read my mind.

54
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,000
This kid...

55
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,636
He didn't need my orders

56
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,996
or my permission.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,116
(Yu-jin feels sympathy for Je-ha)

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,076
He wasn't a hunting dog.

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,156
He was a wolf.

60
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,480
I won't be able to tame him.

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,520
Dad.

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,036
I seem to have lost my way.

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,316
Come and get me.

64
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,396
(Anna desperately wants
to meet her father Se-jun)

65
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,756
Really? My dad sent this?

66
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,716
She realized that her existence
was a nuisance to her father,

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,076
so she ate the strawberries
to get rid of herself.

68
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,076
(Anna is in danger of death)

69
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,276
Anna, no.

70
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Don't die. Please don't die.

71
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,320
Your dad will not appear in front of you.

72
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,316
You must have lived thinking

73
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,556
your dad was everything you had left,

74
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,436
but you're not everything to him.

75
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,840
(Yu-jin begins treating Anna
in more frightening ways)

76
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,276
Promise that

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,356
you'll protect Anna to the end.

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,876
I promise.

79
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,596
Anna is a hostage.

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,276
I must attain the highest authority

81
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,796
if I am to save her.

82
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,716
(Se-jun can't speak his mind
to Anna, as Yu-jin is listening)

83
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
I missed you, Dad.

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,516
Why did you bring my dad to me?

85
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,120
So you wouldn't die.

86
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,280
My father is...

87
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,476
You can't.

88
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,316
Now Anna is in your hands.

89
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,076
I'll protect you in the future.

90
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,276
From now on,

91
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,556
I won't allow anyone to touch you.

92
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,156
Miss! Miss!

93
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,596
Anna!

94
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,996
Please don't act like this!

95
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,996
Our child is unwell!

96
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,756
(Yu-jin acts like Anna's
concerned guardian)

97
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,116
Anna.

98
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,960
Anna, are you all right?

99
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,756
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

100
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,796
(Je-ha gradually draws closer to Anna)

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,156
Thanks.

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,356
As my brother-in-law's kid,
isn't she obviously my niece?

103
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,356
Isn't that right?

104
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,876
You can't.

105
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,156
-J4.
-You protect Anna.

106
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
At my side.

107
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,756
This is war.

108
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,956
Come by yourself.

109
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,560
Otherwise Anna will be in danger.

110
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,480
Hey, where are they?

111
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,996
I know it's a huge secret

112
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,116
that Anna is the daughter
of my brother-in-law.

113
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,276
Thanks to her, my sister can't
easily take JB Group from me.

114
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,560
What took you so long to get here?

115
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,800
This is Anna. K2, come in. Over.

116
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,080
This is K2. Speak. Over.

117
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,560
You forgot to tell me to sleep well. Over.

118
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,956
You're right.

119
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,760
Sleep well. Over.

120
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
Kim Je-ha.

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,640
Sleep well.

122
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,680
Go Anna.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,240
Sleep well.

124
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,280
(Episode 10)

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,516
I bet no one has done such
expert makeup on you before.

126
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,196
Had I not become a bodyguard,

127
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,040
I definitely would've
become a makeup artist.

128
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,916
This is the first time I'm wearing makeup.

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,436
Makeup isn't the only thing
you haven't done before.

130
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,076
What else is there to do?

131
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
You need to have your first kiss, too.

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,996
First kiss?

133
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, first kiss.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,076
I've had my first kiss.

135
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,480
Huh?

136
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,516
No, that was just mouth-to-mouth
to help you breathe.

137
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,916
That doesn't count as a kiss.

138
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,756
Oh, I'm going nuts here.

139
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,276
Just because your lips
touch doesn't mean it's a kiss.

140
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,436
A real kiss is...

141
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,916
I know what a kiss is.

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,316
So have you kissed before?

143
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,436
Oh, I've had countless kisses.

144
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,036
Even just yesterday...

145
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,356
Yesterday?

146
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,076
When? With whom?

147
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,756
No, I mean yesterday...Yesterday...

148
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,676
Anyway, there's someone.

149
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,916
Miss.

150
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,876
I'm letting you have K2.

151
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,516
Letting me? K2?

152
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,516
Yeah, of course.

153
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,836
You're lucky that I yielded to you.

154
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,476
Kim Je-ha...

155
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,396
Had I decided to seduce
him, it would've been wild.

156
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,196
Yeah, right.

157
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,040
Lower those curled lips.

158
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,916
And stop naively thinking that

159
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,960
mouth-to-mouth counts as a kiss.

160
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,196
With this magic lipstick,

161
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,080
I'll make your lips call out for a kiss.

162
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,560
Ta-da!

163
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,560
Wow.

164
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
Where is K2?

165
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,916
Why are you suddenly doing
things you've never done before?

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,916
You haven't seen K2?

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,916
He went out early this morning.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,200
Ah, he left?

169
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,520
Dang it...

170
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,680
Okay.

171
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,036
To keep Ms. Choi from
pursuing Anna further,

172
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,236
I'll go and meet with her.

173
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,160
Will that work?

174
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,640
Be careful, Je-ha.

175
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,840
What's this?

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
Seriously...

177
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,320
Hello?

178
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,636
Kim Je-ha. Did you see the picture?

179
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,916
Yeah, I saw it.

180
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,080
Mi-ran did my makeup. How is it?

181
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,440
Oh, it's pretty.

182
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,676
He says it's pretty. It's pretty.

183
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,040
See? See? I told you it was pretty.

184
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,596
Kim Je-ha.

185
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,316
Yeah, I'm listening.

186
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,956
You're mine now.

187
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,280
What?

188
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,356
Since Mi-ran is letting me have you,

189
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,996
you're mine now.

190
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,076
You know what that means, right?

191
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,120
What are you talking about?

192
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,680
Fine. Do whatever you want.

193
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,956
So today, you can't get hurt,
and you have to be careful.

194
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,600
Got it.

195
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,200
Is Anna happy with things?

196
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,276
Yes.

197
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,040
That's a relief.

198
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,920
When will you all come back?

199
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,116
There are many people watching.

200
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,556
You must control your facial expressions.

201
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,436
That son of a...

202
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,196
He's unwilling to let go of Anna.

203
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,236
Today is a live broadcast, ma'am.

204
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,596
You must be in a calm mood.

205
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,636
This is the last interview
related to Anna that I'll do.

206
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,276
Work with the media team

207
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,236
to stop Anna from being
exposed in the media.

208
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,916
Steps have already been taken.

209
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,680
Soon Anna will be forgotten.

210
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,156
So has Anna completely

211
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,516
fallen into Chairman Choi's hands now?

212
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,596
I'm getting curious about
Choi Seong-won's next step.

213
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,676
He said that

214
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,156
he was using Anna to defend himself

215
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,996
from Choi Yu-jin attacking him.

216
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,116
That could be the case
up until the election.

217
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,956
But the thing is,

218
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,476
if Assemblyman Jang and his
wife are victorious in the election,

219
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,036
will they just leave Anna
in Chairman Choi's hands?

220
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,000
As President and First Lady?

221
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,800
And do you think Chairman
Choi is clueless about that?

222
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,516
Anna is not Chairman Choi's shield.

223
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,756
Rather, she's a powerful knife

224
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,440
that he'll use to attack Choi Yu-jin.

225
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,636
Hello.

226
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,996
Hi.

227
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,760
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

228
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,036
What is it? Did something bad happen?

229
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,960
It's nothing like that.

230
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,956
There's something I'm mulling over.

231
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,076
I don't know whether I
should show it to you or not.

232
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,480
What is it?

233
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,640
But I think it's right to show you.

234
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,436
This is the police record

235
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,916
of your mother's incident.

236
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,720
(Eom Hye-rin Death Investigation Report)

237
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,556
There's something we're
extremely curious about.

238
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,196
How did you end up becoming
the guardian of Go Anna?

239
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,956
I had a close friendship with.

240
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,876
Eom Hye-rin, Anna's late mother.

241
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,716
Actually, when I was single
and working at JB Group,

242
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,396
I met her when she appeared
in a company advertisement.

243
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,436
Ah, I see.

244
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,236
True. At the time, star Eom Hye-rin was

245
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,476
in top demand for commercials.

246
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,836
Yes.

247
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,076
We ended up getting close that way,

248
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,636
and later on, Hye-rin met
film director Go Jun-ho,

249
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,436
who directed a film
produced by our company.

250
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,556
And they got married.

251
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,556
Ah...

252
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,036
So in the end, it was you

253
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,196
who set those two up with each other.

254
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,480
I wouldn't say I set them up.

255
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,636
But it's true that they met due to me.

256
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,396
You just said they met "due to" you.

257
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,000
You're being negative because
their marriage ended in divorce?

258
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,440
Yes.

259
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,400
At the time, it pained me a
lot, and I agonized over it.

260
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,916
I felt like those two had
met all because of me.

261
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,796
So that's the connection

262
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
that led you to becoming
Go Anna's guardian.

263
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,440
Yes.

264
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,520
You've even ended up in tears.

265
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,796
Let's come back after a
short commercial break.

266
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,560
Commercial break!

267
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,160
Ji-hyeon.

268
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,156
Wouldn't it be better

269
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,120
if the emotional moment wasn't
interrupted by commercials?

270
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,120
Is that so?

271
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,796
Sorry, Yu-jin.

272
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,560
It must have been hard
to squeeze out those tears.

273
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,996
Yu-jin.

274
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,200
But back then you worked at JB Group?

275
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,756
What?

276
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Weren't you studying abroad at the time?

277
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
I came back and forth.

278
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,520
Really?

279
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,996
My brother-in-law was
working at JB Group then,

280
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,280
but I don't think he knew you.

281
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,760
What would an employee know?

282
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,000
He was the CEO.

283
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,036
Ji-hyeon.

284
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,680
You know that we're just
sticking to the script, right?

285
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,320
Why?

286
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,800
Because of my son?

287
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,080
Okay, places.

288
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,840
My son went abroad.

289
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,916
Will my son be separated from his mother

290
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and wander the world for 10 years?

291
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,120
Cue.

292
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,156
In our studio now,

293
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,156
we're speaking with guest Choi Yu-jin.

294
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,316
After the late Eom Hye-rin got a divorce

295
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,316
and returned to Korea
from the United States,

296
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,120
you two must have stayed
in continuous contact.

297
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,440
Ms. Choi?

298
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,280
Yes?

299
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,796
Ah...

300
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,520
Yes, that's right.

301
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:11,356
As I saw Hye-rin gradually going downhill,

302
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,996
it made my heart ache.

303
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,276
And Eom Hye-rin's life

304
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,440
then tragically ended in suicide.

305
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,156
Yes.

306
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,636
Had I paid just a little
more attention to her,

307
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,076
maybe I could have prevented...

308
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,076
So through your connection,

309
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,276
you then began taking care of.

310
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,000
Go Anna, the daughter left behind?

311
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,240
Yes.

312
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,556
But Ms. Choi,

313
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,916
it seems you didn't know
that designer Lafeit was

314
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,040
desperately searching
for Anna for some time.

315
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,236
Of course I didn't know.

316
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,156
By any chance,

317
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,596
was Eom Hye-rin acquainted with Lafeit?

318
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,920
Lafeit?

319
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,156
Certainly not.

320
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,756
True...

321
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,476
Had that been the case,

322
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,276
there's no way that you wouldn't know,

323
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,520
considering your long
friendship with Eom Hye-rin.

324
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,440
Exactly.

325
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,476
It would have been great

326
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,276
if Anna could have joined us today.

327
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,196
Seeing the news yesterday,

328
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,756
it seems that she suffers
from some kind of illness.

329
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,996
You said that she was unwell.

330
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,956
Yes.

331
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,676
She suffers from photosensitivity
and a panic disorder.

332
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,636
Due to her prolonged symptoms,
she also has social phobia.

333
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,476
Her symptoms must be severe.

334
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,596
Yes, somewhat.

335
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,516
So she doesn't leave the house...

336
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,360
I see.

337
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,196
But what's this show about?

338
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,596
People who are hot issues.

339
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,116
As a surprise guest today,

340
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,996
we've brought Go Anna to the studio.

341
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,120
Go Anna, please come on out.

342
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,596
You're joking, right?

343
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,120
Who knows?

344
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,240
Please come on out, Anna.

345
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,516
Anna, it's nice to meet you.

346
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,120
Hello.

347
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,956
Is this level of lighting okay?

348
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,116
Yes. Thank you.

349
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,956
You were very surprised,
weren't you, Ms. Choi?

350
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,000
You two should greet each other.

351
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,280
Yes.

352
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,120
You're here?

353
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,120
That's right.

354
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,276
Anna, this whole time,

355
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,276
were you unaware that the designer Lafeit

356
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,116
was desperately looking for you?

357
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,076
Right, I didn't know.

358
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,116
Then you must not have known
what kind of person Lafeit was.

359
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,476
No, I knew who he was.

360
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,276
When I was young,

361
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,636
my mom sometimes talked about him.

362
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,996
Really?

363
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,836
Was Eom Hye-rin a fan of Jean-Paul Lafeit?

364
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,196
No.

365
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,916
I heard that he was among my
mom's close friends in France.

366
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,436
But Ms. Choi,

367
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,800
didn't you say that Eom
Hye-rin didn't know Lafeit at all?

368
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,120
Ah...Yes.

369
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,476
Well, since we're on the topic,

370
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,076
someone greatly surprised by Anna

371
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,036
has sent us a letter in video format.

372
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,600
Aren't you curious? Shall we take a look?

373
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,520
Hello, my angel!

374
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,196
You know me, right? I'm Jean-Paul Lafeit.

375
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,556
I searched for you for a long time.

376
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,556
Because of you, I had two big surprises.

377
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,476
The first was when I first saw you.

378
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,076
I thought my friend and muse
Eom Hye-rin came back to life.

379
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,476
And the second time was

380
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,716
after I had found you.

381
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,120
When I found out you were
the daughter of Eom Hye-rin.

382
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,600
Anna, you can become the greatest star.

383
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,996
Will you become my new muse?

384
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,396
My world of dreams awaits you here.

385
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,320
Come quickly. I'll be waiting.

386
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,516
Wow.

387
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,036
I think this is the first
time it's been revealed

388
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,996
that Eom Hye-rin was
Jean-Paul Lafeit's muse.

389
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Oh, it's really surprising.

390
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,956
In the fashion world, people say that

391
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,396
if Lafeit notices you,
you'll succeed as a model.

392
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,880
When are you planning to head to Paris?

393
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,996
I have no plans.

394
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,076
What?

395
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,516
It's my first priority to get
my social phobia treated,

396
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,316
but there's also something
I must do here in Korea.

397
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,756
So you're saying to wait?

398
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,676
Wow, this is so like the
daughter of Eom Hye-rin,

399
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,076
who was called the pride of Korea.

400
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,040
How surprising.

401
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,196
It's nothing.

402
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,076
But you just mentioned that

403
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,196
there's something you must
do aside from your treatment.

404
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,840
What is it that's causing
you to tell Lafeit to wait?

405
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,840
I want to solve the mystery of
my mom Eom Hye-rin's death.

406
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,676
The mystery of Eom Hye-rin's death...

407
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,640
So you don't acknowledge
that she committed suicide?

408
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,800
Anna.

409
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,160
No, it's not about that issue.

410
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,040
Then what is it?

411
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,276
If my mom committed suicide,

412
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,920
I want to know why she did it.

413
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,676
My mom was not
attached to fame at the time,

414
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,920
nor did she suffer from
any financial difficulties.

415
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,080
And right before her death,
she applied for my passport.

416
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,156
On the day it happened,

417
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,040
she reserved plane tickets
to America for me and herself.

418
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,120
But...

419
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,840
But that night...

420
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
My mom died.

421
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,040
And she didn't even leave a will.

422
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,560
Therefore...

423
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,040
I want to know...

424
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,720
Why my mom died.

425
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,996
Oh, I see.

426
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,440
It makes sense that you would have doubts.

427
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,036
By any chance,

428
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,756
since you had a deep friendship
with Eom Hye-rin back then,

429
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,156
did you two discuss anything

430
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,400
that you could tell Anna now?

431
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm not sure.

432
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,356
First of all, I want to
know the chain of events

433
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,076
on the day or around the
time that my mom died.

434
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,476
If anyone out there knew my mom

435
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,516
or had talked to her,

436
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,880
I'd like them to contact me.

437
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,520
Please.

438
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,116
This is rather suspicious.

439
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Could someone have killed her?

440
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,036
Anna.

441
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,996
Are you thinking or not?

442
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,036
In front of a bunch of people
hell-bent on catching you,

443
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,280
how could you show up out of the blue?

444
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,916
Was it you?

445
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,640
Were you the one who
made her do this broadcast?

446
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,280
I said I wanted to do it.

447
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,560
I wanted to rip off Choi Yu-jin's mask.

448
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,840
If my uncle hadn't stopped me...

449
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,360
I'll go out for a bit.

450
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,276
Anna.

451
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,756
Why on earth are you acting this way?

452
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,916
I want to get revenge on Choi Yu-jin.

453
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,996
My uncle will help us.

454
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,640
And besides...

455
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,720
You'll protect me.

456
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,836
Ma'am! Are you all right?

457
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,040
All that time...

458
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,996
It seems I was mistaken about something.

459
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,836
You should have killed her.

460
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,120
Exactly.

461
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,880
I should have listened to you.

462
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,476
My mom didn't take sleeping pills

463
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,840
and comfortably fall asleep and die.

464
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,960
She was in the throes of such
agony, her fingernails were broken.

465
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,076
Hey, wipe that silly grin off your face.

466
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Be honest with me.

467
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,200
Something is up, isn't it?

468
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,316
This isn't something I can discuss

469
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,200
over a cup of coffee in the office.

470
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,556
I got it, punk.

471
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,276
I'll buy you the dinner of a lifetime.

472
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,036
My, my, sir. You should
know that you're lucky.

473
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,036
Having a junior colleague like myself.

474
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,076
I know.

475
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,596
Give me the scoop already, okay?

476
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,796
Look.

477
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,076
You should get your insurance from me now.

478
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,956
Things are over for Jang Se-jun.

479
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,916
I got it. Cut out the prologue here.

480
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,916
Why? Why are things over for him?

481
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,320
Come closer.

482
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,280
-Is that true?
-Shh.

483
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,756
These team leaders here

484
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,596
are the people who will affix wings

485
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,156
to our Angel of Barcelona.

486
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,000
This is Shin Jeong-hui, in charge
of fashion, hair, and makeup.

487
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,640
This is Kim Yun-hui, in
charge of media relations.

488
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,400
This is Chief Baek, in charge of security.

489
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,156
Ma'am, Assemblyman Jang
is coming out this afternoon.

490
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,160
Oh, my. Congratulations, ma'am.

491
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,996
So you're having your makeup
done before meeting with him.

492
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,996
Yes.

493
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,476
Assemblyman Jang is so lucky.

494
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,040
He has such a beautiful wife.

495
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,316
As for what I reported
to you this morning,

496
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,920
I'll have it dealt with before
you meet Assemblyman Jang.

497
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,116
At any rate, it'll be
best not to touch Je-ha.

498
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,160
We may want to use him later.

499
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And he still has that email.

500
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,236
Right. Understood.

501
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,520
I'll replace your cold coffee.

502
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,076
I thought that chairmen
were very busy making money.

503
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,036
It seems you have lots of free time.

504
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,396
It's the underlings who make the money.

505
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,476
So what do chairmen do?

506
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,800
Us?

507
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,796
We make war.

508
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,596
We build and seize castles
and expand our territory.

509
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,916
Once we expand our territory,
more underlings farm for us.

510
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,276
And so we make war. Endlessly.

511
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,196
So what I heard was true.

512
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,036
Anna is not a shield you're
defending yourself with,

513
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,036
but rather a knife you'll
use to attack Choi Yu-jin.

514
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,196
Oh, that's not bad.

515
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,996
Where did you hear that?

516
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,436
Yes, it's true.

517
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,996
I'd like Anna to succeed
in avenging her mother.

518
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,116
Since then I can hold onto JB Group.

519
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,996
But is that a bad thing?

520
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,760
Justice will be done,
and I'll protect my castle.

521
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,876
So that's why you deliberately showed

522
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,876
a report with shocking
photos of her mother's corpse

523
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,720
to a kid with a panic disorder.

524
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,076
A kid?

525
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,716
It seems you're confused about something.

526
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,160
Look at her.

527
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,960
The woman you love isn't a kid anymore.

528
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,600
Look. Look at her.

529
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
How pretty.

530
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,596
She needs someone to give her wings.

531
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,596
Even though you saw
her beside you all your life,

532
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,436
it seems you don't know
your sister very well.

533
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,556
If you really knew her,

534
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,436
you wouldn't have done
a dangerous thing today

535
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,160
like bringing Anna to the studio.

536
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,676
Anna, we'll go one more time.

537
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,516
Loosen up. Okay.

538
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,076
Just a little more. Relax, relax.

539
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,156
Yes, like that.

540
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,836
That's not bad.

541
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,956
A little less tense. That's right.

542
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,036
This is good. That's right.

543
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,120
You've gotten much better.

544
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,316
You look very awkward.

545
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,916
Please act natural. Release the tension.

546
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,196
Now sit there slightly straddling it.

547
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,480
-I'll take a look at her clothes.
-Sure.

548
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,956
Chairman Choi.

549
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,956
I've been trying my best,

550
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,316
but reaching a pictorial level
is hard without using a flash.

551
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,996
Let's just use today's
shots for profile pictures.

552
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,476
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yes?

553
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,076
Give me just an hour.

554
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,916
I'll try talking to her.

555
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,756
Very well.

556
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,556
Okay, everyone. Let's go and eat.

557
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,956
I reserved seats at
a restaurant out front.

558
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,756
Wow, a restaurant!

559
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,200
Let's go, let's go. I'm hungry.

560
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,000
Anna.

561
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,276
Ah. Mi-ran, you just
go ahead and eat, too.

562
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,600
Okay, I will.

563
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,676
This is medication from
Dr. Lee at the hospital.

564
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,196
It's anti-anxiety medication.

565
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,196
If a situation occurs that
triggers your panic disorder,

566
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,076
taking this an hour in
advance will have a good effect.

567
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,196
Wow. There's medicine like that?

568
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,000
Of course. What a world
we live in nowadays.

569
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,396
Take this, and let's try
the shoot one more time.

570
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,920
We'll see whether we
can use the flash or not.

571
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,680
-Okay.
-All right.

572
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,236
What's this?

573
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,036
A panic disorder drug. He
said they gave it at the hospital.

574
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,956
But why would Chairman Choi
give you something like this?

575
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,676
You should buy
something like this yourself.

576
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,160
Would my uncle really
give me some weird drug?

577
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,276
Would you let him be if that happened?

578
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,116
-No, but the thing is...-
Let's go to the green room.

579
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,240
I'm supposed to wait
an hour after taking this.

580
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,440
It would be nice if this
really worked, right?

581
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,196
Just a moment. What brings you here?

582
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,076
This is a bouquet for Go Anna.

583
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,436
You can give that to me.

584
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,120
I can't do that.

585
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,320
J4.

586
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,034
(No signal transmission in this area)

587
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,680
Anna, get up.

588
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,560
Why?

589
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,320
What's going on?

590
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,996
Go up above

591
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,636
-and escape outside first.
-What did you say?

592
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,356
A bunch of suspicious people
have made their way inside.

593
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,556
If you stay here, I
think you'll be in danger.

594
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,760
Let's go for now.

595
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,236
Wait...

596
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,396
How can I go?

597
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,036
It's fine. You can get out.

598
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,756
You want me to go alone? What about you?

599
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,396
Don't worry about me.

600
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,076
I can just walk out of here.

601
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,276
Then I'm not leaving. I'll leave with you.

602
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,876
Anna, listen carefully.

603
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,476
The suspicious people outside

604
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,196
are releasing sleep-inducing gas.

605
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,556
Do you know what that means?

606
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,356
Gas? Poisonous gas?

607
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,036
You know I'm a good fighter, right?

608
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,396
I'll take care of this
myself, so you leave first.

609
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,396
Just get out.

610
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,036
That's why I'm saying I'll go with you.

611
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,676
Anna, if we're together,
I'm at a disadvantage.

612
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,676
Because I have to protect you.

613
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,436
Don't lie. How can you
fight in the midst of all that?

614
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,076
You're trying to just
send me off, aren't you?

615
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,236
How about the two of us just go?

616
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,996
-Anna, there's no time.
-I'm not going alone!

617
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,036
Anna, please!

618
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,956
Listen to me. I'm asking this of you.

619
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,040
If we're together, we'll both end up dead.

620
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,400
Go up quick. Go up there.

621
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,116
Hello?

622
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,356
Give the phone to Ms. Choi.

623
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,076
She's busy right now.

624
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,040
Talk to me.

625
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,200
So it was you.

626
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,836
Stop the guys who came here. Immediately.

627
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,836
Why?

628
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,436
Unlike a certain
someone, I don't like you.

629
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,636
And I'm not worried about Anna's dad.

630
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,996
It's all because of you
that Ms. Choi has gone soft.

631
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,916
Before you showed up,

632
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,640
everything was peaceful
and done in good order.

633
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,956
Now the time has come

634
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,956
for both Ms. Choi and
Anna to return to their places.

635
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,756
Their places as living and dead.

636
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,716
Just you wait.

637
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,640
Until I get there.

638
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,800
What the heck is this?

639
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,000
Hey!

640
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,120
Je-ha.

641
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,120
Je-ha.

642
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,156
Je-ha! Come on.

643
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,000
Get a grip, Je-ha.

644
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,516
Je-ha! Je-ha, come on!

645
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,476
Je-ha, get a grip!

646
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,320
Je-ha!

647
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,560
Je-ha, get a grip!

648
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,520
Je-ha!

649
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,560
Je-ha, please.

650
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,916
Je-ha, please.

651
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,840
Please, Je-ha.

652
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,160
Je-ha, Je-ha.

653
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,440
Je-ha.

654
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,880
Je-ha.

655
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,156
Come on, Je-ha.

656
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,160
Je-ha.

657
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,040
What's going on?

658
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,360
Miss!

659
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,156
We believe in Assemblyman Jang Se-jun!

660
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,956
We believe! We believe!

661
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,956
Why this investigation
forced by external pressure?

662
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,076
Why? Why?

663
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,640
We believe in Assemblyman Jang Se-jun!

664
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,520
Ah...

665
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,596
Shall I leave now?

666
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,040
Feel free.

667
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,436
I'll come after procedures are finished.

668
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,120
Okay then.

669
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,916
We believe in Assemblyman Jang Se-jun!

670
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,836
We believe! We believe!

671
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,596
Assemblyman Jang is innocent!

672
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,476
Innocent! Innocent!

673
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,076
Prosecutors, wake up!

674
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,280
What about Anna? What happened?

675
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,080
No news yet.

676
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,316
Come on, guys.

677
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,120
What's taking so long?

678
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,996
Breaking news. The prosecution
is expected to announce

679
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,996
they are ceasing to investigate
Assemblyman Jang Se-jun.

680
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,916
We will keep you updated as
they make their announcement.

681
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,160
He's coming out!

682
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,040
Let's go!

683
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,076
Assemblyman Jang Se-jun
was expected to go home today,

684
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,756
but during the investigation
of seized documents,

685
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,036
new suspicions have come to light,

686
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,076
and further investigation is required.

687
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,680
Assemblyman Jang's
release has been canceled.

688
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,040
That is all.

689
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,280
(New suspicions cause prosecution
to cancel Assemblyman's release)

690
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,240
Are the charges serious?

691
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,280
(New suspicions cause prosecution
to cancel Assemblyman's release)

692
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,036
Do you think he'll be jailed?

693
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,556
What is Assemblyman
Jang's current condition?

694
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,516
If the charges are solid,
he should end up detained.

695
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,240
Oh? It's an Assemblyman
from the ruling party!

696
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,040
Quick, quick!

697
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,840
Sir, you need to move to a
standard investigation room.

698
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,920
Damnit.

699
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,916
-Seong-gyu.
-Yeah?

700
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,636
-Let's go to the safe house.
-Huh?

701
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,076
I think the safe house will
be the most secure place.

702
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,676
Secretary Kim can't attack JSS.

703
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,916
Right, let's do that.

704
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,156
I'll send over some security guys.

705
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,840
Let's go.

706
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,760
Let's go.

707
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,160
Hello, Chief Ju. It's me.

708
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,800
What?

709
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,076
Please continue.

710
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,636
When they issued a warrant,

711
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,916
we took measures to
stop this from happening,

712
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,516
but when we don't know
what the charges are,

713
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,916
it's hard to prevent any surprise attacks.

714
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,756
What are you saying?

715
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,636
If you can't stop such a trifling attack,

716
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,076
what have we been keeping you lawyers for?

717
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,436
I'm sorry, ma'am.

718
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,476
In a case like this, rather
than law or evidence,

719
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,156
-political judgments are...-Shut up!

720
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,996
Fry the judge or threaten
him, but prevent this arrest.

721
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:43,996
And the accounting team?

722
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,560
Yes, ma'am.

723
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,676
Were there no mistakes in
the documents submitted?

724
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,040
There's no chance of that.
They were 100% perfect.

725
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,760
Got it. I'm hanging up.

726
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,036
What about the
presidential Chief of Staff?

727
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,920
His line is still busy.

728
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,836
No, you can just understand
this as a form of sincerity,

729
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,796
to stop a lowlife like Jang Se-jun

730
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,956
from joining the party.

731
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,320
(Presidential Chief of Staff)

732
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,436
Assemblyman Park, are
you threatening the president?

733
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,196
What? Come on...

734
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,596
No, how can you call this a threat?

735
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,116
It's just that if I'm
persecuted like this,

736
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,916
the president needs to
pay an equivalent price.

737
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,236
I just wondered how best to handle this,

738
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,596
so I want to meet up and
discuss it with the president.

739
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,676
Assemblyman Park!

740
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,556
Are you that afraid of
Jang joining the party?

741
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,076
Of course I'm afraid. I'm very afraid.

742
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,316
He looks geared up for a fight
between peasants and nobility.

743
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,960
How can I not be afraid?

744
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,996
Fine.

745
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,320
What else do you want me to do?

746
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,596
I heard that up by Uiyang Dam,

747
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,276
there are lots of carp with good roe.

748
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,916
Set up a spot where there's nice scenery

749
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,356
and go fishing for a while.

750
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,876
Once the election is over, I'll
prepare a nice place for you

751
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,000
in a good central location.

752
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,120
I'm busy, so I'll hang up now.

753
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,800
Welcome.

754
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,600
Welcome. Oh, my.

755
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,760
Sir, I was this close to dying!

756
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,116
Right, right. Come on in, my kiddos.

757
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,676
You've worked hard. Worked hard.

758
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,640
Daddy, those guys beat me up.

759
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,040
Beat you up? Who beat you up?

760
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,716
Good job, good job.

761
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,076
Oh, what a good job.

762
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,076
Ma'am, bring us some fresh tofu.

763
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,320
Go on in, go on in.

764
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,640
We should have a round of applause.

765
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,160
-Sir.
-What?

766
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,596
There are a number of
younger reformer politicians,

767
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,640
and they're peeking in at the entrance.

768
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,480
They've figured out
how the wind is blowing.

769
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,236
Don't embarrass them, and get
a separate room ready for them.

770
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,556
And have them share tables
with some solid Assemblymen.

771
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,556
Very well.

772
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,956
You absolutely must not embarrass them.

773
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,396
Since I'll go over there later.

774
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,040
-Yes. Understood.
-Good.

775
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,476
What on earth could it be?

776
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,356
The card that Park Gwan-su is holding...

777
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,996
I don't know exactly,

778
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,836
but it's clear that he's not
pressuring the Chief of Staff.

779
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,760
He's pressuring someone higher up.

780
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,796
The president?

781
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,796
If they manage to get a warrant issued,

782
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,276
it's obvious that

783
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,916
they'll drag out the trial
all the way to the election.

784
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,636
Later, even if we win the trial,

785
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,440
won't the election be a lost cause?

786
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,356
Ma'am.

787
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,400
There's only one way now.

788
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:38,040
Tonight, we must kill Park Gwan-su.

789
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,640
Is that...

790
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,000
Is that possible?

791
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,596
Their side will have set
up extra-tight security.

792
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:00,120
And don't we have an even
more special guy on our side?

793
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,080
Check inside.

794
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,956
Anna, let's go now.

795
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,920
I'm so scared, I can't go.

796
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,640
Let's go.

797
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,120
Since you can't see
well, take careful steps.

798
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,080
Yeah.

799
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,960
How is it? Is this okay?

800
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,760
Yeah, it's okay.

801
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,040
Are you scared?

802
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,520
Yeah.

803
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,836
But you're hungry?

804
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,400
Huh? That was me?

805
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,160
Yeah, it was you.

806
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,240
No.

807
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,080
It was because I was so surprised.

808
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,076
Shall I make ramen for you again?

809
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,040
No, that's okay.

810
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,756
If you're okay, why is
your stomach growling?

811
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,996
It wasn't me.

812
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,680
Oh.

813
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,716
Goodness.

814
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,116
-Be careful.
-Yeah.

815
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,320
Stairs.

816
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,036
How is it?

817
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,800
Are you okay now?

818
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,960
I'm a little scared.

819
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,400
The most...Oh!

820
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,956
I think that's the door.

821
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,396
Oh.

822
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,080
-I'm opening the door.
-Right.

823
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,236
We're going in.

824
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,720
Yeah.

825
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,280
What do you want to
eat the most right now?

826
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,040
What I want to eat?

827
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,840
I don't know.

828
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,040
I think we've come the whole way now.

829
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,276
Already?

830
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,080
Yeah, already.

831
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,796
How are you?

832
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,840
Are you still scared?

833
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,520
Yeah.

834
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,120
I'm scared.

835
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,240
Right now, are they...

836
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,200
I'm going crazy here.

837
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,076
An ambush

838
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,956
needs to occur when your
enemy doesn't expect it.

839
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,116
Unless Assemblyman Park is a total fool,

840
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,320
he'll have set a trap and
be waiting for us tonight.

841
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,996
Even if it's Je-ha...

842
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,236
Are you saying this is possible?

843
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,640
It's definitely possible for him
to take out Park Gwan-su, but...

844
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,240
But?

845
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:43,116
There's only a slim chance
that Je-ha would come back alive.

846
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,996
What are you saying?

847
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,276
Even if there's only a 1% chance,

848
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,316
this victory would be worth it.

849
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,476
If this night passes
without us doing anything,

850
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,840
JSS will crumble.

851
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,800
Kim Je-ha.

852
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,320
Where is he now?

853
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,560
He went back to the safe house.

854
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,160
Right.

855
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,680
I'll go.

856
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,200
But you have to guarantee
that things will be safe here.

857
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,800
Once that's confirmed, I'll go.

858
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,316
Where are you saying you'll go?

859
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,160
I'll be right back.

860
01:03:58,840 --> 01:03:59,956
Don't go.

861
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,476
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

862
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,520
No, don't go.

863
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,280
You're going because of me.

864
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,560
Don't go.

865
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,876
So you're saying that I
can kill Park Gwan-su,

866
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,680
but there's not a good chance
that I'll make it back alive.

867
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,560
I'm good with it. Let's do this.

868
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,276
I'll kill Park Gwan-su.

869
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,236
Instead, I have my conditions.

870
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,040
Conditions?

871
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,036
Tell me. Whatever they are.

872
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,480
First,

873
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,636
give me a life.

874
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,160
A life?

875
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,760
The life of this woman.

876
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,556
If you give me her life,

877
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,916
I'll snuff out Park
Gwan-su's life for you.

878
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,120
What should we do? Secretary Kim?

879
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,196
Very well.

880
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,040
I'll give up my life.

881
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,720
But first you must kill Park Gwan-su.

882
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,076
Then I'll give myself up.

883
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,476
That makes sense, right?

884
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,036
Let's do that.

885
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,160
And the second condition

886
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,116
is that you'll leave Anna alone.

887
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,556
Promise me.

888
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:55,880
In return, I'll persuade Anna
not to provoke you anymore.

889
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,200
All right.

890
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,160
Okay. I promise.

891
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,356
It's done then.

892
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,636
Is that all?

893
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,116
Ah, and give me a strike team.

894
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,956
Since someone has to pull the trigger

895
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,396
other than just me.

896
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,396
Of course.

897
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,716
All you need is a strike team?

898
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,476
I'll get going then.

899
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,716
But just in case,

900
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:33,036
before you go, can't you
provide that email address?

901
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,916
Isn't that whole thing over now anyway?

902
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,996
Are we strangers?
We're like family, right?

903
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,436
Forget it.

904
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,640
We don't need that email.

905
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,636
If Je-ha doesn't succeed,

906
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,996
it's all over for us anyway.

907
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,840
Isn't that right?

908
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,796
Why sit here? If we've decided,
we should move fast. No time.

909
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,280
Yes.

910
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,360
K2.

911
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,080
Je-ha.

912
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,640
If it's a completely dangerous situation,

913
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,120
you can just come back.

914
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,240
Why are you acting like this?

915
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,520
It's not like you.

916
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,880
And what is like me?

917
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,640
Don't worry.

918
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,676
Even before this,

919
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,480
I canceled the sending of that email.

920
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,320
Je-ha.

921
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,520
As for me...

922
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,600
I believe that you're someone

923
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,120
who keeps your promises.

924
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,280
(Anna)

925
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:40,996
Yes, Anna?

926
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,996
When you come back,
bring me some oily tteok-bokki

927
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,556
from the neighborhood
where I used to live.

928
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,000
I'm craving them.

929
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,360
I think I'll get back very late tonight.

930
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,036
It's okay.

931
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,880
Even if you're late.

932
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,760
Couldn't you ask Mi-ran
to do things like that?

933
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,036
No.

934
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,880
Then she'd eat all the food herself.

935
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,080
I want to eat it with just you.

936
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,240
Yes, please go ahead.

937
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,080
You have one extra
duty to carry out tonight.

938
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,316
An extra duty?

939
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,240
Along with Park Gwan-su, eliminate K2.

940
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,356
What?

941
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,916
Even if you fail to kill Park Gwan-su,

942
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,600
you absolutely must kill K2.

943
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,716
And be sure to bring back K2's cell phone.

944
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,120
Got it?

945
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,000
Yes.

946
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,276
Understand?

947
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,400
You need to buy those tteok-bokki.

948
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,480
If you forget, you're dead!

949
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:08,120
If I want to live, I guess I
have to buy those tteok-bokki.

950
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,560
Come back alive.

951
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,040
That's an order.

952
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,040
Got it.

953
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,240
I'll definitely come back to you.

954
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,640
(Thank you to Actor Lee
Han-wi for guest starring)
