(Episode 11)

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,636
Oh, hello, sir.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,716
You're calling so often these days.

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,996
Look here...

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,200
I'd like to get some insurance from you.

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,316
Say! Give me a spot, too.

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,760
Master Song.

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,956
Just go back inside.

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,440
-You all get in quick!
-Hey!

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,680
Are you looking down on me right now?

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,636
I'm not looking down on you.

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,156
I'm worried that you could get hurt.

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,956
What? Hurt?

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,876
Is getting hurt the problem here?

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,076
We're at war, and the
guys could all end up dead,

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,356
and you want me to sit back and watch?

23
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,276
Where is it? Where's an empty seat?

24
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,120
Master Song.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,000
What should we do?

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,316
He'll ride in our vehicle.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,996
Control him so that he
can't interfere. Got it?

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,996
Yes.

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,636
Come to this vehicle.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,040
Everyone, get in quick!

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,036
They're setting out now.

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,716
Yes.

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
But the scale is no joke.

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,000
Just look at those arrogant twerps.

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,680
Yes.

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,036
Yes. Understood.

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,436
Work hard.

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,720
I'm counting on you.

39
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,796
Who was that?

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,716
The police commissioner.

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,156
As expected, Choi Yu-jin
is sending people tonight

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,916
to infiltrate your private residence.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,840
-My house?
-Yes.

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,116
What a fright.

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,596
Hey, they're just pulling
out all the stops now, huh?

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,276
The police commissioner had
men dispatched to the vicinity,

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,396
so a wholesale arrest
will definitely be possible.

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,036
Very well.

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,916
Let's end this election today.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,076
Yes. So tonight,

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,116
instead of taking you home,
we'll take you to the hideout.

52
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,000
Ah, right.

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,080
Hey, are the JSS guys
following us right now?

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,840
Yes.

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,356
Park Gwan-su is currently
headed for his house.

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,560
Got it. Keep up the good work.

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,796
Don't you see that there?

58
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,596
Please show me your driver's license.

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,960
Just write a ticket.

60
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,720
Hey, what's that?

61
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,636
I think we lost him.

62
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,800
What? You seriously...

63
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,476
Found him.

64
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,440
Yes, he's heading in
the direction of his house.

65
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,116
Until further orders are
given, we wait in the vehicle.

66
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,720
Yes. Understood.

67
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,436
Until those guys get out of the car,

68
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,360
don't move an inch, and just wait.

69
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,076
Get ready.

70
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,240
If you're met with resistance,
you can fire immediately.

71
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,036
Hey! Are we filming a spy movie or what?

72
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,160
And with this, we're done
for the day, Mr. President.

73
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,120
Mr. President?

74
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,556
Come on, you really...

75
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,560
What a disloyal subject.

76
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,120
-Mr. President.
-Right.

77
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,320
Let's end this. Let's end it.

78
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,160
(Police SWAT Team)

79
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,396
Park Gwan-su has arrived.

80
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,036
Just as planned,

81
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,636
Park Gwan-su has shown up at his hideout.

82
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,000
Is that so?

83
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,720
He's been caught.

84
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,280
You got quite a fine
insurance policy, didn't you?

85
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
Exactly.

86
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,360
Good work.

87
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,116
It's very spooky here.

88
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,520
-It's been a long time, right?
-Of course.

89
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,160
Have you eaten dinner?

90
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,720
Yes, we've eaten.

91
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,120
What? You've eaten?

92
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,720
So that question was meant to
be answered with a code word.

93
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,680
If you so much as twitch,
your head goes flying.

94
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,720
Just shoot him.

95
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,560
Cover me!

96
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,516
If you hold out here for just a bit,

97
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
backup forces will arrive.

98
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,316
This won't do. We
must take shelter inside.

99
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,236
-Okay. Cover, cover!
-Hurry!

100
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,040
Cover us!

101
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,680
-Cover us! Cover!
-Who are these guys?

102
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,360
Goodness!

103
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,760
Jeez!

104
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,080
If we go in here, it's all over.

105
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,360
Cover!

106
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,000
Sir, this way!

107
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,000
Goodness, I'm going to die.

108
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,040
Jeez!

109
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,880
Hey!

110
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,236
Sir, the time is now.

111
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,196
You must flee! Now!

112
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,160
Cover us! Cover!

113
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
Damnit!

114
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,356
Are you okay?

115
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,356
I'm okay. Just go.

116
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,920
Don't be ridiculous!

117
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,600
If you lose Park
Gwan-su, all of us will die.

118
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,000
Go already! Go!

119
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,640
Cover me!

120
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,040
Got you, son of a...

121
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,396
Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,076
Dang it...

123
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,080
No, no. I can't.

124
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,520
Just a second.

125
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,400
Just a second. Please listen to me.

126
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,800
Even if you kill me...

127
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,040
You won't get out of here alive.

128
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,440
You have to come back alive.

129
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,160
That's an order.

130
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,080
How much?

131
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,680
How much are you being paid to kill me?

132
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,116
Tell me how much you're being paid.

133
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I'll pay you twice that.

134
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,800
A bullet isn't the only
thing that can kill a person.

135
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,720
You know so well.

136
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,520
You know what words a
mercenary likes to hear most.

137
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,800
Right?

138
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,000
It seems we're on the same page.

139
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,236
-Have a seat first.
-What?

140
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,120
Have a seat.

141
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,716
And call your aides

142
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,836
and have my team escorted out.

143
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,916
In total safety.

144
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,560
Ah, right. Right.

145
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,036
Of course it's you.

146
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,756
The mercenary.

147
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,840
This man knows me.

148
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,076
Do you know me?

149
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,800
Yes, of course. I know you well.

150
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,036
You killed someone and ran away.

151
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,160
How much does he know?

152
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,396
Then you must be well aware

153
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,476
why I came here.

154
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,876
But...

155
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,316
Even if you kill me,

156
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,916
you won't be able to
make it out in one piece.

157
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,156
Right, so he doesn't know

158
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,916
that I'm incapable of killing anyone now.

159
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,596
Ha! Seriously...

160
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,516
Since that would be after I kill you,

161
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,560
I'll figure it out myself.

162
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,040
Twice the amount...

163
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,440
Twice the amount?

164
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,356
But since I have a superior,
I'll have to call and ask

165
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,160
whether or not I can go along with this.

166
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,356
Yes, Ms. Choi. It's me.

167
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,240
I'm calling because Assemblyman
Park Gwan-su is in front of me.

168
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,756
He says if I let him live,

169
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,276
he'll pay me double. What should I do?

170
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,476
What?

171
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,240
What are you saying?

172
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,316
So there are no strike
team members with you?

173
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,916
What are you asking about?
I'm saying my price went up.

174
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,240
Three times.

175
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,596
-Three times the amount.
-I have business ethics.

176
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,000
Isn't it kind of inappropriate
to switch sides midway?

177
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,876
He can't kill the man by himself.

178
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,400
What will we do?

179
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,680
What will we do?

180
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,876
Put Park Gwan-su on the phone.

181
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,400
Got it.

182
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,956
Well, Ms. Choi.

183
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,756
Ms. Choi. I was so surprised.

184
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,560
I thought I was dead.

185
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,516
Yes, Assemblyman.

186
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,240
I guess...

187
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,396
You must not be doing too well.

188
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,876
What now?

189
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,916
Shall you and I engage
in a bidding war now?

190
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,076
Ms. Choi, I've lost. Save me.

191
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,196
I'll have the prosecution release
Assemblyman Jang at once.

192
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,196
Mmm...

193
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,916
If you only do that much,
I'm still suffering a loss.

194
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,996
My knight has captured the king right now.

195
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,916
If you kill me now,

196
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,076
Assemblyman Jang can't run for president.

197
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,156
Just take back your move here.

198
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,636
I'm not sure.

199
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,276
As for whether Assemblyman
Jang can run or not,

200
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,640
won't we have to wait and see?

201
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,996
In that case, how about I let
Assemblyman Jang join the party?

202
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,280
I'll make the announcement immediately.

203
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,356
How does that sound?

204
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,160
Will that satisfy you?

205
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,560
I'm not sure.

206
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
In addition to that...

207
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,120
How about you give up
on running for president?

208
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,720
What?

209
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,600
Wow...

210
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Wow, Ms. Choi.

211
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,156
Ms. Choi!

212
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,960
Just kill me. Kill me.

213
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,240
Of course you'd say that.

214
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,836
Very well.

215
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,996
Then I'll give you 15 minutes.

216
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,236
I'll be waiting.

217
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,520
-Put our guy on the phone.
-Yes.

218
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,920
Answer.

219
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,080
Yes?

220
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,716
Come back alive.

221
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,080
For sure.

222
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,240
Yes, understood.

223
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
We're pulling out. We're
pulling out everyone.

224
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,000
Pulling out?

225
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,036
What the...

226
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,560
Those guys are escaping!

227
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,480
Just let them go.

228
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,116
Hey, how are we just leaving like this?

229
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,196
Without even fighting?

230
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,916
It's because we caught the big fish.

231
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,916
Master Song, we won.

232
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,156
We captured Park Gwan-su.

233
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,160
What are you talking about?

234
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,640
(Investigation Room)

235
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,040
He's out.

236
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,756
What exactly was the penalty you received?

237
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,996
Is this related to campaign
funds you received

238
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,196
from JB Group and the
international finance group?

239
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,956
Why were you released as innocent?

240
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,956
What further charges
did the prosecution add?

241
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,916
Is there no plan for an official
appeal to the prosecution?

242
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,720
Please say a word.

243
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,316
I'd like to say a word, or two words,

244
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,956
but the only thing I'll say
is that I received an apology

245
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,476
from the prosecution, who cleanly admitted

246
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,040
their ridiculous mistake.

247
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,156
Will you continue to run as
an independent candidate?

248
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,996
You received an invitation
to join the ruling party,

249
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,636
but that invitation was since canceled.

250
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,316
What are your upcoming plans?

251
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,360
Please tell us more.

252
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,396
Was there no coercive investigation?

253
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,396
Please comment further.

254
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,396
(Assemblyman Jang released
and cleared of suspicion)

255
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,147
(Acceptance of apology
for prosecution's mistakes)

256
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,840
Congratulations, ma'am.

257
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,120
You should congratulate
me once K2 gets back alive.

258
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,520
(Press Room Democratic Progressive Party)

259
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,956
Did something happen?

260
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,996
For you to come here at this hour...

261
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,196
Have the reporters on
night duty all gathered?

262
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,080
Yes, we called
basically all the reporters.

263
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,236
But what's going on?

264
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,160
I am making an urgent announcement.

265
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,436
Today, the prosecutor's
office declared the innocence of

266
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,476
presidential candidate
Assemblyman Jang Se-jun.

267
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,076
As a statement of welcome
and as an announcement,

268
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,516
we now officially invite
Assemblyman Jang Se-jun

269
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,076
to join our party as the
highest-ranking member

270
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,596
and to carry out further
campaign activities

271
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,480
within our party. That is all.

272
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,996
Is it true that as of now, he's
the highest-ranking member?

273
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,476
You can all immediately upload
reports on the Internet, right?

274
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,556
Yes, we can upload them, but...

275
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,160
Wait! Sir!

276
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,080
(Secretary Kim)

277
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,520
Here. It's $2 million.

278
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,476
You must have seen the money in the safe.

279
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,040
Will you be satisfied with this amount?

280
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,800
I could give you
everything that's in there.

281
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,120
I'm not a robber...

282
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,196
As expected, you're a pro. A pro.

283
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,396
Good.

284
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,000
All about business ethics...

285
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,240
You were a mercenary
with Blackstone, right?

286
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,480
Come on. Why are you so surprised?

287
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,160
Where in Iraq did you work?

288
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,516
-Fallujah.
-Oh...

289
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,920
I see.

290
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,400
Were you a client of Blackstone?

291
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,916
Well, you could say that.

292
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,200
Since I hired them
for my private security.

293
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,116
So...

294
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,840
Did you hit it big there?

295
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,160
Why glare at me like that?

296
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,196
I'm not too well-mannered.

297
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,796
And besides,

298
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,636
considering you received
VIP service from Blackstone

299
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,516
that costs at least $30,000 a day,

300
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,120
you wouldn't have gone there just for fun.

301
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,960
Also...

302
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,716
I think I smell oil here.

303
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,476
It's not the smell of oil.

304
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,280
It's the smell of blood.

305
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,960
The smell of blood?

306
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,040
I like you.

307
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,996
Actually, I...

308
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,480
I was looking for a way
to meet you in secret.

309
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,476
But thankfully enough,

310
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,796
Choi Yu-jin sent you directly to me.

311
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,960
Me?

312
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,516
Why'd you want to meet me?

313
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,956
What do you mean, why?

314
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,440
Aren't you the person
who's closest to Choi Yu-jin?

315
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,036
How long will a competent
young man like you

316
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,920
keep living this way?

317
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,040
Then how am I supposed to live?

318
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,036
What would you think about

319
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,840
working with me on behalf of the country?

320
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,596
The country?

321
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,800
I did quite a lot of work for
our country back in the day.

322
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,840
You'd be making money, too.

323
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,916
Let's do that.

324
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,156
If you have a gig that pays well, call me.

325
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,396
Since you know who I am,

326
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,676
it should be easy to get in touch.

327
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,196
Right.

328
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,276
Next time, I'll be the
first to hire your services.

329
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,000
And you'll uphold business
ethics then, too. Right?

330
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,360
-I will.
-Good.

331
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,640
Sir!

332
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,396
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

333
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,916
Catch that guy!

334
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,076
It's fine, it's fine.
Step down. It's fine.

335
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,920
This fellow is my guest.

336
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,120
See you later then.

337
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,676
How did this...

338
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,596
Ah, today I gave him an advance payment.

339
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,040
What?

340
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,680
Everything in life is
a matter of politics.

341
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
Isn't that right?

342
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,960
Are you okay?

343
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,280
What's this?

344
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,680
Money, obviously.

345
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
I asked what it is.

346
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,520
Yeah.

347
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,400
Yeah.

348
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,280
So such a thing happened.

349
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,436
Right. Thank you, Chairman Choi.

350
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,516
For protecting Anna.

351
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,756
I'm counting on you in the future, too.

352
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,000
Yes, right. Then let's meet up sometime.

353
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,400
Yeah.

354
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,396
So in the end, my wife tried to kill Anna.

355
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,076
Sir, that's true,

356
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,476
but it was Chairman Choi
who first provoked her.

357
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,120
Chief Ju.

358
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,040
So in the end, you're
loyal to Choi Yu-jin?

359
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,996
Sir, that's not what I'm saying.

360
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,840
Then it's true that an attempt
was made to kill Anna?

361
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,476
Still, I wanted to say
that it was your wife

362
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,156
who got you released
from the prosecutor's office.

363
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,960
Shut your mouth.

364
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,636
Congratulations.

365
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
You got to stay alive.

366
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,800
Don't touch Je-ha.

367
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,636
If you touch him,

368
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,280
I might kill you first.

369
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,796
Ma'am.

370
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,556
I can do everything for you

371
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,000
that Kim Je-ha can do.

372
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,920
Then you must understand as well.

373
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,120
What you want to do for me...

374
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,720
And what I want to do for Je-ha.

375
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,600
And so...

376
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,440
Don't make me kill you.

377
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,960
And don't try to do
the things Je-ha can do.

378
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,520
You should do the work you're good at.

379
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,156
Yes.

380
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,160
Let's see each other at home.

381
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,360
Let's do that.

382
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,040
Miss, time to eat.

383
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,120
Miss! It's time to eat.

384
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,836
Just leave her alone.

385
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,880
Do you think she can eat right now?

386
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,596
Why wouldn't she be able to eat?

387
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,516
Even in times of war,

388
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,916
people need to eat to fight.

389
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,476
Right now, even K2 is probably

390
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,916
emptying a big bowl of
soup and rice somewhere.

391
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,116
That's what you would do. So unfeeling.

392
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,756
Come on!

393
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,316
If you don't eat, it's your own loss.

394
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,160
You have no strength to fight.

395
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,560
He must be here.

396
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,080
Oh, my. Just look at how happy she is.

397
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,956
Wow.

398
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,436
I can't watch that without crying.

399
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,396
Why does it always seem
like Je-ha is starring in a movie?

400
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,520
Because he's so good-looking.

401
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,520
Welcome back.

402
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,800
I came back safely.

403
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,160
Good job.

404
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,556
But I couldn't buy the oily tteok-bokki.

405
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,000
I had no money.

406
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,676
I left my wallet here.

407
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,160
It's okay.

408
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,120
I'll overlook it just this once.

409
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,520
Instead...

410
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,240
Shall we go out and eat
something even better?

411
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,000
It's okay.

412
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,600
You all leave.

413
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,596
I told you not to mess with Anna.

414
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,516
That if anything happens
to Anna, our contract is over.

415
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,880
If I don't become president,
you're nothing, Choi Yu-jin!

416
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,600
Right. I got it.

417
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,600
I'll just leave Anna alone.

418
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,160
So this means...

419
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,040
You don't want to
become president, do you?

420
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,756
You've gotten very childish.

421
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,200
Are you threatening me right now?

422
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,116
If I make a deal with Choi Seong-won,

423
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,036
even if I can't have all of JB Group,

424
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,120
I'm sure he'll give me a
few subsidiary companies.

425
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,080
And then I'll have no worries
about taking care of myself.

426
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,440
Wow. This is hilarious.

427
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,916
There's no way you can do that.

428
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,116
It won't be enough to
satisfy your ambition.

429
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,160
You know that, too.

430
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,200
Is that so?

431
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,516
That's true.

432
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,796
Right, then...

433
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,240
Shall I take things to another level?

434
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,320
This time,

435
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,920
shall I make a deal with Park Gwan-su?

436
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,560
Just like I set up a contract with you.

437
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,836
Truthfully, it makes
no big difference to me.

438
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,316
Since you and Park Gwan-su

439
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,280
are the same kind of person.

440
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,156
I'd offer you up to him on a platter,

441
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,880
and once he became
president, he'd give me JB Group.

442
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,120
Do you think Park Gwan-su
would refuse that offer?

443
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,916
Geez...

444
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,240
So you think I'm joking.

445
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,400
Have you forgotten who I am?

446
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,160
So you really have forgotten.

447
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,556
Just like you said to me,

448
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,240
without me, you're nothing.

449
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,520
So don't get cheeky.

450
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,880
Anna will end up dead if she
does something to deserve it.

451
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,280
If you don't want that,
let me know anytime.

452
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,760
Tell me you'll give up your candidacy.

453
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,800
What's this?

454
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,320
The expression of a victim?

455
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,280
Am I not the victim here?

456
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,996
For the sake of your
coarse political ambitions,

457
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,760
you seduced me back when I was young.

458
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,356
I had never received real love before,

459
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,560
so of course I fell for it.

460
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800
Shall I confess something embarrassing?

461
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,956
When you touched me, I felt excited.

462
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,160
Even up until recently.

463
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,680
You knew that, didn't you?

464
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,716
What's the matter?

465
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,876
You used it sometimes.

466
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
To taunt me.

467
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,116
But what now?

468
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,720
You don't make me feel anything anymore.

469
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,160
Here.

470
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,240
Want to touch me?

471
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,036
You're good at picking up on these things.

472
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,680
Being a player.

473
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,120
Fine, I admit it.

474
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,360
You were dashing.

475
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,440
You were young, smart, and so righteous.

476
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,200
Since I believed that,
just like the voters did.

477
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,160
But it wasn't true.

478
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,520
Even back then, you were old,
sly, and dirty like you are now.

479
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,996
And that's why

480
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,276
you were able to betray and kill.

481
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,476
Eom Hye-rin, who loved you so much.

482
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,040
You used my jealousy and my rage to do it.

483
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,320
You lowlife.

484
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,036
That was the first time
anyone hit me in my life,

485
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,476
so I thought of having
someone cut off your hand,

486
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,356
but you'll probably need
to shake a lot of hands

487
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,240
during the campaign, so I've let it be.

488
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,080
Keep it well.

489
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,316
Because once the need
for campaigning is done,

490
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,760
I'll be claiming it.

491
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Where shall I take you?

492
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,716
Let's have a drink.

493
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,476
Sir, make a toast.

494
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,716
Good job, everyone.
Let's eat, drink, and die.

495
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,280
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

496
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,996
Hey, hey. You're ruining our drinking.

497
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,236
What?

498
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,796
Your face is getting red again.

499
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,076
It's okay.

500
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,196
Hey, just leave her
be. It's only one drink.

501
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,480
Yeah. What's your deal?

502
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,956
Hey, will you really be okay?

503
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,956
This much is fine.

504
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,200
Oh...

505
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,236
Drink, drink, drink!

506
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,956
The drink is going down.

507
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,720
Glug, glug, glug, glug...

508
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,120
She's a good drinker.

509
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,596
What are you doing? That's not right.

510
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,040
If you're envious, you've already lost.

511
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,080
Team leader, nice!

512
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,956
So that's why she took two pieces of meat.

513
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,556
You should've just eaten
the food, not her hands.

514
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,520
I think my hands smell now.

515
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,116
Was he always close with the strike team?

516
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,600
No, it wasn't like that.

517
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,840
Shall I call K2?

518
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,040
No.

519
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,720
He must be tired...

520
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,840
Let him have a drink and rest today.

521
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:07,756
Tomorrow morning, bring him to Cloud Nine.

522
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,600
Yes. Understood.

523
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,120
We're home!

524
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,196
We need to muster up our strength.

525
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,876
Look, look.

526
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,876
Cheer up, baby! Cheer up, baby!

527
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,196
Muster up a bit more strength!

528
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,596
A girl can't show her
feelings too easily...

529
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,240
Je-ha.

530
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,956
Thanks.

531
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,320
What for?

532
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,880
What's with you?

533
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,916
What's up with you, big
bro? You're acting all weird.

534
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,640
It's not like you.

535
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,040
Big bro?

536
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,076
Wow...

537
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,840
What is it?

538
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,596
Wow...

539
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,956
-What is it?
-Aw...

540
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,480
What's with you?

541
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,836
Let go of me already. This is so gross.

542
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,240
I really hate hugging guys.

543
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,520
I've got goosebumps.

544
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,436
Miss! We enjoyed
ourselves thanks to you today.

545
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,516
-We enjoyed it!
-We enjoyed it!

546
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,756
I enjoyed it, too.

547
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,836
-We're going now.
-Go already. You're so talkative.

548
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,320
Let's go!

549
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,276
You go already, pal.

550
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,956
Hey! Who's going to drive?

551
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,996
Did anyone here hold off from drinking?

552
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,316
I think everyone drank.

553
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,956
I guess our fine team
leader must drive us himself.

554
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,000
-Who's driving?
-Come on, guys. Seriously...

555
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,120
Wow, this is hilarious.

556
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,036
And you, too...

557
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,640
What? I'm not doing it. I won't do it.

558
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,756
This is why substitute
drivers all run away.

559
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,316
These days, men have to
take good care of their faces.

560
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,480
That right?

561
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,196
Je-ha, sit down.

562
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,316
These guys are really going nuts.

563
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,316
I can't stand it. Seriously...

564
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,956
Right, you come and
try a facial mask, too.

565
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,316
What? Are you in pain somewhere?

566
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,796
No, nothing hurts.

567
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,756
If you're okay, please be seated.

568
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,516
-Hurry up and put a mask on.
-I don't want to.

569
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,436
-Why not?
-I don't want to.

570
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,396
This kind of thing is
for ugly guys like this.

571
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,316
If you look like me, there's no need...

572
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,916
Dang it, you really...

573
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,996
Come here already, punk!

574
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,716
Don't stare at me. It's
seriously grossing me out.

575
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,076
Is there something wrong with your faces,

576
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,560
or something wrong with the facial masks?

577
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,036
Seriously.

578
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,040
I said I won't do it.

579
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,360
I'm really not doing it.

580
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,080
Don't laugh, dang it. Seriously...

581
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,120
Mi-ran.

582
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,960
I'm not Mi-ran. I am not Mi-ran.

583
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,116
What?

584
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,000
Oh, you scared me.

585
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,640
Why am I here?

586
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,360
And I can't kill them all.

587
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,276
Right, you come and
try a facial mask, too.

588
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,676
What? Are you in pain somewhere?

589
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,840
No, nothing hurts.

590
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,080
(Je-ha/Are you asleep?)

591
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,880
Are you asleep?

592
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,680
I'm not asleep.

593
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,396
Where are you?

594
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,080
The roof.

595
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,920
Wow.

596
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,476
Wow.

597
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,160
Ta-da.

598
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,476
You cleared everything out like this?

599
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,436
No, I asked the housekeeper

600
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,600
to clean things up, since
you come up here often.

601
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,556
-How is it?
-It's so great.

602
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,160
-You like it?
-This place is wonderful.

603
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,916
Hey, what are you doing right now?

604
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,116
Take this off.

605
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,556
Here? Out of the blue? What's with you?

606
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,556
Take it off.

607
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,956
Hey, isn't this too racy?

608
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,076
No way.

609
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,036
What? Take it off.

610
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,080
I'm not ready yet.

611
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,960
That must have hurt so much.

612
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,036
No, it's okay. Just a slight scratch.

613
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,960
That makes no sense.
This is a slight scratch?

614
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,120
Anna...

615
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,356
Go to a hospital tomorrow for sure, okay?

616
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,836
Fine, I got it.

617
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,080
I can go to the JSS medical facility.

618
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,036
You're mine.

619
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,440
Can you go around acting so reckless?

620
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,840
I got it. I won't do that.

621
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,880
Just a second.

622
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,516
All done.

623
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,120
-You're done?
-Yeah.

624
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,956
Thanks.

625
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,560
It doesn't hurt a bit.

626
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,836
The night has already gotten chilly.

627
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,836
Yeah. Even so, it's okay now.

628
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,316
Why?

629
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,000
Wait a second.

630
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,560
Oh, it's chilly.

631
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,520
Oh, it's warm.

632
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,080
Oh, it's really warm.

633
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,956
I'm joking. Joking.

634
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,076
Oh, it's so cold. So cold.

635
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,120
Here.

636
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,280
How is it? Warm, right?

637
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,120
Yeah.

638
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,560
-But...-Yeah?

639
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,956
We only have one blanket?

640
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,760
No.

641
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,800
Then why are you doing this?

642
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,440
-Huh?
-Well?

643
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,880
Just because.

644
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,000
Anna.

645
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,120
Yeah?

646
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,640
Later on, we...

647
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,560
Later on...

648
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,920
Shall we go and live in Spain?

649
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,040
What? You don't want to?

650
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,400
That place

651
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,400
is somewhere I wanted
so badly to run away from.

652
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,960
But...

653
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,680
It's also the place where I first met you.

654
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,040
Yeah, let's go there.

655
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,840
If I go with you, I think it'll be okay.

656
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,916
But now that I think about it,

657
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,200
I really don't know anything about you.

658
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,360
What were you doing in Spain?

659
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,240
I was on the run.

660
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,160
Why?

661
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,676
I was falsely accused

662
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,240
of killing someone I couldn't protect.

663
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,800
Was it someone you loved?

664
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,800
Yeah.

665
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,080
So that's why you had
nightmares every night?

666
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,840
Yeah.

667
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,440
That must have been hard.

668
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,760
I mean...

669
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,516
It must be hard.

670
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,160
Even now.

671
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,320
It's okay.

672
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,440
I feel comfortable.

673
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,236
Anna.

674
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,960
Yeah?

675
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,516
In the past, there was
nothing I wanted to protect.

676
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,956
So there was nothing I had to push for.

677
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,880
But now,

678
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,640
there's someone I want to protect.

679
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,440
So...

680
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,160
I think I can become happy.

681
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,280
When will we

682
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,160
be able to go to Spain?

683
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,080
Well...

684
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,840
Once this war is over?

685
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,680
Looking cool.

686
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,760
Welcome.

687
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,440
Ms. Choi is waiting for you.

688
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,116
Don't worry.

689
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,076
Since I wasn't able to
take Park Gwan-su's life.

690
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,160
Forgive me...

691
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,480
For my prior rudeness.

692
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,040
Come on in.

693
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,156
Why is she acting that way?

694
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,680
Secretary Kim?

695
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,436
What? It's obvious.

696
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,196
You're the hero who saved JSS.

697
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,840
I'm a hero?

698
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,956
Don't feel too burdened by Secretary Kim.

699
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,436
She's scared that her life
may be demanded of her.

700
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,876
It's unfortunately, but since I
wasn't able to kill Park Gwan-su,

701
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,400
it can't be helped.

702
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,676
Shall I give it to you anyway?

703
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,160
The life of Secretary Kim?

704
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,320
Sometimes...

705
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,916
You make jokes

706
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,316
that sound like you're serious.

707
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,280
Why is that?

708
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,120
I must be good at acting.

709
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,520
Right.

710
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,876
Did you fish any information
out of Park Gwan-su?

711
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,036
I just got a contract for your head

712
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,356
and got paid and came back.

713
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,040
You succeeded.

714
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,156
Dear me. You went through so much.

715
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,156
Did you sleep well?

716
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,596
Yes.

717
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,080
That's a relief.

718
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,076
Ah! As for you guys and the housekeeper,

719
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,396
I set things up so
you'd be working for me.

720
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,796
And I raised your pay. That's okay, right?

721
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,316
I did it of my own accord,
but if you don't want it, say so.

722
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,676
Since you're taking good care of us...

723
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,476
We'll do our utmost.

724
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:34,636
Right. Don't you worry about JSS anymore,

725
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,636
and just keep Anna safe. Got it?

726
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

727
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,036
Ah, but since this house
is the property of JSS,

728
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,076
the security...

729
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,880
This house?

730
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,236
No.

731
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,276
This house is originally
owned by JB Development.

732
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,716
I lent it to my sister.

733
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,116
So I'll remove the current security system

734
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,356
and install a new one.

735
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,716
If you contact my secretary's office,

736
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,556
the manpower and
cost will be arranged for.

737
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,280
Understood.

738
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,000
Ah, you need money, right?

739
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,960
This card has no limit,
so use it when you need it.

740
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,720
Take it already.

741
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,520
Thank you.

742
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,436
Also, I'll register this
house under your name.

743
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,996
You live here.

744
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,240
My name?

745
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,720
Yes. I'm telling you to
just keep living here, kid.

746
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,236
Okay, I'll do that.

747
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,076
Thank you, Chairman.

748
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,756
Thank you so much.

749
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,996
Anna doesn't realize what you're saying.

750
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,996
Miss, at a time like this,
you should say thank you.

751
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,640
Forget it. It's okay if she
doesn't know this stuff.

752
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,720
The smell of blood...

753
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,840
Not the smell of oil?

754
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,556
It seems like something
he said unconsciously.

755
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,716
Wouldn't it mean that he made money

756
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,036
selling weapons?

757
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,560
That's possible.

758
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,516
As for this problem,

759
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,040
I'll look into it further with the Mirror.

760
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,236
More than that,

761
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,996
now we must set about

762
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,040
laying a trap.

763
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,996
A trap?

764
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,280
Yes.

765
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,316
It won't take long for Park Gwan-su

766
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,760
to approach you now.

767
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,080
Since he'll gradually want
to kill me more and more.

768
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,236
You need to gradually

769
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,080
become closer with Park Gwan-su.

770
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,960
Uncle.

771
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,680
By any chance...

772
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,596
Do you know where my mom's grave is?

773
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,480
Yes, I know.

774
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,956
I wondered when you'd ask about this.

775
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,156
Good. There's a commemorative
fashion show for you mom tonight.

776
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,080
Before we go there,
let's visit her resting place.

777
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,080
Okay.

778
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:42,476
Now you should do your own work.

779
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,036
Yes.

780
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,076
I've already started.

781
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,480
Really?

782
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:54,800
You absolutely must not...

783
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,720
Let Je-ha know about this.

784
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,040
Got it?

785
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,280
I'll remember that.

786
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,120
(The K2)

787
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,920
I want to show how my mom is within me.

788
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,916
The public has forgotten
about Eom Hye-rin,

789
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,756
but they need to remember.

790
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,836
Don't you remember me?

791
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,916
We met that night.

792
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,076
You must not tell Je-ha.

793
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,596
Are you on my side? Or Choi Yu-jin's side?

794
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,956
Whoever has created this dirty faction,

795
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,400
I will find them and have
them judged in a court of law!

796
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,796
Mom.

797
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,876
Ma'am. Ma'am!

798
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,680
Choi Yu-jin isn't the type to
get blood on her own hands.
