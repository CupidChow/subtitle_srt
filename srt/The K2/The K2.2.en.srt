(The K2)

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,280
What is it?

8
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,760
What's up with her?

9
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,156
Is this girl really the
daughter of Um Hye-rin?

10
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,796
What caused Um Hye-rin's death?

11
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,400
Is it true that Um Hye-rin was murdered?

12
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,160
You must be scared. But Anna?

13
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,360
Your name is Anna, right?

14
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,956
You should say yes.

15
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,440
You can't act that way.

16
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,440
Okay.

17
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,516
Anna, can you tell this man

18
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,120
what happened yesterday?

19
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,716
I don't know.

20
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,036
Come on.

21
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,916
You said some things earlier.

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,036
Tell the truth.

23
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,320
Detective, you can't act
like that. Please leave.

24
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,876
Doctor.

25
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,076
The early stage of
investigation is key to this crime.

26
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,916
It's easy to wipe away a child's memories,

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,036
so if we don't get her testimony early,

28
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,000
it may not be possible
for her to testify later.

29
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,120
(Sleep Aid)

30
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,356
This child just lost her mother.

31
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,360
She's lost her whole world.

32
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,280
I made Mom die.

33
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,436
What did you say?

34
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,440
Tell me again what you just said.

35
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,556
I killed Mom.

36
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,360
I said, I killed Mom.

37
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,440
Turn off the headlights!

38
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,240
-Please get out!
-Why isn't she moving?

39
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,036
Look. My muse.

40
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,876
-Your muse?
-Right, just look at that girl.

41
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,276
Let's go. She's okay.

42
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,636
-You have two muses right here.
-Let's go and party.

43
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,640
Just wait a second.

44
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,080
I didn't kill her.

45
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,920
I didn't kill her.

46
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,080
You were very surprised, weren't you?

47
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,080
Let's go. What a wretched car.

48
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,000
Wretched car.

49
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
I didn't kill her.

50
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,560
I didn't kill her.

51
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
(Episode 2)

52
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,680
(Toilet)

53
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,796
Since when has military reserve training

54
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,916
gotten so rigorous?

55
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,436
So you didn't know.

56
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,396
The guys in North Korea
are trying so desperately

57
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,996
to get nuclear weapons,

58
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,560
and it's all because
of our reserve forces.

59
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,076
Come out already.

60
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,960
Got it, pal.

61
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,720
Wait, my uniform. Huh?

62
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,320
Darn it, I hung it right here.

63
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,880
So you're saying you couldn't
catch that banner hanger?

64
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,400
I'm sorry.

65
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,036
It can't be helped.

66
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,676
People live according to their ability.

67
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,160
I see that was the extent of your ability.

68
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,240
Very well.

69
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,716
You worked hard.

70
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,316
Ma'am, I'll definitely find the guy.

71
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,996
Please give me just a little more time.

72
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,196
A little more...

73
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,400
A little more, you say.

74
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,796
A little more time passes,

75
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,196
and that guy could meet with the press.

76
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,036
A little more time passes,

77
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,516
he could meet with one
of the other candidates

78
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,880
and turn his life around.

79
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,280
A little more time?

80
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm sorry.

81
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,076
Ma'am, I know this is presumptuous,

82
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,080
but may I say something?

83
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,480
Nothing of the sort will happen.

84
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,556
How can you confirm that, Chief?

85
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,156
That guy was under me

86
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,756
when I was in the special forces.

87
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,996
From the start, he was someone

88
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,160
impossible for JSS to capture.

89
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,636
So it's not that JSS is incompetent.

90
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,196
It's that the guy is just too good?

91
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,956
It may sound like an
excuse, but it's true.

92
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,436
When he was unfairly
dishonorably discharged

93
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,956
from the special forces,

94
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,556
he joined the private
military company Blackstone

95
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,120
and has been active as an elite combatant.

96
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,236
Blackstone? An elite combatant?

97
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,236
-A private military company?
-Yes.

98
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,036
They're thriving businesses
that serve as military proxies

99
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,796
in war zones all over the world.

100
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,076
The guy we're discussing worked in Iraq

101
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,000
as a top-of-the-line mercenary.

102
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,916
So someone could have hired him and...

103
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,560
That's not it.

104
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,596
You're that certain?

105
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,196
He's living on the run now.

106
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,196
On the run?

107
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,676
Due to a certain incident at Blackstone,

108
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,596
he ended up on the run.

109
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,916
He's also wanted by Interpol.

110
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,916
There are rumors he went
over to the Islamic State,

111
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,556
but as for his hiding within Korea,

112
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,520
I just found out myself
from the surveillance footage.

113
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,916
Never mind.

114
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,356
Anyway, the conclusion is

115
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,080
that JSS wasn't able to handle this.

116
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,436
That's not the case, ma'am.

117
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,036
Where in the world is a
man who can survive bullets?

118
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,036
With my own hands, I'll...

119
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,836
Can you interpret the
situation? As head of JSS?

120
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,996
What?

121
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,876
I'll definitely find him and...

122
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,596
Secretary Kim.

123
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,956
Yes, ma'am?

124
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,796
If he gives you a report
of the guy's whereabouts,

125
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,996
get rid of the guy yourself.

126
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,880
Understood.

127
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,476
Ma'am.

128
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,156
Please give us just one more chance.

129
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,916
It would be a waste to
just throw that guy away.

130
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,356
If we could get him working for us...

131
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,636
Chief Ju.

132
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,436
Yes?

133
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,396
Just do a good job of
protecting Assemblyman Jang.

134
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,880
I was rather disappointed yesterday.

135
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,360
Assemblyman Jang is coming down soon.

137
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,836
-Yes.
-Right.

138
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,640
You two can leave now.

139
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,200
Hi.

140
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,400
Yes, yes. Please rest.

141
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,556
Well, well. Why the long faces?

142
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,120
Have things gone wrong since morning?

143
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,160
What? Is it because of me?

144
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,076
No.

145
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,240
I don't think that's an honest "no."

146
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,036
Ease up on the frowns.

147
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,120
This sort of thing has happened before.

148
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,120
He's so shameless.

149
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,636
If we're no longer a couple

150
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,640
and are working partners in name only,

151
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,716
shouldn't he at least
say a word of apology

152
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,760
at times like this?

153
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,720
Are you still...

154
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,640
Upset over incidents like this?

155
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,560
Upset?

156
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,196
That banner hanger is a dangerous person,

157
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,040
so be careful when you get rid of him.

158
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,920
Don't worry.

159
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,276
And also...

160
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,000
What now?

161
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,640
There's been an issue with Anna.

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,156
Anna?

163
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,036
But I heard they caught her last night.

164
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,600
Yes, but...

165
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,396
A rather worrisome issue
cropped up last night...

166
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,760
What is it?

167
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,876
What's this?

168
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,316
As she ran away in the street,
it seems she drew attention,

169
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,516
and her photo was taken
and uploaded on social media.

170
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,596
-Then hurry and...-But
the one who uploaded it

171
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,956
was Jean-Paul Lafeit.

172
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,600
What? Jean-Paul Lafeit...

173
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,076
The designer Paul Lafeit?

174
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,996
Many Internet users

175
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,036
are already trying to
discover Anna's identity,

176
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,760
as she's been nicknamed
"Paul Lafeit's angel."

177
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,556
Please don't worry too much.

178
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,836
Whatever happens, we'll
prevent any outside access.

179
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,360
Prevent it?

180
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,476
I'm hearing the noises again.

181
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,120
Why is everything going like this?

182
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,360
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,796
How will you stop this?

184
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,556
If Jean-Paul Lafeit is looking for her,

185
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,156
all the paparazzi and reporters in Europe

186
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,120
will be looking for her
with their eyes lit up.

187
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,160
I...

188
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,240
At this point, just...

189
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,836
If we just set up the
perfect fake accident...

190
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,160
Are you crazy?

191
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,156
Anna is the only way

192
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,356
I maintain any control over Jang Se-jun.

193
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,356
If something happens to
her, an accident or whatever,

194
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,040
do you think I'll be able to
keep Jang Se-jun in check?

195
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,080
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,280
Right.

197
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,640
It would be better to keep
her where I can see her.

198
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,480
What?

199
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,400
Bring Anna here immediately.

200
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,916
But if that girl comes,

201
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,516
it will affect your nerves even more...

202
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,956
The election is right around the corner.

203
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,036
Is this the time to worry about my nerves?

204
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,560
Move quickly.

205
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,880
Yes.

206
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,960
They look alike.

207
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,956
What's the schedule for today?

208
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,956
Right.

209
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,756
Well...In the morning there's a
meeting with students' parents.

210
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,876
A lunch with Assemblymen
developing traditional markets.

211
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,556
In the afternoon, a meeting
with press center reporters.

212
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,236
In the evening, a meeting with
the junior faction in Yeouido.

213
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,716
-And also...-Wow,
this might kill a person.

214
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,716
Right. They're all events
that you must attend.

215
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,876
Okay, okay.

216
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,036
Chief Ju.

217
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,996
Yes, Assemblyman?

218
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,920
Do you have a cigarette?

219
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,316
Pull over in a quiet place.

220
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,880
Understood.

221
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,120
Where will our Assemblyman
go to cause trouble today?

222
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,236
Sir.

223
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,316
Your security is maintained in this car.

224
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,840
And those guys can be trusted, too.

225
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,756
-You can speak freely...-Wait, so...

226
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,476
When have you ever been betrayed

227
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,560
by someone who couldn't be trusted?

228
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,076
-Secretary Seong.
-Yes?

229
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,080
You get out, too, and have a smoke.

230
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,480
Yes. Understood.

231
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,196
You know why he's
acting so sensitive, right?

232
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,920
Yes.

233
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
What's happening with Anna?

234
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,000
She's safely returned to Korea.

235
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
I know that as well.

236
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,916
She's the same as always.

237
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,840
She still has social phobia.

238
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,040
If you would meet with her...

239
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,316
You know.

240
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,720
You know I can't do that right now.

241
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,280
I'm a pathetic dad, right?

242
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,516
Chief Ju.

243
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,036
Yes?

244
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,080
You're loyal to my wife as well.

245
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,000
But I'm the one who will become president.

246
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,796
Of course.

247
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,200
I'll be the one to appoint you
as head of Blue House security.

248
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,076
Until then,

249
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,996
you're the only one I can ask

250
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
to take care of Anna.

251
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,516
No matter how little fatherly love I have,

252
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,436
and no matter how
much that girl hates me...

253
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,716
I know those things,

254
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,916
but that girl's past is the reason

255
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,880
why I can do nothing but
live as Choi Yu-jin's puppet.

256
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,516
But go to that woman

257
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,160
and convey my message.

258
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,876
Should the hostage die,

259
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,720
the hostage taker will die as well.

260
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,836
If something happens to the girl,

261
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,440
everything Choi Yu-jin
has planned all her life

262
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,600
will come crumbling down in an instant.

263
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,360
I won't tell her that.

264
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,996
And no matter what,

265
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,240
I will protect Anna.

266
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,000
Thanks.

267
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,840
For goodness' sake.

268
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,560
Why is this truck
going crazy. Seriously...

269
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,600
Do you know something?

270
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,880
If you don't, just go.

271
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,996
You should call your insurance company.

272
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,956
If I had insurance, would I be doing this?

273
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,036
Or call a tow truck.

274
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,676
If I had money for a tow truck,

275
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,596
I would've bought insurance.

276
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,120
Exactly.

277
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,036
Sir, please give me gloves.

278
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,996
Do you really know something?

279
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,116
You won't just make it worse?

280
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,840
As if there's a way to
make it worse, right?

281
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,676
Please give me those.

282
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,440
Here.

283
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,640
Right.

284
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,076
Hello, Commissioner.

285
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Oh, hello.

286
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,996
You should've suggested
meeting up outside.

287
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,796
Why did you personally honor
me with your presence here?

288
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,080
Because you're busy.

289
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,160
Ah! Look, look.

290
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,756
This guy is a real lowlife.

291
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,556
We absolutely must catch him.

292
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,676
We don't know where he ran off to.

293
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,796
Oh, come on now.

294
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,636
In a case like this,

295
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,836
first you need to fill out a report,

296
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,036
then get a warrant issued
and put him on the wanted list.

297
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,076
Seriously...

298
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,436
Shall I call in the head
of civil complaints?

299
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,596
Are you nuts?

300
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,280
Would I be here if I could do that?

301
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,316
Hey, pal. Look.

302
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,036
Look.

303
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,796
Think of this as free insurance

304
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,596
that I'm offering to help you out.

305
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,596
What?

306
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,556
What do you think is the likelihood

307
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,600
of my candidate making
it into the Blue House?

308
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,800
I'm not sure.

309
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,756
Even with high public awareness,

310
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,916
he's not affiliated with a party, so...

311
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,396
Right.

312
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,120
But someone in a high
place is thinking differently.

313
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,516
The candidate Jang Se-jun

314
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,236
is probably going to shed
his independent status.

315
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,000
So he'll join a party...

316
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,760
This is absolutely confidential.

317
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,160
Now what do you think
is the likelihood he'll win?

318
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,920
He'll have public popularity
and party power combined.

319
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,836
So...

320
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,680
Wouldn't it be good for you
to acquire some insurance?

321
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
How shall I be of assistance?

322
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,160
Oh, wait. Wait.

323
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,036
Hold on. Hold on.

324
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,036
Careful, careful.

325
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,676
Run along.

326
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,196
Do you have a brush cutter somewhere?

327
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,756
-A brush cutter?
-Yes.

328
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,076
What would you do with it?

329
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,676
Well, I could get rid
of some weeds for you.

330
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,076
Don't, don't. I have no money.

331
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,080
I won't take any pay.

332
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,556
Is it in the storage room?
It must be over there.

333
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,320
I said not to do any work!

334
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,716
Since I'll give you a
meal like I promised,

335
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,680
sleep over there, and leave tomorrow.

336
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,720
It's not opening up.

337
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,396
Wait just a little bit.

338
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,640
It'll definitely open for you.

339
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,280
Oh? A signal is coming in.

340
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,356
What are you doing?

341
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,956
Find him right away, punks.

342
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,280
Yes.

343
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,720
Excuse me.

344
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,996
Your companion should
probably eat as well.

345
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,916
Don't wake her up until we arrive.

346
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,276
Ah...yes...

347
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,916
She drank too much yesterday.

348
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,720
Yes, I see. Please stay comfortable.

349
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,040
Anna, put on your clothes.

350
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Your dad is waiting for you.

351
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,640
Dad?

352
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,876
You have to drink this.
It prevents carsickness.

353
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
What about Dad?

354
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,156
If you drink this, your dad will come.

355
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,080
You're lying.

356
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,956
Yeah. I'm lying.

357
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,636
Your dad won't come now.

358
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,916
I want to go to Dad.

359
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,040
Take me to Dad.

360
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,356
Sorry.

361
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,760
This is all we have.

362
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,720
We eat to live.

363
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,760
It's okay.

364
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,356
Sorry.

365
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,280
For getting mad at you earlier.

366
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,956
Ah! I found him.

367
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,316
What?

368
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,440
Where?

369
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,956
Here.

370
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,036
When was this?

371
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,156
This morning.

372
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,200
But he went into the
restroom and then disappeared.

373
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,080
So he changed clothes.

374
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,156
Trace all the men

375
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,676
who came out of there.

376
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,080
Yes!

377
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,316
Hey, punk.

378
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,040
Save my skin here.

379
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,036
What?

380
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,636
It's a minefield.

381
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,360
Everyone get off.

382
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,396
What?

383
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,596
I can't walk.

384
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,640
Hey. Listen, man. He saved my life.

385
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,996
Hey. We're entering
the civilian territory.

386
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,996
We have to take a detour.

387
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,236
I cannot walk anymore.

388
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,836
I'm dying of pain.

389
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,436
We can't risk hurting civilians.

390
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,560
I'm a civilian, too!

391
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,880
Double.

392
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,716
-What?
-I'm going to pay you

393
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,996
double the amount you get paid here.

394
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,680
Just go.

395
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,996
No.

396
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,760
Three times!

397
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,680
Back off.

398
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,760
What about you?

399
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,600
Would you like a sip?

400
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,960
Today is the 49th day
after our son's death.

401
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,440
We were just on our
way back from the temple.

402
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,916
The fruit trees are just
like kids themselves.

403
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,520
Now that our son who
took care of them is gone...

404
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,076
They all became overgrown.

405
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,516
It'll be peaceful now.

406
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,556
Since they don't have an owner now,

407
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,400
I'll cut them all down and burn them.

408
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,996
Look.

409
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,400
Can you help cut these down?

410
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,516
You mean it?

411
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,076
Yes, cut them all down.

412
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,120
It'll be hard to do with my own hands.

413
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,760
Very well.

414
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,600
Okay.

415
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,076
I feel so refreshed.

416
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,716
Then I'll ask you to do this tomorrow.

417
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,640
I'll be sure to pay you.

418
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,076
This is refreshing.

419
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,480
This is so refreshing!

420
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,956
Okay, okay. Let's get our spirits up.

421
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,796
Let's go for it.

422
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,876
Good, good. This guy needs to be caught.

423
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,116
If you're tired, how will you catch him?

424
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,800
Open your eyes just a bit
wider, and let's catch him, okay?

425
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,240
Right.

426
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,720
Cut them all down.

427
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,360
Sir. Sir!

428
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,080
We found him.

429
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,440
What?

430
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,120
You found him?

431
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,000
If you want to stay
here, you can stay longer.

432
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,160
Well, if you'll hang onto
me, I guess I can stay longer.

433
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,760
-This is delicious.
-Yeah.

434
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,316
This belonged to our dead son.

435
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,596
If you're okay with it,

436
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,480
you can wear it while you work.

437
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,840
I'm sure it'll fit me perfectly.

438
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,760
Thank you.

439
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,000
Sir!

440
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,316
Are there more brush cutter blades?

441
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,316
I don't think so.

442
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,000
Then I'll go buy some.

443
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,996
Does she have any difficulties...

444
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,040
No, she just drank a lot yesterday.

445
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,920
If you need assistance, please speak up.

446
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,840
No. What are you doing?

447
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,916
Okay.

448
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,120
I'll ask you one more time.

449
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,076
Where is this guy?

450
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,200
I don't know.

451
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,720
He left this morning.

452
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,876
Okay then.

453
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,800
If you don't know, it can't be helped.

454
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,640
No! What are you doing?

455
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,916
No, no!

456
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,840
Don't! Don't! Don't!

457
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:08,080
No. No, no!

458
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,600
Hey! Who sent you?

459
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,436
I wish that

460
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,080
I could tell you.

461
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,440
Right, everyone says that.

462
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,916
None of this is personal.

463
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,080
I'm just doing this to make a living.

464
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,516
We're professionals.

465
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,036
Hey. I'm sorry, too. It's
not personal for me, either.

466
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,920
I'm doing this to make a living as well.

467
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,440
You and I are both professionals.

468
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,800
So let's be understanding.

469
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,440
Even if I don't kill you,
you're already a dead man.

470
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,716
That's right.

471
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,956
I've been a dead man for a long time.

472
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,036
But as for you, punk...

473
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,400
I understand you are trying to kill me.

474
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,516
But to do that to the old man and lady...

475
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,436
Whew.

476
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,916
I really don't get what
you intended to do.

477
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,480
What do you mean?

478
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,996
Are you saying that

479
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,400
I was going to kill
those old people for fun?

480
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,476
Everyone who hides
you in the future as well

481
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,400
will end up dead.

482
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,880
That's the order I received.

483
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,996
In the end, those people

484
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,040
will end up dead because of you.

485
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,240
Fine.

486
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,516
You can say who sent you right now,

487
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,076
or in 10 minutes. No difference to me.

488
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,080
I don't really like noise.

489
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,320
I'll start now.

490
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,840
Who is it?

491
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,320
Ma'am.

492
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,600
Have you eaten?

493
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,880
You're all grown up.

494
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,240
You're pretty. You take after your mom.

495
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,240
Devil.

496
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,036
Who?

497
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,756
Me?

498
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,840
Why?

499
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,436
It won't do to act that
way towards the person

500
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,116
who raised your abnormal self.

501
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,236
Think of what you did

502
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,040
to a nine-year-old child who knew nothing.

503
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,440
Were you upset?

504
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,720
So that was it.

505
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,396
Still, what can be done?
You ought to understand.

506
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,840
I did everything for your
and your dad's sakes.

507
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,120
I remembered everything.

508
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,720
My mom didn't commit suicide.

509
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,040
Exactly...

510
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,960
You should have just become a nun.

511
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,160
Right.

512
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,320
I think a meal might be too much.

513
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,956
What a shame that I
can't see you eating well.

514
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,720
I even went to special trouble cooking.

515
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,036
She doesn't seem interested in eating yet.

516
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,076
Take her upstairs.

517
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,600
Yes, ma'am.

518
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,036
Oh, that was a shock.

519
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,120
You should have let me know you were here.

520
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,200
Wow.

521
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,800
You're more handsome than I expected.

522
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,240
You're that banner hanger, right?

523
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,240
I'd imagined a rough face.

524
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,400
You successfully made it inside here.

525
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,440
I really didn't know you'd
appear in front of me.

526
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,156
I came to warn you.

527
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,200
Me and the people around me...

528
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,080
Leave us alone.

529
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,436
And if I don't?

530
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,236
If you don't,

531
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,756
no matter where you are,

532
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,076
I'll find you.

533
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,716
Our first meeting ends with a warning,

534
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,040
but when I come to see you again,

535
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,520
you'll end up dead.

536
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,236
You're just like Chief Ju said.

537
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,036
What did he say?

538
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,480
Ah. You strike the heart?

539
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,916
If you're attacked,

540
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,040
you learn to go after
the source of the attack?

541
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,480
Knowing that about you,

542
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,760
it's quite easy to catch you.

543
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,076
I'm sorry.

544
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,236
You were in the wrong
place at the wrong time

545
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,996
and saw something you shouldn't have.

546
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,996
So it can't be helped.

547
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,560
Is this your way of loving
your cheating husband?

548
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,556
Love...

549
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,276
What an easy thing.

550
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,516
Thinking that two people
chasing the exact same goal

551
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,356
can love each other...

552
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,120
I envy you.

553
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:52,480
Speaking of which, I'm
curious about something.

554
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,436
Why did you come here?

555
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,076
I don't really understand

556
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,396
why you'd come here to attack the source.

557
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,480
Because you're someone who runs away.

558
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,920
You could have just lived
your whole life on the run.

559
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,320
Because I can't allow

560
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,440
innocent people to die because of me.

561
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,000
Innocent people?

562
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,280
The owners of that orchard?

563
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,716
Didn't you meet them for
the first time yesterday?

564
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,360
And yet...

565
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,276
You took this risk
because of those people?

566
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,996
Really?

567
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,920
You say that's your reason?

568
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,160
You people wouldn't know.

569
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,840
Since it's a reason
you'd forgotten long ago.

570
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,916
Since when people fight
in a war for a long time,

571
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,040
they forget the reason

572
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,520
they're at war in the first place.

573
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,600
It's a shame.

574
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,920
You're quite a fine person.

575
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,876
If we had met at a better time,

576
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,000
and under better circumstances,

577
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,236
we could have become friends.

578
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,916
Don't lay a hand on those people.

579
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,276
Do the orchard owners really know nothing?

580
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,160
Yes. They know nothing.

581
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,120
Fine.

582
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,840
For some reason, I
think I can believe you.

583
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,160
I got it. I'll trust you.

584
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,796
But as for sparing those people...

585
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,600
I don't think it's possible.

586
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,120
Stop.

587
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,396
This isn't a toy gun.

588
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,276
Because there's a difference

589
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,436
between believing what you say

590
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,680
and staking my fate on your words.

591
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,320
You...

592
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,640
You'll soon regret this.

593
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,996
You shouldn't have given warnings

594
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,720
at our first meeting.

595
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:17,040
Because we won't be meeting a second time.

596
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,876
Take him away.

597
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,916
And...

598
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,920
Make it painless.

599
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,760
Well, you're working hard.

600
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,396
Hello.

601
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,800
What brings you here?

602
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,476
Well, this guy

603
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,116
stole a delivery man's motorbike

604
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,956
and fled the scene.

605
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,520
But someone said the
motorbike came over this way.

606
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,440
-This way?
-Yes.

607
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,836
They must have been mistaken.

608
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,956
That's what I'm saying.

609
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,316
If that thief had come this way,

610
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,876
he would've had the worst luck ever.

611
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,756
This place is like a tiger's den.

612
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,916
Oh? I think that's it.

613
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Huh?

614
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,600
Just a moment.

615
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,160
Let me get the license number.

616
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,160
Hold on.

617
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,036
Right, 3812.

618
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,196
No, no. 38 in front.

619
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,956
Then comes 12.3812.

620
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,200
Right.

621
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,560
Yeah? It's a match?

622
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,076
Oh, my.

623
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,916
It's the same number
as the stolen motorbike.

624
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,440
I said let's go.

625
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,196
Wait. Is something going on?

626
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,120
No, what would happen?

627
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,640
No, no, something happened.

628
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,836
Hey, there's a rat in the garage.

629
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,996
All of you go and catch it.

630
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,516
Rats got into the house?

631
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,516
That's a big problem.

632
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,396
Would you get going already?

633
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,116
What? Go? Where?

634
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,636
I have to keep an eye on the scene.

635
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,636
What did you say?

636
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,956
If we find a motorbike that was stolen,

637
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,076
the identification team
comes to find fingerprints,

638
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,036
and that way, we can catch the thief.

639
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,556
We do scientific
investigations now as well.

640
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,680
It's not like the old days.

641
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,196
And as the first to
discover the motorbike,

642
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,040
I have a duty to keep an eye on the scene.

643
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,000
What on earth?

644
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,960
What mayhem.

645
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,400
On account of one little rat,
they're destroying the house.

646
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,400
Where?

647
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,320
Got it. I'll go there now.

648
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,080
This is the second
meeting I mentioned to you.

649
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,040
Shoot!

650
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,600
Shoot!

651
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,960
Shoot!

652
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,840
Help me.

653
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,400
Save me.

654
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,000
Save me.

655
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,520
Shoot! Shoot!

656
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,480
(The K2)

657
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,516
If you were tending to
your unwell wife all night,

658
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,836
shouldn't you look like this?

659
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:43,280
I will win this fight, everyone!

660
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,440
Don't lay a hand on the people around me.

661
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,720
It's dangerous to go home right now.

662
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,000
The brakes aren't working.

663
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,000
It looks like someone
else wanted to kill you, too.
