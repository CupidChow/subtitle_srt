1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,040
(The K2)

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,880
(Ji Chang-wook)

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,120
(Song Yoon-a)

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,080
(Im Yoon-a)

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,520
(Cho Seong-ha)

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,080
(The K2)

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,276
(Previously)

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,956
I was falsely accused of murdering Rania

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,320
and arrested by the
police, but fortunately,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,040
I was able to escape within a week.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,276
(He met the girl Anna)

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,200
Save me.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,720
Don't go...

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,680
Don't lay a hand on the people around me.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,596
The brakes aren't working.

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,356
(He is caught up in
danger along with Yu-jin...

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,800
So there was someone
else who wanted you dead.

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,276
(He saved Yu-jin's life
in a moment of crisis)

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,756
As someone who stayed by
his injured wife's side all night...

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,520
Shouldn't you look mussed up?

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,876
As expected, you're such a
good wife and wise mother.

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Ah...

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,080
Since you have no children,
forget the "wise mother" part.

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,836
A bodyguard?

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,560
I have no loyalty to anyone anymore.

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,520
Not to a nation, and
not to an organization.

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,440
(He encounters Park Gwan-su,
who had caused Rania's death)

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,716
Kim Je-ha?

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,756
So I'd be a puppet of JB Group?

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,880
More like the vassal of an empire.

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,036
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,876
(He fails to get revenge on Park Gwan-su)

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,676
At the right time,

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,516
JSS will become a gun for you.

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,996
You'll become the bullet.

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,396
And I'll pull the trigger.

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,996
I will now introduce the new
VIP team member. Kim Je-ha.

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
His pager code is K2.

39
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,156
What are you looking for?

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,396
(Je-ha's duty is to keep watch over Anna)

41
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,600
What's this?

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,680
Ah, ramen.

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,000
(Je-ha feels sympathy when
he sees Anna's innocence)

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,040
There will be a board meeting
to appoint a new chairman.

45
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,196
Appointing a chairman
in my absence is invalid.

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,640
We'll start by passing a motion
for your dismissal as chairwoman.

47
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,040
But this kid read me.

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,160
He read my mind.

49
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,360
He didn't need my orders or my permission.

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,836
(Yu-jin feels sympathy for Je-ha)

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,720
He wasn't a hunting dog.

52
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,760
He was a wolf.

53
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,600
I won't be able to tame him.

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,916
Let's go to Cloud Nine.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,436
Cloud Nine?

56
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,036
(Je-ha comes to Yu-jin's
secret space, Cloud Nine)

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,956
What is it you really want to hear?

58
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,356
Everything. Now our hunt will begin.

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,160
Is this a good enough reason?

60
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,436
No.

61
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,956
(Anna runs away in
order to meet her father)

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,600
Anna, you can't.

63
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,516
Dad! It seems I've lost my way.

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,160
Dad, come and get me.

65
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,556
Your dad sent me.

66
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Your dad said to give you this.

67
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,196
Really? My dad sent this?

68
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,236
Of course.

69
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,356
It's good.

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,596
Until the ambulance comes,
maintain artificial respiration.

71
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,156
(Je-ha saves Anna when
she is at death's doorstep)

72
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,200
Anna, no. Don't die. Please don't die.

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,080
Your dad will not show up in front of you.

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,996
You must have lived thinking

75
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,236
your dad was everything you had left,

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,840
but you're not everything to him.

77
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,396
Don't cry.

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,356
(Je-ha promises Anna a
meeting with her father)

79
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,000
And wait.

80
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,120
I'll bring your dad to you.

81
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,596
Jang Se-jun! Jang Se-jun!

82
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,356
Gosh.

83
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,756
Those kids. I said to throw a couple eggs.

84
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,080
Why throw so many?

85
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,000
Get dressed. You need
to get out of here quick.

86
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,596
A trap?

87
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,000
Those two are teamed up.

88
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,796
Promise that you'll
protect Anna to the end.

89
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,036
Right.

90
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,600
I promise.

91
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,916
(Due to Yu-jin's surveillance,
Se-jun can't be honest with Anna)

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,560
I missed you, Dad.

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,996
To think that I placed my fate

94
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,040
in the hands of a man like you.

95
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,160
(Episode 8)

96
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,880
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

97
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,396
You go home first with Mi-ran.

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,516
No, how could I do that?

99
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,356
It's okay. This afternoon,
she's going to the safe house.

100
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,360
So you go first to get things ready.

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,236
Yes. That would be better.

102
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,596
Let's go back.

103
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,396
You, too? You should be here.

104
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,036
That's all right. I'll handle things.

105
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,956
If I need anyone,
there are lots of people.

106
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,396
Yes, there are plenty of people.

107
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,796
Let's go.

108
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,116
You just can't get a grip.

109
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,836
Okay. Then I'll go and get things ready.

110
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,760
-Right.
-Work hard.

111
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,956
This afternoon, you'll be
heading to a safe house.

112
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,400
If you need anything
until then, let me know.

113
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,280
You don't need anything?

114
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,036
Okay, got it.

115
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,676
If there's nothing, never mind.

116
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,320
Why?

117
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,000
Why did you bring my dad to me?

118
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,876
So you wouldn't die.

119
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,240
What does it matter
to you if I die or not?

120
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,796
Do you know how many people
are agonizing over you right now?

121
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,240
Agonizing?

122
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,080
That's true.

123
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,036
Sorry.

124
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,636
For making villains like
you agonize over me.

125
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,516
That's right. We're villains.

126
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,676
We're villains who confine
you and keep watch over you.

127
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,916
However, I wish you would realize

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,956
that we're also trying
hard to protect you.

129
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,116
Preparing ramen for
me, giving me ice cream,

130
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,760
acting like my dad...That's protecting me?

131
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,080
Forget it. Just leave.

132
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,080
Okay.

133
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,440
I really...

134
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,120
I really made a pointless
promise to your dad.

135
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,200
Promise?

136
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,236
We're here.

137
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,560
How on earth are you handling security?

138
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,880
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,356
I was negligent. I
will take responsibility.

140
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,276
Responsibility? How?

141
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,240
I will step down.

142
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,036
Step down?

143
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,236
Do you not know what that means?

144
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,756
Don't you know how it
works to step down here?

145
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,800
I'll do as you order.

146
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,800
Okay.

147
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,956
What about those other people?

148
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,956
The police are pretending
to investigate them, but...

149
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,196
But?

150
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,236
Well...

151
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,516
As for the ones who tried
to kill Assemblyman Jang,

152
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,516
that backstabbing woman

153
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,276
has accused Assemblyman Jang

154
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,596
of sexually assaulting her,

155
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,520
so the police want a cross-examination...

156
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,996
Okay.

157
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,156
Just have them released
without being charged.

158
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,120
We'll deal with them once they're out.

159
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,040
Secretary Kim.

160
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,036
Yes?

161
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,236
In particular, the traitor bodyguard

162
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,036
needs to be disposed of.

163
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,280
That will prevent anyone
else from following his lead.

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,196
Chase him to the ends
of the earth if necessary.

165
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,476
Yes. I'll carry out your orders.

166
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,040
Park Gwan-su.

167
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,996
I demand an immediate investigation

168
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,116
by the prosecution
of the financial sectors

169
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,916
that are arousing suspicion.

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,560
Don't worry.

171
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,316
Jang Se-jun is putting on a show.

172
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,036
Touch us, and he'll...

173
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,000
He's not here. You can't go in there!

174
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,476
For violating financial laws on
transaction and foreign exchange,

175
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,036
and due to suspicion that
you created a secret slush fund,

176
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,876
we are placing both of you under arrest.

177
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,516
You have the right to remain silent.

178
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,076
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

179
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,600
You have the right to consult an attorney.

180
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,396
Let's go.

181
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,760
Dang it!

182
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,080
What is it?

183
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,956
We are now commencing search and seizure.

184
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,876
Everyone keep your hands off.

185
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,636
Hey, you there!

186
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,160
Hands off.

187
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,800
We are carrying out official duties.

188
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,236
He's coming!

189
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,280
He's here!

190
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,916
Assemblyman Jang, a word, please.

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,036
Are you confident about the
prosecution's investigation?

192
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,596
Are you confident about the
results of the investigation?

193
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,996
Everyone, you're working
hard early in the morning.

194
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,596
I will faithfully undergo investigation

195
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,400
and alleviate the worries of the citizens.

196
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,396
Please give another comment.

197
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,196
Please give another comment!

198
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,600
-Assemblyman Jang.
-How are you feeling right now?

199
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,796
Welcome. Please come this way.

200
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,000
Right.

201
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,676
Ah, by the way.

202
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,036
We aren't here to forcibly
carry out a search warrant.

203
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,796
We're on a business
outing at the residence

204
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,996
of Assemblyman Jang,
who's fully cooperating,

205
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,076
so mind your manners.

206
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,076
-Yes.
-Yes.

207
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,716
Oh, my. You're here?

208
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,400
Ma'am.

209
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,960
You're here to greet us.

210
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,516
I'm sorry for suddenly
causing you such a bother.

211
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,436
No, it's not a bother.

212
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,036
You're conducting your official duties.

213
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
Please feel free to come in.

214
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,996
To start with, we packed
up everything we could.

215
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,956
If you need more, go ahead and search.

216
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,676
Dear me. Why do our job yourself?

217
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,596
Oh, right. Have you all had breakfast?

218
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,356
I prepared some light
sandwiches in the dining area.

219
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,996
I made a lot of them,

220
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,040
so eat those as you do your work.

221
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,956
Well, thank you.

222
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,756
Hey, boys. Go have a bite.

223
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,756
Your cooking is so famous.

224
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,880
You all should be honored.

225
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,076
This is embarrassing.

226
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,356
Thank you.

227
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,040
Please come this way.

228
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,596
I've prepared something for
you in my study. Go ahead.

229
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,080
Shall I?

230
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,916
This study is just like you.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,076
Graceful and refined.

232
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,996
Is that so? Thank you.

233
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,156
Please eat.

234
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,800
Thank you.

235
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,756
Is your investigation of the
financial group going well?

236
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,080
Oh, dear. It's so...

237
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,716
About that...

238
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,316
I know that the group is
owned by your blood relatives.

239
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,996
The higher-ups are pushing
hard on this investigation,

240
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,076
so there's not much I can do for you...

241
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,600
I'd like you to conduct
an impartial investigation.

242
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,760
Pardon?

243
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,036
Think of the determination
of those higher-ups

244
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,800
as being my determination as well.

245
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,356
Ah...Very well.

246
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,800
I'll do my utmost.

247
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,400
The recipient cannot be reached...

248
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,676
You still can't get in touch with
the president's Chief of Staff?

249
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,240
As expected. This is so like Choi Yu-jin.

250
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,596
My dear in-law.

251
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,396
This is no time for laughter.

252
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,800
What will I do if I don't laugh?

253
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,716
She's going after her own uncle like this.

254
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,716
It's us.

255
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,636
She can go after him
because he's small fry.

256
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,036
But if she touches me
or my son-in-law Choi,

257
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,036
it would basically mean
giving up on the election.

258
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,916
How would there be funding
for the presidential race?

259
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,076
She can't go that route.

260
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,036
She's always had a strong personality.

261
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,076
When she loses her head,

262
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,156
she's willing to walk through fire.

263
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,036
The problem is what
happens after the election.

264
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,956
If we can't find a safe ally by then,

265
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,836
on the day she and her
husband enter the Blue House,

266
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,120
we could end up in real danger.

267
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,876
A large-scale investigation
has been launched

268
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,796
to examine suspicions
surrounding six major

269
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,036
financial groups and
financial conglomerates.

270
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,156
Also, starting with the
voluntary investigation

271
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,596
on Assemblyman Jang,
who has no party affiliation,

272
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,196
the prosecution is currently
conducting internal probes

273
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,276
of numerous politicians in both
ruling and opposition parties.

274
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,956
The public is watching
to see if this investigation

275
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,916
will signal overall investigation
of the political realm.

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,520
Next up...

277
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,116
All but the international group
are our sponsor companies.

278
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,040
What about the internal probe?

279
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,240
It's okay. Go ahead.

280
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,236
Our allies being probed are
Assemblymen Kim, Heo, and Song.

281
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,760
What?

282
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,396
It's clearly a targeted
investigation ordered by someone.

283
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,116
Well, I expected this,
but it hurts to be right.

284
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,160
If this happens, the Assemblymen
on our side will be in a frenzy.

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,356
Could you give us some privacy?

286
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,880
Yes. Please call me when
you're finished talking.

287
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,956
Min-cheol.

288
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,116
Is Jang Se-jun lucky?

289
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,796
Or are we unlucky?

290
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,996
I'm sorry to say this,

291
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,036
but I think Assemblyman Jang
has someone special on his side.

292
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,996
Someone special?

293
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,040
The one who tried to commit
an act of terror against you...

294
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,040
The revolving door incident?

295
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,436
-Prosecutor.
-Prosecutor.

296
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,436
Please step back.

297
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,356
Please give a comment.

298
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,240
Has any evidence come to light?

299
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,280
Please stand back.

300
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,956
Chief of Staff Park, will
you really be this way?

301
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,036
Sir.

302
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,036
Don't act this way toward
me when I can't do anything.

303
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,556
Wouldn't it work better for
you to mend your relations

304
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,676
with those in high places?

305
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,036
Chief of Staff Park.

306
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,396
The president's term
is still far from over.

307
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,596
You should be smart about this.

308
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,756
Have you gone blind
looking back on last year?

309
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,636
As if that would happen.

310
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,996
I'm just hoping everything will
go smoothly and reasonably...

311
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,396
Was it Presidential Secretary
Kim who gave the order?

312
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,156
Yeah, I knew this would happen. I knew it.

313
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,156
Fine!

314
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,956
Then you can wait

315
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,996
until the next order is given, right?

316
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,876
Well, it's not like a whole new
investigation is being launched.

317
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,236
Anyway, it'll be within
two nights and three days.

318
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,556
Keeping your hands off any
of our Assemblymen until then

319
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,076
will be good for you.

320
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,036
Since I'll be the one
to give the next order!

321
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,480
Goodbye!

322
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,920
I mean, these people right now...

323
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,716
What happened with
the police investigation?

324
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,516
Well...

325
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,676
They said it'd be tricky to get
tangled up with Jang Se-jun...

326
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,560
You moron!

327
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,920
-I'm sorry.
-Geez...

328
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,276
No, no. This won't do.

329
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,196
I meant to use it in the
final stretch of the election,

330
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,560
but I'll draw my real sword now.

331
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,996
If we add up all the
information we've found so far,

332
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,796
it's clear that the Angel
has appeared in Seochon.

333
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,276
Seochon? Oh my God. That's where I live.

334
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,036
Multiple people also saw
her in Seoul Forest up north.

335
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,796
Let's track this target.

336
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,080
What about Busan?

337
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,236
Photo analysis shows
zero match with Busan.

338
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,600
I see.

339
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,440
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

340
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,116
What about Naegok-dong?

341
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,916
There are no tipoffs in
Naegok-dong except you.

342
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,156
Give up.

343
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh, but I definitely saw her.

344
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,676
Yesterday at the park,

345
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,636
I think Anna was exposed to the public.

346
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,956
Where is Anna now?

347
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,596
She's on her way to the safe house.

348
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,160
What should be done?

349
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,760
Shouldn't you come to
a decision at this point?

350
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,676
That's right. We're villains.

351
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,876
We're villains who confine
you and keep watch over you.

352
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,036
However, I wish you would realize

353
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,880
that we're also trying
hard to protect you.

354
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,520
Anna, wake up!

355
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,640
What promise?

356
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,836
What promise did you make?

357
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,956
Come on. I'm not hard of hearing!

358
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,436
Won't you sit back down?

359
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,116
That's dangerous.

360
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,880
Geez.

361
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,876
Your dad asked me to protect you.

362
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,476
And I promised that I'd do that.

363
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,876
What now?

364
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,316
Anyway, since I made a promise,

365
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,116
I'll protect you in the future.

366
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,356
From now on,

367
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,280
I won't let anyone touch you.

368
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,596
Even if it's Choi Yu-jin.

369
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,796
I never asked you to protect me.

370
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,036
That's right.

371
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,356
Although your dad asked this favor of me,

372
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,836
you're an adult.

373
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,956
If you say you don't
want me to protect you,

374
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,716
I'll stop acting as your
bodyguard anytime.

375
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,080
So if you don't want this,
tell me right away. Got it?

376
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,676
Got it?

377
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,240
I got it.

378
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,760
(#Couldn't this girl be
the angel of Barcelona?)

379
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,956
What are you looking at so intently?

380
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,596
It's that Lafeit angel I told you about.

381
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,036
She must be a Korean.

382
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,956
That does look like her.

383
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,676
But isn't it a little shaky

384
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,876
to use this as the sole
basis for an article?

385
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,276
Still a little shaky, right?

386
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,076
Right.

387
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,640
Work hard.

388
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,036
Thanks.

389
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,000
For doing my dad this favor.

390
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,316
And for bringing my dad to meet me,

391
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,916
so that I could find out he
abandoned me and my mom...

392
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,996
Stop acting like a crybaby.

393
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,876
Because your dad didn't abandon you.

394
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,356
Crybaby?

395
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,916
What do you know, anyway?

396
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,236
My dad abandoned us.

397
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,436
Even when my mom died,

398
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,516
and when I was dragged off to Spain,

399
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,516
he never showed up.

400
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,516
Yeah, that's right.

401
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,996
Your dad is a bad person.
He's a very bad politician.

402
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,876
But if your dad had truly abandoned you,

403
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,880
you wouldn't be alive like this today.

404
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,556
Since Choi Yu-jin isn't the type
to bet her future on bad odds.

405
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,596
So please, at this point,

406
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,520
you need to become an adult.

407
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,200
If you want to fight
Choi Yu-jin and survive.

408
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,556
Huh? I mean, this guy seriously...

409
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,036
Reporter Park, where are you?

410
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,956
If I catch you, you're dead! Come out now!

411
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,836
How could you steal this scoop from me?

412
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,996
I'll be on my way, sir.

413
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,120
-Right. Be careful.
-Yes.

414
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,240
-Get in.
-Why?

415
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,200
The heck?

416
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,800
Hey. What's your deal? Huh?

417
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,040
I just...

418
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,240
I'm sorry.

That's the position Anna is in.

421
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,956
Rather than reveal her to the world,

422
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,160
they'd sooner let her die...

423
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,436
The thing is, if she blabbers,

424

I don't know if Choi
Yu-jin will let her live.

425

What is it? Who was that guy just now?

426
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,800
It was nothing.

427

Okay. Freeze.

428
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,360

-Melt.
-Melt.

Don't you know the freeze-and-melt game?

433
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,196
If I say "freeze," you freeze,

434
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,876
and if I say "melt," you can move.

435

have already surrounded the house.

carefully to what I tell you.

-Yes, ma'am.

Yes, what is there to see?

491
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,156
To start with, shouldn't we silence her?

492
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,636
Yes. I hope that you won't disappoint me.

493
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,996
Right.

494

But ma'am...

495
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,996
Yes?

496
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,236
There's a decision you
must make ahead of time.

497
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,316
What's that?

498
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,956
Depending on the situation,

499
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,916
I'll decide at the scene,

500
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,680
but just in case...

501
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,716
Just in case?

502
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,076
If Anna is exposed to the public,

503
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,916
can I resolve that
first and report it later?

504
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,916
Are you seriously
asking me that right now?

505
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,436
It's much easier to kill her
than to shut everyone up.

506
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,040
Yes. Understood.

507
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,556
But I don't think.

508
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,240
Assemblyman Jang would agree.

509
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,960
Call the leader of the strike team.

510
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,680
Are you trying to bargain
with me right now?

511
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,436
No, that's not it, ma'am.

512
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,796
I'm just rather fearful of doing something

513
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,960
to the daughter of the future president.

514
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,280
Yes, Secretary Kim.

515
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,956
I'm next to him now.

516
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,236
Understood.

517
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,160
I'll be waiting.

518
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,920
I'm the one you should
be afraid of right now.

519
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,680
Of course. If it's an order from you...

520
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,876
Wouldn't I go through hell and high water?

521
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,956
We'll confirm if that's true on-site.

522
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,436
We're leaving now.

523
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,476
Standby is lifted.

524
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,240
-Let's get going.
-Yes.

525
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,116
Yes, I'm here at 3589-1 Naegok-dong.

526
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,240
Please confirm the
real owner of this house.

527
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,516
And dig into her
connection with Eom Hye-rin.

528
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,480
Okay...

529
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,716
What should we do, Chief Ju?

530
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,440
What do you mean? Lock
the door and wait quietly!

531
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,040
Hello? Hello?

532
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,236
Yes, Chief Ju?

533
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,836
The head of JSS is on his way there now.

534
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,640
With a strike team.

535
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,796
Assemblyman Jang is
at the prosecutors' office,

536
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
and I can't make a move.

537
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,396
Sergeant Kim.

538
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,000
Now Anna

539
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,440
is in your hands.

540
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,916
Keep the target from
getting near the media.

541
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,436
In particular, if she tries to
say anything about her father,

542
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,040
at that point you must...

543
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,316
Kill her.

544
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,636
-You understand, right?
-Yes.

545
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,236
We're almost there.

546
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,556
When we get out of the car,

547
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,836
everyone must rapidly move
to their assigned positions.

548
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,160
-Yes.
-Yes.

549
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,596
You wait as close as
possible to the target.

550
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,716
If it's impossible to
stop her from a distance,

551
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,516
eliminate the target at close range.

552
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,316
After elimination, quickly exit the area

553
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,036
and wait at the designated location.

554
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,476
Yes.

555
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,076
If you get caught, you
don't know me. Got it?

556
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,400
Yes.

557
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,916
Okay, get up.

558
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,040
It's time now.

559
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,280
Hey, don't worry.

560
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,000
You can do this.

561
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,960
Oh? She's coming out. She's coming out.

562
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,076
What's this?

563
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,476
I'm not the one.

564
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,836
It's not me. Not me.

565
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,000
The young lady will be coming out soon.

566
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,916
But I have something I must ask of you,

567
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,636
which is why I came out.

568
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,956
It's okay to take pictures,

569
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,036
but you absolutely must
not take pictures with flash.

570
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,316
The young lady really
hates those flashes of light.

571
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,916
-Do you understand?
-Of course! Don't worry!

572
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,956
Right. Thank you.

573
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,520
I ask this of you.

574
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,160
Yes!

575
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,040
Gunner 1. I'm ready.

576
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,796
Miss!

577
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,036
Yes?

578
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,636
It's your turn now.

579
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,040
Be strong.

580
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,880
Okay.

581
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,840
Freeze?

582
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,676
I've got a visual on the target.

583
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,160
Get ready.

584
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,880
Melt.

585
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,560
Oh! It's the angel!

586
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,800
Everyone, the angel has
made her appearance.

587
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Please look over here!

588
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,720
You're so pretty.

589
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,356
We love you!

590
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,480
Okay! Quiet, quiet!

591
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,920
Hello.

592
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,716
I'm the daughter of late
movie actress Eom Hye-rin,

593
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,640
and my name is Go Anna.

594
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,880
What a great voice.

595
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,000
Is it true that you're
the Angel of Barcelona?

596
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,000
I'm not an angel.

597
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,076
But it's true that I was in Barcelona.

598
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,920
Then it's certain! It's certain!

599
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,476
Then what's your nationality?

600
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,600
Ah! And who is your father?

601
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,156
Shoot!

602
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,720
What are you doing? Shoot!

603
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,156
My nationality is Korean.

604
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,040
Oh, Korean.

605
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,160
My father...

606
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,160
You can't...

607
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,760
My father...

608
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,476
was the late film director Go Jun-ho.

609
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,036
Oh!

610
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,800
A film director.

611
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,040
What are you doing right now?

612
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,316
Who knows?

613
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,960
If you watch and wait, you'll find out.

614
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,036
What are you doing? No camera flashes!

615
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,120
Don't do that!

616
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,916
Lady, please stop using your flash.

617
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,960
No flashes! No!

618
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,996
Stop.

619
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,996
Lady, you can't be using your flash.

620
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,640
Don't!

621
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,076
-Miss! Miss!
-No camera flashes!

622
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,356
-Miss!
-Anna!

623
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,796
Anna! Anna! Snap out of it!

624
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,440
Anna, come on! Are you okay?

625
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,040
For goodness' sake.

626
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,160
Anna, get a grip.

627
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,996
Please don't act like this!

628
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,080
Our child is unwell!

629
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,520
Anna! Anna, are you okay?

630
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,240
These two did nothing wrong.

631
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,040
I told them to do everything.

632
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,600
Yes, ma'am.

633
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,916
We thought those were your orders and...

634
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,760
Shut up.

635
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,560
Why did you do such a thing?

636
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,276
Isn't this better?

637
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,000
Better than killing an
angel in front of everyone?

638
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,956
Then why didn't you report to us first?

639
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,360
True...

640
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,600
Even if we had killed her, it
would've been a headache.

641
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,600
That's right.

642
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,040
You handled today well,
with good reaction time.

643
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,120
Good job.

644
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,636
Ma'am, this is a lie.

645
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,676
You must not be fooled.

646
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,116
It's okay.

647
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,080
If that's the case, I can
always kill her tomorrow.

648
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,760
Isn't that right?

649
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,040
You've worked hard as well.

650
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,356
Thank you, ma'am.

651
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,676
Thank you.

652
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,796
Would you leave us alone?

653
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,240
I have some things to
discuss with this guy.

654
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,080
Sit down.

655
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,236
You've worked hard the past two days.

656
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,200
Saving Assemblyman
Jang from Park Gwan-su...

657
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,240
And saving Anna from me.

658
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,520
But...

659
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,280
Are you going to continue
acting so immature?

660
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,280
Have you given up on
avenging Rania's death?

661
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,440
If our opponents have
pulled out their swords...

662
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,640
Now I want to pull the trigger, too.

663
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,596
Ma'am, it's a lie.

664
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,796
They definitely conspired
among themselves and...

665
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,356
-I know.
-What?

666
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,036
Are you a fool?

667
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,036
Why did you blabber in front of everyone?

668
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,320
Can't you distinguish between
being fooled and pretending?

669
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,440
Anna already has a weapon in her hands.

670
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,236
First appearing on social media
via foreign designer Paul Lafeit

671
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,116
and capturing the
interest of the Internet,

672
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,276
the famous "Barcelona angel"

673
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,276
has caused a stir as she
revealed herself to be Korean.

674
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,916
Go Anna was also discovered

675
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,716
to be the daughter of
late film director Go Jun-ho

676
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,836
and late movie actress Eom Hye-rin,

677
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,076
drawing further public attention.

678
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,676
All that time, Assemblyman
Jang Se-jun's wife...

679
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,716
Her name is Anna?

680
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,476
?列hoi Yu-jin had been
acting as Go Anna's guardian,

681
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,996
and there is increasing curiosity
about the pair's relationship.

682
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,160
This will save us.

683
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,760
Yes!

684
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,880
Oh, my gosh!

685
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,800
Who...who...

686
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,480
What are you doing here?

687
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,160
Ah, well...I just...

688
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,800
It doesn't hurt?

689
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,036
It doesn't hurt.

690
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,076
I think you got hurt. Are you okay?

691
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,880
Yeah, I'm okay.

692
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,760
Hey, it's really dangerous
for you to be up here.

693
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,960
I'm going.

694
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,360
Don't go.

695
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,680
Huh?

696
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,040
Just stay a while before you go.

697
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,316
Don't stand up.

698
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,956
It's really dangerous
if you fall from here.

699
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,716
It's dangerous even to trip.

700
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,916
You just fell like this
and smashed things up...

701
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,476
Hey, it's not dangerous.

702
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,440
It's not dangerous at all.

703
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,320
-It hurts, doesn't it?
-It doesn't hurt.

704
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,440
Thanks.

705
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,796
For everything.

706
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,240
Absolutely everything.

707
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,716
For what you did at the
Barcelona subway station,

708
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,640
and for the ramen and the ice cream.

709
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,480
And for bringing my dad to me.

710
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,960
And for earlier today,
and for this right now.

711
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,956
Well, that kind of thing...

712
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,716
Of course...

713
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,280
You should be grateful to me.

714
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,236
What?

715
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,120
I'm telling you to be thankful.

716
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,440
From now on, your life will change a lot.

717
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,240
Since a lot of people
have shown interest in you.

718
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,716
Now if you want to go
somewhere, you can go there,

719
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,596
and if you want to do something,

720
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,676
you can do it to your heart's content.

721
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,160
And if you want to be alone...

722
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,520
No one can stop you.

723
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,880
But the thing is, you must not be alone.

724
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,080
The moment you escape
from the crowds of people,

725
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,520
you'll end up dead.

726
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,076
The reason you've
stayed alive up until now

727
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,200
is because Choi Yu-jin didn't
need to be cautious of you.

728
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,040
But now the situation has changed a lot.

729
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,876
You have become Choi
Yu-jin's greatest weak point.

730
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,996
If you say a single word,

731
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,840
that woman could lose everything.

732
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,916
On the surface, she'll be appeasing you,

733
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,156
but if the public loses
interest in you someday...

734
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,840
That moment...

735
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,760
Choi Yu-jin will be
angling for that moment.

736
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,000
Then what if...

737
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,156
What if before then, I reveal
that Jang Se-jun is my father?

738
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,400
Then you'll become a child
who destroyed her father.

739
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,160
Would you be okay with that?

740
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,000
I get it know.

741
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,076
That's why my mom died as well.

742
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,840
Fear that my politician
dad would be ruined.

743
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,160
Even on the day my mom died,

744
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,356
she was just hoping
that my dad would come.

745
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,080
Like a fool.

746
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,240
My dad had promised to come on that day,

747
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,120
but in the end, he didn't show up.

748
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,040
Mom started drinking.

749
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,080
Like she always did on
the days Dad couldn't come.

750
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,636
Hey.

751
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,676
Jang Se-jun.

752
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,560
If you come...

753
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,040
If you come today...

754
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,440
Right.

755
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,996
It's true.

756
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:39,440
You never intended to
go to America together.

757
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:46,520
Being an Assemblyman to the
end...Is that such a great thing?

758
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:53,960
Now I'll tell the whole world.

759
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:59,120
I have no interest in all
that political nonsense!

760
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,440
But she wasn't able to do that.

761
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,760
I really hated seeing my mom drink.

762
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,480
That disgusting smell of
alcohol, sweat, and tears...

763
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,036
And the way she'd come into my room

764
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,596
and hug me tight and
cry and drift off to sleep...

765
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,036
Mom.

766
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,640
Sometimes,

767
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,436
I thought Dad didn't want to come

768
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,156
because Mom acted like that.

769
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,440
Ah, that's right. My Anna.

770
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,636
I had my Anna, didn't I?

771
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,956
(Sleep Aid)

772
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,040
My beloved daughter.

773
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,120
Come to Mom.

774
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,156
But I didn't go to her.

775
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,876
You don't like your mom?

776
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,956
You smell bad. You smell like alcohol.

777
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,840
I'm sorry.

778
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:02,640
But Mom is so sad.

779
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,840
I'm doing this because I'm so sad.

780
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,516
Anna.

781
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,160
Your mom is so sad.

782
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:17,236
Anna, would you hug your mom tight?

783
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,280
I didn't hug her.

784
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,316
Even on that day, I just...

785
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,520
My mom...

786
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,320
I thought it was just
her drunken rambling.

787
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,396
Mom.

788
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,800
Mom, I was wrong. Mom...

789
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,600
I was wrong, Mom!

790
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,800
It's okay.

791
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,040
It's just...

792
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,080
You were young back then.

793
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:09,040
You were just very young. It's okay.

794
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,000
It's okay.

795
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,360
No.

796
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,400
I was so bad.

797
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,756
If I think about

798
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:24,000
what I did next...

799
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,520
Mom, take this.

800
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,356
My Anna.

801
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,996
So you don't like your mom crying.

802
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,556
So would you like your
mom to sleep for a long time?

803
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,036
Yeah. I don't like seeing you cry.

804
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,956
I wish you'd sleep and not wake up.

805
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,316
Please.

806
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,240
Mom wants to sleep for a long time, too.

807
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,036
Mom.

808
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,956
Take this and sleep.

809
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,480
Then if Dad comes, I'll wake you up.

810
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,476
If Dad comes?

811
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:10,720
Then Mom will have to
sleep for a very long time.

812
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,796
So I...

813
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,036
I killed my mom that way.

814
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,680
I killed my mom.

815
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,520
Had I known it would be
the last time I saw her face...

816
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,760
Mom, I was wrong.

817
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,156
Sir, the police commissioner
is here to see you.

818
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,680
Let him come in.

819
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,276
Sir, have you been all right?

820
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,640
-Come and sit down.
-Yes, thank you.

821
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,196
You're looking rather fine.

822
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,436
Pardon?

823
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,636
Ah, yes.

824
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,840
It's always thanks to you.

825
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,116
You must be feeling comfortable
since you have good insurance.

826
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,916
Pardon?

827
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,196
What insurance...

828
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,796
I mean you have me and Jang Se-jun.

829
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,680
No, sir...

830
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,036
What insurance do I have other than you?

831
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,440
Forget it, forget it.

832
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,160
-You brought it?
-Yes.

833
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,480
Here it is.

834
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:12,076
Right now, he's masquerading
as someone named Kim Je-ha.

835
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,316
That guy was a mercenary in Iraq,

836
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,716
and he murdered a
civilian there and ran away.

837
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,076
He's currently wanted by Interpol.

838
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,800
He's an extremely dangerous guy.

839
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,440
Iraq? Blackstone?

840
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,520
No way. Blackstone?

841
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,516
This seriously...

842
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,120
It's unbelievable.

843
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,076
