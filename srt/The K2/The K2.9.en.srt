1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,040
(The K2)

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,880
(Ji Chang-wook)

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,120
(Song Yoon-a)

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,080
(Im Yoon-a)

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,520
(Cho Seong-ha)

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,080
(The K2)

7
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,280
Hey, don't worry.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,720
You can do this.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,280
Then...

10
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,996
Her social phobia was just...

11
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,120
It was all an act?

12
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,116
She just didn't like seeing us.

13
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,800
It makes sense.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,236
All that time, she knew what I did

15
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,116
and heard me cursing her.

16
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,796
Goodness. That's why

17
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,160
I tell you to talk nicely all the time.

18
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,440
I mean...Who would've
thought this day would come?

19
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,040
-Good morning.
-Ah, this is hot.

20
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,680
Good morning.

21
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,596
Miss.

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,160
Well...Miss...Is something the matter?

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,036
Can I eat breakfast
with you, too? I'm hungry.

24
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes.

25
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,280
What?

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,800
Of course that's okay. It's fine. Yes.

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,520
I'll shower and come back.

28
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,400
What is it?

29
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,160
The way you ate well all that time...

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,196
I think it tastes better since
we're all eating together.

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,160
Every morning...

32
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,040
I'd like to eat together like this.

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,880
Yes, miss.

34
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,840
Mi-ran.

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,480
Me?

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,316
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,196
Huh? Why?

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,036
Why, to me?

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,800
I didn't say anything yet...

40
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,396
I only thought of myself all that time,

41
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,840
and I didn't think of how I
made things hard for you.

42
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,120
And thanks.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
For saving me yesterday.

44
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,676
That was nothing.

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,556
I'll try to ensure that I
don't get you in trouble,

46
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,036
and that you can leave here.

47
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,400
What?

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,280
Now Choi Yu-jin will at least
accept small terms like that.

49
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,600
Um...Could I just say one thing?

50
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,756
I'm sorry,

51
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,880
but we can't leave this place.

52
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,920
Even if we want to leave.

53
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,636
Don't mess with Ms. Choi,
or you'll die in my hands.

54
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,280
Do what you will.

55
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,280
This time as well...

56
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,480
Are you just feeling useless pity?

57
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,680
It's hard to say.

58
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,556
It's possible.

59
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,036
You didn't come here to
babysit some young kid.

60
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,276
I also didn't come
here to watch a girl die

61
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,000
because you stopped an
ambulance from coming.

62
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,880
Did something like that happen?

63
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,076
Think carefully about why

64
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,916
I decided to kill Park Gwan-su.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,276
Killing an innocent person

66
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,396
because she interpreted
at a secret meeting,

67
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,516
and trying to kill a banner hanger

68
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,516
because he saw a secret affair

69
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,756
unfolding behind glass...

70
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,396
There's no difference.

71
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
Ah...

72
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,716
And there was even a person

73
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,956
who ordered that an innocent couple

74
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,516
in an orchard be killed for fear that

75
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
they'd heard something
from that banner hanger.

76
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,320
You people are all just like
Park Gwan-su. Do you get it?

77
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't want to create a second Rania.

78
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,080
I see.

79
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,120
So you could think of Anna

80
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,600
as being a second Rania.

81
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,680
Lucky Anna.

82
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,120
Okay, I got it.

83
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,396
What good would it do

84
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,040
to argue with you over this?

85
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,400
There are things that we need to do.

86
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,040
We must catch Park Gwan-su.

87
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,720
But the thing is...

88
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,880
If all the attackers in the
world are Park Gwan-su,

89
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
and all the victims are Rania,

90
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,000
then wouldn't I have been a Rania as well?

91
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,120
With my father being a Park Gwan-su?

92
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,720
In relation to Jang Se-jun as well,

93
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,040
I must have been a Rania.

94
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,196
A wolf is not a devil

95
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,640
just because it catches and eats a sheep.

96
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,760
Wolves have always
eaten sheep. And besides...

97
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,400
The offspring of a wolf

98
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,520
can only become a wolf itself.

99
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,796
Anna is

100
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,120
not the offspring of a sheep, either.

101
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,840
Forget it.

102
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,956
While we were busy on account of Anna,

103
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,160
the Mirror has been
working hard, never sleeping.

104
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,396
What do you mean by "the
burial of the living with the dead"?

105
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,316
It means that if you die,

106
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,796
we die with you.

107
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,080
What?

108
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,076
What are you saying?

109
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,560
Who says so?

110
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,676
Chief Ju told me that
before I came over here.

111
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,280
Other than top leadership,
all who know Anna's identity...

112
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,280
Will be subject to elimination later on.

113
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,556
In other words,

114
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,916
the connection between
Omar and Park Gwan-su

115
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,160
wasn't simply one of oil drilling rights.

116
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,236
It definitely goes beyond that.

117
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,916
And for those two to
maintain tight security,

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,196
they did not speak in English or Arabic,

119
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,316
but rather used Korean
and the Kumar language,

120
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,800
and found a special
interpreter for that purpose.

121
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,080
Though unfortunately, that was Rania.

122
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,876
At this point,

123
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,396
all we need to do is find
evidence to confirm this fact.

124
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,876
Hold on. Is there any guarantee

125
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,116
that there is evidence like you say?

126
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,400
Park Gwan-su could have
destroyed the evidence already.

127
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,636
Bad guys

128
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,360
always leave evidence
when they make deals.

129
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,240
Because it's their insurance
if they end up in danger.

130
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,400
Choi Yu-jin, that devil...

131
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,956
She's driven us like slaves until now...

132
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,236
What?

133
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,396
She'll just bury us?

134
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,236
Come on. You sucked up
before. "Oh, ma'am. Ma'am."

135
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,076
So from now on, guard Anna well.

136
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,996
That's how we can survive.

137
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,516
And you heard what Seong-gyu said, right?

138
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,516
If Assemblyman Jang
really becomes president,

139
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,236
then we'll all be total...

140
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,240
-Recipients of merit?
-Right.

141
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,956
Okay then. Dumb merit.

142
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,676
Are you nuts?

143
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,200
Right. I see.

144
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,916
Okay. I've made a resolution.

145
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,716
From now on to the
end, I will absolutely...

146
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,440
Mi-ran.

147
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,716
She's calling for you.

148
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
Me?

149
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,560
Yes, miss?

150
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,960
So then if I...

151
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,916
If I bring you the evidence,

152
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,956
Park Gwan-su will lose
his candidacy for president.

153
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,480
That's right.

154
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,720
I think you're mistaken about something.

155
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,276
I have no interest in
these political gambles.

156
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,956
The reason I've allied
myself with you is...

157
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,480
Because you want to kill Park Gwan-su.

158
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,120
To avenge Rania's death.

159
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
That's exactly what we'd be doing.

160
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
Please give me your autograph!

161
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,036
It's okay, miss.

162
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,156
These are all people who like you.

163
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,236
Be strong. You did well yesterday, too.

164
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,840
You can do this.

165
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,840
Just a second.

166
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,880
Hold on.

167
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,236
Please get in.

168
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,160
-Give me an autograph.
-An autograph!

169
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,240
I can't do autographs.

170
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,756
But how about taking a picture together?

171
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,556
-Yes!
-Yes!

172
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,796
-I'll take a picture.
-Me, too. Me, too.

173
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,800
Stand here. Over here.

174
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,196
Don't push.

175
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,920
I'll take the picture now.

176
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,080
One, two, three.

177
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,556
Once more.

178
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,160
One, two, three.

179
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,760
For politicians, what is death?

180
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,996
For politicians, true death is

181
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,076
the inability to continue
their political careers.

182
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,476
The inability for them
to dream any longer.

183
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,080
No, forget it.

184
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,796
I said I have no interest
in that kind of death, okay?

185
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,076
I'm just cut to the heart

186
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,080
about how Park Gwan-su had Rania killed,

187
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,796
and I hope that he'll die in my hands.

188
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,436
Someone who has a
dream doesn't fear death.

189
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,516
He's spent his whole life
dreaming of the presidency.

190
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,560
And one day as he comfortably
dreams of the presidency,

191
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,796
he'll abruptly die in your hands?

192
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,796
Wouldn't that be an odd kind of revenge?

193
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,680
What kind of revenge is that?

194
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,560
You must smash his dream first.

195
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,556
So that he can never dream again.

196
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,676
You must destroy him
beyond any hope of recovery.

197
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,076
And at the last moment,

198
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,760
you hand a single rope to that man.

199
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,596
And then,

200
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,360
he'll tie that rope
around his neck himself.

201
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,240
As he bitterly regrets the death of Rania.

202
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,400
Bullets aren't the only
things that can kill someone.

203
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,560
We're here to get some medicine.

204
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,840
She's having trouble sleeping these days.

205
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,160
It's all ready.

206
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,956
Why aren't you springing
to your feet to greet her?

207
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,836
And say you're sorry.

208
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
Leave. Leave, leave!

209
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,916
Miss.

210
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,756
If I may say so myself,

211
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,756
I'm the last true teacher
of this generation.

212
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,196
I'm the successor of Wing
Chun, the zenith of martial arts.

213
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,400
My name is Master Song Yeong-chun.

214
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,796
And as for you...

215
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,076
If I can speak regarding her,

216
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,716
she's the famous Barcelona...

217
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,080
Angel! Kid, I know. I know.

218
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,556
Miss.

219
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,156
Won't you try learning
self-defense from me?

220
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,956
What self-defense? Just go, Master Song.

221
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,520
-Self-defense?
-Yes.

222
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,516
Okay, for all you ladies,

223
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,476
we will now begin Master Song
Yeong-chun's self-defense class.

224
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,156
There isn't much to self-defense.

225
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,036
Let's say you walk down the
road and run into a pervert like this.

226
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,396
He looks mean.

227
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,836
But can a maiden like you

228
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,396
match him in terms of strength? You can't.

229
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,240
So first, I just...

230
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,236
Look at him!

231
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,756
Then the guy is staring at me, too.

232
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,076
His eyes are open wide.

233
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,800
Just then, pow!

234
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,276
So who cares if he's a bad guy?

235
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,716
-He can't see.
-Ow, my eyes.

236
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,080
So now we go for the body.

237
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,476
That hurts. It really hurts.

238
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,960
He's saying it really hurts.

239
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,956
But as for a girl like you,

240
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,756
no matter how weak you are,

241
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,756
you have the strength
to break a pinky finger.

242
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,240
-Yes.
-Then last of all...

243
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,756
You know what this is, right?

244
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,240
You grab here, and pow!

245
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,236
If you kick him, it's over!

246
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,000
You saw, right? Self-defense is nothing.

247
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,196
Okay. Let's try some practice.

248
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,160
-What?
-Come on out.

249
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,400
Come.

250
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,396
Um...Oh!

251
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,276
-You, come out here.
-Ow...Ow...

252
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,916
You, you, you.

253
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,680
Come on out here.

254
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,996
So a guy who looks like a
pervert just showed up, right?

255
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,316
So then, just like earlier...

256
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,996
Whoa.

257
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,360
Hey! Hey, punks! Where
are you running off to?

258
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,716
Miss.

259
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,996
Those are pathetic guys
who just do as they're ordered.

260
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,120
So don't hate them too much, huh?

261
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
Yes.

262
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,916
I'll try it once.

263
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
Master Song, be my partner.

264
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,280
No, no. If we do that, you'll
be at a huge disadvantage.

265
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,556
Class is over! Over!

266
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,156
Where are you going
in the middle of talking?

267
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,356
You suddenly stop, and
you're leaving? Master Song!

268
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,320
Oh my.

269
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,080
My niece.

270
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,836
My niece!

271
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,436
Good to see you, huh?

272
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,480
Who are you?

273
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,480
Me?

274
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,920
I'm your uncle, okay?

275
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,160
You grew up pretty.

276
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,156
Anna.

277
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,560
You've really saved me, huh?

278
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,040
Be careful.

279
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,036
Don't worry.

280
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,760
I'll stay alive and keep delaying
the sending of that email.

281
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,680
I wasn't saying that because of the email.

282
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Oh? My big sis.

283
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,880
You all wait here a moment.

284
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,880
What are you doing right now?

285
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,156
Me?

286
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,560
I came here to see my niece.

287
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,236
Niece?

288
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,680
Yeah.

289
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,996
As the daughter of your
husband, isn't she my niece?

290
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,960
Isn't that right?

291
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,080
Why are you acting so surprised?

292
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,840
What kind of crap trick
are you pulling here?

293
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,116
Crap trick?

294
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,596
How can you use terms like
that when you aim for refinement?

295
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,360
Terms like that don't suit
you. Don't talk like that.

296
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,480
I'll go out front with Anna
and have a bite to eat.

297
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,920
We're going.

298
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,680
You can't.

299
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,320
I can't?

300
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,996
In that case, right here,

301
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,556
I'll just go around
talking about who she is.

302
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,676
Hey, people!

303
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,836
Do you know who this girl
is? She's my brother-in-law's...

304
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,640
Hey!

305
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,836
I'm kidding, big sis.

306
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,200
I was just joking, but your face
went white, and you yelled...

307
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,436
And besides,

308
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,916
your relationship with Anna

309
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,160
isn't one where you can give her orders.

310
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,920
And she's not in a position
where she needs your permission.

311
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,280
Right, Anna?

312
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,400
No, I need permission.

313
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,080
K2.

314
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Can I go along with this person?

315
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,916
Then I'll follow you.

316
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,960
Miss.

317
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,076
Yeah, that should be okay.

318
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,000
Everyone around me will
be JSS guards anyway.

319
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,560
Let's go.

320
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,960
Say...

321
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,640
Watch her well.

322
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,520
Ma'am, are you all right?

323
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,720
No.

324
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,440
I'm not all right.

325
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,040
Right. Get in.

326
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,596
If you tell me your
destination, I'll follow you.

327
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,720
Don't do that. You hop in front.

328
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,796
Let's go to St. Thomas Hospital.

329
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,796
A hospital?

330
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,756
Yeah. The food there is great.

331
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,236
What a pathetic kid.

332
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,876
You're unwell and can't
even visit a hospital.

333
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,036
What are you doing right now?

334
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,396
Hey, you people should
live a more humanitarian life.

335
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,996
Didn't you hear earlier?

336
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,480
This kid is not well.

337
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,876
The problem is psychological.

338
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,916
In her current mental state,
who knows what she'll do?

339
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,880
In the end, she needs to
receive psychiatric treatment.

340
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,996
Anna.

341
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,120
Do you want to eat, or go to the hospital?

342
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,236
Oh! Dr. Kim!

343
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,000
You all go ahead.

344
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,756
Have you been well?

345
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,240
What brings you here?

346
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,956
You're the same as always.

347
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,916
Ah. This is my friend.

348
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,876
He's head of this hospital's
psychiatry department.

349
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,356
And this is

350
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,040
my niece, Go Anna.

351
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,800
Hello.

352
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,876
We came here

353
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,996
so she could be examined by Dr. Lee.

354
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,156
Would you show us where to go?

355
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,600
Sure.

356
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,076
Dr. Lee is good, right?

357
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,400
Yeah.

358
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,760
When you meet the doctor,
you'll be very surprised.

359
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,680
You can come this way.

360
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,396
Long time no see, Anna.

361
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,116
You know me?

362
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,160
You don't recognize me?

363
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,440
That makes sense.

364
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,200
You were young back then,
and you'd had a big shock.

365
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,280
Don't be scared, Anna.

366
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,076
Your name is Anna, right?

367
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,476
Anna.

368
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,120
Can you tell me what happened yesterday?

369
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,276
Ah! Doctor!

370
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,476
You do remember.

371
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,916
You grew up so pretty.

372
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,160
I worried about you a lot.

373
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,516
See?

374
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,120
This is a hundred times better
than just having a meal, right?

375
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,196
Did you say your name was Kim Je-ha?

376
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,240
Would you talk with me briefly?

377
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,796
We'd like to borrow a room.

378
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,120
Sure, go ahead.

379
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,436
Mi-ran, please keep an eye on things here.

380
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,040
Okay.

381
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,000
Don't be too impatient.

382
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,556
Psychiatric examinations and counseling

383
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,480
take quite a long time.

384
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,800
I heard you're a good fighter.

385
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,520
What is it you want
to say to me right now?

386
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,360
Come to me.

387
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,196
No.

388
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,276
Come to Anna.

389
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,156
Don't stick with Choi Yu-jin.

390
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,676
What are you saying right now?

391
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,756
I don't know why you're standing
by someone like my sister,

392
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,120
but I'll fulfill whatever
conditions you have. Okay?

393
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,080
What? You can't trust me?

394
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,956
Come on. I'm the chairman
of a major conglomerate.

395
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,956
A far higher position than some
president with a five-year term.

396
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,836
I doubt you'll last even five years there.

397
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,240
What?

398
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,400
Ah, right.

399
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,280
Without Anna, that is.

400
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,716
But Anna will choose me.

401
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,036
So you protect Anna. At my side.

402
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,360
I'm not sure about that.

403
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,760
A little while from
now, ask Anna yourself.

404
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,396
Well...

405
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,360
By now, Anna will have decided.

406
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
J4. J4.

407
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,440
J4. J4. This is K2! J4!

408
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,160
Damnit!

409
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,076
Excuse me.

410
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,636
Do you know where Go Anna
went? She was here earlier.

411
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,516
Ah, she finished her examination
and went home just now.

412
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,236
With her bodyguard.

413
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,680
Thank you.

414
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,116
Where are Chairman Choi and the girl?

415
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,480
What? Didn't you come here with them?

416
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,356
We can't get in touch with
Chairman Choi Seong-won.

417
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,800
Check his JB Group office,
his house, and his villa!

418
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,276
Search every single place
where Seong-won may have gone.

419
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,516
Also,

420
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,556
tell all the JSS agents who
are dispatched at JB Group.

421
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,956
Tell them that whoever catches
Choi Seong-won and Anna

422
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,876
will be invited to Cloud Nine.

423
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,516
Yes. Understood.

424
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,680
But ma'am, first we should
deal with that bleeding...

425
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,520
Quick!

426
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,920
Tell them, quick!

427
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
Yes.

428
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,716
We will now commence a brief
emergency search and seizure.

429
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,400
Please follow our orders.

430
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,040
What? Even the house?

431
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,400
Got it.

432
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,596
Why are you so surprised?

433
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,276
It's just as we expected.

434
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,076
Yu-jin is so brazen...

435
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,996
She would dare search
the chairman's residence?

436
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,316
Don't worry, my dear in-law.

437
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,720
Everything will go well according to plan.

438
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,120
Ah! Chief Ju!

439
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,396
What? The license plate number was a fake?

440
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,636
Dang it all...

441
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,236
You all heard, right?

442
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,160
If we can't find them
now, it's over for us!

443
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,676
But Chief Ju,

444
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,916
all things considered,
he's chairman of JB Group.

445
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,116
Is it okay for us to do this?

446
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,276
I'm flustered myself,

447
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,520
but for now, we need to look into things.

448
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,954
(Termination of JSS
Security Employment Contract)

449
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,996
Chairman Choi Seong-won
has directly dismissed

450
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,396
all you JSS guards
from working at JB group.

451
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,796
From now on, security for JB Group

452
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,796
will be handled by us
here at Jinhan Group.

453
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,996
We now request

454
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,240
all JSS employees to leave the premises.

455
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,916
Oh, dear. It's all torn up.

456
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,200
Hey. Are you able to read that?

457
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,800
No.

458
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,556
What?

459
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,040
Dismissal?

460
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,036
What does he take us for?

461
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,480
He took away Anna
based on that flimsy plan?

462
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,040
This is war.

463
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,600
Cut them all down.

464
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,680
Would you stop this now?

465
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,520
Forget it.

466
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,680
Ms. Choi has given her orders.

467
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,156
I found them. These are headquarters.

468
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,396
I found the suspect's vehicle.

469
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,276
The vehicle is parked at
Jangan-dong Munchon intersection.

470
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,680
This is K2. I'm on my way.

471
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,960
-What's this?
-What's wrong with it?

472
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,996
Sir, the surveillance feeds have cut out.

473
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,316
Hey! What's wrong with the screens?

474
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,516
Hurry and fix this!

475
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,916
I think the transmission has
been cut from the police side.

476
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,436
What? Dang it...

477
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm already plenty busy.

478
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,076
Hey. It's me!

479
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,796
All our surveillance feeds have cut out.

480
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,276
What's going on?

481
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,316
Sir, I can't do anything more for you.

482
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,716
What?

483
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,596
Hey! What are you saying all of a sudden?

484
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,996
Have you gone crazy?

485
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,876
So you don't need insurance anymore? Huh?

486
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,516
Sir.

487
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,956
You have to stand in the right lines.

488
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,956
At a time like this, why don't
you get insurance from me?

489
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,640
What?

490
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,796
Are you testing the waters right now?

491
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,676
Did Assemblyman Park
Gwan-su put you up to this?

492
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,196
Come on, sir.

493
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,956
Come over sometime.

494
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,036
Have some nice hot alcohol,

495
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,040
and let's have a deep conversation.

496
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,040
Hey, get out. Get out, punk!

497
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,080
Hey, where are they?

498
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,080
Chairman Choi is calling you.

499
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,676
Where are you now?

500
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,320
I'll text you the location.

501
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,560
Come by yourself.

502
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,400
Otherwise, Anna will be in danger.

503
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,520
Damnit!

504
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,076
What about Je-ha?

505
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,200
No word yet.

506
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,040
How dare that damn bastard...

507
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,560
You're here?

508
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,356
Je-ha is here.

509
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,600
See? I told you he'd be
here around dinnertime.

510
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,840
Go on in.

511
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,240
Why did it take you so long?

512
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,120
What are you doing? Sit down.

513
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,560
You're preparing plenty of dinner, right?

514
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,360
This guy looks awfully hungry.

515
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,600
Yes, Chairman.

516
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,600
Come in, Je-ha. Weren't you surprised?

517
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,276
Oh! Je-ha, welcome.

518
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,040
You're here?

519
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,840
What are you doing? Sit down.

520
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,760
I was fooled.

521
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,440
Ma'am, this is K2.

522
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,036
Yes. What happened?

523
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,280
Well, I found them now.

524
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,960
I'll give the phone to Chairman Choi.

525
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,396
Oh, big sis.

526
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,080
You were very worried, right?

527
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,156
I'll just hang out with
Anna a bit before leaving.

528
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,520
That's okay, right?

529
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,076
You should have told me in advance.

530
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,916
Sorry.

531
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,596
Anna was feeling cooped up.

532
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,680
Ah, I see.

533
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,636
Since you didn't tell me in advance,

534
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,280
I nearly had your wife killed.

535
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,720
Sis! You don't know what I'm like?

536
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,156
If you keep nagging me like that,

537
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,160
I really won't go back.

538
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,400
But...

539
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,636
Why is your father-in-law
acting like this?

540
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,356
Ah, you mean bringing
in Jinhan for security?

541
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,796
It was because of you.

542
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,956
He was worried about his
son-in-law and his daughter.

543
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,716
How long will you keep
burdening your father-in-law?

544
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,440
If you keep this up, he'll start
wanting JB Group for himself.

545
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,636
Oh, don't worry about other people.

546
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,436
Check your own greed first.

547
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,316
Sis. I'll hang out with
Anna and then head back.

548
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,036
Oh, and I talked to my father-in-law

549
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,236
about removing those Jinhan Group guards.

550
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,236
In the future, our home
and our family's security

551
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,160
will be handled by Jinhan Group.

552
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,320
Dear me. My father-in-law was
so worried about his daughter...

553
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,040
Got it, right? I'm hanging up.

554
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,796
The Jinhan security guards

555
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,396
are leaving JB Group headquarters.

556
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,076
Pull our guards out of Seong-won's house.

557
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,800
Understood.

558
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,760
Come by yourself. Otherwise
Anna will be in danger.

559
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,320
You were surprised, weren't you?

560
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,080
Just a bit.

561
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,036
I was surprised, too.

562
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,240
Since my uncle was so good at acting.

563
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,880
Your uncle?

564
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,920
Yeah.

565
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,920
I just decided to call him that.

566
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,320
Ah, it's so nice here.

567
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,756
When we talked about the
living being buried with the dead...

568
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,156
Yeah?

569
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,316
You said you heard it from
Chief Ju before coming over.

570
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,996
Yes.

571
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,520
So you came to the house
knowing that all along?

572
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,520
Yes.

573
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,920
Why did you come?

574
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,236
-Was it perhaps...-Yes, that's right.

575
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,920
It was because of you, Mi-ran.

576
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,640
I came of my own accord to save you.

577
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,196
What kind of crap trick is that?

578
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,680
What?

579
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,516
What? Was it not good?

580
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,520
It's up to men to do stuff like this.

581
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,040
So do you plan to stay here?

582
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,556
I'm thinking about it.

583
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,196
Since I don't want to go
back to that house anyway.

584
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,720
And I don't really have anywhere to go.

585
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,040
Do you trust Chairman Choi?

586
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,076
I still don't know. But...

587
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,040
I think he hates Choi
Yu-jin, just like I do.

588
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,320
Don't worry too much.

589
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,960
You're right next to me.

590
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,596
-Catch me.
-Mi-ran, go slowly.

591
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,120
Girl, if I catch you, you're dead meat!

592
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,520
What?

593
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,076
You chase me, too.

594
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,036
Why chase you?

595
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,680
Chase me like they're doing.

596
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,760
It looks like fun.

597
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,036
Hey. How can we...

598
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,916
How is that fun? It's just crazy.

599
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,516
Catch me. Off I go.

600
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,200
-You have to catch me.
-I don't want to.

601
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,916
I don't want to. I can't.

602
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,556
It's so childish, I'll die.

603
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,916
Freeze. Freeze.

604
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,640
Wait.

605
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,916
You have to come to catch me. Melt!

606
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,196
What do you mean,
"melt"? I'm not doing that.

607
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,476
How about we have fun, too?

608
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,796
Having fun is great, but...

609
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,076
You have to come and catch me, okay? Melt.

610
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,836
Okay, you go. I won't do it.

611
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,916
-Melt!
-This is so childish.

612
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,916
I said I'm not doing it.

613
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,196
Melt.

614
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,480
I really don't want to.

615
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,200
Why are we doing this?

616
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,560
Those two...Are they dating or what?

617
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,076
Oh, there's no way.

618
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,680
No, no. They look great together.

619
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,276
The kid is certainly good-looking enough.

620
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,240
So it's as if you're her real uncle.

621
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,480
We agreed I'd be her real uncle.

622
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,076
Thank you, Chairman.

623
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,756
For saving us as well.

624
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,240
That's a given. You're like Anna's family.

625
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,716
Don't worry about anything now,

626
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,196
and just take good care of Anna.

627
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,440
Yes, Chairman.

628
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,316
How could we eat together
with you, Chairman?

629
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,596
Of course you can.

630
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,236
Sit, sit, sit.

631
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,480
Sit down comfortably already.

632
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,440
You sit down, too.

633
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,920
Sit.

634
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,920
Sit.

635
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,716
Okay, let's make a toast.

636
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,196
Raise your glasses. Okay now.

637
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,556
To Anna's dreams.

638
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,080
-To Anna's dreams!
-To Anna's dreams!

639
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,560
What are you thinking about
so intently all by yourself?

640
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,040
What on earth is Chairman Choi thinking?

641
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,160
I was thinking along those lines.

642
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,356
But since I'm simple-minded,

643
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,916
it should be easy to read me.

644
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,600
What thinking

645
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,560
led you to pull Anna out
of Choi Yu-jin's grasp?

646
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,676
You must have put up
with significant danger.

647
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,320
Isn't that right?

648
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,876
You saw at the funeral.

649
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,036
Yu-jin wants to snatch
JB Group away from me.

650
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,916
And I want to prevent that.

651
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,400
But then Anna showed up. Ta-da!

652
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,716
I know it's a huge secret

653
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,916
that Anna is the daughter
of my brother-in-law.

654
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,796
So if Anna stays by my side,

655
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,916
Yu-jin can't easily steal
JB Group away from me.

656
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,196
You're really quite strategic.

657
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,200
Of course. I'm a businessman.

658
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,880
That's right. My thinking is simple.

659
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,596
I'd like Anna to stay with me,
safe and sound, for a long time.

660
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,600
As my guardian angel.

661
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,040
(Brother-in-Law)

662
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,356
Hi, Se-jun.

663
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,316
Of course I'm doing well.

664
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,156
Don't worry.

665
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,636
She's happy, too.

666
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,876
How would it burden me?

667
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,560
I'm enjoying this.

668
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,756
Don't worry.

669
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,756
Ah, I'm here with a certain bodyguard.

670
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,640
Just a second.

671
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,236
Don't say names.

672
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,916
Someone is probably right next to Se-jun.

673
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,560
Take the phone.

674
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,276
Yes, I'm on the phone.

675
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,236
Oh, it's me.

676
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,480
I heard you worked hard today.

677
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,356
You haven't forgotten your promise, right?

678
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,356
I haven't.

679
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,080
Right. Thanks.

680
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,356
I'm going out tomorrow.

681
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,760
Let's meet up.

682
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,040
Yes, okay. I'm hanging up.

683
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,560
If you're busy, you
could go out right now.

684
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,840
Oh, no. How could I do that?

685
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,400
This intense investigation should
take two nights and three days.

686
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,596
Hey, Prosecutor Kim. Take off your socks.

687
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,840
Why are you acting like
you're at someone else's house?

688
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,040
Oh, you seriously...

689
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,760
Check your own defenses before attacking.

690
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,400
I'll save my stone and kill yours.

691
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,520
There!

692
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,916
Have you made your decision now?

693
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,720
Whether you'll stick with
me, or stick with my sister?

694
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,476
I'm going to leave.

695
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,076
Once I do the task I must do.

696
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,996
Really? That's a shame.

697
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,720
I thought you and Anna
looked good together.

698
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,320
But what is this task you must do?

699
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,480
Later, you'll find out.

700
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,636
-You're here?
-Yes.

701
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,116
I'm sorry I made you stay open so late.

702
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,320
It's all right.

703
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,236
When you'd already said you would help,

704
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,036
why didn't you push Seong-won harder?

705
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,156
Seong-won was like a shop owner saying no,

706
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,556
so how could I do anything
as a powerless customer?

707
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,236
All things pass from nothing into nothing.

708
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,556
Is there any eternal owner of a company?

709
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,280
The owner can become a customer.
A customer can become the owner.

710
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,040
So that's when you use sayings like that?

711
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,320
Who knows?

712
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,000
I did hear as such.

713
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,156
Anna, where are you going?

714
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,760
Huh?

715
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,316
I had a few glasses of wine,

716
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,316
and my cheeks are so hot.

717
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,036
I'm going to catch some sea breeze.

718
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,156
The sea? You can't. It's dangerous.

719
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,316
Why not?

720
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,160
I'm so hot, I feel like
I'm running a fever.

721
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,236
Hey, how overheated can you really be?

722
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,556
That feels so cool. So nice and cool.

723
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,236
Your face really is hot. Let's see here.

724
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,956
Oh, that's so refreshing.

725
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,516
-It's refreshing?
-Yeah.

726
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,036
Who told you to drink so much?

727
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,876
-It's so cool.
-Goodness.

728
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,840
So cool, so cool.

729
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,556
-Huh?
-Come here.

730
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,920
What? What is it?

731
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,396
If I had drunk even one more glass,

732
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,556
I would've had to call
the fire department.

733
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,356
How is it? Still hot?

734
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,316
No, it's gotten better.

735
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,840
Then give me that.

736
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,156
You could catch a cold if
your face cools off too much,

737
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,076
so wait a little before you use it again.

738
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,440
Okay.

739
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,320
Do you have to leave again?

740
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,916
Yeah, I'll make one more round.

741
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,480
This place doesn't have
security as tight as the safe house.

742
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,840
There's really no such thing
as a safe place anywhere.

743
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,200
But it's okay.

744
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,120
Today was a lot of fun.

745
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,916
Here.

746
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,836
What's this? A walkie-talkie?

747
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,396
If you hear a weird noise
coming from somewhere,

748
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,836
or if you're too cold, or
suddenly need something,

749
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,716
say so right away into this walkie-talkie.

750
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,036
Since it's faster than a phone.

751
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,600
Ah...

752
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,036
Got it. Over.

753
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,116
Are you dumb?

754
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,200
You have to press this
button when you talk. Like this.

755
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,160
Got it, K2.

756
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,760
Good job.

757
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,960
Where are you? Over.

758
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,000
I'm in the living room.

759
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,000
Will you not say "over"? Over.

760
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,960
I'll say "over." Over.

761
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:00,040
The fire in my cheeks
has finally gone out. Over.

762
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,760
Hey, you don't have to
talk in that formal way. Over.

763
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,960
Really? I don't have to talk like that?

764
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,876
Where are you now? Over.

765
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,120
I'm behind the villa now. Over.

766
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,356
Aren't you scared being alone? Over.

767
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,760
I'm not scared. Over.

768
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,720
Where are you now?

769
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,880
Now I'm on the living room sofa.

770
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,640
So you came inside now.

771
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,880
Yeah.

772
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,076
Aren't you tired?

773
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,840
No, I'm okay. I can trade off
with another guard and rest now.

774
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,960
You must be tired. You go to sleep first.

775
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,240
And have good dreams.

776
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,160
Okay. Sleep well.

777
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,160
Yeah. Right.

778
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,600
Je-ha.

779
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,360
I think I like you.

780
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,360
K2, are you asleep?

781
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,040
Why are you sleeping
here so uncomfortably?

782
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,960
Did you have a dream?

783
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,276
Yeah.

784
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,160
Apparently so.

785
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,316
-Ah, I...
-Yeah...

786
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,036
I mean, I just came to cover
you since I thought you'd be cold.

787
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,036
Yeah.

788
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,676
No, I'm not cold at all.

789
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,556
Oh, I'm so hot.

790
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,796
I must have had a hot dream.

791
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,040
Why is the weather so hot...

792
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,040
Then...

793
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,076
Then I'll go back in.

794
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,040
Right. Go on in.

795
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,720
Yeah.

796
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,040
I'll go now.

797
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,716
Yeah. Sleep well.

798
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,236
Yeah. Bye.

799
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,760
Yeah.

800
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,800
Dang it.

801
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,160
Dang it.

802
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,800
Ugh, how humiliating.

803
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,360
Dang it, I can't do this.

804
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,040
No.

805
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,800
(The K2)

806
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,480
Kim Je-ha, you're mine now.

807
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,836
When will you come back?

808
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,476
These are the police records

809
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,956
regarding your mother's incident.

810
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:00,956
To Chairman Choi,

811
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,596
Anna is not a shield he's
using to protect himself,

812
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:05,320
but rather a knife to attack Choi Yu-jin.

813
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:06,956
As a surprise guest,

814
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,996
we've brought Go Anna
herself into the studio.

815
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,120
There's only a slim chance
that he'll make it back alive.

816
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,916
I'll ask this of you.

817
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,040
If we're together, both of us will die.
