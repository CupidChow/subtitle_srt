(The K2)

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,356
Anna, wake up.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,640
Anna. Anna.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,076
Anna, no.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,120
Don't die. Please don't die.

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,480
Please don't die.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,036
Anna, wake up! Anna!

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,520
Anna, wake up!

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,716
What? Call the emergency services?

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,076
Are you nuts? We can't call them!

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,956
Sir.

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,196
We're too far from JSS.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,276
There's no time.

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,276
No!

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,716
I canceled the call to
the emergency services.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,276
Wait for our car to show up.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,480
Sir. Sir!

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,480
Damnit!

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,956
Chief Ju. She's in critical condition.

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,240
Wait!

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,116
(No vehicles)

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,076
-Push through it.
-What?

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,396
Push through it, punk!

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
Yes.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,996
Anna, are you awake? Well?

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,920
Anna. Anna!

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,356
Hey. What are you people doing?

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,876
Why isn't an ambulance here?

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,160
I'm seriously going crazy here!

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,396
Get her in the car. Quick!

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,640
Quick!

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Hey, move.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,956
-Hey, get out.
-Huh?

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,480
Get out already!

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,596
This is K2.

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,956
I'm going to the nearest hospital.

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,196
You can't take her to a hospital.

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,876
-Go to the JSS medical facility.
-What?

44
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,276
How can we go that far
when she's in this state?

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,836
Step on it!

46
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,956
If we take her to a
hospital, everyone is dead.

47
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,560
Dang it!

48
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,040
-Out of the way.
-Move, move.

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,716
Out of the way.

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,040
Move, move.

51
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,120
What's this? Someone went zipping by.

52
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,956
You acted all pretty. You
photoshopped it, didn't you?

53
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,600
-I didn't!
-So you did.

54
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,316
That girl is so pretty.
Where have I seen her?

55
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,836
What do you mean?

56
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,116
She's sitting here in front of you.

57
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,916
No, I mean the girl behind you.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,560
I've seen that face a lot somewhere.

59
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,756
Isn't it her? That angel.

60
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,120
The girl Jean-Paul Lafeit was looking for.

61
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,676
-Oh?
-Come on.

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,876
I don't think it's her.

63
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,956
You're saying she's in Korea?

64
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,636
Wasn't she in Spain?

65
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,236
No...

66
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,560
She totally looks like her...

67
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,276
Ah!

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,520
Let's upload this on social media.

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,596
(#Barcelona_Angel #Jean-Paul_Lafeit)

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,036
(#Jean-Paul_Lafeit)

71
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,080
(#Couldn't this girl be the
angel of Barcelona?#Lol)

72
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,316
Je-ha, you leave now.

73
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,640
What?

74
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,960
Okay.

75
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,436
Leave. If you stay here acting like this,

76
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
you'll only get in the
way of her treatment.

77
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
Got it.

78
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,356
Here, take this already.
It's all going to melt.

79
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,080
Your dad told me to give you this.

80
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,156
Really?

81
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,036
My dad sent this?

82
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,480
Of course.

83
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,760
I see.

84
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,716
If it's from my dad,

85
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,600
I should eat it.

86
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,960
It's good.

87
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,120
No!

88
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,080
Mom?

89
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
No!

90
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,560
Mom?

91
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,316
Are you okay?

92
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Miss, are you okay?

93
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
Calm down.

94
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,680
Are you feeling uncomfortable at all?

95
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,476
Where am I?

96
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,116
This is the JSS medical facility.

97
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,556
Je-ha brought you here from the park.

98
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,120
If you'd arrived much later,
it might have been very bad.

99
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,236
So, what happened?

100
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,716
Her allergic reaction
has settled down a lot.

101
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,276
Shouldn't she be moved
to a hospital right now?

102
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,876
I'm a doctor.

103
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,956
And most of the equipment here

104
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,840
is better than what's
available in a hospital.

105
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,356
But although her body can
be healed with medicine,

106
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,716
the real problem is a psychological one.

107
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,356
In her current mental state,
who knows what she'll do?

108
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,120
In the end, she'll need
some psychiatric treatment.

109
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,640
You'll need to keep close watch over her.

110
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,516
But did Anna happen to
say anything about me?

111
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,396
Like that I bothered her, or...

112
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,276
What a pointless thing to bring up.

113
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,036
Now isn't the time to think about that.

114
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,960
-Seriously.
-Geez...

115
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,520
Why did you cancel the ambulance call?

116
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,796
Chief Ju!

117
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,396
Come on.

118
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,076
I have to be dispatched again tonight,

119
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,800
so I was just getting
a bit of shut-eye here.

120
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,076
This is the situation that Anna is in.

121
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,400
They'd rather let her die than
risk exposing her to the world.

122
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,676
Do you get it now?

123
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,916
And if, like today, you
give her strawberries,

124
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,796
and she eats them herself
even knowing she could die,

125
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,196
it would be the chance of
a lifetime for certain people.

126
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,556
Even Assemblyman Jang

127
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,000
wouldn't raise an issue
about an incident like this.

128
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,356
Who is it?

129
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,800
Who is it that canceled
the ambulance call?

130
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,036
What will you do if you know who it is?

131
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,956
No matter what you do,
Anna's situation won't change.

132
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,596
What you can do is
avoid the slightest excuse

133
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,916
for any slip-up in her protection.

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,640
If we had taken Anna
to the hospital earlier,

135
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,076
we'd all end up dead.

136
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,716
Of course Mi-ran and the housekeeper,

137
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,920
but also the doctors and
nurses in the emergency room.

138
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,040
Everyone who saw Anna would die.

139
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,240
Although as part of Cloud
Nine, you would've been spared.

140
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,196
Have you already forgotten

141
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,916
why the couple at the
orchard nearly got killed?

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,076
It doesn't seem natural
for you to act like this.

143
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,996
If the others find out
that you're acting this way,

144
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,516
it'll become harder to protect Anna.

145
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,436
If you truly want to protect Anna,

146
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,240
act naturally.

147
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,840
You can leave.

148
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,960
She's a rather pitiful kid,
so be good to her, okay?

149
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,076
Do you know Anna?

150
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,196
I don't know her well.

151
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,236
I just know she was
born to the wrong parents,

152
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,436
so she got stuck

153
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,760
being dragged overseas at a young age.

154
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,716
That's right. She was
born to the wrong parents.

155
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,076
Why'd it have to be them?

156
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,560
Since her father is a
presidential candidate...

157
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,316
Who's her father?

158
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,036
Her last name is Go. She's Go Anna.

159
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,480
She's not Jang Se-jun's
daughter in a legal sense.

160
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,036
Her last name is Go?

161
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,756
You didn't know? The name is Go.

162
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,636
There was this director,
Mr. Go someone or other.

163
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,916
An American.

164
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,396
Anna's mom married him.

165
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,636
Her mom, Eom Hye-rin.

166
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,996
So that means.

167
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,676
Jang Se-jun fathered Anna
with a married woman...

168
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,716
That's not what happened.

169
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,960
Anyway, it's complicated.

170
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,756
Whatever. I've lived a long time.

171
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,076
What happened was that

172
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,596
she was pregnant when she
went to America with her husband.

173
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,120
She was carrying Jang Se-jun's child.

174
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,720
Do you see what I mean?

175
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,236
Of course I didn't know
that she was pregnant.

176
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,396
But later, I don't know if
she was deserted or what,

177
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,276
but Eom Hye-rin suddenly
showed up in Korea,

178
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,636
bringing little Anna with her

179
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,516
and came to see Jang Se-jun,

180
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,036
who was now married to Choi Yu-jin.

181
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,076
Do you get what I mean?

182
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,476
Jang Se-jun kept it a
secret from Choi Yu-jin,

183
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,480
and he set up a second
household with Eom Hye-rin.

184
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,756
But young Anna was such an unlucky child.

185
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,036
Her mother died an untimely death.

186
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,876
And then Anna was packed
off to a foreign country.

187
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,716
That's why I say she's pitiful.

188
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,556
An untimely death?

189
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,996
Huh?

190
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,956
Ah, Eom Hye-rin?

191
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,560
Well, doesn't suicide
qualify as an untimely death?

192
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,676
Anyway, seeing what happened,

193
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,080
I don't know if Choi Yu-jin
will leave Anna alone.

194
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,116
Have you done some thinking?

195
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,236
Why are you in such a hurry?

196
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,956
Let's start by eating.

197
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,360
The acorn jelly here is superb.

198
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,796
I doubt you have much time on your hands.

199
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,120
The president has been a
lame duck for a long time.

200
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,756
I don't think

201
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,036
the president is able

202
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,996
to trust you or Assemblyman Jang yet.

203
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,956
At best, you need party
support to win the election,

204
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,556
and if you make it to the Blue House,

205
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,076
you may stab the former president
in the back for your benefit...

206
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,040
As Chief of Staff, aren't
you testing the waters?

207
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,316
I've been looking into

208
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,836
a number of happenings
surrounding the president.

209
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,520
Though none of these
have actually happened yet.

210
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,760
Is this a threat?

211
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,240
Here are records of corruption
in JB Group and the foundation.

212
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,760
All in.

213
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,634
(Pyeongchang Scholarship
Foundation's Deposits & Withdrawals)

214
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,876
With that, you can easily kill me.

215
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,676
So you're saying

216
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,680
we should share our weak points?

217
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes.

218
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,800
Is this enough to strike a deal?

219
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
As expected of you.

220
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,196
I'm sorry. Business is done for today.

221
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,036
Come on. There are still people inside.

222
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,276
And the lights are on there.

223
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,756
Those are today's final guests.

224
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,480
Oh, how about we just go in
and have a bit of rice wine?

225
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,680
Must you go in?

226
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,676
Wow, your place must be doing well.

227
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,116
You even pick and choose your customers.

228
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,800
Let's go.

229
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,800
Hello, it's me.

230
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,956
I can see why

231
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,276
your little brother Chairman
Choi is afraid of you.

232
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,716
That's a compliment, right?

233
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,076
Oh, of course.

234
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,676
I'm talking to this nation's
future first-in-command,

235
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,600
so would I dare say otherwise?

236
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,756
It's a compliment.

237
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,196
It seems more like jeering.

238
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,316
The first-in-command will be my husband.

239
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,996
Oh? Is that so?

240
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,600
What?

241
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,156
Right.

242
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,036
When will you be
officially joining the party?

243
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,836
Well...

244
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,596
We can't just make an
uneventful entrance, can we?

245
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,396
I'm preparing the whole story.

246
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,036
Before then,

247
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,200
I'd like it if you could
pave the way for us.

248
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,236
Really?

249
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,720
Okay.

250
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,600
Did the meeting go well...

251
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,076
So it went well.

252
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,116
Is that what it looks like?

253
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,156
Congratulations, ma'am.

254
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,960
Thank you.

255
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,120
What a beautiful night. Ha ha ha!

256
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,476
Am I not funny?

257
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,960
What?

258
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,520
So in the end, he's joining the party?

259
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,756
It looks like it.

260
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,556
From olden times, if
the nation was in turmoil,

261
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,796
it was rotten institutions
and dirty merchants

262
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,040
who monopolized political power.

263
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,956
I gave so many warnings.

264
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,916
Yet this guy...

265
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,876
He goes ahead and
colludes with Choi Yu-jin.

266
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,676
Well then, I'll organize
an internal investigation

267
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,040
and hurry with preparations
for the primary election.

268
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,036
Was it necessary to push things so far?

269
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,480
What?

270
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,516
It's the one who exposes
dirt and corruption

271
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,800
who becomes the hero of a turbulent age.

272
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,120
Where did you say that
clown Jang Se-jun is now?

273
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,876
Assemblyman.

274
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,476
Your wife just finished her meeting.

275
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,996
Right.

276
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,116
Your expression tells me it went well.

277
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,400
Yes.

278
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,716
Is that so? Well then...

279
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,036
Shouldn't we make
changes to today's talk script?

280
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,996
I can't criticize the
current president too much.

281
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,996
That's right.

282
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,196
You'll keep things soft today, right?

283
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,596
I'll change some of the questions as well.

284
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,840
-Okay. You can go.
-Yes, sir.

285
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,716
Congratulations, ma'am.

286
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,476
Why the congratulations?

287
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,036
How are you handling the girl?

288
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,516
She's in the medical facility.

289
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,556
Really?

290
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,956
I guess she cheated
death and made it over here.

291
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,476
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,996
Why would you be sorry?

293
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,240
It was her own fate.

294
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,396
Where's the medical facility?

295
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,196
What? You intend to meet with her?

296
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,396
Yes.

297
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,596
Secretary Kim, please
go ahead to Cloud Nine.

298
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,280
-Where is it?
-I'll take you there.

299
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,116
What's her condition?
Is she able to converse?

300
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,196
She can.

301
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,156
Her physical condition
has improved greatly,

302
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,036
but a suicide attempt like the one today

303
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,756
means she needs psychiatric treatment...

304
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,880
As in going to a hospital? Forget it.

305
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,156
Keep an eye on her.

306
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,040
So she doesn't do any pointless things.

307
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,036
You all leave for a moment.

308
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,160
Ah, yes.

309
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,076
Dang it. You follow me.

310
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,840
What do you mean, a hospital? Dang it...

311
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,840
What?

312
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,076
Seeing you today, the
nun's habit suited you.

313
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,120
And your song was moving.

314
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,280
Did you learn that at the convent?

315
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,196
But I'd like to know

316
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,680
what you hoped to get
by showing up like that.

317
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,076
All this time,

318
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,480
did you think I was preventing
your father-daughter reunion?

319
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,996
Oh my.

320
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,320
You saw the truth at the church, right?

321
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,120
Dad.

322
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,640
Why is Anna...

323
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,560
Your dad doesn't want to meet you.

324
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,676
Your dad is not going
to appear in front of you.

325
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,116
Like the day your mom Eom Hye-rin died,

326
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,436
and like the day you left for Spain...

327
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,320
Just like he didn't show up then.

328
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,360
It must be painful. That's right.

329
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,320
So you must want to deny it.

330
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,996
But it's reality.

331
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,276
That's what fathers are like.

332
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,636
I know as a daughter myself

333
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,996
that all daughters have

334
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,916
special feelings for their fathers.

335
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,040
But fathers aren't quite on board.

336
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,480
They don't know how we feel.

337
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,716
You must have thought

338
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,956
your dad was everything you had left,

339
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,280
but you're not everything to him.

340
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,676
You're just a very small

341
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,160
and very burdensome part of his past.

342
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,040
Then let me meet my dad.

343
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,996
I'll ask him myself, and...

344
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,916
Oh, dear.

345
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,320
You want me to forcibly
drag him to see you?

346
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,556
Even as a loving married couple,

347
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,156
shouldn't we uphold basic manners?

348
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,436
Your dad doesn't want to meet you.

349
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
What do you want me to do about it?

350
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,636
My dad

351
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,800
doesn't love you.

352
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,440
Did your mom tell you that?

353
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,916
Fine.

354
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,596
I understand how she felt.

355
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,596
She must have really hated me.

356
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,560
But Anna,

357
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,836
since you were so young then,

358
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,636
there were things you
didn't know about your mom.

359
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,956
It's hard for us to understand,

360
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,556
but do you know what the goal in life is

361
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,080
for a member of the National Assembly?

362
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,156
Their goal is to be re-elected.

363
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,916
And your dad is no exception.

364
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
But do you know what your mom did?

365
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,796
Your mom used you

366
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,716
to blackmail your dad.

367
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,640
Right before the election.

368
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:30,000
Though I don't know if she
was a good mother to you.

369
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,996
True...

370
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,956
Your alcoholic, drug-addicted
mom must've given you a hard time.

371
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,076
You were so young,

372
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,680
and you gave her the
pills with your own hand...

373
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,876
No.

374
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,640
Mom didn't die because of
the sleeping pills I gave her.

375
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,916
Someone was at the house that night.

376
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,480
And that person tried to kill me, too.

377
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,000
But?

378
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,040
Was it me?

379
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,676
Anna.

380
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,836
Your memories are lying to you.

381
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,800
Sometimes the truth is too hard to accept.

382
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,996
But this is the truth.

383
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,356
Your mom took the pills
you gave her, and she died.

384
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,756
That's a lie.

385
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,396
I heard everything from that lady.

386
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,956
That lady?

387
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,156
Ah, the lady you went to
see at the nursing home,

388
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,200
who used to be your family's housekeeper?

389
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,436
Anna.

390
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,676
If by some chance

391
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,076
I killed your mom,

392
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,396
and that housekeeper knew about it,

393
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,200
would I have allowed
the housekeeper to live?

394
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,600
Let's stop this now.

395
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,840
Anna is very unwell.

396
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,640
True.

397
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,956
I said a lot of pointless things today.

398
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,640
To a kid who's unwell.

399
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,236
Right, Anna.

400
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,156
You ran away in the
wee hours of the morning,

401
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,556
so you must have had a tough time.

402
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,320
Get some rest.

403
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,480
And take care of yourself.

404
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Come to Cloud Nine.

405
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,676
Don't cry.

406
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,680
And wait.

407
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,960
I'll bring your dad to you.

408
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,760
(Jang Se-jun Youth Concert)

409
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,000
What are you doing here?

410
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,956
Oh, I want to have a
look at the talk show, too.

411
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,160
What? Have a look?

412
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,636
What scheme is up your sleeve this time?

413
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,676
Scheme? Come on.

414
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,240
But that person...

415
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,920
Who?

416
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,236
It's nothing.

417
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,956
Hey!

418
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,360
That punk is so rude.

419
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,996
Everyone, you're having a
hard time these days, right?

420
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,040
Yes.

421
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,716
Yes, that's right.

422
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,916
Right now, we're standing at a crossroads.

423
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,676
There is great income inequality,

424
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,036
and the rich get ever richer
while the poor get poorer.

425
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,556
The elderly population keeps growing,

426
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,356
and the young people who must
fund the pensions are decreasing.

427
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,996
The productive members of the population

428
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,956
are clamoring over a lack of good jobs.

429
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,076
The rich clash with the poor,

430
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,596
and the same occurs
between the old and young.

431
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,996
Even young couples in love
who should get married...

432
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,956
This is K2.

433
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,556
In the very middle of the
front seats by the stage,

434
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,036
there are suspicious audience members.

435
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,236
So the population is shrinking,

436
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,236
and birth and marriage
rates are plummeting.

437
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,720
This is Team Leader Seo. What do you mean?

438
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,076
Why is this the case?

439
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,836
It's the economy, stupid.

440
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,440
It's the economy, stupid!

441
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,120
Of course, I'm not
calling all of you stupid.

442
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,596
Just upstage of stage center,

443
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,116
at 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, and 2:00,

444
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,556
the four audience members carrying bags.

445
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,276
On the first floor, row B
seat 12 and row C seat 16,

446
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,036
audience members are
hiding things close to the chest.

447
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,276
The economy is still the problem.

448
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,276
This is Team Leader Seo.

449
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,316
Those people went through
security screening at the door.

450
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,040
Don't mind them.

451
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,196
Ah, but people say that

452
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,920
if one is sick, one
should go to the hospital.

453
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,436
That's right!

454
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,360
Ah! Over there, it looks
like we have a sick person.

455
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,916
Yes, that's right.

456
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,040
We are sick right now.

457
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,160
(Police)

458
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,596
I'm sorry to say this to people
scrambling to prepare for jobs,

459
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,756
but truthfully, our
generation did not study hard.

460
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,116
We were busier going on group dates.

461
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,076
But someone as ugly as me

462
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,476
didn't get many
invitations to group dates.

463
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,676
So I could pass the bar exam
in my third year of college.

464
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,240
And in the top percentile.

465
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,080
Yes, I'm bragging.

466
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,040
I'm sorry.

467
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,476
Secondly, if you were involved
in the democratization movement

468
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,116
or labor movement,
you didn't need to study.

469
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,876
The whole nation was a candle in the wind,

470
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,956
so who cared about grades?

471
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,716
So we didn't worry about
getting jobs or getting married.

472
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Why? The nation was a candle in the wind.

473
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,636
Actually, it was due to
the expansion of industry.

474
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,796
There were more than
enough jobs to go around.

475
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,436
Even if the prices of
goods went up every day,

476
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,000
we didn't really worry.

477
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,516
This is K2.

478
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,156
Look, Team Leader. Suspend the talk now.

479
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,436
The VIP is in danger.

480
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,236
What? Are you nuts?

481
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,316
K2, where are you?

482
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,120
I'm backstage.

483
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,676
This is why older people

484
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,640
often still say how
good the old days were.

485
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,360
But how are things now?

486
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,036
It's the economy, stupid.

487
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,040
It's the economy, stupid!

488
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,716
It'll sound like some historical novel,

489
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,036
but let me talk about when I was young...

490
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,000
Don't do anything stupid. Stay put.

491
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,040
This was when I was dating my now-wife.

492
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,840
I was a poor fellow
without a cent in my pocket.

493
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,156
Hey! K1, what are you doing?

494
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,076
What are you doing here right now?

495
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,000
Move. Don't ruin things.

496
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,560
Jang Se-jun, get out!

497
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,436
Jang Se-jun who protects
international finance, wake up!

498
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,400
-Wake up! Wake up!
-Wake up! Wake up!

499
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,680
Just a moment!

500
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,236
Security personnel,

501
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,436
please let go of them.

502
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,876
Don't stop them from speaking out.

503
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,356
They are not to be treated this way.

504
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,076
They have a right

505
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,036
to throw eggs at me

506
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,196
and at the politicians of this country.

507
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,956
Up until now,

508
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,556
they have suffered ridicule

509
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,920
at the hands of far too many politicians.

510
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,720
And getting hit by a
few eggs won't kill me.

511
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,436
And if these people
really wanted to hurt me,

512
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,156
they would have thrown rocks.

513
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,480
-Isn't that right?
-Yes.

514
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,876
Yes. I believe

515
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,756
that these people threw eggs

516
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,316
since they have some affection for me.

517
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,636
And weren't they shouting at me

518
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,036
to wake up?

519
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,556
If you're a politician,
you should wake up.

520
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,156
Understood.

521
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,080
I take your meaning.

522
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,160
I will wake up.

523
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,796
As for that

524
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,516
international finance group

525
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,276
these people think I'm protecting,

526
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,676
I demand an immediate investigation

527
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,956
by the prosecution

528
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,756
of the financial sectors

529
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,000
that are arousing suspicion.

530
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,916
And from this moment on,

531
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,636
In accordance with the immunity
I have as an Assemblyman,

532
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,636
I will not wield any
authority in my defense.

533
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,556
Tomorrow morning,

534
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,396
I will appear at the prosecutors' office

535
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,200
and undergo investigation.

536
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,996
My home, office, campaign
office, and all other places

537
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,756
associated with me will be
subject to search and seizure.

538
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,396
And I request that they
clearly reveal everything,

539
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,520
with no regard for my self-interest.

540
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,876
If a single suspicion arises

541
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,516
that all of you find unacceptable,

542
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,116
then I will not hesitate to step down

543
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,280
as these people have demanded.

544
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,036
All of you who threw eggs at me today,

545
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,796
if this investigation
is conducted properly,

546
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,916
and if you're satisfied with the results,

547
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,036
then don't waste eggs by throwing them.

548
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,640
Give me an entire box.

549
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,520
Or a small carton is okay, too.

550
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,120
I want to bring them to
my wife who loves to cook

551
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,520
and receive her love.

552
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,000
-Jang Se-jun! Jang Se-jun!
-Jang Se-jun! Jang Se-jun!

553
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,836
Ugh!

554
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,036
Ugh, what a nasty raw smell.

555
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,836
Isn't there a nasty smell coming off me?

556
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,596
-It's okay.
-Those kids.

557
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,156
I said to throw a couple
eggs. Why throw so many?

558
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,996
Do they dislike me to begin with?

559
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,316
Still, this had a great effect.

560
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,596
You dislike me, too. Right?

561
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,636
What? Not at all.

562
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,400
All my love.

563
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,956
I have to take a shower.

564
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,160
It'll take a while.

565
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,356
When I'm done, I'll call.

566
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,040
Understood.

567
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,640
You waited a long time, right?

568
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,000
This is tough.

569
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,956
Have you eaten anything?

570
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,520
Yes.

571
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,276
I'll go in first, okay?

572
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,036
Come in soon.

573
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,440
Yes.

574
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,040
Well, well. My cutie.

575
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,836
Let's go somewhere for a cup of coffee.

576
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,800
You know how long this will take.

577
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,676
You wait here.

578
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,120
Understood.

579
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,356
What are you doing?
Why aren't you coming in?

580
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,240
Yes, I'm coming.

581
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,240
Ruining the mood.

582
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,040
Get dressed. You need
to get out of here quick.

583
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,076
-Who are you?
-Police.

584
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,236
-What are the police doing here?
-Why are you here?

585
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,836
-Stop!
-Out the way!

586
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,040
Let go!

587
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,996
What's with him?

588
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,316
-He teamed up with the girl.
-What?

589
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,076
And soon the police
will be breaking in here.

590
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,800
Since they've got the
police on their side, too.

591
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,276
You cannot enter.

592
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,200
Do you all want to get arrested?

593
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,036
Don't look back.

594
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,880
-There he is. Catch him!
-Run!

595
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,516
Catch him!

596
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,076
Stop!

597
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,800
Move!

598
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,556
What's this?

599
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,640
The police are a trap. Help us out.

600
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,716
Who are those guys?

601
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,316
Park Gwan-su's underlings.

602
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,120
A trap?

603
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,836
Come on, guys, seriously...

604
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,956
Hey. You must know you're
obstructing us in our duties.

605
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,280
Then try arresting us.

606
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,836
The suspect has fled.
Block off the entrance.

607
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,756
Hey! Secure footage from
the surveillance cameras.

608
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,996
Show us a warrant first.

609
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,356
You were so busy planning and waiting,

610
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,756
I doubt you had time to get a warrant.

611
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,156
A warrant?

612
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,796
We don't need anything like that.

613
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,916
The victim directly reported
a case of sexual assault.

614
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,920
Chief Ju. Chief Ju.

615
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,920
These two are on the same side.

616
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,516
Contact Room 5 at the Seoul
district prosecutors' office.

617
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,636
This is an assassination attempt
involving a police conspiracy.

618
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,916
Submit photographic evidence.

619
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,400
Yes.

620
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,160
We lost him.

621
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,040
Okay, I think the show is over now.

622
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,156
Right.

623
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,360
See you next time, huh?

624
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,160
Wow. They nearly got me good.

625
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,676
Hey, thanks.

626
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,796
It's nothing.

627
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,996
No. If it weren't for you,

628
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,396
I would've been in quite a predicament.

629
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,040
I imagine so.

630
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,276
But where are we going right now?

631
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,116
To your daughter.

632
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,880
What?

633
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,920
Stop the car.

634
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,436
Stop the car, kid!

635
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,996
If you don't want to meet her...

636
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,316
If you don't want to meet
her, tell her that to her face.

637
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,120
Don't put her through
the torture of hoping.

638
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,556
Who ordered you to do this?

639
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,516
I don't do things like this
because of anyone's orders.

640
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,880
You dog...

641
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,276
Do you think you can get away with this?

642
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,960
A dog?

643
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,316
Even if you bring in a
stray dog from somewhere,

644
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,036
you're taking responsibility for its life.

645
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,036
All the more so if you have a kid.

646
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,076
Shouldn't you put up with
this level of discomfort?

647
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,036
You arrogant punk, how dare you...

648
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,040
Do you know where I found Anna today?

649
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,760
Dream Land.

650
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,960
Does that jog your memory?

651
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,076
When I met Anna today,

652
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,720
do you know what the
first thing she said was?

653
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,160
He didn't get angry?
Since I suddenly appeared?

654
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,840
She was worrying about you.

655
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,760
But now I know.

656
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,840
It's me...

657
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,320
It's me who was the bad person.

658
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,200
What? She ate strawberries?

659
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,836
She has an allergy, so if
she eats strawberries...

660
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,120
Yes! Yes.

661
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,480
She dies.

662
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,996
I don't think

663
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,120
Anna tried to die out of hate for you.

664
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,916
I think she realized

665
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,640
that her very existence
was a nuisance to you.

666
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,400
So she ate the strawberries
to get rid of herself.

667
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,716
If you're truly

668
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,836
doing this for Anna's sake,

669
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,600
then promise me.

670
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,916
Promise that you'll
protect Anna to the end.

671
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,520
Then I'll meet with her.

672
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,640
Right.

673
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,320
I promise.

674
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,876
Yes, sir.

675
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,396
Hey, why aren't you answering the phone?

676
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,800
Where are you now?

677
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,676
Where are you, punk?

678
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,716
Chief Ju, it's me.

679
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,040
Ah...You'll make me go deaf.

680
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,076
Assemblyman, I'm sorry.

681
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,716
We escaped to JSS just now.

682
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,076
Bring everyone over here.

683
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,000
Yes. Understood.

684
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,956
The reason I didn't
meet Anna all that time

685
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,916
was because it would put Anna in danger.

686
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,836
For my own ambition,

687
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,916
I sold my soul to the devil.

688
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,476
And the price was that

689
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,916
I lost my loved ones and
my conscience as well.

690
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,116
But the thing about ambition is that

691
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,076
there are no brakes.

692
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,396
I can only speed ahead

693
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,400
to escape from Choi Yu-jin's clutches.

694
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,560
Anna is a hostage.

695
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,956
I must attain the highest authority

696
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,316
if I am to save her.

697
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,036
If I turn back now,

698
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,036
Choi Yu-jin will think

699
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,796
Anna has no more value as a hostage.

700
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,076
Then Anna will be in danger.

701
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,916
On the other hand, if I meet with Anna

702
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,876
and say even one wrong thing,

703
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,956
Choi Yu-jin will figure out my intentions

704
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,440
and hide Anna in a place
where I can't find her anymore.

705
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,636
So now,

706
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,916
the fact that Anna came back in Korea

707
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,720
was an act of God's grace to me.

708
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,076
Accordingly,

709
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,120
you taking me here today was a bad idea.

710
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,876
But what can be done?

711
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,120
It's already happened.

712
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,760
Keep your promise.

713
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,320
I ask this of you.

714
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,756
Right. Let's go.

715
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,000
Let's go and make

716
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,800
my poor daughter even sadder.

717
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,356
Sir, what is going on?

718
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,276
I heard that Anna is here now.

719
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,076
What?

720
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,800
Ah. Yes.

721
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,716
Assemblyman Jang is
at the medical facility?

722
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,120
Got it.

723
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,356
Mirror.

724
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,240
Show me the surveillance
footage of the room where Anna is.

725
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,680
Anna. Dad is here.

726
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,356
Is she asleep?

727
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,276
No, not yet.

728
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,680
Come on.

729
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,756
So are you angry at your dad, Anna?

730
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,640
Dear me.

731
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,636
I'm sorry, Anna.

732
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,160
All that time, I was very busy.

733
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,236
But what's the matter with her?

734
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,840
Why is she here?

735
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,756
Well...She ate strawberry ice cream...

736
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,196
Strawberry ice cream?

737
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,520
-So what?
-What?

738
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,196
She's allergic to strawberries, and...

739
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,640
What?

740
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,040
She's allergic to strawberries?

741
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,556
Oh dear.

742
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,836
You people weren't even careful.

743
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,520
Why did you feed her something like that?

744
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,960
Anna.

745
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,080
Were you very unwell?

746
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,876
He's supposed to be her father,

747
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,560
and he didn't even know
she had an allergy...

748
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,596
All of you leave.

749
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,076
I want to talk comfortably with her.

750
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,680
Yes.

751
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,840
Anna.

752
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,236
No one is here now.

753
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,920
So will you talk with your dad?

754
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,160
Dad.

755
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,520
Dad.

756
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,996
Yes.

757
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,400
Yes, Anna.

758
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,040
Oh, my daughter.

759
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,120
I'm sorry, Anna.

760
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,156
I missed you, Dad.

761
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,880
Yeah.

762
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,076
Yes.

763
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,200
I missed you, too.

764
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,440
Let's see here.

765
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,956
Dear me.

766
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,120
My daughter is all grown up.

767
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,640
You could get married now.

768
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,556
Right, Anna.

769
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,596
Just wait a little bit.

770
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,876
If I become president,

771
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,516
I'll choose a good guy for you,

772
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,116
so you can go on dates
and meet up with friends

773
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,796
and live a fun life.

774
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,920
At the right time, I'll
help you get married.

775
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,516
So don't worry about anything now.

776
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,516
Okay?

777
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,756
Dad, listen to me.

778
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,036
My mom didn't commit suicide.

779
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,636
I remember everything
that happened that night.

780
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,596
When I went into the room,
my mom had already collapsed.

781
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,076
Someone flashed a light at me

782
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,116
so I couldn't see their face

783
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,560
and covered my mouth.

784
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,916
Anna.

785
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,880
All that is in the past now.

786
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,316
You need to forget about it now.

787
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,676
It's true, Dad.

788
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,076
And that woman came in.

789
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,996
It was definitely Choi
Yu-jin who killed my mom.

790
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,716
Anna.

791
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,036
You can't carelessly say things like that.

792
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,756
-Dad.
-Don't say such things again.

793
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,316
If anyone hears you,

794
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,640
my future will be destroyed,
and bad stuff will happen to you.

795
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,076
Anna.

796
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,716
Since you were young,

797
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,316
and you went through
something very difficult,

798
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,076
you have false memories.

799
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,436
No, Dad.

800
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,436
My mom cried so much that day

801
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,836
that I did give her the pills, but...

802
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,360
Anna!

803
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,916
Will you really do this?

804
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,640
Do you want to see
something bad happen to me?

805
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,956
Dad.

806
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,360
If you talk like this again,
I won't see you anymore.

807
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,396
Do you want that?

808
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,400
Dad.

809
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,000
Right.

810
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,600
You're a good daughter.

811
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,436
Of course.

812
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,560
You should be.

813
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,640
I'm sorry, Anna.

814
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,360
Please just wait a little bit.

815
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,036
There's something I want to ask you, Dad.

816
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,800
Oh? What is it?

817
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,916
Did you love Mom?

818
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,360
What?

819
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,476
Of course. That's a given.

820
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,756
That's why you were born.

821
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,876
And did Mom

822
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,396
really use me to blackmail you?

823
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,160
What?

824
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,840
Choi Yu-jin.

825
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,600
That devil...

826
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,080
Is that why you abandoned me and Mom?

827
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,240
Anna.

828
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,156
That's the world of adults.

829
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,036
I'm an adult now, too.

830
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,516
I want to know.

831
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,036
Anna.

832
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,880
All of that means nothing now.

833
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,956
Why?

834
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,516
You said you loved Mom.

835
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,120
But Mom died.

836
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,956
And I got dragged
off to a foreign country,

837
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,636
but you didn't even come to see me.

838
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,320
So why does it mean nothing?

839
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,640
Anna.

840
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,236
Dad is doing big things for this country.

841
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,560
When you do big things,

842
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,120
the small things fall by the wayside.

843
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,596
She was right.

844
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,080
What?

845
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,596
You must have lived thinking

846
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,636
your dad was everything you had left,

847
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,596
but you're not everything to him.

848
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,756
You're just a very small
and very burdensome

849
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,996
part of his past.

850
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,160
What Choi Yu-jin said was true.

851
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,760
I had a vana ilusion.

852
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,000
Anna.

853
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,116
Fine.

854
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,676
Since you had a very tiring day,

855
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,520
it'll be good for you to sleep.

856
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,036
And now, don't think about foolish things,

857
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,040
and take good care of your health.

858
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,280
In the future, I'll often...

859
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,236
Come to see you.

860
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,920
Okay?

861
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,156
Right.

862
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,116
To think that I placed my fate

863
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,120
in the hands of a man like you.

864
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,120
(The K2)

865
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,676
Please investigate
in an impartial fashion.

866
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,796
I need to pull out my real sword.

867
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,076
Why did you bring my dad to me?

868
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,840
So you wouldn't die.

869
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,000
Wait as close as possible to the target.

870
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,640
My father...

871
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,836
No.

872
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,476
Now Anna is in your hands.

873
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,236
I'll protect you in the future.

874
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,556
From now on,

875
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,400
I won't allow anyone to touch you.

876
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,920
Thanks.
