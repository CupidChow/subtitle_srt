Is Anna your real daughter?

Please make a comment.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,156
Is she the real daughter of Choi Yu-jin

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,236
and not Eom Hye-rin?

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,720
Ms. Choi, please comment.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,400
How are you feeling right now?

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,916
Please comment on the rumors.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,996
Please say a word!

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,920
Is Anna your real daughter?

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,596
Please comment on the rumors.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,956
Are the rumors true?

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,160
Reporters.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
And...

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,280
Citizens.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,156
I'm sorry that I
couldn't tell you the truth

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,040
all this time.

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,240
Everything was brought about

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,480
by my shortcomings.

29
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,760
Yes.

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,160
Anna is

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,640
my daughter.

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,160
And Anna is

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,516
like my own daughter.

34
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,956
Is she saying she's not her real daughter?

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,920
Does that mean Anna
isn't her real daughter?

36
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
Anna is

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,080
my husband, Assemblyman Jang Se-jun's...

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,756
Biological daughter.

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,960
You're saying she's the daughter
of Assemblyman Jang Se-jun?

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,640
(Angel of Barcelona Go Anna
revealed to be Jang Se-jun's daughter)

Please make a comment.

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,276
Did Ms. Choi tell the truth just now?

43
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,080
Please make a comment.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,480
Assemblyman, this will no
doubt impact the election.

45
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,560
Is what Ms. Choi said true?

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,916
I'm sorry, everyone.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,716
I will provide details

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,516
in a little while

49
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,880
when we move to another location.

50
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,480
I will tell you everything.

51
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,916
Do you acknowledge that
Go Anna is your real daughter?

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,040
Assemblyman, please comment further.

53
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,240
It's all over.

54
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
It's all over for Jang Se-jun.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,200
(Angel of Barcelona Go Anna
revealed to be Jang Se-jun's daughter)

56
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,760
No way. That crazy...

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,000
What are you trying to do right now?

58
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,560
Are you crazy?

59
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,516
Chairman Choi.

60
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,676
How could you have
managed things that way?

61
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,876
I'm disappointed in you.

62
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,080
What?

63
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,796
What are you referring to?

64
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,200
That witness...

65
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,116
The one who supposedly
saw Choi Yu-jin that night.

66
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,476
Yes.

67
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,120
He's an actor. He was bait.

68
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,480
You got caught in your sister's trap.

69
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,080
He's here.

70
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,676
Back in 1993, Eom Hye-rin and I met

71
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,636
when I was a human rights lawyer

72
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,996
and offered pro bono services
to an animal protection group.

73
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,480
We ended up falling in love.

74
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,000
And we promised to marry each other.

75
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,356
But in 1994, when I was
running for office in a by-election,

76
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,636
I was imprisoned after being
accused of hiding a wanted member

77
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,836
of the politically active Korean
Federation of Student Councils.

78
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,796
While I was imprisoned,
I heard the painful news

79
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,076
that Eom Hye-rin, who had
gone to film in the United States,

80
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,520
had married director Go
Jun-ho while she was there.

81
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,356
While I suffered this heartache
and the loss of the election,

82
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,996
the person who helped me stand up again

83
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,916
was my now-wife.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,756
It was Choi Yu-jin.

85
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,076
And the following year,

86
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,196
the two of us got married.

87
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,960
We were happy.

88
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,436
Then in 1996,

89
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,156
thanks to my wife's deeply moving support,

90
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,720
I was able to be elected
to the National Assembly.

91
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,196
That's right.

92
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,600
Your wife bought you the nomination.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,916
How deeply moving.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,756
But after years had gone by,

95
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,036
one day Eom Hye-rin, who had left me,

96
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,276
showed up in front of
me with the young Anna

97
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,400
and informed me that Anna was my child.

98
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,916
After that,

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,920
life became an ongoing
nightmare for me and my wife.

100
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,876
A nightmare?

101
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,796
My wife tried hard to
accept that part of my past,

102
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:45,036
and tried to protect our family
by placating Eom Hye-rin,

103
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,836
but Eom Hye-rin demanded
that I divorce my wife

104
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,076
and go to the United
States to live with her.

105
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,956
She said that otherwise,
she would tell the press

106
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,000
that I'd had a child out of wedlock.

107
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,600
That's a lie.

108
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,956
No.

109
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,716
It's a lie.

110
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,996
-It could end my political life.
-These are all lies.

111
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,676
But I couldn't betray my beloved wife,

112
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,120
so I had to refuse Eom
Hye-rin's blackmail.

113
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,000
Dad...

114
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,040
How can Dad be saying things like that...

115
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,356
Then one night,

116
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,876
Eom Hye-rin called and
threatened to commit suicide

117
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,760
by taking sleeping pills
if I did not come at once.

118
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,360
She had made these threats before.

119
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,240
So I didn't believe her.

120
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,040
And the next day,

121
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
Eom Hye-rin...

122
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,200
was found dead.

123
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,240
The police investigation
concluded it was suicide.

124
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,040
But I know well

125
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,240
that in the end,

126
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,160
it was I who caused Eom Hye-rin's death.

127
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,920
I've suffered from a guilty
conscience ever since.

128
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,440
People of Korea,

129
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,916
I am sorry.

130
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,240
I promoted good morals and
properly managing family affairs,

131
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
but I was unable to live that way myself.

132
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,996
All the blame lies with me.

133
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,956
But please,

134
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,120
as for my wife who has suffered so much,

135
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,240
and who embraced a child not her own...

136
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,516
Please do not criticize her.

137
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,076
Citizens of Korea,

138
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,516
whatever criticisms and
lashings you have for me,

139
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,516
I will humbly accept them.

140
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,436
However,

141
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,760
I earnestly request

142
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,840
that my unfortunate wife

143
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,440
be protected.

144
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,076
Thank you for listening to the end

145
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,320
of this foolish man's speech.

146
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,200
Just wait and see.

147
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,316
If that witness just comes forward now,

148
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,440
it'll be the end for Choi Yu-jin.

149
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,316
Okay, is this the person
you witnessed that day

150
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,840
at the scene?

151
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,636
Well, it's not like I
definitely witnessed her.

152
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,396
Come on. Take a good look, okay?

153
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,756
You claimed that

154
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,600
you witnessed her at the
scene of Eom Hye-rin's murder!

155
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,436
Well, that...I just thought that Anna girl

156
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,596
might hook me up with a good lawyer,

157
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,036
so I thought I'd be of some help.

158
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,436
To tell the truth, I'm in
such an unfair situation here.

159
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,916
You said you saw this person, right?

160
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,436
If you keep this up, it counts
as a false accusation. Got it?

161
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,116
How is this a false accusation?

162
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,956
I just thought I'd seen
her, so I said that.

163
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,436
When did I ever...

164
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,876
I mean, at the time,

165
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,796
that girl talked as if the
lady who was on TV with her

166
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,396
was the person who'd killed her mother.

167
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,600
So I said I thought she was.

168
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,080
I'm going nuts here.

169
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,036
That guy...

170
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,876
At the time of Eom Hye-rin's death,

171
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,076
he was being investigated
in the Jongam area.

172
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,956
What?

173
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,436
Oh, my head. Oh, my head...

174
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,596
Release Ms. Choi already. Quick!

175
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,120
The longer she's here, the
worse public opinion will be.

176
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,676
I mean, what did Choi
Yu-jin ever do wrong?

177
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,436
Unlike Eom, who left her
fiance when he was sent to jail.

178
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,836
Whether man or woman, a
person should have loyalty.

179
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,680
She didn't know that
he'd be found innocent.

180
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,236
But didn't Eom Hye-rin

181
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,196
come back from the
States and live in Korea

182
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,916
because that Jang Se-jun took care of her?

183
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,956
Come on. She had his kid,

184
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,036
so could the father just ignore them?

185
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,396
That would be even worse on his part.

186
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,356
And Choi Yu-jin knew all about it.

187
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,476
Eom must have gotten
a lot of money from them.

188
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,996
Right? And Eom Hye-rin was really pretty.

189
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,956
A face like that comes with a price.

190
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,920
Exactly.

191
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,236
However,

192
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,796
I earnestly request that
my unfortunate wife...

193
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,240
What did I say? I said it
was all for show, right?

194
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,000
-Exactly.
-Seriously...

195
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,516
It's scary, isn't it?

196
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,516
When they set a trap like that,

197
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,240
there's no way anyone
can avoid falling into it.

198
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,356
He was a false witness.

199
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,000
An actor my sister set up.

200
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,920
What?

201
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,156
How can that be?

202
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,556
Then was he just acting in front of us?

203
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,996
It'll be a relief

204
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,400
if we don't get charged for
providing a false witness.

205
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,436
Charged? But what did we do wrong?

206
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,076
We messed up.

207
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,556
We messed up big time.

208
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,876
Don't worry about anything.

209
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
My lawyers will take care of it.

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,920
The witness in prison...

211
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,640
He was something you set up, right?

212
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,636
Yes.

213
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,716
Of course,

214
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,840
it was a trap set so that
Choi Yu-jin could catch Anna.

215
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,596
You lay out these schemes
like it's nothing at all.

216
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,120
Do you realize how horrific that is?

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,440
I'm not sure. I don't really know.

218
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,960
There was no need to take things that far.

219
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,920
You had no reason to bring
up her dead mother's corpse!

220
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,236
Well then,

221
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,236
should I have just sat back and watched

222
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,240
the powers that threatened Ms. Choi?

223
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,480
Hey.

224
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,680
You people have made a mistake.

225
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,916
Ma'am, you've done a great job.

226
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,600
Thank you for cooperating
with the investigation like this.

227
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,156
It's nothing.

228
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,596
It's my obvious duty as a citizen.

229
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,836
Oh, my.

230
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,680
I'm even more grateful that
you'd say a thing like that.

231
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,996
The truth is,

232
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,276
we simply wanted you to testify
so your name would be cleared

233
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,440
-after that article...-Forget it.

234
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,596
Send my regards to Assemblyman Park.

235
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,120
Pardon?

236
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,036
Which Assemblyman Park?

237
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,400
Let's go.

238
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,676
Will the people who circulated
that article be punished?

239
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,076
It's true that Eom Hye-rin
blackmailed you, right?

240
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,236
So will Go Anna become Jang Anna now?

241
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,116
How is your current physical condition?

242
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,240
Did the police go overboard
with their investigation?

243
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm sorry.

244
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,276
I'm sorry.

245
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,720
Everything was due to my mistakes.

246
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,316
How exactly did Eom Hye-rin blackmail you?

247
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,316
Does Go Anna know the
truth about this as well?

248
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,120
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,236
I'm sorry.

250
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,640
Please tell us how
you're feeling right now.

251
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,756
I'm sorry. She's not in good shape.

252
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,120
What did you say during
the cross-examination?

253
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,076
I'm sorry.

254
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,280
Does Go Anna know the
truth about this as well?

255
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,116
Does Go Anna know the
truth about this as well?

256
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,996
How do you feel right now?

257
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,400
What will happen to Go Anna now?

258
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,356
Oh, just look at that.

259
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,396
She's practically on death's doorstep.

260
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,516
We live in a strange world.

261
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,956
Choi Yu-jin did nothing wrong,

262
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,396
yet they latch onto the victim
and humiliate her like that.

263
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,556
Is it a sin to be a politician's wife?

264
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,556
Truly.

265
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,276
It's a relief that my husband
chose not to be president.

266
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,000
What?

267
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,236
But without a doubt,

268
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,036
Park Gwan-su's camp planned
this to try and ruin Jang Se-jun.

269
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,116
-Right?
-It's obvious.

270
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,916
Who in this world

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,396
hasn't had a romance
before getting married?

272
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,796
If he didn't, he'd be even
more of a wuss, right?

273
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,480
Right.

274
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,996
Commissioner, please say a word.

275
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,036
-No comment.
-Commissioner.

276
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,396
How did the cross-examination go?

277
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,156
Cross-examination? What cross-examination?

278
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,396
It's widely rumored that

279
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,956
you cross-examined Ms. Choi with
a witness of Eom Hye-rin's death.

280
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,196
Come on. How can you
go the route of the tabloids?

281
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,396
Is it true that Eom Hye-rin
committed blackmail?

282
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,596
All we did here

283
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,196
was bring in Choi Yu-jin,
victim of vicious rumors,

284
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,556
and ask her to offer a simple testimony.

285
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,560
That's all.

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,596
Well, well.

287
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,996
They got me again.

288
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,320
Those two are a real
husband-and-wife con artist team.

289
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,956
Truly, I just...

290
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,600
Wow.

291
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,116
Ma'am, please recover quickly.

292
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
-Be strong!
-Ms. Choi, chin up!

293
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,320
Be strong!

294
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,720
We understand everything!

295
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,276
We'll cheer for you to the end!

296
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Be strong, Ms. Choi!

297
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,320
Ms. Choi, you go!

298
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,040
Sis.

299
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,236
I'm ashamed.

300
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,440
You're very audacious, aren't you?

302
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,200
Your acting was no joke, either.

303
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,596
Then go and wait.

304
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,156
Until I decide how to handle you.

305
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,960
Okay. Got it, sis.

306
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,036
I'm counting on you.

307
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,600
Also...

308
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,596
From now on, you should cease
your contact with Anna, right?

309
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,156
Of course. That's right. I got it.

310
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,396
And as for those underlings...

311
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,680
Who?

312
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,560
Ah! The housekeeper,
and Mi-ran and Seong-gyu?

313
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,120
You even know their names?

314
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,276
They're your employees now,
so you deal with them, okay?

315
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,276
Deal with them?

316
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,040
Once Anna is sent overseas,
do away with them cleanly.

317
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,440
Oh, I got it. Don't worry.

318
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,436
Take care of yourself, sis.

319
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,040
I'll be going.

320
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,036
Ah, right.

321
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,480
But it was you, wasn't it?

322
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,840
You killed Eom Hye-rin.

323
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,516
Are you wearing a wire?

324
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,996
What are you talking
about? In our relationship...

325
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,836
Come on...

326
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,440
Take care of yourself, sis.

327
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
(Anna)

328
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,116
Save me.

329
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,240
Save me, please.

330
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,040
I'm sorry.

331
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,640
Love isn't something to be shared.

332
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,640
The recipient is unable to
answer the phone right now.

333
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,516
I should have told you back then.

334
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,880
That I visited the prison.

335
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,156
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,000
For tricking you.

337
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,040
I really must be stupid.

338
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,160
It's fine. Okay?

339
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,436
It's fine.

340
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,960
Don't cry.

341
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,640
If you cry, you get weak,
and if that happens...

342
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,400
You can't fight.

343
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,000
Fight?

344
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,840
Since the real fight

345
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,440
begins now.

346
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,080
Your dad came.

347
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,516
Be sure to meet with him today.

348
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,120
Meet him and listen to what he has to say.

349
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,360
Anna.

350
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,240
I'm sorry.

351
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,080
Your dad...

352
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,040
is such a foolish person.

353
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,600
Also...

354
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,920
I'm a liar.

355
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,120
Everything I said at the
press conference was a lie.

356
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,480
Your mom didn't blackmail me.

357
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,000
She just...

358
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,120
She just begged me.

359
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,040
And your mom didn't commit suicide.

360
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,876
When we met before
in the medical facility,

361
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,880
everything I told you there...

362
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,640
It was all lies.

363
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,476
That woman Choi Yu-jin was watching us,

364
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:34,276
so I deliberately said things to hurt you.

365
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,796
Why are you telling me this now?

366
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,236
I don't want to hear it.

367
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,240
Because your dad is a coward.

368
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,440
I'm afraid that I might lose even you.

369
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,916
I mean it.

370
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,236
You're afraid that your
political career will end.

371
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,240
Anna, that...

372
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,440
Since politics means everything to me,

373
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,640
if I lose that...

374
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,640
then I'll never be able to save you

375
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,160
or make you happy.

376
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,800
Do you know why politics
means everything to you?

377
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,640
Because for the sake of politics,

378
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,240
you abandoned me and my mom.

379
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,640
So what is it that you want to say?

380
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,516
Until you become president,

381
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,916
you want me to stay quiet
and not cause any trouble?

382
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,880
You don't want me to defy
Choi Yu-jin, who killed my mom?

383
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,080
When we talked last
time in the medical facility,

384
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,716
you didn't lie to me because
Choi Yu-jin was watching.

385
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,080
Think carefully.

386
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,720
You meant what you said.

387
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,040
So don't be afraid anymore.

388
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,680
You've already

389
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,040
lost your daughter.

390
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Okay, let's start again now.

391
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,674
(Presidential hopeful Jang Se-jun
continues dialogue with citizens)

392
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,520
Mom.

393
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,560
I'm sorry.

394
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,840
I ruined everything.

395
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm sorry.

396
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,480
Your mom loved hydrangeas.

397
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,036
One day, your dad got drunk
and brought hydrangeas home.

398
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,160
He looked at me and
said, "Don't you like these?"

399
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,200
The truth is, I don't like hydrangeas.

400
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,716
But I still felt happy.

401
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,040
However...

402
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,356
Later, when I went to you
and your mom's house,

403
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,640
I saw a vase in the living
room filled with hydrangeas.

404
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,920
You must hate me enough
to want to kill me right now.

405
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,956
But as for me,

406
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,236
even in the moments when
I thought I should kill you,

407
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,080
I never hated you like that.

408
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,600
Since in a way,

409
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,400
you're a lot like me.

410
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,676
When I was the same age that you are now,

411
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,036
I had no mother.

412
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,036
Instead,

413
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,676
I had a stepmother who
snatched my father away.

414
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,920
She started as his secretary,
then became his mistress.

415
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,040
Later on, she even took
over the master bedroom.

416
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,916
That woman is

417
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,240
the mother of Seong-won,
whom you call "uncle."

418
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,520
But ironically enough,

419
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,120
now I've become a stepmother to you.

420
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,320
Right.

421
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,080
It makes sense that your
mom acted the way she did.

422
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,276
Your mom

423
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,040
may not have known at
first that she was pregnant.

424
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,720
She could have married
Director Go while pregnant.

425
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,640
She could have had that
baby and then gotten divorced.

426
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,880
She could've come back to Korea,
wanting to see the baby's father.

427
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,360
But the thing is,

428
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,400
what should I have done?

429
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,556
I threw away everything I
had and chose your father.

430
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,240
So now...

431
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,596
You want to say that

432
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,600
this is why you killed my mom?

433
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,160
Rather than that...

434
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,080
How nice would it be if
you'd been my real daughter?

435
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,880
Ah...

436
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,076
Now you'll become Jang Anna, not Go Anna.

437
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,560
Then you're becoming my daughter.

438
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,080
My legal daughter.

439
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,956
And I have no children.

440
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,636
So if you just stay put,

441
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,316
you could become the
daughter of the president,

442
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,716
and if you're lucky, JB Group
will become yours in the future.

443
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,076
After you've taken
possession of all that I have,

444
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,876
if you still want revenge on me,

445
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,080
do it then.

446
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,040
I don't need any of that.

447
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,360
Then just leave quietly now.

448
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,200
That's right.

449
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,916
Go to Lafeit.

450
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,396
Whether you become a model,
muse, designer, or whatever,

451
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,836
live the life you want.

452
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,076
I'll help you out.

453
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,036
There's nothing that you can do here now.

454
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,276
You can't awkwardly pretend
to be a celebrity anymore.

455
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,436
Your mom is dead,

456
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,240
and your dad isn't very trustworthy.

457
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,040
But you want to keep living
with a stepmother like me?

458
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,040
What if I say no?

459
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,956
What if, to the bitter end,

460
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,040
I work to reveal the
culprit who killed my mom?

461
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,480
Then your life will continue
to hold nothing but sadness.

462
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,036
You'll see everyone
you love die around you.

463
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,996
Mi-ran, Seong-gyu, the housekeeper, and...

464
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
Kim Je-ha.

465
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,036
As they try to protect you,

466
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,236
all of them will die fighting for you.

467
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,716
No.

468
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,120
Before then...

469
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,240
Je-ha will kill you.

470
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,956
So you don't know.

471
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,440
You don't know why Kim
Je-ha is working with me.

472
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,476
Just how flashes of
light trigger your PTSD,

473
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,316
Je-ha has post-traumatic
stress disorder as well.

474
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,880
Je-ha can't kill anyone.

475
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,916
So I agreed that I'd
pull the trigger instead

476
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,916
and get revenge for him.

477
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,956
-Revenge?
-Yes, revenge.

478
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,520
To avenge the woman he
loved, he's taken my hand.

479
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,280
They must have been engaged to marry.

480
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,796
And once he's accomplished his revenge,

481
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,320
won't he leave you in the end?

482
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,040
So don't get attached to a man.

483
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,000
I guess you didn't know.

484
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,200
You should ask your uncle.

485
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,000
You're lying.

486
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,156
You're the one who didn't know.

487
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,036
I'm leaving with Je-ha.

488
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,236
Did he say that?

489
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,720
He suggested leaving together?

490
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,200
Do you know that Kim Je-ha is a fake name?

491
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,876
You don't know a thing.

492
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,156
He's someone who can't go abroad.

493
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,316
He's wanted by Interpol.

494
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,916
I know that he was framed.

495
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,720
So that's what he told you?

496
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,800
That he was framed for killing Rania?

497
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,680
-Rania?
-You didn't even know her name?

498
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,916
But it's not true

499
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,080
that Kim Je-ha is
wanted for killing Rania.

500
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,076
In Iraq, he was charged
with slaughtering civilians,

501
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,160
and he was sent to court for war crimes.

502
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,076
If you don't believe me, ask him yourself.

503
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,316
He can't live without the
fake identity I made for him.

504
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,720
It'll only take one phone call
to land him in prison for life.

505
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,040
Do you want to make that happen?

506
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,956
Hello.

507
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
Ma'am, please give me a lot.

508
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,876
Please enjoy, and be healthy.

509
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,316
Eat up and have some more.

510
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,956
-Please give me a lot.
-Yes, yes.

511
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,356
Hello there.

512
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,960
Do you need more?

513
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,916
Do you need anything else?

514
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,800
-This is delicious.
-Right.

515
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,240
Prepare a lot so there's enough.

516
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,040
Is Anna doing okay?

517
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,080
Yes.

518
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,560
Well, she's doing okay
in a physical sense.

519
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,156
Right. What did you want to tell me?

520
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,476
I think that

521
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,080
you're a very bad father.

522
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,520
-And so?
-And so...

523
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,760
I'd like to give you the chance
to become a good father.

524
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,956
I think that's already become impossible.

525
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,356
I'll arrange for the fall of Park Gwan-su,

526
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,996
and I'll free you from being the puppet

527
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,280
of Choi Yu-jin and Choi Seong-won.

528
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,196
In return, you reveal who
really killed Anna's mother.

529
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,076
For Anna's sake.

530
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,720
So there's something there.

531
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,596
So Je-ha kept coming here all this time?

532
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,760
Yes.

533
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,160
He worked hard.

534
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,236
Well, ma'am...

535
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,836
Was there really a need

536
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,396
to give K2 access rights to the Mirror?

537
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,440
Do you know why the
AI's name is the Mirror?

538
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,596
Because if you want it
to answer your questions,

539
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,240
you must show yourself first.

540
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,316
Mirror.

541
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,516
What did Kim Je-ha ask you?

542
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,716
Current scale of weapons owned
by Kumar independent government.

543
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,036
Current development of oil
fields in northwestern Iraq.

544
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,796
Eastern geological investigation
for major oil companies.

545
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,116
Consortium list of Kumar oil businesses.

546
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,556
List of subcontractors associated
with Kumar oil businesses.

547
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,040
Stop. That's enough.

548
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,636
Combining all his questions,
what is Kim Je-ha looking for?

549
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,000
Evidence of "Kumargate."

550
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,160
Kumargate?

551
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,356
Did you name something?

552
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,636
It is the name that Kim Je-ha gave

553
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,960
to the Kumar oil field
development fraud incident.

554
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,116
If what you said is true

555
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,320
about me being freed from
life as Choi Yu-jin's puppet...

556
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,840
Then I promise.

557
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,796
Now tell me.

558
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,876
What do you know?

559
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,836
I know that Park Gwan-su and
his fellows in the economic world

560
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,480
are involved in large-scale corruption.

561
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,120
Of course, it hasn't been
revealed to the outside,

562
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,036
but the president is
also deeply involved in it.

563
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,676
Really?

564
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,796
You have grounds for saying this?

565
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,156
I'll bring you not grounds,
but material evidence.

566
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,196
-Tangible proof?
-Yes.

567
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,236
If Park Gwan-su finds out that
this evidence is in your hands,

568
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,520
he'll drop out of the
race of his own accord.

569
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,036
Probably everyone in the economic realm

570
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,480
will bow their heads to you.

571
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,156
And naturally,

572
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,316
Choi Yu-jin and JB Group

573
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,880
can be brought down in one fell swoop.

574
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,556
But...

575
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,636
What's your reason for giving me this?

576
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,440
Because you are a very bad politician.

577
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,560
You're prepared to betray
Choi Yu-jin at any time.

578
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,636
Right now, Choi Yu-jin

579
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,000
has plans to kill everyone
surrounding Anna.

580
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,800
And this is a way

581
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,080
to punish both Choi Yu-jin and
Park Gwan-su simultaneously.

582
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,356
This would be to protect Anna,

583
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,636
and to restore

584
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,036
the honor of Anna's
mother, like she wants.

585
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,036
Right. Good.

586
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,440
I'd like to try being a good dad for once.

587
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,240
Mirror.

588
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,436
Did Kim Je-ha ask any questions about me?

589
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,916
No.

590
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,516
Did he ask anything about Eom Hye-rin?

591
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,120
No.

592
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,836
I'm telling you, he's polite like that.

593
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,036
Wouldn't he have known

594
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,076
that he could not gain
any information about you

595
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,640
from the Mirror?

596
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,320
Well, it doesn't matter.

597
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,356
Mirror, what is the final item

598
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,636
that Kim Je-ha asked about?

599
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,916
A list of non-government,
non-military Korean civilians

600
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,036
who stayed in the
Kumar region at the time.

601
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,756
There were people like that in Kumar?

602
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,040
-There were.
-Show me.

603
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,760
They're just members of
a medical volunteer team.

604
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,920
(Woo Sang-hyuk/Kim
Seok-han/ Do Young-gyun)

605
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,796
What is it, ma'am?

606
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,120
Kim Seok-han.

607
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,556
Mirror, is that Kim Seok-han
that particular Kim Seok-han?

608
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,520
Your guess is correct.

609
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,120
Is he a doctor? A neurosurgeon?

610
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,280
He's his son.

611
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,920
He's the son of the president.

612
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,320
Je-ha finally found it.

613
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,916
(Kim Seok-han Doctor of Neurosurgery)

614
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,480
The core culprit of Kumargate.

615
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,716
Is everything ready for the surgery?

616
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,680
Yes, everyone is waiting.

617
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,240
Okay, let's go.

618
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,040
(Democratic Progressive Party/
National Assemblyman Park Gwan-su)

619
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,156
Oh, my. What brings you here?

620
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,756
You came all this way.

621
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,636
I have that contract

622
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,916
that you gave me an advance payment for.

623
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,120
I'd like to receive the balance.

624
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,636
Why?

625
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,276
Why? Since I need money.

626
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,436
Why?

627
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,680
So you can make a midnight
run with Jang Se-jun's daughter?

628
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,076
There's nothing you don't know.

629
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,640
Goodness...

630
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,560
Sit down.

631
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,916
But the thing is,

632
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,756
after the incident with
that troublemaker daughter,

633
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,156
Choi Yu-jin's popularity
has risen somewhat,

634
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,236
but Jang Se-jun has lost a lot of support.

635
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,316
So at a time like this,

636
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,956
I wonder whether I really need to employ

637
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,360
the services you have to offer.

638
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,996
But I don't think you can
afford to relax in this situation.

639
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,756
Is there something you have to tell me?

640
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,840
Evidence of Kumargate?

641
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,320
I think I've just about found it.

642
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,040
Right now, are you...

643
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,036
No...

644
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,040
How did you know about that?

645
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,036
I'm not sure. How could I have
found out about Kumargate?

646
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,036
Oh, and Kim Seok-han.

647
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,080
You're keeping an eye on him.

648
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,076
In the middle of the night,

649
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,876
Kim Je-ha had a secret
meeting with Park Gwan-su.

650
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,440
What? Park Gwan-su?

651
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,800
I mean, Ms. Choi... Did
you not know, either?

652
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,196
Then no way is that guy going to...

653
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,996
Leave him be.

654
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,880
It's a strategy.

655
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,516
-Chief Ju?
-Yes?

656
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,360
Provide Je-ha with backup.

657
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,560
Understood.

658
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,996
Use everything you have at your disposal.

659
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,920
This strategy will determine
the course of the election.

660
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,276
No...

661
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,360
It will change who leads
Korea's economy in the future.

662
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,156
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

663
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,436
Oh, I'm sorry.

664
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,196
I'm coming at such an early hour.

665
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,436
No need for that.

666
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,756
Rather, we're thankful that

667
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,396
you came here before outpatient hours.

668
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,080
Oh, is that so?

669
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,796
It can't be helped that even a
candidate needs medical exams.

670
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,916
-That way.
-Right.

671
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,800
Wow, this hospital is nice and spacious.

672
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,996
Hello, Section Chief.

673
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,036
Yes, hi.

674
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,840
But Section Chief...

675
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,640
Your bodyguards are too obvious this time.

676
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,760
Isn't that right?

677
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,596
Excuse me.

678
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,916
My coworkers say you guys are too obvious.

679
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,276
Section Chief.

680
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,916
There's an outpatient. You
need to go to the CT scan room.

681
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,320
CT?

682
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,876
I don't have any CT scans scheduled today.

683
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,200
He's a presidential candidate.
Assemblyman Park Gwan-su.

684
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,800
You must not move.

685
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,520
Dr. Kim.

686
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,876
I urgently want a consultation
regarding my health.

687
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,440
We can do that now.

688
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,476
I'll consult with him alone.

689
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,000
Right.

690
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,916
It's problematic if you come
and see me yourself like this.

691
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,676
Then you should answer your phone.

692
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,196
Since I came as a candidate
receiving a health checkup,

693
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,236
you don't need to worry
about how it looks to others.

694
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,636
What's this about?

695
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,040
Dangerous goods must be set aside safely.

696
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,236
Someone is targeting me.

697
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,040
It's Choi Yu-jin.

698
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,040
That camp has found out some secrets.

699
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,236
Immediately move the location
where the items are stored,

700
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,480
or get rid of them entirely.

701
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,000
I'm not sure...

702
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,916
I wondered if I should do that,

703
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,916
but seeing how you got rid
of my father's Chief of Staff,

704
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,240
it occurred to me that I
should hold onto these items.

705
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,956
Even if you end up in the Blue House,

706
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,000
the fact that I have those items

707
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,640
is something you shouldn't forget.

708
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,760
Okay, we're all done.

709
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,436
There are no abnormalities
in your scan results.

710
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,036
You don't need to visit
again to see your results.

711
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,160
Right. Thank you.

712
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,556
An ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure.

713
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,556
It's best to get healthy in advance

714
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,680
before you come down with an illness.

715
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,956
And tell your father
to beef up his security.

716
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,316
If something goes wrong,

717
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,440
your father may be hit
by a bolt from the blue.

718
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,556
Oh, where did my shoes go?

719
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,996
Ah! Well, here they are...

720
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,160
Good work.

721
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,640
I received the scan. They
made me quite comfortable.

722
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,916
I'm busy, so excuse me.

723
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,356
Please get going then.

724
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,036
-Work hard.
-Good job today.

725
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,756
-No, we'll see you to your car.
-Go on back.

726
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,480
No, it's fine.

727
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,396
-Yes?
-It's not just that guy.

728
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,040
Park Gwan-su has men at
10 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 4 o'clock.

729
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,040
Blue House men are approaching,
followed by Park's police.

730
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,476
You should head back.

731
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,316
I don't know what your plan is here,

732
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,240
but it'll be tough without support.

733
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,120
Follow me.

734
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,916
How did you end up here?

735
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,880
Ms. Choi sent me.

736
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,316
Thanks to the Mirror.

737
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,156
She said you would tell
me what was going on.

738
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,640
What's going on?

739
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,276
Please keep an eye
on one particular doctor.

740
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,116
Make it obvious you're watching him.

741
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,836
What?

742
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,880
Why make surveillance obvious?

743
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,436
Based on what I've seen up until now,

744
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,876
our target has some very important data

745
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,516
as material evidence,

746
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,040
and he's hiding it
somewhere in this hospital.

747
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,916
If it's important evidence,

748
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,036
wouldn't he hide it
in a safe or his office?

749
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,120
No.

750
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,356
Looking at the records
of hospital security,

751
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,716
there is evidence that the target's office

752
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,756
was burglarized
multiple times in the past.

753
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,880
So someone already looked there.

754
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,916
Those burglars must've been
working for Park Gwan-su.

755
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,160
Probably.

756
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,956
In the end,

757
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,916
Park is trying to seize this data

758
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,756
with no regard for
authority, ways, or means.

759
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,596
So the target would've hidden
it in a place that's immune

760
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,196
to forcible search and seizure.

761
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,276
It follows that his office,
his home, the bank,

762
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,720
and other personal
spaces are not an option.

763
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,996
Also, he wouldn't have stored
it on a computer or website

764
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,956
that could be hacked.

765
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,236
In the end, he would've used
an external memory device

766
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,120
that he could check anytime
and keep close to him.

767
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,320
Then why do you want me to
be obvious about watching him?

768
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,956
You'll make him nervous,

769
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,440
so he'll pull out his
hidden item to move it.

770
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,356
Starting with Kim Je-ha, now JSS agents

771
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,160
are all over the hospital.

772
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,240
So what Kim Je-ha said was true.

773
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,436
How many bodyguards does
Kim Seok-han have these days?

774
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,236
Normally, three are
dispatched from the Blue House,

775
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,796
and they guard him in close quarters.

776
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,916
In emergencies, police backup
arrives in the general area,

777
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,436
but since all the police
are our own people,

778
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,120
there won't be an issue.

779
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,040
Still, I'm anxious.

780
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,716
Fine. Keep an eye on things,

781
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,636
and if a situation arises where
JSS agents seize the evidence,

782
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,840
collect it immediately and bring it back.

783
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,076
Very well.

784
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,676
Or else just destroy the evidence on-site.

785
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,876
Understood.

786
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,036
No matter what happens,

787
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,756
it must not fall into the
hands of Choi Yu-jin.

788
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,916
Got it?

789
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Yes.

790
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,156
Where is it?

791
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,440
The third one.

792
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,716
Your face isn't looking too good.

793
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,436
Is something the matter?

794
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,640
I'm all right. Never mind.

795
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,596
From the beginning,

796
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,956
Kim Seok-han wasn't someone
suited for this type of thing.

797
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,036
This is quite interesting.

798
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,956
I wonder who will end
up in possession of it.

799
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,956
If it ends up in Choi Yu-jin's hands,

800
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,200
Chairman Choi will be in trouble.

801
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,236
Who knows? Let's see whether

802
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,756
that'll be the case.

803
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,196
Choi Yu-jin is rather incredible.

804
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,036
Since they've discovered
our true identity,

805
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,836
won't we need to get rid of

806
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,920
either Jang Se-jun or Park Gwan-su now?

807
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,356
Won't those of us sitting at this table

808
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,676
need to side with whoever obtains.

809
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,920
Seok-han's memory card?

810
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,716
That's right.

811
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,156
Anyway, if Choi Yu-jin acquires it,

812
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:11,356
she'll have us and Park Gwan-su
by the scruffs of our necks.

813
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,676
If Park Gwan-su obtains it,

814
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,040
nothing will change at all.

815
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,840
Then we need to decide
the successor here today.

816
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,240
The recipient is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

817
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,560
-What's with you?
-What?

818
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,800
Yes.

819
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,956
-Yes.
-Yes.

820
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,116
Hey, they found it! End of operation!

821
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,160
-Goodness.
-Good work.

822
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,760
What are you doing? Catch him, quick!

823
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,520
So it was there.

824
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,960
Who are you?

825
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,040
(The K2)

826
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,236
If we make a surprise attack now,

827
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,956
we can capture Cloud Nine
and Choi Yu-jin all at once.

828
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,920
Will you form an alliance with me?

829
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,200
Our company's fate is in your hands.

830
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,000
No.

831
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,676
No, Je-ha.

832
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,876
Don't die.

833
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,116
Let me meet Je-ha just
once. I'm asking this of you.

834
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,516
You can't.

835
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,120
Mom! Mom!
