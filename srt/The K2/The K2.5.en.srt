Dang it...

9
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,880
What's this?

10
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,640
Ugh, it's a cat.

11
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,720
That scared me.

12
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,760
You can't eat this. It's too hard.

13
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,840
I said you can't.

14
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,040
I'm hungry, too.

15
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,160
Here.

16
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,080
Is it yummy?

17
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,040
Your mom must be calling you. Run along.

Ugh, this is tight.

(Missed Call/K2)

22
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,040
No! Je-ha was calling at that hour?

23
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,120
And here I was just sleeping...

24
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,196
But what could've been so urgent

25
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,280
that he'd call me on his first night?

26
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,040
You scared me. You're always...

27
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,400
What are you doing all of a sudden?

28
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,360
What are you looking for?

29
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,680
Okay. Come on.

30
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,000
Ma'am, hurry.

31
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,160
Side dishes. Side dishes.

32
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,000
What are you planning to do this time?

33
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,240
Yes?

34
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,520
You're working hard.

35
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Come on in, J4.

36
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320
Eat with me, J4.

37
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,280
I mean Mi-ran.

38
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,476
No, K1, you eat up.

39
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,160
Yes, I'll eat a lot.

40
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,960
There's no soup.

41
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,796
What?

42
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,280
Never mind.

43
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,760
But about K2...

44
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,316
He was on night watch?

45
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,756
I don't know if he was busy or what,

46
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,560
but he finished duty and left.

47
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,996
I see.

48
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,076
If he stayed up all
night, he must be tired.

49
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,560
I guess so.

50
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,160
Ah...

51
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,876
-You're still really hot, right?
-What?

52
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,236
Seeing you on the monitor before,

53
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,916
it looked like you were really hot.

54
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,116
Are you a very warm-blooded person?

55
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,716
What?

56
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,436
But summer is basically over.

57
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,880
Why is it so hot?

58
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,320
You little...

59
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,076
You should be monitoring the VIP.

60
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,316
Why are you keeping an eye on me?

61
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,196
Mi-ran. Hold on a second...

62
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,920
Agh! Oh my goodness!

63
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,996
Wash the containers and return them, K1.

64
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
How perverted...

65
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,040
What?

66
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,396
That hits the spot.

67
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,476
What did you eat

68
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,716
that your energy is overflowing like this?

69
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,716
Don't talk nonsense.

70
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,956
People would think it was true.

71
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,596
What are you talking about?

72
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,640
You should go ahead and
score another goal today.

73
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,796
Come on, people.

74
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,156
If I couldn't even score a goal

75
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,956
with the ball that dropped
right in front of me,

76
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,120
how would I have conceived our kids?

77
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,516
Hey, at this rate,

78
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,556
won't you end up with
another kid born late?

79
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,036
What? A late kid?

80
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,196
Have the first birthday
party at the Blue House.

81
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,396
It would be a historic moment.

82
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,160
Should I hit you?

83
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,956
Okay, enough making fun of the old folks.

84
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,796
Chase your hangovers.

85
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,040
We should eat and go
straight to the bathhouse.

86
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,520
Good job.

87
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,716
But by the way,

88
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,160
why do you all look so
down these days? Huh?

89
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,676
When you go,

90
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,076
you should each take a
box of vitamin drinks with you.

91
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,076
I brought them along.

92
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,996
Thank you, sir!

93
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,676
Thank you!

94
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,160
Drink up those vitamins
and renew your energy.

95
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,200
Oh, good job.

96
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,636
Drink this and get your spirits up.

97
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,360
-Thank you.
-Right.

98
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,396
Drink up.

99
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,236
It's light. Is it the right amount?

100
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,156
I'll give you more next time.

101
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,960
Drink up and lift your spirits. Go for it.

102
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,240
Oh, Assemblyman. Here you go.

103
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,876
Hey, hey. Give me one more.

104
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,956
I can't.

105
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,916
Do you think I can take
responsibility for that?

106
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,596
Come on now. I'll explain to him later.

107
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,916
Come on now. I said it's not possible.

108
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,956
This is a delivery disaster right here.

109
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,356
You little man, seriously...

110
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,120
Right. Give him one more.

111
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,996
Assemblyman Kim has a large district,

112
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,596
so he has significant expenses.

113
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,236
Right, give him one more. One more.

114
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,436
As expected of you!

115
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,916
I love you.

116
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,796
How disgusting. Get out of here already.

117
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,796
Drink up.

118
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,160
Geez, how greedy.

119
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,916
Ah, sir.

120
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,756
I just heard news of the
passing of Choi Seon-ja.

121
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,040
Choi Seon-ja?

122
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,196
Hold on.

123
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,436
-Ah, Choi Yu-jin's aunt?
-Yes.

124
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,556
Then her husband...

125
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,236
He runs an international
financial conglomerate.

126
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,280
Ah, that's right.

127
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,956
Shall I make a visit?

128
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,476
Is there any reason
for you to go personally?

129
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,440
The place didn't even make it
into the top financial rankings.

130
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,156
I can't miss a good chance to look around.

131
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,156
-What?
-Let's go. Let's go.

132
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,680
It's not like there was a
fire. What will you look at?

133
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,436
Which one would you like?

134
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,516
Aren't they all the same?

135
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,040
All my clothes are like
mourning clothes anyway.

136
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,236
Bring another dress.

137
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,840
Yes.

138
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,360
Does everyone who dies
childless end up like that?

139
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,240
I mean my aunt.

140
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,040
She had great wealth, and she got married,

141
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,476
but in the end, she died a
lonely death in a nursing home.

142
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,036
But in her final years,

143
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,676
you took good care of
her with such devotion.

144
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,036
I was just flattering her in order to gain

145
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,876
her shares in JB Group.

146
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,356
No. Please don't talk like that.

147
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,240
The two of you sincerely
cared about one another.

148
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,680
It was just a case of
misery loving company.

149
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,236
But I...

150
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,800
I don't have a single niece
or nephew who's like me.

151
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,036
Without full makeup,

152
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,240
I look even more like a ghost today.

153
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,240
True, I ought to be like a ghost...

154
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,640
To gain an advantage in the fight.

155
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,836
Chief Ju, where are you going?

156
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,036
I was on my way to see you.

157
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,796
Follow me. Let's talk on the way.

158
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,120
What? But where are you going?

159
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,276
So, did you find anything?

160
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,876
No, I just saw him

161
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,040
giving spending money to his subordinates.

162
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,796
Don't waste your energy. And wait a bit.

163
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,080
Revenge is something that requires time.

164
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,360
Here. Wear this.

165
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,316
What is this?

166
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,760
We need to dress appropriately
when going to a funeral.

167
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,956
What are you doing out
here? Why didn't you go in?

168
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,236
Entrance to the temple is prohibited.

169
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,356
What?

170
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,876
It was a request from
the family of the deceased.

171
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,116
They're turning down
standard condolence calls,

172
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,916
and even those who come with an invitation

173
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,880
can only bring in one reporter
and one additional person.

174
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,036
Venerable Sir.

175
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,560
There's no issue, right?

176
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,516
Right.

177
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,880
Let's go.

178
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,280
You must be happy.

179
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,556
Because my aunt is dead?

180
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,556
Because your shares will increase.

181
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,276
It's a given that your aunt's shares

182
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,036
will end up going to you.

183
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,996
I'm not sure.

184
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,836
Will her husband and son
give up the shares so easily?

185
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,356
Ah...

186
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,916
He's not her biological son.

187
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,400
Well, all sons in general

188
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,480
are a pathetic bunch.

189
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,516
It's just as you expected.

190
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,240
They have people stationed
tightly here and there.

191
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,040
A VIP has arrived.

192
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,796
What is it?

193
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,356
You may need to consider
canceling your visit.

194
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,796
Our men are deliberately
being denied entrance.

195
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,236
And the financial group has

196
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,396
very tight security there.

197
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,120
What's this now?

198
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,156
Are they shooting a gangster movie?

199
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,636
They must have thought this would exert

200
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,960
some psychological pressure. How childish.

201
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,916
Let's go in.

202
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,956
Ma'am.

203
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,516
You need to consider the contingencies.

204
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,836
What contingencies?

205
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,916
If there's a clash in there,

206
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
it will be difficult for us to intervene.

207
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,716
No way. Do you really
think they'd try to kill me?

208
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,200
When I have an Assemblyman with me?

209
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,440
I'm saying let's go.

210
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,200
In that case, let's do this.

211
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,400
I will accompany you.

212
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,040
Let's go.

213
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,596
May the deceased rest in peace.

214
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,360
My sins were visited upon the deceased.

215
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,120
You're here.

216
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,840
Let's go together.

217
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,480
Where are you going?

218
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,080
Ma'am.

219
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,476
There's a message from home.

220
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,040
What?

221
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,276
You go ahead.

222
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,120
Okay.

223
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,240
What's this?

224
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,316
If things seem off when you're in there,

225
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,916
press that just once.

226
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,516
So that I can hear what goes on in there.

227
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,036
-What?
-If you think you're in danger,

228
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,240
press it twice.

229
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,360
And if I press it?

230
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,240
Who knows?

231
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,560
(Amitabha Room)

232
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,200
(Bereaved Family Meeting)

233
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,676
Yu-jin, come in. How have you been?

234
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,160
My son-in-law, this
is a place of mourning.

235
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,556
Yes, sir.

236
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,080
Come here and sit down.

237
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,596
What did you put in Ms. Choi's bag?

238
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,436
-A ball-point pen.
-Don't joke around.

239
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,596
It really is a ball-point pen.

240
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,520
MJ7081, B type, made in Italy.

241
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,196
It has a good writing feel and
no issues with ink emission.

242
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,440
The only problem is that it
has short monitoring range.

243
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,880
I wish I had no reason to use this.

244
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,396
Normally, once the process
of the funeral is completed,

245
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,116
it's common for the last will
and the testament to be read.

246
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,436
But based on the wishes of a
family that cannot gather often

247
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,036
and in order to carry out
the wishes of the deceased,

248
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,240
the reading of the will is
going to occur here and now.

249
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,276
But the truth is,

250
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,916
I do not have the key
to unlock this briefcase.

251
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,996
Right now in this room

252
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,836
is a person to whom the
deceased gave the key.

253
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,640
I would like that person
to give me the key now.

254
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,120
Do you have it?

255
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,480
So all of them knew?

256
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,840
Here is the will.

257
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,040
I will now read it.

258
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,956
1. I, Choi Seon-ja, bequeath all my assets

259
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,840
to the Pyeongchang Scholarship Foundation.

260
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,996
K2.

261
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,116
Yeah?

262
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,036
So why

263
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,996
do you have no respect for your superiors?

264
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,040
I just don't respect them.

265
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,996
A sense of respect for those
above you in an organization

266
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,036
is the most basic aspect
of our social lives...

267
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,880
So I don't even have basic manners, do I?

268
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,596
You're right. You have no manners.

269
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,956
But why do you have no manners?

270
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,076
I just said that I have no manners,

271
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,276
but if you ask why I have no manners,

272
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,796
I'll just say it's because
I have no manners.

273
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,716
Fine. That's right.

274
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,236
No problem, right?

275
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,360
-None.
-Don't talk to me.

276
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,120
You talk very disrespectfully.

277
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,880
Right. That is all.

278
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,076
She must have had a lot of
resentment toward her son.

279
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,276
Well, it's all done.

280
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,916
The lawyer can take
that and go outside to wait.

281
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,676
Then I'll go to the office and wait.

282
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,040
I said to wait outside!

283
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,040
Ah. Understood.

284
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,356
The truth is,

285
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,076
we didn't come here to hear
the obvious content of the will.

286
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,520
She turned it on.

287
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,760
Let's look at the conclusion here.

288
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,796
Right.

289
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,556
What will you do, my in-law?

290
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,476
In accordance with the
wishes of the deceased,

291
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,036
we should use that money well
in the scholarship foundation.

292
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,156
Right, Sis.

293
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,356
You can explain to the foundation and...

294
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,640
Chairman Choi. Be quiet.

295
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,400
Yes, Mom.

296
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,640
Yu-jin.

297
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,480
Don't you know that you can't have it all?

298
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,716
Well...

299
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,236
If my uncle insists on suing,

300
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,356
I suppose he could receive
a partial legal inheritance.

301
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,880
No.

302
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,276
I'm talking about the
presidency and JB Group.

303
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,080
Having both of those.

304
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,676
Let's get honest with each other.

305
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,076
The real owner of the Pyeongchang
Scholarship Foundation is you,

306
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,036
and everyone here knows it.

307
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,796
And isn't it true that you
keep an eye on JB Group using.

308
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,476
JSS, owned by the Pyeongchang
Scholarship Foundation?

309
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,516
Well now...

310
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,400
It seems off to say "keep an eye on."

311
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,196
Appreciate would be

312
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,636
a more accurate expression.

313
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,916
The thing is,

314
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,556
Yu-jin is doing that because she's worried

315
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,836
that I might bring harm
to Father's good name.

316
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,600
Isn't that right, Sis?

317
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,360
How much will it take?

318
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,676
The JB Group shares you
inherited from your aunt today,

319
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,960
and those owned by Pyeongchang
Scholarship Foundation...

320
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,000
Sell them all to me.

321
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,796
I have no interest in JB
Group, so don't misunderstand.

322
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,080
I'll give the shares as
a gift to my son-in-law.

323
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,956
Oh, sir.

324
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,836
There's no need...

325
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,876
I'll pay you double the market price.

326
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,156
What?

327
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,476
Double?

328
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,320
That much money should
allow you to win the presidency.

329
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,360
I'll give you three
times the market price.

330
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,080
This is my final offer.

331
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,156
I think this isn't a bad offer.

332
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,716
That money would beef
up the scholarship fund

333
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,116
and ease the presidential race.

334
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,720
That's right, my brother-in-law.

335
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,396
How can I sell what belongs
to a public foundation,

336
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,080
when it's not even mine?

337
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,076
Is it hard for you to make the decision?

338
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,080
Or do you just not want to?

339
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,560
Then let me help you out.

340
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,036
At the Pyeongchang Scholarship Foundation,

341
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,156
an emergency board
meeting will be held soon.

342
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,880
A new chairman of the
board will be appointed.

343
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,240
It's been turned off.

344
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,756
Among the foundation's board members,

345
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,156
quite a few people are upset with you.

346
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,436
It's invalid to dismiss me as
chairwoman in my absence.

347
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,716
Of course.

348
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,996
That's why we'll start by passing

349
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,996
the resolution to dismiss
you as chairwoman.

350
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,516
Then once the JB Group shares are sold,

351
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,920
you'll be reinstated.

352
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,996
And we will offer significant support

353
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,080
for Assemblyman Jang's
presidential campaign.

354
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,916
Shouldn't Assemblyman
Jang be elected president

355
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,116
in order for us to recover

356
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,720
the funds we've invested so far?

357
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,600
I suppose so.

358
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,996
I doubt that cell phones
will work in this room.

359
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,716
If you rest easy and wait,

360
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,880
it'll all be over soon.

361
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,556
Assemblyman Jang.

362
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,320
Shall we play a game of baduk sometime?

363
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,640
Ah...

364
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,080
Well, sure. Nothing better to do.

365
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,956
I took the bait.

366
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,036
I came here to collect the
shares of my kindred spirit aunt,

367
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,120
and now I'll lose the scholarship
foundation that's precious to me.

368
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,396
JB Group was founded by my father.

369
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,916
My father, the father of
Chairman Choi as well.

370
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,400
No!

371
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,796
Long before he took a pretty
secretary like you as a mistress,

372
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,996
when I was a child, my mother and I

373
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,876
would always take
snacks to him in a basket,

374
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,436
and he'd eat on the factory
floor with the workers.

375
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,040
That's the father who built this company.

376
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,036
I guess you overvalued

377
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,040
how much those snacks were worth.

378
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,916
-What's with you?
-Isn't it strange?

379
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,796
Don't you get it?

380
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,396
They're talking about money.

381
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,840
She didn't want us to hear,
so she turned off the recorder.

382
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,836
Right.

383
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,160
This woman would never
let her ambition be bought.

384
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,436
Start the engine and wait in the car.

385
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,640
Why? Where are you going?

386
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,956
Do you know why

387
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,956
your father didn't choose
you as his successor?

388
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,760
Was it because you're a woman?

389
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,240
That had nothing to do with it.

390
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,076
It was because he didn't love you.

391
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,596
Your father came to realize
how horrible you were.

392
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,716
He worried about what
would happen to the company

393
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,920
and to Seong-won if he left things to you.

394
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,916
Your father knew clearly.

395
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,396
You would make your husband president,

396
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,796
and with that power,

397
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,316
you planned to get JB
Group into your clutches.

398
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,160
Do you think he didn't know?

399
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,476
Fine.

400
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,400
I was your father's mistress.

401
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,276
-Mom!
-But you?

402
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,120
But you even used marriage
as part of your scheme!

403
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,076
Look at yourself now.

404
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,080
Are you happy doing this?

405
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,996
What's wrong with all of you?

406
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,120
Please stop this now.

407
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,636
What's going on?

408
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,996
I'm here to escort Ms. Choi Yu-jin.

409
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,116
Without specific orders,

410
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,720
we cannot allow anyone to enter.

411
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,836
What's going on?

412
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,996
I think a fire started.

413
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,160
What? Open the door, quick!

414
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,040
Hurry and open the door!

415
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,996
Hurry out! Hurry!

416
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,960
Let's get out.

417
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,756
Don't worry.

418
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,640
The scholarship foundation
board meeting has been suspended.

419
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,000
Let's leave now.

420
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,760
You can't go out like this.

421
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,080
I definitely didn't press
the pen button twice.

422
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,000
But this kid read it.

423
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,520
He read my mind.

424
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,160
No one has ever moved
without my orders before.

425
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,916
This kid...

426
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,440
He didn't need my order or my permission.

427
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,876
Right.

428
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,000
He wasn't a hunting dog.

429
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,920
He was a wolf.

430
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,040
He's dangerous.

431
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,120
I probably

432
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,360
won't be able to tame him.

433
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,600
Straighten your back.

434
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,556
And lift up your head.

435
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,520
Because your enemies are watching you.

436
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,156
What is this?

437
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,636
Hold still.

438
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,076
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine.

439
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,556
Damnit.

440
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,480
-What on earth is this?
-Are you okay?

441
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,320
What? The board meeting
has been suspended?

442
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,796
What do you think you're doing right now?

443
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,560
Can't you move aside?

444
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,360
My niece, Yu-jin.

445
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,240
My condolences for your loss.

446
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,680
What's this mess that's going on here?

447
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,956
You ride a different car.

448
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,476
What?

449
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,240
After you take your time
playing baduk or whatever.

450
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,076
Oh dear.

451
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,796
People enter and leave
the world with nothing at all.

452
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,520
Isn't that right, Venerable Sir?

453
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,996
People should rid themselves
of greed, shouldn't they?

454
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,400
That's right.

455
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,640
Next time, don't interfere
without my permission.

456
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,880
Got it?

457
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,760
Yes. Well, whatever.

458
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,476
I'm sorry, ma'am.

459
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,320
He still hasn't received
his fundamental training.

460
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,600
Driver.

461
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,320
Let's go to Cloud Nine.

462
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,436
Yes.

463
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,080
Cloud Nine?

464
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,356
Ma'am, have you suffered any injuries?

465
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,036
No.

466
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,356
I'm in excellent condition.

467
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,756
I see.

468
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,996
What about the foundation board meeting?

469
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,516
Right. Of course, I went there myself

470
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,596
and overturned everything,

471
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,636
and I smashed those traitors

472
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,040
and got them all to resign.

473
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,036
You did very well.

474
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,800
Oh?

475
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,600
Thank you, ma'am.

476
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,996
What about Cloud Nine?

477
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,240
Yes, it's all ready. Let's go.

478
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,236
All by himself, Kim Je-ha

479
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,236
took on the international
finance group guards in the hall

480
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,916
and sent them flying.

481
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,356
Completely and totally!

482
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,516
Oh, how cool of him.

483
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,036
And then he went and opened the door.

484
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,996
How could they withstand
him and not open the door?

485
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,596
A fire had started.

486
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,036
Right, right.

487
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,956
That guy is so clever.

488
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,396
-Yeah.
-Hey, hey.

489
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,076
Did you see it happen yourself?

490
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,600
You talk as if you really saw it.

491
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,996
The SDT department head
of the security team there

492
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,116
is a friend of mine.

493
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,476
The guards who were there today

494
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,276
all have to be hospitalized
for eight weeks.

495
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,796
This is their testimony.

496
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,236
Eight weeks?

497
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,036
That's just the diagnosis

498
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,956
you can get as a passerby
walking down the street

499
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,796
if my fist brushes against you.

500
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,116
There wouldn't even be
a settlement paid for that.

501
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,156
Oh, what a shock.

502
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,320
Go practice throwing people some more.

503
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,116
Hey, hey, I don't need to hear that.

504
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,236
Tell me about what happened next.

505
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,640
And then, as water from
the sprinklers rained down...

506
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,836
As water from the sprinklers rained down,

507
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,560
he appeared holding an
umbrella over Ms. Choi.

508
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,876
So totally cool.

509
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,676
Ms. Choi must have
become enamored with him.

510
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,476
Of course, of course.

511
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,396
Now Kim Je-ha's path in
life will go nowhere but up.

512
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,716
Yeah. Yeah.

513
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,716
You have to see how handsome he is.

514
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,280
Oh, oh, he's so fine.

515
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,676
Hello.

516
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,040
Hey!

517
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,000
Yes?

518
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,040
Are you busy?

519
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,596
No, I'm not busy,

520
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,596
but I was going to
shower before night duty...

521
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,080
Follow me.

522
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,640
I'm busy...

523
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,360
Okay. Open wide. Open up.

524
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,480
Isn't it good?

525
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,276
Yes.

526
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,120
Korean pork is the best, right?

527
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,036
But why are you suddenly buying me dinner?

528
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,036
Huh?

529
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,680
Just eat for now. Eat.

530
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,840
Here. Open up.

531
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,280
Isn't it good? Right?

532
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,040
Done for the day!

533
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,400
You little twerp, acting
arrogant to your senior.

534
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,440
Let go of me and let's talk.

535
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,156
Help me out here.

536
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,756
But the floor here is hard.

537
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,400
You! Words don't work with you!

538
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,440
Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my!

539
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,240
I surrender!

540
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,916
What's going on here?

541
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
-Oh, my head! Oh,
oh...-Are you okay, Je-ha?

542
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,760
-Are you okay?
-Ow, my head.

543
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,516
The skin is broken.

544
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,956
Broken? Oh, blood.

545
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,920
Oh, oh, I'm dying.

546
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,636
What woman puts bars of iron in her purse?

547
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,956
I'm sorry.

548
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,520
The world is a dangerous place.

549
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,796
So you shouldn't have
done something like that.

550
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,956
You, too, Je-ha.

551
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,880
Just since he fed you
meat, you went along with it?

552
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,516
I'm sorry.

553
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,996
I just wanted to improve the
relationship between you two...

554
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,596
Oh, this is unbelievable.

555
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,676
You think a woman
would fall for that stuff?

556
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,200
Does stupid fighting win a woman over?

557
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,200
Fine. I got it.

558
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,076
Nothing like this will happen again.

559
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,840
I'm sorry about everything before.

560
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,120
I'm sorry toward you, too.
For dragging you into it.

561
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,120
Sorry.

562
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
No. Wait.

563
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,196
Hey. Dang it.

564
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,360
Master Song.

565
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
What are those two doing?

566
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,876
Thanks, Je-ha.

567
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,756
This is all thanks to you.

568
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,156
How is it thanks to me?

569
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,796
It's all because of your charm.

570
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,236
Right?

571
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,440
I'm a bit charming, right?

572
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,996
But I think you should treat
me to meat one more time.

573
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,476
Oh!

574
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,756
Over that way is a place
with incredible goat meat.

575
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,036
Let's go there with her this weekend.

576
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,796
Goat meat is supposed
to be great for women.

577
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,240
Sure.

578
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,796
Why'd she use an electric
blanket in this weather?

579
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,960
If your heart is cold,
your body is cold as well.

580
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,596
Nothing comes into this house.
Will a search reveal anything?

581
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,400
Come here and grab this.

582
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,160
So that was it.

583
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,996
Since my heart is cold,
my body's been cold, too?

584
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,036
Then is Je-ha a heater?

585
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,240
You're cold because you
keep taking off your clothes.

586
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,716
Anyway, it seems that
Anna has no appetite.

587
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,440
She's not eating well.

588
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,080
You came out.

589
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,600
Okay...

590
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,000
There you go.

591
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,640
You're going in.

592
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,200
Ta-da!

593
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,520
Ta-da! Ta-da!

594
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,476
Yes!

595
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,040
Yes, yes.

596
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,880
Good, good.

597
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,480
What?

598
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,160
What?

599
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,960
What?

600
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,996
What's this?

601
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,116
What are you doing right now?

602
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,956
Hey, what?

603
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,756
Hey, seriously...What the...

604
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,756
Why are you...

605
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,040
Hey, why are you covering it?

606
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,000
Where did you go?

607
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,560
Okay, I found you. I found you.

608
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,640
Found you, found you,
found you, found you.

609
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,800
I found you.

610
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,440
I found you.

611
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,120
Oh, my. Je-ha!

612
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,840
So you came out to take a break.

613
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,836
Yes.

614
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,800
I came out to get some exercise.

615
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,556
I'm sorry I couldn't
answer the phone last night.

616
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,240
It's okay. These things can happen.

617
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,480
It was just too sudden.

618
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,160
What?

619
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,156
I mean...

620
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,796
I mulled over whether
I should answer or not,

621
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,480
and I just didn't answer.

622
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,876
But my phone is a hotline.
You should have answered.

623
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,240
Hot.

624
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,356
Line.

625
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,000
It's a hotline.

626
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,716
Yes.

627
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,920
In the future, I'll be sure to answer.

628
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,040
Oh...

629
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,596
I heard you originally
worked in Barcelona.

630
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,956
Don't even start.

631
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,876
It was so hard.

632
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,840
She kept trying to find her dad.

633
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,516
It's okay. Her dad is her dad.

634
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,160
Right?

635
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,556
Right? Yeah.

636
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,996
Come on. In a place where
even the king won't look,

637
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,076
that son of a...

638
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,796
You know?

639
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,716
But what's this about her dad?

640
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,556
She wanted to find her dad,

641
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,840
so she kept running away over and over.

642
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,000
I see.

643
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,600
-But...-Yes?

644
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,276
But why doesn't her dad come?

645
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,600
Her dad?

646
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,036
Her dad doesn't really take
an interest in his daughter.

647
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,476
Starting when I was in Spain,

648
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,076
I kept submitting reports

649
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,876
that Anna was looking for her dad,

650
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,996
but to the end, there was no response.

651
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,036
When he came to Madrid on a business trip,

652
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,716
I thought he might come,
but he acted as usual.

653
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,516
But Anna doesn't know a thing,

654
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,356
and trying to meet her dad,

655
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,276
she kept leaving the
house and running away,

656
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,080
and we kept going out to find her.

657
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,796
How pitiful.

658
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,116
Right?

659
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,360
It turns out that I'm really
a woman to be pitied.

660
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,996
At this age, I'm stuck
chasing after a kid.

661
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,120
This is how I live.

662
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,916
Yes? This is J4.

663
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,956
No issues during duty.

664
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,040
Yes.

665
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,680
What?

666
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,960
Yes. Understood.

667
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,596
What is it?

668
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,436
It's the situation room.
You're off duty today.

669
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,680
They're telling me to
take on emergency duty.

670
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,636
Yes, Chief.

671
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,120
Yes. Right now?

672
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,276
Understood.

673
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,680
Yes, the ninth floor. Yes.

674
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,036
Are they asking you to
come to the office right now?

675
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,676
-Yes.
-To the ninth floor?

676
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,036
Yes.

677
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,480
-Oh my God.
-What is it?

678
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,076
Je-ha, right now

679
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,716
you're being called to Cloud Nine.

680
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,836
Oh my God.

681
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,280
And what is that?

682
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,600
I mean, right now, Je-ha...

683
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,836
I'm here to escort you.

684
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,356
Hey, I'll change my clothes first.

685
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,040
Please go ahead.

686
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,076
Wow, they even sent a car?

687
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,196
He's really risen up in the world.

688
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,760
What now?

689
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,516
Let's go.

690
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,156
Ride in the backseat.

691
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,716
-What?
-Ride in the backseat.

692
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,476
You're joking, right? Get going.

693
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,640
-I'll set off then.
-Yeah.

694
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,120
Please scan your entry card.

695
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,760
Thank you.

696
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,600
The elevator is going down.

697
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,960
(The K2)

698
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,276
What is it that you really want to hear?

699
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,876
Everything. Now the hunt will begin.

700
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,480
Is this a good enough reason?

701
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,040
My dad isn't that kind of person.

702
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,836
It's all because Choi
Yu-jin is beside him.

703
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,676
Choi Yu-jin found out everything.

704
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,236
She's going to kill you and Anna.

705
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,760
Dad.

706
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,076
I seem to have lost my way.

707
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,040
Come and get me.

708
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,756
No!

709
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,400
Anna. No.
