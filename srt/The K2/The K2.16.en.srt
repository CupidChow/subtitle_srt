1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,040
(The K2)

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,880
(Ji Chang-wook)

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,120
(Song Yoon-a)

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,080
(Im Yoon-a)

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,520
(Cho Seong-ha)

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,560
(The K2)

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,156
Promise me.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,316
That you'll protect Anna to the end.

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,680
I promise.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,720
My niece!

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,996
As my brother-in-law's daughter,
isn't she obviously my niece?

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,040
-Isn't that right?
-You can't do this.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,040
What were you thinking

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,080
when you snatched Anna
out of Choi Yu-jin's hands?

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,356
I know it's a huge secret that Anna is

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,556
the daughter of my brother-in-law.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,436
So if I keep Anna close,

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,996
my sister can't easily take
JB Group away from me.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,276
All that time,

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,156
I was mistaken.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,076
You should have killed her.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,116
Exactly.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,676
(Yu-jin tries to kill Anna,
but Je-ha keeps her safe)

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,516
I'll protect you in the future.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,160
From now on, I won't let anyone touch you.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,280
Je-ha.

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,516
If it's a totally dangerous situation,

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,676
(Je-ha plans to kill Park Gwan-su
for himself, Anna, and Yu-jin)

29
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,756
you can just come back.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,796
Come back alive.

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,120
That's an order.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,076
No. I can't.

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,156
(But due to post-traumatic
stress disorder, Je-ha cannot kill)

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,560
He can't kill anyone by himself.

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,276
Anna. Later on, shall we go live in Spain?

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,876
(Je-ha and Anna dream of the future...

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,360
Let's go.

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,120
Now it's time to lay a trap.

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,036
A trap?

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes.

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,516
It smells of oil here.

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,036
It's not the smell of oil,
but the smell of blood.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,320
You must gradually

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,320
become closer with Park Gwan-su.

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,196
Of the tipoffs that have come
in regarding Eom Hye-rin,

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,680
this one looks like it has some substance.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,436
Don't you remember me? We met that night.

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,676
In your mother's room.

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,396
Ah!

50
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,640
Did you forget because I
shined a light in your eyes?

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,876
Did you really spread
this Internet article?

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,916
We need to do this so that

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,156
my sister is called
by the police to testify,

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,036
and in the process of that investigation,

55
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,240
they'll start investigating
the suspicions of murder.

56
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,000
Someone else's house is on
fire, but this is a house of feasting.

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,160
Yes.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,040
Anna is

59
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,160
my daughter.

60
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,876
Eom Hye-rin showed up in
front of me with the young Anna.

61
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,276
She informed me that Anna was my child.

62
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,396
After that, life became a nightmare

63
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,276
for me and my wife.

64
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,800
A nightmare?

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,000
Evidence of Kumargate?

66
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,196
I think I've just about found it.

67
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,276
How did you know about that?

68
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,760
It's a strategy.

69
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,876
-Chief Ju?
-Yes?

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,680
Provide backup for Je-ha.

71
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,160
Keep an eye on just one doctor.

72
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,316
Make it obvious.

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,516
Our target

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,396
has hidden a piece of
evidence containing key data

75
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,956
somewhere in this hospital.

76
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,796
We need to make him nervous

77
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,160
so that he takes it out to
move it somewhere else.

78
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,156
(Je-ha finds evidence from
Seok-han, but is put in danger of death)

79
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,040
The fate of our company is in your hands.

80
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
No.

81
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,236
No, Je-ha.

82
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,440
Don't die.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,396
Won't everything work
out if I acquire Cloud Nine,

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,796
and you acquire the
memory card from Seok-han?

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,320
But why does everyone think
Cloud Nine is on the ninth floor?

86
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,800
But Anna...

87
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,920
Will you really not leave?

88
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,276
Won't it be hard

89
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,316
for Je-ha to protect you in that state?

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,040
Anna.

91
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,476
Now it's time for you
to protect Je-ha, too.

92
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,236
I'll save Je-ha.

93
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,880
You just leave.

94
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll leave.

95
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,720
What brings you here?

96
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,956
Coming all this way?

97
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,760
I came to set up a bomb.

98
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,916
-I'm sorry about this.
-You dirty traitor.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,636
What do you plan to do?

100
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,156
I must capture Park Gwan-su.

101
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,040
Anna was kidnapped?

102
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,396
Let's make the exchange there.

103
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,560
I'm setting off now.

104
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,560
If you want to save your girl Go
Anna, give up the memory card.

105
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,156
Je-ha, don't get worked up, okay?

106
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,360
Let's talk.

107
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,840
Let's talk. Talk, okay?

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,076
Where is Anna?

109
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,076
Ah! Anna is at Cloud Nine.

110
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,036
She went there. You should hurry over.

111
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,840
-You drive.
-Now?

112
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,196
We can't go there right now.

113
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,720
Why not?

114
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,440
The thing is, there's...

115
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,076
Wait! Wait!

116
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,356
There's a bomb.

117
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,196
The bomb will go off soon.

118
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,956
If the bomb goes off,
everyone there will die.

119
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,076
We can disable it.

120
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,476
That would be good,

121
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,996
but once that bomb is activated,

122
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,280
it can't be disabled.

123
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,240
Even Chairman Choi doesn't know that.

124
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,000
For goodness'...

125
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,880
No!

126
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,240
No.

127
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,876
No.

128
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,596
Shouldn't you stop being
stubborn at this point?

129
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,556
Seok-han's memory card
is in my possession now.

130
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,000
Right. Congratulations.

131
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,880
Then I've lost everything, right?

132
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,156
What you said was true.

133
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,920
I should die here today.

134
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,320
With this bomb.

135
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,000
Let me ask you one thing.

136
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,840
What is it?

137
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,396
JB Group is not on the
list of consortium members.

138
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,276
How did you end up involved in Kumargate?

139
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,676
That?

140
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,276
It was a trap to catch my
father-in-law and other members.

141
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,316
I had gone to school with Seok-han.

142
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,236
But he was going to Iraq
for medical volunteer work.

143
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,116
And he provided medical
treatment for Abdul Omar,

144
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,636
the most powerful figure in Kumar.

145
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,916
So I asked him for an introduction.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,356
And I had my father-in-law set
up the consortium membership.

147
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,076
And then you dropped
out of the consortium?

148
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,036
Of course.

149
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,520
Since it was an issue
that could blow up anytime.

150
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,476
But Seok-han had
some tricks up his sleeve,

151
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,520
I ended up on the list.
As a safety mechanism.

152
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,756
What a shame.

153
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,120
You could have turned the
financial world upside down.

154
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,440
At any rate, you were at
the heart of Kumargate.

155
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,240
I suppose so.

156
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,836
But how did you know without
seeing the memory card's content?

157
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,316
It was an inference from the Mirror.

158
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,316
And Kim Je-ha.

159
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,040
Wow.

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,640
The more I hear, the more
I'd like to acquire the Mirror.

161
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,080
You bastard!

162
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,076
Okay.

163
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,636
Let's end our pleasant
sibling conversation here.

164
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,760
Take the bomb and leave.

165
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,636
Ah, right.

166
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Before you leave,

167
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,676
sign an agreement giving
up your company shares.

168
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,120
I don't want to.

169
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,436
I would be broke.

170
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,756
What's the point of living then?

171
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,640
Let's just die here together.

172
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,640
Do you think dying is such an easy thing?

173
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,080
Let us out. Let us out!

174
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,440
It's just as I said.

175
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,756
So, what shall I do?

176
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,360
Shall I open the door?

177
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,636
Those guys are in such a hurry now,

178
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,120
they won't have any scruples.

179
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,800
Shall I teach you what is
more difficult than dying?

180
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,280
Incoming call from Secretary Kim.

181
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
Accept the call.

182
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,116
Hello, ma'am.

183
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,076
We gained control of the lobby.

184
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,480
Is that so?

185
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,516
Good job.

186
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,876
But since there are stragglers
remaining in the building,

187
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,840
I think it'll take a while
to hunt them all down.

188
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,640
Okay. I got it.

189
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,516
Take your time.

190
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,516
Just a moment, ma'am.

191
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,556
Secretary Kim, we have a big problem.

192
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,676
Anna is inside this building.

193
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,916
What are you saying?

194
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,396
Anna is running away
from the bad guys right now.

195
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,040
What? Why is Anna here?

196
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,836
Secretary Kim, right before
the departing plane took off,

197
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,240
Anna was dragged away by some detectives.

198
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,836
I think it was Park Gwan-su's doing.

199
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,996
What?

200
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,076
And a call came in from Je-ha.

201
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,556
He said that Anna was taken here.

202
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,076
We rushed right over.

203
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,476
Find her quickly.

204
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,036
They mean to use her as a hostage.

205
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,036
Anyone not pursuing
stragglers, search for Anna!

206
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,240
-Yes.
-Yes.

207
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,916
Even so, what a relief.

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,040
Since she's at least running away.

209
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,076
Yes, Assemblyman.

210
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,836
We've lost Assemblyman Jang's
daughter in JSS headquarters.

211
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,116
What, punk?

212
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,796
Does Assemblyman Jang know that?

213
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,076
No. She has no phone,

214
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,236
so she won't have
been able to call him yet.

215
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,356
Why are you going nuts
and calling right now?

216
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,396
Find her already!

217
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,996
Yes. Understood.

218
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,236
If you get a call from Assemblyman Jang,

219
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,356
stall for time...

220
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,356
Hey!

221
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,036
Don't worry about that.
Find her already, punk!

222
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,440
That Je-ha guy is on his
way, so what will you do?

223
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,036
Find her quick and put
down the phone, pal.

224
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,996
Oh, seriously...

225
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,720
Come on, come on. Punks!

226
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,160
Come on!

227
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,996
If Jang Se-jun finds out...

228
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,400
What trouble. What trouble.

229
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,080
My brother-in-law is only human.

230
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,036
If Anna is taken hostage,

231
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,516
won't he give up Seok-han's memory card?

232
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,320
Who knows?

233
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,480
Will that really go the way you want?

234
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,116
Wow, I almost disabled
this bomb for no reason.

235
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,196
Tell the squad members to come in.

236
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,796
I'll be occupying this
place in the meantime.

237
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,476
Until our reinforcements arrive.

238
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,236
And if the reinforcements don't show up,

239
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,760
I can always disable the bomb then.

240
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,240
Reinforcements?

241
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,636
Fine.

242
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,076
I should send those guys off now.

243
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,080
I'll just tell our own men to come down.

244
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,516
All you underlings of Park Gwan-su.

245
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,876
You've done a good
job of waiting a long time.

246
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,640
I'll reactivate the elevator,
so all of you get out.

247
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,076
Secretary Kim.

248
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,360
The men coming up in the elevator
must be chased from the building.

249
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,360
Put down your guns.

250
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,396
Secretary Kim, what happened?

251
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,556
The building was occupied
by Park Gwan-su's men,

252
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,316
and we're in the process of reclaiming it.

253
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,876
-What about Anna?
-She's in the building. But...

254
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,436
We don't know where she
is yet, but we'll find her soon.

255
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,956
So right now,

256
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,080
guys like that are in pursuit of Anna?

257
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,560
This is just...

258
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,036
Come to Cloud Nine quickly with Chief Ju.

259
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,396
What?

260
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,676
We must find Anna first...

261
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,636
Didn't you come here to
exchange the memory card?

262
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,756
You and the memory card must be safe

263
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,956
in order for a decision about
an exchange to be made.

264
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,396
If you're captured, Anna
won't be safe, either.

265
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,000
Hurry in here.

266
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,560
Because once Anna is
found, she'll be brought here.

267
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,116
Secretary Kim.

268
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,036
Bring Assemblyman Jang
and Chief Ju here quickly.

269
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,640
Understood.

270
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,080
Damnit.

271
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,240
Je-ha.

272
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,476
Je-ha! In this shape, how did you...

273
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,836
Quick, quick. To the medical facility.

274
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,436
Hey, where are you going, punk?

275
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,080
Hey. Where's Anna?

276
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,516
Where is Anna?

277
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,880
They're looking for her now.

278
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,836
Oh, please...

279
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,160
Je-ha.

280
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,956
There's just one entrance.

281
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,720
There's no way she got out. Find her!

282
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,800
Found her!

283
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,596
No! The guys are rushing in.

284
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,920
Je-ha.

285
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,640
Je-ha.

286
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,676
Let go!

287
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,316
Je-ha. Je-ha!

288
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,640
Don't do anything
foolish, or the girl dies.

289
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,280
Stay still!

290
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,920
Freeze?

291
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,480
We've got her. Guard the boiler room.

292
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,960
Sit.

293
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,556
That was a gunshot.

294
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,276
The basement. Get down there!

295
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,080
-Yes.
-Yes.

296
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,880
Je-ha.

297
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,996
Je-ha.

298
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,356
Je-ha, wake up.

299
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,996
Je-ha, are you okay?

300
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,956
Je-ha. Wake up, Je-ha.

301
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,996
Anna. You need to get out of here.

302
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,396
Right.

303
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,440
Try to wake up, Je-ha.

304
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,040
You're here, my brother-in-law?

305
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,240
And the memory card?

306
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,076
You wait here.

307
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,956
Chief Ju, you go out and
stop Park Gwan-su's attacks.

308
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,320
Understood.

309
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,920
Mirror.

310
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,080
Turn off conversation mode.

311
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,280
Oh...

312
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
So this is what.

313
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,116
Cloud Nine looks like.

314
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,036
Give Seok-han's memory card to me now.

315
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,716
Ah...

316
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,396
Is this what you wanted to take?

317
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,796
Goddamnit.

318
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,956
I'm sorry, but I can't give this to you.

319
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,636
Since I must save Anna.

320
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,880
That will mean giving up the presidency.

321
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,240
Still, it can't be helped.

322
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,040
Even though you'd lose everything?

323
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,400
It doesn't matter.

324
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,160
We have no time.

325
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,360
You really...

326
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,156
Because of your daughter,

327
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,996
you're willing to give
up becoming president?

328
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,716
I don't know about that.

329
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,040
The reason I decided I
wanted to be president

330
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,876
was so that I'd be stronger than you,

331
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,680
since I wanted to destroy you.

332
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,316
Wow...

333
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,360
You're coming on strong.

334
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,360
You should've done that sooner.

335
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,276
Then I would have

336
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,916
seen you in a different light.

337
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,716
Still, nothing would change.

338
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,040
I would still detest you.

339
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,440
I suppose so.

340
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,320
But to tell the truth...

341
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,240
I didn't kill Eom Hye-rin.

342
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,360
And I didn't order anyone to kill her.

343
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,636
Since this is in my hand,

344
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,876
now your tail is between your legs?

345
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,640
As if that would happen.

346
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,676
In this place, taking it away from you

347
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,640
would be easier than
taking candy from a child.

348
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,396
Then why did you pretend

349
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,640
to have killed Eom Hye-rin up until now?

350
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,320
Could it have been

351
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,240
because I feared you would leave me?

352
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,000
No.

353
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,880
I probably feared

354
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,640
that I would find out

355
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,556
that I had made the wrong choice.

356
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,076
To the end, I wanted to prove

357
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,760
to others, or rather to my late father,

358
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,956
that I had made the right choice.

359
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,716
And even if it had been the wrong choice,

360
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,160
I wanted to prove that
I could make it right.

361
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,640
So you just tried to seem clever.

362
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,160
You are

363
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,040
truly foolish.

364
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,040
You nailed it.

365
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,640
I was very foolish.

366
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,996
Happiness was

367
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,080
something I never
needed to prove to others.

368
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,676
So there was no need to live this way.

369
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,080
Not for me,

370
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,840
and not for you.

371
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,276
But we've already

372
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,160
lived this long, haven't we?

373
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,800
I'm sorry.

374
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,600
For making even you live this way.

375
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,240
You're sorry?

376
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,680
Right now...

377
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,160
Did you say sorry?

378
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,240
Hold on just a bit, Je-ha.

379
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,276
Je-ha will receive proper treatment.

380
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,996
You must go to Cloud Nine now.

381
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,600
As if. Says who?

382
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,956
Says me.

383
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,556
-Grab her.
-Yes.

384
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,556
Let go. Let go. Je-ha, Je-ha!

385
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,116
Let go! Let go! Je-ha!

386
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,956
Ma'am, we found Anna.

387
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,476
Let go!

388
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,396
-How is she?
-She's fine.

389
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,796
We'll come down now.

390
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,520
Je-ha! Let go of me!

391
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
Good, right?

392
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,640
Mirror.

393
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,160
Make a phone call to
Chairman Park of Jinhan Group.

394
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,640
Lend me that.

395
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,240
Hello, my dear in-law.

396
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,196
For those of you who still doubt

397
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,916
whether I have the memory card,

398
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,156
I will send each of you a text message

399
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,716
with the account numbers

400
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,516
of your slush funds located in tax havens.

401
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,440
Please confirm.

402
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,916
Even if you don't go this far,

403
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,040
we have no doubts about what you say.

404
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,116
Then you must know that
Assemblyman Park Gwan-su

405
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,796
couldn't reveal this
information if he had it,

406
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,036
but that I most certainly can.

407
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,236
After 10 minute has elapsed, starting now,

408
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,556
if any of Park Gwan-su's
men remain on these premises,

409
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,396
I will begin revealing

410
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,196
the accounts I just
showed you to the media,

411
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,956
starting with the secret
Cayman Islands SPC account.

412
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,036
Ah! Confirm with the president as well,

413
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,840
as to whether he got my text message.

414
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,280
Goodbye then.

415
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,040
Anna, long time no see.

416
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,640
Sis, open this door.

417
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,720
What are you doing? Open it already!

418
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,840
Mirror. Open the door.

419
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,916
Sis.

420
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,120
Didn't you know I'd have a gun?

421
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,476
No.

422
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:57,040
I thought only underlings
used things like that.

423
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,956
That's right.

424
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,040
I do have a rather low-status background.

425
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,040
Well, don't keep standing
there. Both of you sit down.

426
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,316
And you give me the memory card.

427
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,436
You can't.

428
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,360
Mirror. The elevator...

429
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,800
-Deactivate the elevator.
-Elevator deactivated.

430
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,076
No. No!

431
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,840
This can't be...

432
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,040
My brother-in-law, give
me the memory card.

433
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,240
If you don't want Anna
to get killed as well.

434
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,076
What? And so...

435
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,316
Now you'll pull out our guys?

436
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,076
Assemblyman.

437
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,036
To be honest, they're not your guys.

438
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,156
They're undeniably a special police squad.

439
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,476
And a lot of our special squad members

440
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,076
have been slaughtered
since getting involved.

441
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,356
So how can I insert them again?

442
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,036
At this point, I'm in danger as well.

443
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,196
So you got instructions from on high.

444
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,916
What? That is...

445
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,036
That's not the case.

446
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,836
If you just communicate with
some people in high places,

447
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,996
then I'll find a way to
make an effort again...

448
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,600
I got it. Wait.

449
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,996
Yes, Assemblyman Park?

450
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,036
Did Choi Yu-jin give the order?

451
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,000
To pull out your armed men?

452
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,916
You're quick, as expected.

453
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,396
Did she say that again?

454
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,476
That I wouldn't be able to handle this?

455
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,596
Both of you can handle this.

456
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,040
But the one who's actually
hurting is you, right?

457
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,876
And you people as well.

458
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,000
Perhaps. You'll know if you wait and see.

459
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,356
There are now 10 minutes left.

460
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,716
The bomb in Cloud Nine

461
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,876
will be going off.

462
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,636
And 10 minutes from now,
Jang Se-jun, Choi Yu-jin,

463
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:37,356
Choi Seong-won, and the
evidence from Kim Seok-han

464
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,396
will all be obliterated.

465
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Then I'll be the only one
with evidence of Kumargate.

466
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,916
And I'll be the only candidate
left in the ruling party.

467
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,040
Do you know what I'm saying?

468
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,156
I'm curious what groans will
be coming from your mouths

469
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,880
10 minutes from now.

470
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,076
How can we help you?

471
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,396
Cut off the power and all
communications connections

472
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,036
to JSS headquarters immediately.

473
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,756
That is how you people and I can survive.

474
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,076
Just 10 minutes should be enough.

475
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,040
Cut it off at once.

476
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,840
Je-ha! You must not move.

477
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,236
Everyone needs to get
out of here right now.

478
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,276
Why?

479
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,400
A bomb is going off. In Cloud Nine.

480
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,080
Hurry.

481
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,080
Yes, Chief Ju?

482
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,080
What?

483
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,440
The time bomb can't be stopped?

484
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,516
Right. I think Park Gwan-su
tricked Chairman Choi.

485
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,480
You must quickly escape from there.

486
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,160
Park Gwan-su, that dog!

487
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,796
Sis. Sis! The elevator
needs to be activated.

488
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
We have no time, okay? Sis.

489
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,636
Mirror. Mirror. Activate
the elevator, okay?

490
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,076
The Mirror only listens to me.

491
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,436
Sis, you must go to a
hospital. Tell the Mirror already.

492
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,836
Sis. We have no time. Sis!

493
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,040
Shameless lout.

494
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,720
Mirror. The elevator...

495
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,200
External power has been cut off.

496
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,320
A temporary power
supply has been activated.

497
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,040
What?

498
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,276
What about the elevator?

499
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,556
Its operation has been suspended.

500
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,556
Lines of communication as well?

501
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,160
Yes.

502
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,800
Congratulations.

503
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,920
This must be what your reinforcements did.

504
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,996
You need not worry.

505
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,720
Your subordinates will come to rescue you.

506
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,436
Anna.

507
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,076
Can you come here and
hold this for a moment?

508
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,640
I'll go out and assess the situation.

509
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,520
Anna?

510
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,240
If you're a human being,
you should have some shame.

511
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,080
Forget it.

512
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,680
Don't do it.

513
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,840
Congratulations.

514
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,040
Your wish has come true.

515
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,116
Don't keep talking.

516
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,120
It keeps bleeding.

517
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,640
I guess I'll die like this.

518
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,836
That's right.

519
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,960
Your mom was dying back then, too.

520
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,040
When I arrived...

521
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,640
It was already too late.

522
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,200
Like you,

523
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,840
I once had a father.

524
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,760
But the funny thing about fathers is,

525
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,240
they're never around when you need them,

526
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,000
and they always interfere
when you don't need them.

527
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,036
When my father found out
about your mother's existence,

528
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,800
he just had to go and interfere.

529
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,760
I tried hard to stop him.

530
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,080
But in the end,

531
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
he ordered someone close to him

532
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,040
to kill your mother.

533
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,000
For his daughter's sake.

534
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,480
Was it Master Song?

535
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,400
So you knew.

536
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,120
Yes, you were right.

537
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,960
I'm sorry.

538
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,600
Mom? Mom?

539
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,000
Mom?

540
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
Mom?

541
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:38,000
I learned of my father's
orders and went there myself,

542
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,360
but it was too late.

543
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,280
And I knew that behind the door,

544
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,000
Master Song was holding onto you.

545
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,196
But...

546
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,000
I couldn't get myself
to turn around and look.

547
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,680
Your face...

548
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,040
I was afraid I'd see your face.

549
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,716
And I turned and left.

550
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,480
That's right.

551
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,720
Your mother

552
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,520
asked me to save her.

553
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,280
Save me.

554
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,476
For a moment,

555
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,320
a very short moment...

556
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,120
I wondered if I should
call emergency services.

557
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,280
But...

558
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,840
I couldn't do it.

559
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,160
Save me.

560
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,400
I'm sorry.

561
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,440
Love is not meant to be shared.

562
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,040
And I coldly turned around.

563
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,240
It's possible I could have saved her.

564
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,920
It's true that I killed your mother.

565
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,120
And after that,

566
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,920
I lived like my father did.

567
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,836
No...

568
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,320
Worse than he did.

569
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,240
On the day your mother died,

570
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,160
there was a devil within me,

571
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,000
and I obeyed its whispering.

572
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,920
That's right.

573
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,000
But take your hand away now.

574
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,440
I'm...

575
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,960
I'm the enemy who killed your mother.

576
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,476
What will you do?

577
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,316
There's not much time left.

578
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,840
We need to get down there quickly.

579
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,436
Give me the rope.

580
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,916
Come down to the lowest floor with me.

581
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,640
It's closest to Cloud Nine. Follow me.

582
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,916
Ah, Chief Ju.

583
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,276
Call a few more people.

584
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,640
So that we can be pulled up from below.

585
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,720
Team Leader Seo, I need manpower.

586
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,080
The stairs end here.

587
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,120
They dug quite deep.

588
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,556
Master Song, first you wait here.

589
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,596
If we're getting people pulled up,

590
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,796
we'll need the hands up here.

591
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,160
Yeah, okay.

592
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,876
Je-ha.

593
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,276
If I send the signal, pull
the rope up right away.

594
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,080
Got it. Be careful.

595
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,600
He's really afraid of nothing.

596
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,040
Oh, Choi Yu-jin.

597
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,480
Hey!

598
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,840
You all have to get out of...

599
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,840
Je-ha. Je-ha.

600
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,876
Ah, so now you show your true colors.

601
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,316
We'll go up first.

602
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,996
Anna, let's go.

603
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,956
No. Let go. Let go!

604
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,600
Hey!

605
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

606
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,440
Anna will get hurt, okay?

607
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,356
Yes, Kim Je-ha.

608
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,076
Send those two up first.

609
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,520
And...

610
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,956
This person will need to be carried.

611
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,120
You heard, right?

612
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,200
You lead the way.

613
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,436
Won't two people be a
bit heavy to get pulled up?

614
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,436
You two come up after I do.

615
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,120
-Hey, pull us up!
-No, send Anna up first.

616
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,440
But there's no time.

617
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,080
Je-ha!

618
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,640
Hey! Pull up quick!

619
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,440
Je-ha.

620
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,040
Don't move.

621
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,040
I said don't move.

622
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,080
No. No.

623
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,880
What about Anna?

624
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,276
If you people want to live,
don't do anything foolish.

625
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,240
-There are three minutes left.
-What?

626
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,436
Hey, what are you doing?

627
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,996
What do you think you're doing?

628
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,440
Move!

629
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,076
Crazy bastard! How could...

630
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,276
Dang it...

631
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,316
What are we supposed to do now?

632
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,796
You have guns, right?

633
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,956
-K2!
-Yes, we do.

634
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,516
Okay. Just wait one minute.

635
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,840
I'll contact you on radio,
so cut the cable then.

636
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,280
Cut the cable?

637
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,360
We can't cut the cable.

638
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,036
Got it.

639
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,116
I'm going now.

640
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,600
Je-ha.

641
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,240
You need to get out of here.

642
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,076
Je-ha.

643
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,276
There's no time. You need to leave.

644
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,120
Stop this.

645
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,276
It's too late.

646
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,120
We have to get out fast! There's no time!

647
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,240
Okay, let's go.

648
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:59,040
Do I have anywhere left to go?

649
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,120
I want to rest now.

650
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,240
Carry Secretary Kim out.

651
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,760
I was wrong.

652
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,240
Go quickly.

653
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,640
Save Anna.

654
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,996
Assemblyman, get Secretary
Kim and board the elevator quickly.

655
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,636
Right now the elevator...

656
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,440
Hurry! There's no time!

657
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,880
Go.

658
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,320
Go.

659
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,996
Even if we can't go up, we can go down.

660
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,956
Go down?

661
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,196
There's a safety mechanism
in case of elevator freefall.

662
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,040
Je-ha. Get up.

663
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,596
If we descend to the safe
space, even if the bomb goes off,

664
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,596
the shock will only move
upwards, so we can survive.

665
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,996
Is that true?

666
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,240
It's what I think...I could be wrong.

667
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,120
Just bear up a little longer.

668
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,120
Hurry.

669
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,360
Okay, everyone get ready.

670
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,240
Cut the cable now!

671
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,840
Okay, shoot now! Hurry!

672
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,040
Dad.

673
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,356
Dad. Where are you going? Dad. Dad!

674
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,080
What are you doing right now?

675
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,116
I can't save you this way.

676
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,036
I need to dampen the explosion.

677
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,516
What are you going to do?

678
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,116
Anna.

679
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,920
Up until now, you've
lived fine without me.

680
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,680
So you'll be able to
live just fine in the future.

681
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,720
To tell the truth, someone like your dad

682
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,560
doesn't need to be around.

683
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,040
As for my daughter Anna...

684
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,040
Take good care of her.

685
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,760
Dad, no! Dad...

686
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,480
How did you end up coming back?

687
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,240
I'll bring this inside.

688
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,240
That way, the explosion will
be dampened at least a bit.

689
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,720
You said this glass box

690
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,080
was very sturdy.

691
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,240
Hurry out of here.

692
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,240
And close the door.

693
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:16,120
Close the door.

694
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,280
Mirror.

695
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,040
Close the door.

696
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,240
Tight.

697
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,480
On the way to see the angel of death,

698
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,840
let's go there together.

699
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,720
Seeing us this way,

700
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,240
it's like we're a happy married couple.

701
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,640
I'll say.

702
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,880
Are you okay?

703
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,996
K2. K2.

704
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,480
Answer, K2.

705
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,716
This is Team Leader Seo.

706
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,516
-Please. Please.
-K2. K2.

707
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,280
This is Team Leader Seo. Answer me.

708
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,476
This is Team Leader Seo.

709
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,520
K2, answer me!

710
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,720
K2.

711
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,880
K2!

712
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,920
This is Team Leader Seo.

713
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,760
Je-ha.

714
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,800
Please answer. Please.

715
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,960
Please!

716
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,160
This is K2. This is K2.

717
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,440
Answering. Over.

718
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,636
Miss. Miss, are you okay?

719
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,440
What about K2?

720
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,236
Get me out of here quick.

721
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,716
The pain is killing me.

722
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,356
Over.

723
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,076
They're alive. They're alive.

724
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,756
-They're alive.
-They did it.

725
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,600
They're alive.

726
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,596
Does the witness swear
to only offer true testimony

727
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,160
regarding the Blackstone
slaughter of civilians?

728
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,400
Yes, I swear.

729
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,240
Oh, this is nice.

730
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,600
It's cold.

731
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,720
You two are having fun.

732
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,556
What will become of us now?

733
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,200
Anna inherited everything
and moved to the estate,

734
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,676
but will she ever call us again?

735
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,156
After the funeral for
Assemblyman Jang and Ms. Choi,

736
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,880
we haven't seen hide or hair of her.

737
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,476
There's no way she's ignoring us, right?

738
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,756
No way.

739
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,160
All I need is you.

740
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,160
All I need is not you two.

741
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,076
So Anna is the sole heir

742
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,276
of Choi Yu-jin and Jang Se-jun.

743
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,036
That's right.

744
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,916
Then the Pyeongchang
Scholarship Foundation also...

745
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,876
Correct.

746
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,116
But without Cloud Nine,

747
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,160
there's not much she can do.

748
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:59,960
But she has the memory card,
which is a greater menace to us.

749
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:05,120
She won't use that to do anything nasty.

750
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,516
You think it's unlikely?

751
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,076
Once someone gets a taste of power,

752
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,676
they can't give it up easily.

753
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:17,516
Wasn't Choi Yu-jin once
an innocent young girl, too?

754
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,956
Girls grow up that way

755
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,040
and then turn into witches.

756
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,476
But still,

757
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,516
she's young and has no father or mother.

758
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,516
What can she do all by herself?

759
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,956
Wait and see.

760
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,120
Soon she'll contact
me and want to bargain.

761
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:19,840
Yes, yes. Just wait comfortably.

762
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,880
Let's get going, okay?

763
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,040
You've been through a lot of trouble.

764
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,720
Oh, I'm alive. I'm alive.

765
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,240
I thought I was dying, punk.

766
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,120
Hey! Hey, what's this?

767
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,640
You can stop now.

768
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,396
I never...

769
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,040
I never even dreamed I'd commit suicide.

770
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,796
What can be done?

771
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,120
The world has changed overnight.

772
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,040
Did your testimony go well?

773
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,960
Yeah.

774
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,836
What about your identity?

775
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,240
Has your name been cleared?

776
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,040
Yeah. Now we're able
to go wherever we want.

777
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,316
Great.

778
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,996
So how was today for you?

779
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,996
Was it fun?

780
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,316
No.

781
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,276
I lived like Choi Yu-jin
did when she was alive.

782
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,476
It's no fun at all.

783
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,240
I don't know how she kept living that way.

784
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,160
-Shall we eat then?
-Yeah.

785
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,356
You love this place. You're always here.

786
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,160
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

787
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,956
-Anna.
-Yes?

788
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,160
You really won't regret it?

789
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,520
I won't.

790
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,956
But you really need to consider carefully.

791
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,396
If you press this key,

792
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,956
you'll be giving up all the authority

793
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,876
you inherited from Choi Yu-jin.

794
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,516
Why are even you acting like this?

795
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,000
Secretary Kim already
keeps trying to persuade me.

796
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,956
Okay, good.

797
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,076
Now...

798
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,240
You can just press the "Enter" key.

799
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,596
-This?
-Yeah.

800
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,516
If you press this, do
you know what'll happen?

801
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,160
The financial and economic
realms of Korea will be...

802
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,480
(Sending email)

803
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,636
Ah, what's with you?

804
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,996
You should savor such a historic moment,

805
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,396
and do it together with me...

806
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,796
No need. I don't want to
savor that kind of thing.

807
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,436
Look at you.

808
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,040
Just doing whatever you please. Gosh...

809
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,040
What? What? Well?

810
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,320
What?

811
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:41,716
Look at this. You always
just do as you please.

812
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,840
In everything, it's not about
what I want, but what you...

813
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,196
But Anna...

814
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,076
Don't you regret it?

815
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,756
Regret what?

816
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,960
Not being able to restore
your mother's reputation.

817
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,440
No.

818
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,200
Instead, I got a father.

819
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,276
Je-ha.

820
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,720
Yeah?

821
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,280
I love you.

822
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,120
I know.

823
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,520
Gosh...

824
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,036
Hey, Kim Je-ha.

825
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,360
What?

826
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,760
What's your real name?

827
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,040
Me?

828
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,440
Truthfully, my real name is...

829
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,320
(Thank you to everyone who
showed 'The K2' their love)

830
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,000
