1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,040
(The K2)

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,880
(Ji Chang-wook)

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,120
(Song Yoon-a)

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,080
(Im Yoon-a)

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,520
(Cho Seong-ha)

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,560
(The K2)

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,236
Well, this is just...

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,000
Lots of pals here, huh?

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,960
You're working hard.

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,640
Good job.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,200
(Do not enter)

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,600
I don't

13
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,040
want you to worship me.

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,000
I just...

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,120
-I just...-You just wanted to own me.

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,320
Like one more slave.

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,920
What's going on?

18
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
Intruders detected.

19
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,156
Wow.

20
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,960
This is quite the place.

21
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,160
Mirror, lock the door.

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,240
But this is a bomb.

23
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,560
They can't hear you from inside.

24
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,000
That's a bomb.

25
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,120
That son of a...

26
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
Let's talk. I can't hear, okay?

27
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,800
Mirror.

28
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,356
Turn on the exterior conversation mode.

29
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,280
Please speak.

30
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,316
What's this about?

31
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,680
Coming with no notice.

32
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,076
Sir.

33
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,956
If you're inviting a guest,
you should tell me in advance.

34
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,916
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

35
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,796
Out of loyalty to this company...

36
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,156
Shut your mouth!

37
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,516
Come on, sis.

38
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Our eardrums will burst.

39
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,080
Shh!

40
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,036
What's going on?

41
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,280
Starting now, listen to me carefully.

42
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,716
Right then.

43
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,316
What is it that brings you here?

44
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,040
Me? I came to set up the bomb.

45
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,676
Take a look.

46
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,080
Hey, open it up.

47
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,920
Okay...

48
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,520
Just a second.

49
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,160
Everyone is watching.

50
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,440
Okay...

51
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,236
It's done now.

52
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,560
Two hours is enough,
right? For us to talk.

53
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,040
Mirror, turn off conversation mode.

54
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,960
Where is Anna right now?

55
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,996
You're worried about
Anna every single moment?

56
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,036
I asked where she is.

57
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Anna.

58
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,076
Right about now, she's
probably on a plane.

59
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,200
Or she could still be at the airport.

60
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,400
She left to go to Lafeit.

61
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,996
That's fine.

62
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,916
Out of everything you've done to Anna,

63
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
this was the best so far.

64
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,800
Mirror, turn conversation mode back on.

65
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,996
You must have come to
take control of Cloud Nine.

66
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,916
Oh. Kim Je-ha.

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,080
How are you doing
physically? I see you're alive.

68
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,236
Your family fights get pretty rough.

69
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,640
Our family has always been like that.

70
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,720
Ah, sis, answer your phone.
It's my business partner.

71
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,800
-Who is it?
-A video chat with Park Gwan-su.

72
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,240
Display it.

73
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,480
I don't know if you're
doing too well, Ms. Choi.

74
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,396
As you can see.

75
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,880
This time, my knight
has captured the queen.

76
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,876
And so?

77
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,556
Did you send him to kill me?

78
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,236
Oh, my. How can you say such scary things?

79
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,916
To some extent,

80
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,716
don't politicians need to
solve their problems by talking?

81
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,036
Oh...

82
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,400
While holding a gun in one hand?

83
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,036
That's the right way to talk.

84
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,556
Like last time.

85
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,080
Remember? When I almost got killed.

86
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,076
Right.

87
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,916
What do you want from me this time?

88
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,276
All I need is that memory
card from Kim Seok-han.

89
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,156
It's very simple, right?

90
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,800
And all I need is Cloud Nine.

91
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,680
Mirror, turn off conversation mode.

92
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,680
Just tell them honestly
that you don't have it.

93
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,840
To accomplish what?

94
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,200
We need to catch him.

95
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,280
Mirror, turn conversation mode back on.

96
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,076
You're only asking for the impossible.

97
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,716
First of all,

98
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,276
I can't give you Seok-han's memory card.

99
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,836
Since I don't have it.

100
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,000
What?

101
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,596
Is that true?

102
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,796
Yes, it's true.

103
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,040
That Kim Je-ha guy hasn't given it up yet.

104
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,236
If you just give me a bit of time,

105
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,160
I can find out about it quickly.

106
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,996
Hey, mercenary. You
haven't handed it over yet?

107
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,320
That's right.

108
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,956
If it weren't for that guy
taking it away from me,

109
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,800
it would be in your hands already.

110
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,916
And I wouldn't have ended up like this.

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,716
Why did you do that? You didn't
want to give me my remaining pay?

112
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,676
Come on.

113
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,756
Come on, that's a misunderstanding.

114
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,120
Would I ever give orders like that?

115
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,996
That was all due to the
pointless, emotional fighting

116
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,516
of those young guys.

117
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,876
You beat that guy up so much before.

118
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,556
He was practically destroyed.

119
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,796
Well, he did get pretty beaten up.

120
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,316
Remaining pay? As in money?

121
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,116
So that guy was teamed up
with Assemblyman Park Gwan-su?

122
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,920
Yes.

123
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,160
I hired him.

124
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,436
Ms. Choi. Does this mean

125
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,440
you lied to the consortium?

126
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,520
What?

127
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,720
I'm sorry about this.

128
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,440
You dirty traitor.

129
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,276
What are you planning to do?

130
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,876
That's why I said not to touch Anna.

131
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,996
I need to catch Park Gwan-su.

132
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,840
That is one scary fellow.

133
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,280
And our poor Ms. Choi didn't even know...

134
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,476
Well then,

135
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,356
did you lose that memory card?

136
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,196
No.

137
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,716
I'm keeping it safe.

138
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,080
Can you bring it to me now?

139
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,956
What about my remaining pay?

140
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,996
Oh, of course I'll give it to you.

141
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,000
And a fat bonus as well.

142
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,636
Bring it quickly.

143
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,116
-You know where it is, right?
-Of course.

144
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,596
Then my business here is over.

145
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,916
The brother and sister pair
can have a fun chat now.

146
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,040
I'll be going then.

147
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,716
Miss.

148
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,480
Here's your ticket.

149
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,080
I checked all your luggage, too.

150
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,120
Thanks.

151
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
Mirror, turn off conversation mode.

152
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,716
In that condition...

153
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,596
Can you do this?

154
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,120
Send Chief Ju to the scene.

155
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,916
Right.

156
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,680
And...

157
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,800
I won't be coming back.

158
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,396
Give up Cloud Nine and come out.

159
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,996
I think then, you'll probably become

160
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,120
happier than you are now.

161
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,760
I can't give up the Mirror.

162
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,640
Because the Mirror...

163
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,600
It's me.

164
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,276
Right.

165
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,996
It must be that way.

166
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,600
You can't give up the Mirror because

167
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,040
it gives you so much power.

168
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,640
That's right.

169
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,000
So you've realized it, too.

170
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,276
That's why

171
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,440
I gave you access rights to the Mirror.

172
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,996
Look at him.

173
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,956
He's head of a conglomerate
and lacking for nothing,

174
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,880
and yet he's trying so
hard to acquire the Mirror.

175
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,000
However...

176
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,080
This is

177
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,880
already yours.

178
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,960
If anyone experiences
the power of the Mirror,

179
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,836
they will become a prisoner

180
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,120
to their desire to have
Cloud Nine for themselves.

181
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,676
And so you,

182
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,636
as the witch who rules Cloud Nine,

183
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,080
have yourself become
a prisoner of Cloud Nine.

184
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,320
Just walk out of here.

185
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,956
As for Chairman Choi and Park Gwan-su,

186
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,720
I'll find a way to topple them.

187
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,600
We should have met

188
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,400
at a better time, in a better way.

189
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,280
Goodbye.

190
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,640
Mirror, turn conversation mode back on.

191
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,720
Hey, you people move back.

192
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,640
Mirror, when this door
opens and I come out,

193
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,036
close the door quickly.

194
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,080
Yes, quickly.

195
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,000
Open it.

196
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,956
Will you be okay? In that state?

197
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,640
Enough talking. Let's go.

198
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,440
You take the lead.

199
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,120
Okay, shouldn't we handle
our business as well, sis?

200
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,796
When you arrive, there will
be someone there to meet you.

201
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,160
Right.

202
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,276
Miss, don't erase my number. Hang onto it.

203
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,236
Since I definitely won't change my number.

204
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,760
Of course. Why would I erase it?

205
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,600
There are such curious
affections in life...

206
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,720
All I did were cruel things
like watch you and confine you,

207
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,640
but in the end there's
this affection between us.

208
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,960
I wanted to be good to you
now, but in the meantime...

209
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,236
Don't cry. If you keep that up,
how am I supposed to leave?

210
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,036
That's right. Don't keep crying.

211
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,356
I mean, Anna is going
away to move up in the world.

212
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,040
Yes. Right.

213
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,156
Miss.

214
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,480
Live your life freely in the
great big world out there.

215
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,360
Forgive me, too.

216
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,796
Call when you arrive.

217
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,320
Right.

218
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,600
This time as well, my dad hasn't come.

219
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,760
As for Je-ha...

220
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,076
Take good care of him.

221
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,000
Have you forgotten that
I tried to kill both of you?

222
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,000
No, not yet.

223
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,040
But I'll try hard to forget.

224
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,520
It's time. Get going now.

225
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,280
Go to the parking lot of St.
Thomas Hospital in Seoul.

226
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,400
Mirror.

227
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,636
Did Je-ha head out?

228
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,080
Yes.

229
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,680
Right.

230
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,040
So he left.

231
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,156
Then to start with,
shut down the elevator.

232
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,680
And block all communication
with the outside.

233
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,920
Check it.

234
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,560
The door won't open.

235
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,716
Come on. Why act like this?

236
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,556
Sis, I told you this is a bomb.

237
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,836
Okay, Mirror.

238
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,836
Connect the surveillance video feed here

239
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,840
with Secretary Kim's cell phone.

240
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,240
What?

241
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,356
What's this?

242
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,636
Hurry and drive us to JSS.

243
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,516
And gather all the
manpower we have outside.

244
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,996
Yes.

245
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,556
This is B1. This is B1.

246
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,956
All security personnel,
assemble at headquarters.

247
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:39,120
Well, the live broadcast has now begun.

248
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,196
So now,

249
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,240
shall we start the game?

250
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,240
Mirror.

251
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,476
Where do the grandchildren of
President Guk of JSS live now?

252
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,836
San Diego, on the west
coast of the United States.

253
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,476
Right. Send an email
with the kids' address

254
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,916
to our contractors in the United States.

255
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,996
And send them a cash
transfer that can't be canceled.

256
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,000
Since I won't be alive
for even two more hours,

257
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,956
tell them they'll receive double
if they do it within an hour.

258
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,080
What? Just a moment, ma'am!

259
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,756
I've made a terrible mistake.

260
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,920
Mirror, hold on for a second.

261
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,236
Ma'am, I'm the one who deserves to die.

262
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,040
Someone like me should die. Yes, yes...

263
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,356
But ma'am,

264
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,876
for the sake of JB Group,

265
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,956
I just didn't want you and
Chairman Choi fighting...

266
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,000
And so you betrayed me?

267
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,996
-Mirror.
-Ma'am!

268
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,996
Can't you please give me

269
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,876
just one more chance?

270
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,756
Didn't I act on the late chairman's orders

271
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,080
to clean up the mess
after Eom Hye-rin's death?

272
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,596
And because of that,

273
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,836
didn't you become a director
and then the head of JSS?

274
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,880
Yes! Yes, I'll die.

275
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,320
But...

276
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,076
My grandchildren...

277
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,836
What wrong did those young kids ever do?

278
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,480
Is that so?

279
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,880
Yes, the kids did nothing wrong.

280
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,080
Right. I got it.

281
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,640
Then die right here, right now.

282
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,040
I'll spare your grandchildren.

283
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,240
You don't want that?

284
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,480
No, I'll do it.

285
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,520
Ma'am.

286
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,400
Thank you.

287
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,480
I'll repay this debt in hell.

288
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,160
Seong-won.

289
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,080
Did you see that?

290
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,440
This is the way to use Cloud Nine.

291
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,036
Well, sis.

292
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,160
As expected, this is so like you.

293
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,276
Don't be too happy.

294
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,360
Since you're next.

295
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,920
You squad members back there.

296
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,040
Shoot Choi Seong-won, who's next to you.

297
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,836
What are you saying?

298
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,156
The first person to shoot him

299
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,040
will immediately receive
a deposit of $1 million.

300
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,916
Nice.

301
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,600
To avoid any awkwardness,
I'll give you $1 million each.

302
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,156
Hey, hey. Hold on, hold on.

303
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,756
I'm way richer than she is.

304
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,876
I'm the chairman of a major conglomerate.

305
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,840
Gosh, that surprised me.

306
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,316
And I'm the only one who
knows the password for this bomb.

307
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,236
Since it's connected to a tracking device,

308
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,720
if I go and leave it
here, it'll just blow up.

309
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,560
Isn't that right?

310
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,996
Really? I got it.

311
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,676
Then we'll call it off for now.

312
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,516
Hey.

313
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,476
That was a good attempt.

314
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,000
But did you think I
was that short-sighted?

315
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,280
At any rate, you're going to die today.

316
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,476
Would you people step out?

317
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,956
So that we can talk.

318
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,076
Right. Everyone go wait outside.

319
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,040
And bring out President Guk as well.

320
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,080
Right.

321
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,520
You prepared well.

322
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,040
One can never truly know a person.

323
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,076
Soon those squad members
will point their guns at you,

324
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,196
telling you to disable the bomb.

325
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,276
And once you disable it,

326
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,676
they'll ask me to reactivate the elevator.

327
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,120
In return for killing you.

328
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,596
You made a mistake coming in here.

329
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:16,160
There's no exit for you here.

330
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,000
(Parking Lot)

331
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,556
Yes, it's me.

332
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,716
I've acquired the memory card.

333
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,596
Oh?

334
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,560
Good job. Good job.

335
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,756
But what should I do with this guy?

336
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,760
You should get rid of him.

337
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,040
Understood. Wait just a moment.

338
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,040
Goodbye.

339
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,320
Sergeant Kim, are you okay? Stand up.

340
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,876
Are you okay?

341
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,040
I'm not okay. I'm not okay.

342
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,000
Hello? Hello?

343
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,636
Yes.

344
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,676
So where should

345
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,920
I take this memory card?

346
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,520
Oh! Mercenary. Is that you?

347
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,916
Yes, it's me.

348
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,280
What about the guy next to you?

349
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,640
What now? He's dead.

350
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,036
The money. The money. Is it ready?

351
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,196
Of course, of course.

352
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,956
Should I go to the place with the safe?

353
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,080
Ah, yes. I'll be waiting.

354
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,236
Wow...

355
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,796
This guy

356
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,840
is indeed a scary fellow.

357
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,160
Did you find the memory card?

358
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,000
Yes.

359
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,160
Thanks.

360
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,036
You hurry to a hospital.

361
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,836
No.

362
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,440
This memory card isn't yours now.

363
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,440
It must be revealed to
the world immediately.

364
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,200
Chairman Choi has come
inside Cloud Nine with a bomb.

365
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,040
In order to take Cloud Nine for himself.

366
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,916
We need to take down Park
Gwan-su and Chairman Choi.

367
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,196
In order to do that,

368
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,796
the content of this memory
card must be made public.

369
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,356
Sergeant Kim.

370
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,396
Assemblyman Jang's
political career would be ended.

371
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,676
It must be entrusted to Assemblyman Jang

372
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,316
and used politically right
before or right after the election.

373
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,956
No.

374
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,116
We must stop Park Gwan-su
and Chairman Choi immediately.

375
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,596
I know. But it's not
such a simple problem.

376
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,396
Revealing this will endanger
JB Group and Jinhan Group.

377
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,516
What will be the cost
of winning the election?

378
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,996
Do you know what'll
happen if we don't reveal this?

379
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,276
Either Cloud Nine will fall
into Chairman Choi's hands,

380
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,156
or Choi Yu-jin could die
together with Cloud Nine.

381
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,196
Je-ha, for the greater good...

382
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,960
The greater good?

383
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,840
You're just the same as you always were.

384
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,636
When I was stripped
of my military uniform,

385
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,956
you said a small sacrifice was
needed for the greater good...

386
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,356
I'm not saying we should sacrifice anyone.

387
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,556
But Je-ha, I need to have that memory card

388
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,476
to realize what I've hoped for,

389
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,160
and for you to achieve
the revenge you want.

390
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,800
Then what about Eom Hye-rin?

391
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,160
And what about Anna?

392
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,840
If it's hard for you to do this,

393
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,000
I'll do it myself.

394
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,800
Sergeant Kim, don't make me shoot you.

395
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,156
When you first persuaded
me to work at JSS,

396
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,076
you said these people
weren't to be trifled with.

397
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,076
That they'd definitely make
their way into the Blue House.

398
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,836
But look now.

399
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,960
Look at you!

400
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,916
You're egging on
Assemblyman Jang to throw away

401
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,996
his last bit of conscience as a father.

402
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,636
And you massacred Iraqi
civilians just to receive a pittance,

403
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,396
then got hauled to court
and ended up on the run.

404
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,156
You're partly right,
but you're also wrong.

405
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,556
It's true.

406
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,796
I was abandoned by my country

407
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,636
and sold to work as a
mercenary for a pittance.

408
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,320
It's true that I worked as
a mercenary. However...

409
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,320
I did not massacre civilians.

410
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,240
Rather, the reason that
I ended up on the run

411
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,996
was because at the
international court of war crimes,

412
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,836
I intended to testify regarding
the slaughter of civilians,

413
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,280
and Blackstone found out about it.

414
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,000
Those guys went after me
to stop me from testifying.

415
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,000
Je-ha.

416
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,160
You told me that I was a puppet.

417
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,036
That's true.

418
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,436
But now Cloud Nine is
on the brink of being taken,

419
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,360
and if I don't have that memory card,

420
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,036
I won't even be a puppet.

421
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,996
-I'll become a scarecrow.
-Assemblyman!

422
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,360
Why would you be a scarecrow?

423
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,800
You should become a father to Anna now.

424
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,520
Seriously.

425
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,040
I've been cowed by you people now.

426
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,076
My original goal here

427
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,236
was to get Anna safely
out of Choi Yu-jin's grasp

428
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,640
and kill Park Gwan-su.

429
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,920
I'm leaving to kill Park Gwan-su now.

430
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,996
What's all this?

431
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,960
Aren't these C4 plastic explosives?

432
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,000
Sergeant Kim.

433
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,076
How will you do this alone?

434
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,920
You saw what's in the trunk.

435
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,040
Are you by any chance...

436
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,160
Are you planning to blow yourself up, too?

437
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,040
Hey, Sergeant Kim.

438
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
Look, Sergeant Kim!

439
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,396
Sis.

440
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,156
Can't you give me the Mirror?

441
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,120
Or share it with me, okay?

442
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,076
Now your strategy is to
ask for the impossible?

443
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,196
Truthfully, when you said
you'd marry your husband,

444
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,440
weren't you giving up JB Group?

445
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,360
Back then, I was so
envious of your courage.

446
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,080
That wasn't the case.

447
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,160
Your mom snatched JB Group away from me.

448
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,040
I envied you.

449
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,516
You're not the kid of
a mistress like I am.

450
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,956
Everyone liked you,

451
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,556
and they said you'd become chairwoman,

452
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,720
so of course I thought so as well.

453
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,956
But I envied you the most

454
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,956
when you rejected a strategic marriage

455
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,440
and said you'd marry your now-husband.

456
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,520
Because I had a woman I loved, too.

457
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,240
Although I had no
choice but to give her up.

458
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,440
If you had a speck of
innocence, I would believe you.

459
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,756
Oh, this is such a shame.

460
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,636
I could've fooled you.

461
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,880
I have such a smart sister, huh?

462
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,516
But the thing is,

463
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,356
it's true that our father
cared more for you than me.

464
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,956
And from what I heard just now,

465
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,796
didn't our father order President Guk

466
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,116
to straighten things out
after you killed Eom Hye-rin?

467
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,440
What would you know?

468
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,396
Fine, I got it.

469
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,276
Then sis, let's do this.

470
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,236
I'll give you half the shares of JB Group.

471
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,996
And let's both use the Mirror.

472
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,596
That way, it'll be fair.

473
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,756
Then if I acquire Jinhan Group,

474
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,996
you become chairwoman of JB Group.

475
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,556
And I'll be chairman
of Jinhan Group. Okay?

476
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,000
Why?

477
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,680
Are you getting nervous
since time is ticking?

478
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,556
Seong-won.

479
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,996
From the moment you
brought that thing in here,

480
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,676
didn't you intend

481
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,516
to either take the Mirror
or just destroy everything?

482
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,076
Dying together with me wasn't on the menu.

483
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,116
But now that you can't get out of here,

484
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,916
you have no choice
but to disable the bomb.

485
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,040
So why would I make a deal with you?

486
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,636
The squad members
outside are getting impatient,

487
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,916
so before they turn into rabid beasts,

488
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,916
it'll be better to call it quits

489
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,196
and take your bomb and leave quietly.

490
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,880
Then I won't kill you.

491
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,676
Um, Assemblyman.

492
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,356
Are you really calling a press conference?

493
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,076
All this time, the reason I
covered up your dark secrets

494
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,476
and endured countless indignities

495
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,956
was because of your
unwavering desire for power.

496
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,756
But if you're going to
throw it all away now,

497
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,716
do I have any reason to
stand by you anymore?

498
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,760
You're coming on strong.

499
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,076
Chief Ju. What about you?

500
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,716
In a situation like this,

501
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,600
doesn't your wife have a
choice in the matter, too?

502
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,116
That's true.

503
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,876
Call Choi Yu-jin.

504
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,920
Let's see how she's doing.

505
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,200
Incoming phone call from
Assemblyman Jang Se-jun.

506
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,440
It's pretty early for that.

507
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,680
Mirror, take the call.

508
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,076
Yes. Assemblyman, go ahead.

509
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,360
Oh. It seems that the
bomb hasn't gone off yet.

510
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,036
What?

511
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,480
Are you upset that it didn't go off?

512
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,596
You have time on your hands,
so I have something to discuss.

513
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,076
Go ahead.

514
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,396
Je-ha gave me a gift before he left.

515
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,520
The memory card from Kim Seok-han.

516
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,160
What now, Seong-won?

517
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,876
And so?

518
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,156
He said that to save you from the bomb,

519
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,360
we need to quickly
make its contents public.

520
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,436
Je-ha said that?

521
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,956
Yes.

522
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,156
But what should we do?

523
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,076
Shall we reveal it, or not?

524
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
Are you crazy? Why reveal it?

525
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,396
Don't worry about Seong-won.

526
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,840
Chairman Choi won't be
able to let the bomb detonate.

527
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,396
Right. Of course.

528
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,676
Take this chance to get control
of Park Gwan-su's consortium.

529
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,556
I will...no.

530
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,236
You call Chairman Park
of Jinhan Group yourself.

531
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,996
We may see the consortium, Park Gwan-su,

532
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,080
and JB Group all go up in flames.

533
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,600
Won't it be more believable
if you're the one to call?

534
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,880
As expected of my wife.

535
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,316
What about Je-ha?

536
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,116
What about him?

537
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,756
How is his condition?

538
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,276
He doesn't seem to be doing well.

539
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,760
Where...

540
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,680
Never mind. See you later at home.

541
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,996
Park Gwan-su will quietly
drop out of the presidential race.

542
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,876
What should be done, Seong-won?

543
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:52,600
Should I take all of JB Group
and build it up from scratch?

544
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,396
Cancel the press conference.

545
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,996
Call Chairman Park.

546
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,640
Yes.

547
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,596
Yes, Chairman Park.

548
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,240
I've acquired an interesting item.

549
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,160
A memory card from Kim Seok-han.

550
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,440
Oh...

551
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,956
Why are you so surprised?

552
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,116
You're a member

553
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,120
of that consortium as well.

554
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,636
I'd like to have a cup of tea together

555
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,480
with those members in person.

556
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,916
What?

557
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,076
Jang Se-jun has the memory card?

558
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,720
Did he confirm the contents?

559
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,476
Oh, this is...

560
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,116
Well then...

561
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,120
No, for now, I got it.

562
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,676
Oh, this is an uproar.

563
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,796
So this means that Kim Je-ha
gave Assemblyman Jang...

564
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,316
Yes. That fellow is shady.

565
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,080
I think he's been a double agent
on Choi Yu-jin's side as well.

566
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,236
Turn the car around.

567
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,276
-Turn around.
-Yes, sir.

568
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,876
-And you.
-Yes?

569
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,596
Dispatch men to the hideout
and catch that guy, okay?

570
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,040
Yes, understood.

571
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,480
Wait.

572
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,916
-Jang had a kid? Anna?
-Yes.

573
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,396
Call the police commissioner
and tell him to bring her in.

574
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,996
Understood.

575
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:44,120
Whether Jang Se-jun or Kim
Je-ha, let's bury them all tonight.

576
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,156
Miss.

577
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,360
Please turn your cell phone
off temporarily for safety.

578
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,480
Okay.

579
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,680
(Power off)

580
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,560
The recipient's phone is turned off.

581
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,036
The plane will soon take off.

582
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,240
Just a moment.

583
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,556
We request your cooperation.

584
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,080
Have you by chance...

585
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,160
I think that's her.

586
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,400
Go Anna?

587
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,600
(Kwon Tae-jin/Police Agency)

588
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,880
Please come with us.

589
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,996
He's been tricked. Kim Je-ha has arrived.

590
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,014
Everyone, secure the perimeter
and spread out to find him!

591
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,600
Drop the gun.

592
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,080
Stick this on there.

593
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,840
Stick it on.

594
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,320
Stick it on.

595
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,276
What is this? Where's Park Gwan-su?

596
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,676
Assemblyman Park told me to tell you

597
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,996
that if you want to save your girlfriend,

598
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,236
hand over the memory card.

599
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,200
What did you just say?

600
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,800
-Who?
-Your girlfriend, Go Anna.

601
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,000
Speak clearly, punk.

602
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,356
She was captured at the airport.

603
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,356
She was leaving the country.

604
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,676
Where is she now?

605
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,436
If you want to save your
girl, that memory card...

606
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,360
Tell me, punk!

607
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,036
Please spare me. I'll talk.

608
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,520
Talk!

609
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,996
-Hello?
-Mi-ran, this is Kim Je-ha.

610
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,476
Where is Anna right now?

611
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,396
Je-ha, how's your condition?

612
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,996
Anna just left the country.

613
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,676
I think Park Gwan-su had Anna kidnapped.

614
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,636
Call the airport and check.

615
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,040
Kidnapped? You're saying
Anna was kidnapped?

616
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,276
What are you talking
about? Anna was kidnapped?

617
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,996
We escorted her to the
departure desk earlier.

618
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,996
I don't know, he thinks
Park Gwan-su kidnapped her.

619
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,116
Je-ha seems to be in pursuit.

620
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,956
Hello? Is this the airport?

621
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,960
I need to confirm a
passenger who left the country.

622
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,520
Well, well. What's the
reason for a video chat?

623
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,276
At a time like this,

624
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,636
isn't it best to speak face-to-face,

625
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,316
Assemblyman Jang?

626
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,516
You must have been in quite a hurry.

627
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,876
Of course. The hurry is that

628
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,040
someone's life is hanging in the balance.

629
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,636
Don't worry.

630
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,316
Would I really have you killed?

631
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,160
Me?

632
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,800
I didn't mean me. Wait just a moment.

633
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,716
Dad. Dad, save me.

634
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,040
Dad, save me.

635
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,080
Anna.

636
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:07,920
Enough of that unpleasant view.

637
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,436
What do you think you're doing right now?

638
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,996
Okay, okay, calm down.

639
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,160
I shouldn't need to explain this to you.

640
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:17,996
Assemblyman Jang.

641
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,556
Bring the memory card from Kim Seok-han.

642
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,436
Exchange it for your daughter.

643
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,796
Come to that place called
Cloud Nine or whatever it is.

644
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,196
I'll bring your daughter there as well.

645
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,036
Let's make the exchange there.

646
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:36,356
It's enemy territory for me,
but since I'm bringing personnel,

647
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,956
it's fair, right?

648
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,996
Assemblyman Jang.

649
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,716
As for me,

650
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,800
when it comes to killing a young woman...

651
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,596
I don't like that kind of thing, but...

652
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,160
I'll go.

653
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,676
Ah, and I heard that

654
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,196
the content of the memory
card cannot be copied.

655
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,036
Let's refrain from pulling any tricks.

656
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,636
Since I'll check everything.

657
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,080
I'm setting off now.

658
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,560
Goodbye then.

659
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,040
Send her there.

660
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,076
Let's deal with the memory
card, Cloud Nine, and these people

661
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,280
all in one fell swoop.

662
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,240
Yes.

663
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,600
(J4)

664
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,636
-Yes.
-Hello? Je-ha.

665
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,036
Right before the plane took
off, police took Anna into custody.

666
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,840
I think Park Gwan-su is telling the truth.

667
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,320
Got it.

668
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,920
Anna.

669
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,680
Anna.

670
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,960
Anna!

671
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,360
No!

672
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,040
Je-ha! Je-ha!

673
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,440
Je-ha!

674
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,640
Help me. Help me.

675
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,400
Save me.

676
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,600
Help me.

677
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,760
Je-ha! Je-ha!

678
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,840
Kill him!

679
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,840
Master Song!

680
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,800
Master Song!

681
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,200
Miss, are you okay?

682
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,040
Yes.

683
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,600
Master Song.

684
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,040
Who are you people?

685
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,000
Let's go.

686
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,240
-What about you?
-Go already!

687
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,200
Mom?

688
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,600
It's okay. It's okay.

689
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,440
You were surprised, right? I'm sorry.

690
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,680
It was you, Master Song?

691
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,840
Huh?

692
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,640
That night.

693
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,600
The person who covered my
mouth and flashed the light.

694
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,960
Miss.

695
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,240
About that night...

696
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,160
Je-ha. Don't get worked up, okay?

697
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,680
Let's talk.

698
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,160
Let's talk. Talk, okay?

699
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,796
Where is Anna?

700
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,796
Ah! Anna is...She's...

701
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,796
She went to Cloud Nine.

702
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,476
Hurry over there.

703
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,080
-You drive.
-Now?

704
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,876
We can't go there right now.

705
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,160
Why not?

706
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,600
The thing is, there's...

707
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,796
Wait! Wait!

708
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,200
There's a bomb.

709
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,996
The bomb will go off soon.

710
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,476
If the bomb goes off,
everyone there will die.

711
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,956
We can disable it.

712
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,076
That would be good,

713
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,916
but once that bomb is activated,

714
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,440
it can't be disabled.

715
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,720
Even Chairman Choi doesn't know that.

716
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,160
For goodness'...

717
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,040
No! No!

718
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,000
(The K2)

719
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:02,956
What's the point of living?

720
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,600
Let's just die here together.

721
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,120
So you're saying Anna is being pursued?

722
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,316
The bomb can't be disabled.

723
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,076
If Anna is taken hostage,

724
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,956
won't he hand over Seok-han's memory card?

725
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,520
Who knows? Will it go how you want?

726
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,956
Everyone needs to get out of here now.

727
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,076
A bomb will go off in Cloud Nine.

728
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,596
Let go of me! Je-ha!

729
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,160
I swear.
