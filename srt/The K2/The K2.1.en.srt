Mom?

Mom?

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,280
Please give me something to eat.

20
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,240
Please give me something to eat.

21
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,680
Hey, handsome guy.

22
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,316
What is it? What?

23
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,916
Are you picking a fight?

24
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,920
-Are you picking a fight?
-It's nothing.

25
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
Be careful from now on.

26
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,880
What were you doing with
that guy? What did you do?

27
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
She's here.

28
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,040
Ticket!

29
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,240
Quick!

30
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,920
Quick, quick!

31
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,920
Ow, that hurt.

32
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,680
I'm sorry.

34
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,480
Are you okay?

35
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,040
You're Korean?

36
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,596
Mister, please save me, okay?

37
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,996
There are bad people chasing me.

38
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,076
Please save me, okay?

39
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,560
Please save me!

40
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,120
Please save me. Please help me, okay?

41
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,076
Please save me.

42
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,920
Save me, save me.

43
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,680
Miss!

44
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,640
This game of hide and seek is over now.

45
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,080
Time to go home, right?

46
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,240
No!

47
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,160
How annoying.

48
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,080
Come here!

49
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,000
Hold still!

50
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,800
Stop it!

51
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,200
Go quickly.

52
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,840
Go.

53
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,280
(Police)

54
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,000
Ah...dang it...

55
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,640
There's been a mugging on Platform 2.

56
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,156
Mister.

57
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
Please help me, okay?

58
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,036
Mister.

59
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,956
Mister, my dad is in Madrid.

60
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,876
Can you please take me there?

61
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,036
It's true. If you take me there,

62
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,036
my dad will give you a big reward, okay?

63
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,076
Hey.

64
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,556
I'm in trouble myself. Just go.

65
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,796
It's true.

66
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,316
Bad people are trying to catch me.

67
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,356
Please save me, mister.

68
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,036
-Hey!
-Please.

69
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,116
If the police are bad,

70
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,276
then I am, too. Get it?

71
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,196
So...

72
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,396
Let go of me.

73
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,280
And don't live this way.

74
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,396
Please, please. Believe me, please.

75
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,396
Please believe me. Please.

76
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,076
-Please believe me.
-Oh! Over there!

77
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,600
Mister.

78
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,960
-Come over here!
-Please help me.

79
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,840
Save me.

80
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,200
Help me.

81
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,240
Get going already.

82
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,320
Put your hands up!

83
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,560
Why?

84
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,520
We have something to ask you.

85
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,600
Oscar! Oscar! Where are you?

86
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,076
Save me, save me.

87
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,916
Save me.

88
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,436
Help me.

89
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,920
Help me. Save me.

90
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,160
Help me.

91
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,836
Help me.

92
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,716
Save me.

93
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,276
Help me, mister.

94
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,640
Help me.

95
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,520
Help me.

96
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,916
Hey!

97
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,840
We're police. Get lost!

98
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,076
Save me.

99
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,916
-I said to get lost!
-Help me.

100
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,040
Help me. Save me!

101
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,120
Save me!

102
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,360
Don't go...

103
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,160
Let's go to the airport.

104
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,520
(6 months later, Seoul)

105
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,440
What's with you, huh? Hey.

106
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,000
You can't eat this. It's too tough.

107
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,160
Yes, sir.

108
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,196
I'm so ticked off, I'm going nuts here!

109
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,036
It seems the banner
came loose in the wind.

110
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,076
It needs to get fixed right away,

111
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,556
but we're finishing things here
and won't be back until tomorrow.

112
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,756
Help me out.

113
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,720
It'll be a piece of cake.

114
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,000
What are you here for?

115
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,916
I'm here to fix the banner up there.

116
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,276
This building's hours
of operation are over.

117
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,080
I came because I was called.

118
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Do you have an ID card with you?

119
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,116
-I don't.
-Then you can't come in.

120
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,840
Come back tomorrow.

121
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,396
Hold on, mister.

122
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,076
Just wait a moment.

123
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,836
How can you just send him away?

124
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,396
The campaign manager demands
the banner be fixed right away.

125
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,756
And this is the same person

126
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,240
who was brought in
before to put up the banner.

127
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,960
Still, it's not possible
without identification.

128
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,276
Now you're in big trouble.

129
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,956
This is coming from the manager
as well as the respected lady.

130
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,716
The lady herself?

131
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,440
Yes.

132
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,280
Me?

133
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,316
How long will it take to
fix that banner up there?

134
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,080
I'm not sure. If I'm fast,
maybe 20 or 30 minutes.

135
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,360
Yikes...

136
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,756
Thank you.

137
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,196
For what?

138
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,036
People like us earn wages by the day.

139
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,800
If you just go back,
you'll have made nothing.

140
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,000
My son has no work these
days, and it's a big problem.

141
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,440
By the way, it's very windy.
Are you sure you'll be okay?

142
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,120
It's fine.

143
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,640
Whoa!

144
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,480
What are you doing?

145
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,276
What do you mean?

146
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,956
I was pouring wine.

147
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,520
Wine?

148
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,436
Let's go slow.

149
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,920
Slow?

150
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,356
I don't know what slow
means. I don't like slow.

151
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,436
Now on "Encounter with Jeong Ji-hyeon,"

152
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,076
we've invited special guest Choi Yu-jin.

153
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,316
Let's give her a big hand.

154
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,760
Hold on a second.

155
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,996
Hello. Hello.

156
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,996
Welcome.

157
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,400
Pleasure to meet you.

158
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,476
You must be busy these days

159
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,956
as the wife of Assemblyman Jang Se-jun.

160
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,996
Thank you for joining us.

161
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,236
I'm not busy. I don't really do anything.

162
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,076
Don't you get tired of seeing
your wife's face every day?

163
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,876
But do you know why we invited you today?

164
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,636
Well, let's hear what she has to say.

165
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,636
We conducted a poll

166
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,396
regarding potential First Ladies.

167
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,436
Among all age groups,
ranging from 20s to 70s,

168
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,996
you were in first place.

169
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,916
Really?

170
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,796
So out of all wives of the
presidential candidates,

171
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,396
you came out as no. 1.

172
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,880
Congratulations.

173
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,040
-I did?
-Yes.

174
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,876
Come on.

175
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,076
You've already been widely praised

176
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,120
as the queen of support for your husband.

177
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,476
There's nothing much to being supportive.

178
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,276
All I have to do is make sure

179
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,196
he doesn't skip breakfast.

180
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,076
Does that mean that you make breakfast

181
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,080
for the Assemblyman yourself?

182
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,036
This is embarrassing,

183
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,516
but I think I gave him a bad habit.

184
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,796
He's a rather picky eater,

185
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,796
so if I don't make
breakfast, he won't eat at all.

186
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,116
I see.

187
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,876
Well, your cooking skills

188
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,876
are already rumored to be great.

189
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,160
Oh, if someone hears
you, they'll think it's true.

190
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,316
It's just something people say

191
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,196
to be polite after visiting us.

192
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,316
Wait, you cook for guests yourself?

193
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,716
You make all the food yourself?

194
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,956
Yes.

195
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,240
But it's nothing to be proud of.

196
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,480
You're really incredible.

197
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,080
Enough now.

198
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,160
Hey, you have no manners.

199
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,000
Okay.

200
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,556
Hey now.

201
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,520
Ditching the manners for today.

202
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,000
Oh? Just look at you.

203
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,640
Oh...

204
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,080
If you keep this up,
you'll get a scolding.

205
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,800
(Office of Assemblyman Jang Se-jun)

206
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,196
Be careful with the camera.

207
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,196
Take clear pictures.

208
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,600
Yes.

209
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,160
Close the curtains.

210
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,680
You nasty...

211
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,436
You won't get away with it.

212
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,960
Sleep well. This will be over soon.

213
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,836
This is a restricted area.

214
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,040
Yeah, I know. From now on,
we'll be restricting things here.

215
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Who are you?

216
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,720
Ma'am.

217
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,080
Ma'am.

218
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,960
You can't touch her.

219
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,680
Hey, you can't. You can't.

220
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,280
Is anyone there?

221
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,760
What's going on?

222
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,396
This is K1. This is K1.

223
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,720
Please respond. Please respond.

224
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,916
-Yes, sir. Right now...-
Yeah, I'm on my way.

225
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,036
Do your best there.

226
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,760
Understood.

227
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,000
Dang it.

228
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,880
Dang it.

229
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,320
Get me out of here.

230
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,880
Get me out of here! Quick!

231
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,080
Move away from the door.

232
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,356
Ma'am.

233
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,596
Ma'am, ma'am.

234
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,760
Ma'am.

235
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,280
VIP in danger. Rescue the VIP.

236
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,960
VIP in danger.

237
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
Hurry. A strike team has arrived.

238
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,280
End the situation
before the police arrive.

239
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,800
Pull out!

240
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,876
-What the heck?
-Pull out!

241
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Pull out!

242
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,880
Ma'am!

243
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,480
Ma'am!

244
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,996
Ma'am!

245
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,796
Ma'am, are you okay?

246
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,356
The Assemblyman. What
about the Assemblyman?

247
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,356
Fortunately, his room's
door was not breached.

248
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,240
Call an ambulance. Call an ambulance!

249
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,680
Dispatch office, send an ambulance.

250
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,800
Situation room, release the lock
on the special guest room door.

251
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,880
The lock is disengaged.

252
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,356
But speaking of wifely support,

253
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,956
hasn't there been talk
that his wife's family

254
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,956
was instrumental in
allowing Assemblyman Jang

255
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,880
to rise to his current position?

256
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,600
His wife's family?

257
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,720
So...does he have another
wife I don't know about?

258
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,636
That's funny.

259
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,196
But it's true that you're
the eldest daughter

260
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,836
of the family that owns JB Group.

261
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,076
And it's true that JB group is

262
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,520
a leading conglomerate in Korea.

263
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,396
The truth is...I feel
sorry toward my husband

264
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,600
for marrying someone like me.

265
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,356
Had he married someone else,

266
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,036
he could have been a
son-in-law in fine standing

267
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,080
compared to his wife's family.

268
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,560
You must have been
through a tough situation.

269
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,120
My late father

270
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,396
didn't want me to marry a politician.

271
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,516
Wait, so was your marriage
to Assemblyman Jang

272
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,800
the reason your family cut ties with you?

273
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,316
I'm sorry.

274
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,000
I asked too sensitive a question.

275
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,120
No, it's okay.

276
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,316
Whether you're a man or a woman,

277
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,996
shouldn't you stay loyal

278
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
to the one you love?

279
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,716
So you loved Assemblyman Jang very deeply.

280
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,240
To the point that you gave
up your inheritance rights.

281
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,080
Yes.

282
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,400
And truthfully, even now...

283
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,200
I still respect him.

284
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,280
They're coming out!

285
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,356
Please move out of the way!

286
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,356
How serious is the injury?

287
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,120
What is the patient's condition?

288
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,916
Please tell us.

289
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
What is the patient's condition?

290
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,556
A man hanging a banner...

291
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,960
Yes.

292
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,320
That huge pane of glass...

293
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,476
But speaking of which,

294
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,836
do you currently have
no shares in JB Group?

295
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,116
From what I know, prior to your marriage,

296
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,640
you were bequeathed a
large number of shares.

297
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,120
Ah...

298
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,076
Those were shares I
had when I was still single.

299
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,516
I already donated all those.

300
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,636
Ah, you mean the Pyeongchang
Scholarship Foundation?

301
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,916
Yes.

302
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,076
But it's said you have
close relationships with

303
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,076
the director and members of
the board for the foundation.

304
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,196
If that's true,

305
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,956
doesn't it mean you still own

306
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,560
a fair number of shares in JB Group?

307
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,800
Director, they want us to
cut and continue a bit later.

308
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,716
Anchor Jo.

309
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,560
Let's break for commercials.

310
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,116
We'll hear the answer to this question

311
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,636
after a brief commercial break.

312
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,560
Right, we'll roll commercials
before resuming.

313
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,800
Ji-hyeon.

314
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,996
Yes, Yu-jin?

315
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,556
I think I mentioned earlier

316
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,080
that I didn't want to discuss that topic.

317
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,836
Yu-jin.

318
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,916
If someone will touch
on that issue anyway,

319
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,560
isn't it better that I be
the one to handle it?

320
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,800
Right?

321
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,640
Everyone has an issue that can hurt them.

322
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,880
For example, your son's problem.

323
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,636
Okay, the commercial is almost over.

324
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,280
We're about to roll.
Turn on the microphones.

325
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,680
Okay, shall we begin?

326
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,316
Yu-jin, sorry.

327
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,480
I crossed a line.

328
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,916
Right, Ji-hyeon.

329
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,040
Let's just stick to the script.

330
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,116
Your interview today was very moving.

331
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,196
Really? Thank you.

332
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,356
I got in trouble for being nervous.

333
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,836
No. You seemed very natural.

334
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,240
You were very, very beautiful.

335
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,516
Could we have a moment...

336
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,956
Yes?

337
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,556
I'm good now. I'll take off my own makeup.

338
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,636
Thank you.

339
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,836
Yes, ma'am.

340
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,320
Ah! Hold on.

341
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,916
Thank you for today.

342
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,436
These are some cookies I baked.

343
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,396
I don't know if they'll be good.

344
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,116
Ma'am, this is so moving.

345
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,636
Can I take a picture of these?

346
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,076
Oh?

347
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,160
Ah. A picture? No need...

348
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,120
I won't eat these. I'll just cherish them.

349
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,000
Thank you.

350
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,196
Again?

351
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,676
Who was it this time?

352
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,996
The investigation isn't over yet.

353
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,596
But it seems like
Assemblyman Park's camp...

354
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,720
Obviously.

355
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,836
Cookies that Ms. Choi
Yu-jin baked herself.

356
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,076
In the background, the handbag
she's carried for 20 years.

357
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,716
I love you and respect
you, Ms. Choi. Heart!

358
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,236
Hey! What are you doing?

359
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,596
Total respect for Ms. Choi.

360
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,680
She baked these herself.

361
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,516
Really?

362
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,516
Let's eat them together.

363
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,636
No way! These are now
my household treasure.

364
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,436
How petty...

365
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,436
Let's see the picture.

366
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,640
Wow, how pretty.

367
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,920
How shall we proceed?

368
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,196
First, let's announce
that unidentified assailants

369
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,076
broke into the office and
stole the campaign playbook.

370
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,680
Understood.

371
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,520
Then...

372
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,436
That girl...

373
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,360
I dug into her background.
Keep her around.

374
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,156
We'll have a use for her later.

375
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,800
Understood.

376
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,080
I'm good now.

377
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,160
I'm getting old...I have wrinkles.

378
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,840
How old is she?

379
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,956
What?

380
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,800
That woman...the girl.

381
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,640
She's in her late 20s.

382
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,040
Still, at least she's
not a minor this time.

383
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,436
It's me.

384
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,240
Starting tomorrow, will I
eat breakfast made by you?

385
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,240
You looked great on camera.

386
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,836
Ah, right.

387
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,996
You're reliable, so I
knew you'd handle it well.

388
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,516
Also...

389
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,236
That guy hanging the banner.

390
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,680
I'd like you to be sure
you handle him well.

391
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,876
The thing is,

392
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,156
that guy saw my face.

393
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,760
A man hanging a banner?

394
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,760
Okay.

395
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,240
Hello, sir. Yes.

396
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,476
Um...

397
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,436
Are you hiding something from me?

398
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,476
What? No, there's no way.

399
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,516
How could I dare...

400
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,716
I shouldn't act like this to you.

401
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,716
But I keep getting
this unpleasant feeling.

402
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,956
Ma'am, it's not like that.

403
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,356
There's no need for you to
worry over such a small matter.

404
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,836
I'll deal with it. Yes, yes.

405
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,796
I'm sorry. I'll keep that in mind.

406
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,796
I'll deal with him and
report on the results.

407
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,040
Yes, yes. Rest well.

408
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,600
What on earth? How did she find out?

409
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,316
Is the strike team dispatched?

410
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,880
Yes, they'll soon catch
him and bring him in.

411
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,400
What's all this trouble
over a banner hanger?

412
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,196
You don't have any angle but this?

413
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,400
That's right.

414
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,760
Hold on. Rewind it.

415
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,480
Right. There.

416
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,240
No way...

417
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,996
Yes. Chief Ju.

418
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,276
-Pull out the strike team.
-What?

419
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,000
If you don't, they could all end up dead.

420
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,960
What do you mean?

421
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,436
I mean, Chief Ju,

422
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,796
following that candidate around,

423
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,236
your tall tales are getting taller.

424
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,356
The team members are in danger.

425
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,116
So when you were a colonel...

426
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,676
No, no.

427
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,276
When you were in the special forces,

428
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,156
you trained that kid.

429
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,520
Yes.

430
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,236
Okay, I get it.

431
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,876
It seems you want to say that

432
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,196
the strike team you trained
is the toughest of all, but...

433
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,876
-That's not it.
-Chief Ju!

434
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,796
You don't seem to
understand what I'm saying.

435
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,756
Since I'm in a real tight spot right now,

436
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,796
I sent a whole strike team

437
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,276
to catch a lone banner hanger.

438
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,116
Korea's cream of the crop,

439
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,040
a JSS strike team.

440
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,200
Soon you'll find out
what I'm talking about.

441
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,680
That arrogant punk.

442
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,840
Ha! That punk.

443
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,240
Get moving quickly.

444
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,000
Report on the situation.

445
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,520
Report on the situation.

446
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,040
Report on the situation.

447
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,120
Report on the situation!

448
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,440
Hey! What happened?

449
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,840
I asked what happened!

450
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,640
What a relief.

451
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,676
What?

452
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,280
You're saying this is a relief?

453
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,760
No one was killed.

454
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,640
Why are you still up in the living room?

455
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,276
I'll be going to bed
a little late tonight.

456
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,040
I have to receive a report on something.

457
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,876
Why?

458
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,320
Is someone making trouble other than me?

459
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,400
Your daughter.

460
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,480
Anna? What about her?

461
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,160
She ran away again.

462
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,556
She should have grown
out of that by now...

463
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,240
But maybe...

464
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,160
It's because she's your
own flesh and blood?

465
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,600
If something bad happens to her,

466
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:29,520
you know that our agreement
is over as well, right?

467
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,560
What is it?

468
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,760
What's up with her?

469
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,880
(Sleep Aid)

470
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,000
I didn't kill her.

471
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,320
I didn't kill her.

472
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,080
(The K2)

473
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,316
You're saying you didn't
catch that banner hanger?

474
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,596
From the start, he wasn't
someone who JSS could catch.

475
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,676
Who sent you?

476
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,276
When I come to see you a second time,

477
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,916
I'll kill you.

478
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,476
You were in the wrong place
and saw something you shouldn't.

479
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

480
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,916
You're pretty. You take after your mother.

481
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,796
I remembered everything.

482
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,236
Mom didn't commit suicide.

483
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,516
That girl's past is

484
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,120
the reason I had no choice but
to live as Choi Yu-jin's puppet.
