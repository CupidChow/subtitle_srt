1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,040
(The K2)

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,880
(Ji Chang-wook)

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,120
(Song Yoon-a)

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,080
(Im Yoon-a)

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,520
(Cho Seong-ha)

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,160
(The K2)

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,316
I thought nothing was left.

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,876
(A mercenary who lost
everything and became a fugitive)

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,996
But...

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Help me.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,316
(The delicate girl Anna
appeared before him)

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,920
Save me.

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,676
Don't go...

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,800
Someone appeared who I wanted to protect.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,476
You ranked first place
in the popularity poll

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,640
for wives of presidential candidates.

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,036
You're already widely praised

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,996
as the queen of wifely support.

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,880
There's nothing much to being supportive.

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,596
(Chaos ensues when he witnesses
Assemblyman Jang's secret affair)

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,996
That guy hanging the banner.

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,876
The thing is,

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,396
that guy saw my face.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,076
The banner hanger did?

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,036
(Jang Se-jun's wife Choi Yu-jin
calls her security company JSS)

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,454
(She orders them to get rid of this man)

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,316
(Escaping the danger, the
man is once again on the run)

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,836
So you're saying you couldn't
catch that banner hanger?

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,596
Just give me a little time.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,836
A little time?

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,000
He's a man who couldn't be
caught by JSS in the first place.

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,276
(Anna wants to see
her father, Jang Se-jun)

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,800
(She escapes from Choi
Yu-jin's watchful control)

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,716
What?

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,636
Is there someone other than
me who's causing trouble?

36
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,756
Your daughter.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,196
(Aiming for power rather than love)

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,247
(Jang Se-jun and Choi Yu-jin
have a marriage just for show)

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,280
Did she inherit this from her father?

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,916
How will you stop it?

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,436
If we just set up the
perfect fake accident...

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,080
Are you crazy?

43
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,036
Anna is the only way

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,476
I maintain any control over Jang Se-jun.

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,756
But I'm the one who will become president.

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,956
If something happens to that girl,

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,156
everything you've planned your whole life

48
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,200
will crumble in an instant.

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,676
You're all grown up.

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,956
You're pretty. You take after your mom.

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,636
Devil!

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,640
Who? Me?

53
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,920
I remembered everything.

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,280
My mom didn't commit suicide.

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,636
What are you doing?

56
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,080
No! Don't!

57
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,720
(Yu-jin sends another killer
to eliminate the mystery man)

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,716
Everyone who hides
you in the future as well

59
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,716
will end up dead.

60
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,160
Who sent you?

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,076
When I come to see you again,

62
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,840
you'll end up dead.

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,716
This is our second
meeting that I told you about.

64
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,596
(He comes to Yu-jin's house to kill her)

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,516
(There, he meets Anna again)

66
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,040
Shoot.

67
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,920
Shoot!

68
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,680
Shoot! Shoot!

69
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,836
Kill her already! Kill her!

70
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,080
It looks like someone
else wanted you dead, too.

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,676
(The man takes Yu-jin
hostage and runs away)

72
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,800
(They are attacked by others
who are trying to kill Yu-jin)

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,076
I can't let innocent
people die because of me.

74
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,600
(He saves Yu-jin's life
in the midst of danger)

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,956
If you were tending
your unwell wife all night,

76
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,996
shouldn't you look like this?

77
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,520
I will win this fight, everyone!

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,236
Kim Je-ha?

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,236
So, am I supposed to be a
pawn of JB Group or what?

80
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,480
Just think of yourself as
the vassal of an empire.

81
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,156
I will now introduce the new
VIP team member. Kim Je-ha.

82
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,720
His pager code is K2.

83
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,996
(Je-ha's assignment is to watch over Anna)

84
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,756
It's not that my dad doesn't want to come.

85
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,276
He can't come because of that woman.

86
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,040
(She grows to resent Yu-jin more and more)

87
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,680
But this kid read me.

88
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,760
He read my mind.

89
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,880
This kid didn't need
my orders or permission.

90
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,156
(Je-ha saves Yu-jin
from a crisis once again)

91
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,996
He wasn't a hunting dog.

92
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,196
(Yu-jin feels sympathy for Je-ha)

93
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,120
He was a wolf.

94
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,956
I won't be able to tame him.

95
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,116
(Yu-jin has a secret space
referred to as Cloud Nine)

96
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,236
(Je-ha is invited there...

97
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,276
Let's go to Cloud Nine.

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,040
Cloud Nine?

99
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
The elevator is going down.

100
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,556
Fine.

101
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,236
Then we'll seize Kim
Su-yeong's professorial salary

102
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,756
and file a lawsuit for
damages of $30 billion.

103
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,076
Then it'll be hard for
him to get a new job.

104
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,836
His credit rating should
deteriorate quickly now.

105
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,076
But ma'am,

106
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,276
it'll be rather hard for
us to win the lawsuit.

107
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,556
So what if we lose?

108
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,036
We can drag out the
trial for about three years.

109
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,596
By then, it'll be impossible
for him to recover socially.

110
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,196
Ah, yes. I see.

111
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,000
Prevent him from getting hired anywhere.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,756
Okay, next is Director Go Yun-yeong.

113
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,320
(List of foundation board members
supporting Ms. Choi's dismissal)

114
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,196
We don't have anything on this guy.

115
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,636
There is a record of
non-indictment for accusations.

116
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,636
What is it?

117
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,036
There is a record of Internet
video chatting as evidence.

118
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,720
And a video?

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
Play it.

120
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,800
Enough. Turn it off.

121
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,756
How dirty.

122
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,396
Leak the video and paint
him as a heinous pervert.

123
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,796
First get someone who will
accuse him of sexual assault.

124
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,956
It's perfect.

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,160
Yes.

126
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,276
Before showing that video to the world,

127
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,800
ensure that man's children watch it first.

128
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,240
What?

129
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,996
They're old enough to see X-rated videos.

130
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,636
Look, ma'am.

131
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,676
If you show the kids a video
of their dad acting that way...

132
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,800
Won't he want to commit suicide?

133
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,240
Or maybe not? Based on just that video?

134
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,036
During the family meeting
at the funeral earlier,

135
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,160
I was thinking about that.

136
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:15,080
What means of dying
would be the least painful?

137
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,000
Right. I'll carry out the plan at once.

138
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,636
Oh, that was sudden. You should knock.

139
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,516
Do you know what just happened?

140
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,036
What?

141
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,436
Je-ha...Je-ha...I don't even know...

142
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,916
Je-ha, Je-ha. What about that guy again?

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,560
Oh my.

144
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,400
What are you...

145
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,956
My goodness.

146
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,320
Are you happy?

147
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,676
I mean, how could Je-ha

148
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,916
go to Cloud Nine when
he's only just arrived?

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,156
Exactly.

150
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,196
What in the world...

151
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,076
At that age, he's already
practically an executive.

152
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,956
Truly. Wow.

153
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,040
He did a great deed
yesterday, so it must be true.

154
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,236
Enough. Now all I need
to do is reel in Je-ha.

155
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,436
Oh my God.

156
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,600
And then I...Now I'll be...

157
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,476
You're dead in the water.

158
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,316
How can you catch the guy now?

159
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,636
Do you think he'll come
back here? Seriously...

160
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,076
No one is monitoring
the cameras again today.

161
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,316
So don't waste time
peeling off your clothes,

162
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,996
and keep watch over Anna.

163
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,196
Where did Seong-gyu go on a day like this?

164
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,160
This sucks.

165
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,960
Yes. Understood.

166
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,036
Oh, you're here.

167
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,400
Go on in. She's waiting for you.

168
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,040
Sit down.

169
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,000
This is a nice place.

170
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,276
A soundproof anti-eavesdropping room.

171
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,160
Oh, you know quite a lot.

172
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,956
So is this B Level? Or...

173
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,400
C Level?

174
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,760
As expected of you.

175
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,360
It's D Level.

176
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,036
Even if a gun goes off in here,

177
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,316
no one outside can hear it.

178
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,396
And even if a gun is shot from outside,

179
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,836
it can't penetrate this.

180
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,396
You spent a lot of money on this.

181
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,316
So...

182
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,756
What did you want to talk about

183
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,796
that you called me here?

184
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,836
It's not that.

185
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,956
I called you because I wanted to hear

186
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,716
what you have to say.

187
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,956
What is it you want to hear?

188
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,520
Everything.

189
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,436
The story of someone who rushed
into a den of enemies to save me.

190
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,956
The story of someone
who brought an umbrella

191
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,156
and held it over me then.

192
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,356
And what kind of life someone has lived

193
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,120
that he still carries around
a handkerchief nowadays.

194
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,440
I'm curious.

195
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,396
I'm curious as well.

196
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,040
Why have I lived this way?

197
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,680
So what is it that you
really want to hear?

198
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm being honest.

199
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,316
I heard about your
military days from Chief Ju.

200
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,360
This time, I want to hear
about what happened in Iraq.

201
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,716
I'm going to start hunting
Park Gwan-su now.

202
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,680
Is that a good enough reason?

203
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,996
I'm sure you know, but this is
a completely soundproof room.

204
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,996
No one in the world

205
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,440
can hear what we discuss in here.

206
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,956
Then who's listening
to us from the other side

207
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,160
of the microphone that's turned on?

208
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,680
That's my mirror.

209
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,160
My magic mirror.

210
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,080
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

211
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,196
Who's the fairest of them all?

212
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,316
Do you not know that?

213
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,640
Oh please.

214
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,276
What's that for?

215
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,996
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

216
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,120
Okay then. Watch this.

217
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,596
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

218
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,636
Who's the fairest of them all?

219
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,560
Snow White.

220
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,996
It even has a sense of humor.

221
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,956
On his walking tour of
the traditional market,

222
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,756
Assemblyman Jang got up
close and personal with citizens.

223
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,796
Tomorrow, ruling and
opposition party leaders will attend

224
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,356
the fifth annual memorial Mass
at Ahyeon-dong Catholic Church

225
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,996
commemorating the
Ahyeon-dong gas explosion fire,

226
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,356
and Assemblyman Jang
is expected to attend.

227
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,120
Coming up next...

228
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
Ahyeon-dong Catholic Church?

229
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,480
It's artificial intelligence?

230
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,436
Yes.

231
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,320
It's AI that has voice
recognition capabilities.

232
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,556
These days, even cell
phones all have this technology.

233
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,556
Of course, the Mirror is
a bit smarter than those.

234
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,800
I'm sure you've guessed,
but this is like the brain of JSS.

235
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,876
This is where we gather

236
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,076
all the secret information
we can collect in the world.

237
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,756
And this is where we can analyze

238
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,040
all the big data floating
around the Internet.

239
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,956
Out of all this stored information,

240
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,436
the Mirror finds the content

241
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,196
most relevant to the question I'm asking

242
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
and shows it to me. The
Mirror is this software.

243
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,156
Tell me about yourself.

244
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,280
Then the Mirror will tell you
whatever you're curious about.

245
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,076
Why do you think I'm
curious about anything?

246
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,316
If you weren't curious,

247
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,276
you'd have no need to enter JSS.

248
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,000
Isn't that right?

249
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,396
Once again, you have the expression

250
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,000
of a kid who got caught
stealing from his mom's wallet.

251
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,916
There was no need for you
to deliberately enter secretly.

252
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,036
Other methods are all futile.

253
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,276
You can't access any data
here except through the Mirror.

254
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,916
And the Mirror

255
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,400
is set up to only respond to my voice.

256
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,040
I'll eat two. Come on!

257
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,320
Come on!

258
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,036
Oh my.

259
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,760
Wow, this is great. Seriously...

260
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,040
(Jang Mi-ran)

261
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,156
Tell me now.

262
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,396
Why are you going after Park Gwan-su?

263
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,680
And what exactly happened to you?

264
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,076
There was a girl

265
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,036
named Rania, a Kumar refugee.

266
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,236
I wanted so much

267
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,960
to pull her out of that hellish place.

268
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,800
Hey, guys.

269
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,120
What's up?

270
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,880
-Hi.
-Hi.

271
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,840
Rania.

272
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,440
He says to take a look at this document.

273
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,840
Rania.

274
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
Rania.

275
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,040
I love you.

276
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,636
Since this is very important,

277
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,760
even minor issues are unacceptable.

278
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,036
It's certain.

279
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,640
Certain?

280
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,280
Oh, no...

281
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,160
No!

282
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,356
Rania! Please, no!

283
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,080
You can't die!

284
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,800
You can't die!

285
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,956
Rania! No!

286
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,160
You can't die!

287
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,960
Someone save her!

288
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,160
You can't die!

289
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,836
Rania! No!

290
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,600
You can't die!

291
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,080
You can't die!

292
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,800
No!

293
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,876
I was falsely accused of murdering Rania

294
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,756
and arrested by the
police, but fortunately,

295
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,920
I was able to escape within a week.

296
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,080
But once I got out,

297
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,236
I found out that the Korean
politician Park Gwan-su

298
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,836
had left on the day of the incident,

299
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,956
and the Blackstone camp

300
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,476
had already been moved.

301
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,316
I ran away

302
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,996
and joined some Syrian
refugees to cross through Turkey

303
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,120
and enter Europe.

304
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,680
That's everything.

305
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,520
That's the reason I
need to kill Park Gwan-su.

306
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,240
You have a good enough reason.

307
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,520
Ugh, my stomach.

308
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,800
Oh, I'm going nuts here.

309
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,956
Mirror, did you hear?

310
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,996
From now on, respond directly

311
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,836
to what Kim Je-ha says.

312
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,436
Yes.

313
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,680
I want to know Park Gwan-su's
schedule for September 15, 2015.

314
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,920
He was busy.

315
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,076
At 3:30 p.m. on that day,

316
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,916
Park Gwan-su went to a camp in the desert

317
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,076
about 30 minutes away from his hotel.

318
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,356
Why was that?

319
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,600
There is no official data.

320
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,356
Mirror.

321
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,036
Double your query range,

322
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,036
double the modified value limit,

323
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,956
and answer again.

324
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,560
In that case...

325
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,076
Number 5. A secret
meeting, 54.3% probability.

326
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,000
That's right. Number 5. A secret meeting.

327
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,316
Who was there?

328
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,076
Can you gauge the location of the camp?

329
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,516
Kumar Highway 2,

330
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,036
7 km north of the Sanami crossing.

331
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,476
Assemblyman Park Gwan-su,
a Blackstone bodyguard,

332
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,996
interpreter Rania,

333
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,676
and an assumed attendee,

334
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,836
Kumar leader Abdul Omar.

335
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,836
Why was he assumed to attend?

336
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,036
The camp is that of Abdul Omar's guards.

337
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,116
What was the reason
for the secret meeting?

338
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,756
Unknown.

339
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,876
After the meeting with Park Gwan-su,

340
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
why were Blackstone
mercenaries ordered to kill Rania?

341
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,356
(2. The interpretor dealt with content)

342
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,574
(she wasn't supposed to know: 68%)

343
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,720
Right, that's right.

344
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,996
Number 2.

345
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,916
The interpreter dealt with content

346
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,600
that she wasn't supposed to know.

347
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,956
In that case,

348
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,116
what did Park Gwan-su
discuss with Abdul Omar?

349
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,276
No assumptions can be made.

350
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,876
Was there a financial transaction?

351
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,196
No assumptions can be made.

352
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,476
The AI can't tell you more.

353
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,480
Not without additional information.

354
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,036
However...

355
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,956
However?

356
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,796
A special note of interest
that can be assumed

357
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,036
to have a relation
within the range of error

358
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,796
is that two weeks after the meeting,

359
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,916
Abdul Omar escaped the
grasp of the local government

360
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,920
and armed his private military group.

361
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,960
Does that mean Park was exporting weapons?

362
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,640
If that's the case, Park
Gwan-su is quite something.

363
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,116
That's what it would be from
Park Gwan-su's perspective.

364
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
He's an export facilitator.

365
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,800
What's this?

366
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,956
This is Number 1.

367
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,280
Where are you going again at this hour?

368
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,516
This is J4.

369
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,036
I'm going to the supermarket.

370
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,036
If you keep acting like this,

371
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,160
I'll have to report it
to the situation room.

372
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,600
Don't.

373
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,276
I was joking.

374
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,880
Instead, just bring me a cup of coffee.

375
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,560
-Okay.
-Okay?

376
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,400
What's up with you?

377
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,320
Where shall I take you?

378
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,756
Miss, where shall I take you?

379
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,160
What?

380
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,040
Erm...

381
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,436
Yeonhui-dong.

382
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,040
Yeonhui-dong? Okay.

383
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,800
That refugee girl Rania...

384
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,920
You loved her.

385
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,520
I'm not sure.

386
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,436
Even that isn't clear now.

387
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,760
I don't know if it was love,
or just useless compassion.

388
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,636
Useless?

389
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,720
Rania worked with
Blackstone as an interpreter

390
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,560
because I introduced her to them.

391
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,760
Well then, I'll get going now.

392
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,676
Where to?

393
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,040
The dormitory.

394
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,596
Forget it.

395
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,716
Cloud Nine here is where
you'll work from now on.

396
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,636
Use the JSS residences.

397
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,156
Forget it.

398
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,476
I'm comfortable where I am now.

399
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,036
At JSS,

400
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,916
if someone is assigned to Cloud Nine,

401
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,796
from that moment onward,

402
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,000
I take care of them as if they're family.

403
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,796
To me, it sounds like

404
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,196
from that moment onward,

405
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,720
you want me to live as your slave.

406
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:48,276
I've never betrayed anyone

407
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,876
who hasn't betrayed me.

408
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,120
There is no master who
doesn't betray their slave.

409
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,480
But it's possible not
to betray a friend, right?

410
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,080
Friend?

411
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,961
(JB Card 6♪9 Jang Mi-ran $7.60 debit/taxi)

412
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,240
Well done.

413
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,436
Like this.

414
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,716
Can you hear that music?

415
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,596
One step, two step.

416
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,040
Let's do it like this.

417
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,160
This way.

418
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,520
Spin around. Woo.

419
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,760
Other way.

420
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,240
You try it too.

421
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,440
Oh my, great job.

422
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,920
So, do you start working
at Cloud Nine today?

423
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,880
No, I'm not going to work.

424
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,440
So you didn't make it. Shucks.

425
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,760
That's a shame.

426
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,116
-Did you have fun?
-Yeah.

427
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,116
What did you do?

428
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,000
After reading a book together, we...

429
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,640
(Yeonhui-dong Photo Studio)

430
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,440
Excuse me.

431
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,320
Yes, welcome.

432
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,756
Seeing that you're here
first thing in the morning,

433
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,760
do you need a passport
photo? Class registry photo?

434
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,240
That photo outside...

435
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,796
Eom Hye-rin...

436
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,156
So you're her daughter!

I'm Anna.

That's right.

-You're working hard.
-Thank you.

441
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,116
But J4 left a while ago,
and still hasn't come back.

442
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,116
I was about to report
it to the situation room.

443
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,356
J4?

444
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,960
Yes.

445
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,520
Oh, my. Je-ha.

446
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,320
You can't suddenly show up like this!

447
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,040
Seriously. Ugh...

448
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,076
What? What?

449
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,716
Why are you acting like that, Je-ha?

450
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,076
What is it? Why are you being this way?

451
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,116
Oh, my.

452
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,796
Back then, your mother
was the prettiest ever.

453
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,076
Even when this photo was taken,

454
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,200
her eyes were just sparkling.

455
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,316
Do you know my mom well?

456
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,396
Come on. How could I know her?

457
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,516
Your mom was a movie star.

458
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,316
Actually, your mom wasn't someone

459
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,356
who'd have her photo
taken at a studio like this.

460
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,596
She should've had it
taken at a good studio.

461
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,956
But that day, she came to
have your passport photo taken,

462
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,356
and she suddenly wanted
a family photo as well.

463
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,076
So I was lucky enough to take it.

464
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,636
My passport photo?

465
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,996
Yes, your passport photo.

466
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,156
-You went to America, right?
-What?

467
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,000
You had a photo taken
for an American visa, too.

468
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,796
And you had this final family photo

469
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,076
taken with this lady here.

470
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,880
Since to your mom, this lady was family.

471
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,956
In this frame,

472
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,640
I deliberately folded
over the part with her in it.

473
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,520
Since it didn't look pretty.

474
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,480
That's right.

475
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,280
There was that lady.

476
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,880
Yes, I'm on my way to the situation room.

477
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,756
Of course.

478
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,476
We need to check police
cameras and everything else.

479
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,036
Ah, but Chief Ju, what now?

480
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,396
We'll have to report this to Ms. Choi.

481
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,476
At this rate, we'll all be dead.

482
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,716
Sir, calm down.

483
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,876
I think it'll be good if
we just try to find her

484
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,920
before Assemblyman Jang
and Ms. Choi's afternoon event.

485
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,760
Right. Of course.

486
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,240
I'll take responsibility.

487
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,480
I'm sorry.

488
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,116
Right.

489
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,396
What's gone missing?

490
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,720
Did she leave a note or anything?

491
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,876
There was no note.

492
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,836
What's missing is my
wallet and walkie-talkie.

493
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,520
Your walkie-talkie...Seriously!

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,276
She used my card to pay for a taxi.

498
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,796
She's used it twice.

499
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,916
I should report the card as lost.

500
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,036
You can't. Are you nuts?

501
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,316
Leave it be. Get in touch
with the situation room.

502
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,920
And find out where
the taxi dropped her off!

503
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,200
This is such a relief.

504
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,956
That lady was someone
who lived in this neighborhood.

505
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,720
I heard she's living in
a nursing home now.

506
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,400
Poor her.

507
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,436
Ah, Lee Myeong-ja in Room 101.

508
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,360
It's right over that way.

509
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,916
How's the food settling?

510
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,116
Are you feeling uncomfortable in any way?

511
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,916
No, I've gotten a lot better.

512
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,116
If there's anything you need,
please tell me right away.

513
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,440
It's a relief that you've
gotten much better.

514
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,040
Ma'am.

515
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,120
Ma'am, I'm Anna.

516
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,276
Hye-rin.

517
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,996
Hye-rin, I'm hungry.

518
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,876
Give me something to eat.

519
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,076
What?

520
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,240
She just ate a little while ago.

521
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,356
Hye-rin, that hussy
took and ate all my food.

522
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,476
Oh, I'm so hungry.

523
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,676
Oh, I'm so hungry, Hye-rin.

524
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,240
I'm so hungry.

525
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,236
Ma'am.

526
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,956
I'm Anna. Anna.

527
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,880
Do you remember me?

528
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,916
Anna?

529
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,876
Yes.

530
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,916
Right, Hye-rin. Run away quick!

531
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,236
Quick, take Anna to
America! You have to go fast!

532
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,916
Choi Yu-jin found out about everything.

533
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,556
Run away!

534
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,076
That person will kill both you and Anna.

535
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,076
You have to go fast. Go fast. Go fast.

536
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,596
Go fast, go fast. Go fast, Hye-rin.

537
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,760
You have to go fast. You have to go fast.

538
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,680
That's right.

539
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,000
It's Choi Yu-jin, isn't it?

540
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,476
You knew everything, right?

541
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,156
You can't put that much water in flour.

542
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,880
It smells bad.

543
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,600
Squid soup...

544
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,120
Hye-rin.

545
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,676
Give me something to eat.

546
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,960
-I'm hungry.
-Ma'am...

547
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,640
Give me something to eat.

548
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,000
Ma'am.

549
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,160
-Ma'am...-Hye-rin, I'm hungry.

550
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,280
Patrol cars are guarding
the front and back doors.

551
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,120
We're going in now.

552
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,240
Keep security tight, with no cracks.

553
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,476
Have you seen anyone who looks like this?

554
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,396
Ah, she came to visit
the patient in Room 101.

555
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,040
She went that way.

556
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,960
J4. You go ahead.

557
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,196
This is J4. The target isn't here.

558
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,520
Search well. She went that way.

559
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,280
She's not in the men's ward.

560
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,236
Yes, Assemblyman. I'm sorry.

561
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,920
Yes. We'll definitely find her.

562
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,160
What?

563
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,120
Yes. Understood.

564
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,000
Was that Assemblyman Jang?

565
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,876
I guess the JSS director
finally reported to him.

566
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,276
He couldn't stand to wait.

567
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,036
So what did he say?

568
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,640
He said to keep her from
showing up at the church.

569
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,956
In the end, he's more worried
about himself than his daughter.

570
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,960
Well, he's a politician.

571
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,240
My dad isn't that kind of person.

572
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,040
This is all because
Choi Yu-jin is next to him.

573
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,596
Ma'am, give that to
me. I'll carry it for you.

574
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,080
Please take my hand.

575
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,036
Assemblyman Jang.

576
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,640
It's difficult, isn't it?

577
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,400
That way.

578
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,156
What does he think he's doing?

579
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,756
Aren't Assemblyman Park and
Assemblyman Jang very different?

580
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,156
What is he doing, bringing his car?

581
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,516
Isn't that Assemblyman Park?

582
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,956
-Go on in.
-Yes.

583
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,916
She's definitely in here.
Thoroughly search the place.

584
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,120
She can't be allowed to get near any VIPs.

585
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,320
Oh, you're here early.

586
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,040
Sit. Sit, sit.

587
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,280
Hold on. Jang Se-jun...

588
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,320
Over that way.

589
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,840
Even helping someone else's wife.

590
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,360
Thank you.

591
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,840
I'll put your bag here, ma'am.

592
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,596
Assemblyman Jang! Come on over. Come here.

593
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,036
Ms. Choi, come here. There are seats.

594
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,116
Come here, come here.

595
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,396
-No, that's all right.
-Come on over. Why not?

596
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,716
There are seats here.

597
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,956
Come on over.

598
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,276
-Haha...Seriously.
-Here, sit here.

599
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,036
That's all right. We'll go to the back.

600
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,916
No, you can't do that.

601
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,156
Please sit. We're fine.

602
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,556
No, no. That's all right.

603
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,356
-It's okay.
-No, don't be like this.

604
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,320
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

605
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,440
They got me good. Seriously...

606
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,956
Before our ceremony today,

607
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,236
in memory of those who perished,

608
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,236
nuns from multiple
convents will join together

609
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,120
in singing a song of memorial.

610
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,960
Dad.

611
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,396
Why is Anna...

612
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,200
Dad.

613
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,320
The nuns.

614
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,440
The target is among the nuns.

615
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,760
We'll move in.

616
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,600
No.

617
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,400
No.

618
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,880
No, Anna.

619
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,676
Stop her.

620
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,436
-Now?
-It can't be helped.

621
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,596
Stop her physically if necessary.

622
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,316
If she opens her mouth...

623
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,596
Hold on.

624
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:26,160
Ah...It seems we have one more song.

625
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,200
Bravo!

626
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,080
No, Anna.

627
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,280
Anna, you can't.

628
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,120
Anna. Anna!

629
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,920
Just a moment.

630
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,200
What is it?

631
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,560
Nothing at all.

632
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,120
Hold on a second.

633
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:02,916
Dad, it seems I've lost my way.

634
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,436
Come and get me.

635
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,600
You know where I am, right?

636
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,036
If Anna is revealed to the world now,

637
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,796
everything is over.

638
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,040
That's what I want to say right now.

639
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,400
How did you guard that kid

640
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,836
that this could happen?

641
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,836
Forget it.

642
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,640
Hurry and think of
where she's referring to.

643
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,040
I'm telling you, I don't know.

644
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,996
The kid is waiting steadfastly
for her dad to come and find her,

645
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,436
and you don't know where the place is?

646
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,036
How could I know that?
It's been over 10 years.

647
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,836
Anna is pathetic,

648
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,680
but I'm truly sad as well.

649
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,080
She believes this kind of
dad will come to find her...

650
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,640
Look, just stop it.

651
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,000
What are you trying to do here?

652
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,356
Chief Ju, leave us for a moment.

653
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,120
Yes, ma'am.

654
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,196
14 years ago on that day,

655
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,480
on the last day that I
made breakfast for you,

656
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,556
if only you had just broken
down the door and left the house.

657
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,916
Then I wouldn't have gone so far...

658
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,720
I wouldn't have despised you.

659
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,800
Breakfast is almost ready.

660
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,040
(Suicide of unfortunate star Eom Hye-rin!)

661
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,760
If you leave this house now,

662
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,120
Anna will die as well.

663
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,916
Well then,

664
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,916
should I have allowed Anna

665
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,360
to die in your hands?

666
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,320
Wow. This murderess.

667
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,996
That's what I thought, too, up until now.

668
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,356
I thought you cooperated to
keep Anna from dying in my hands.

669
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,000
But...

670
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,196
Now we both know everything.

671
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,836
You simply were afraid
that Anna would become

672
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,960
an obstacle to your ambitions.

673
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,040
Have you found anything out?

674
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,320
Nothing at all.

675
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,396
Find out about everyone
who came out of the church.

676
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,476
Be alert,

677
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,636
and find whatever
information is out there.

678
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,196
-Got it?
-Yes.

679
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,000
If we do poorly here,
it's all over for us.

680
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,876
-Which one?
-That one.

681
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,200
The Viking?

682
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,516
Oh dear.

683
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,800
-You can't ride it.
-What now?

684
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,476
Anna, what will we do?

685
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,400
You're just a little too short.
You can ride it next year.

686
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,076
Dad, come quick!

687
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,356
Right. The ice cream is here.

688
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,356
Let's eat.

689
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,836
We are looking for a six-year-old girl.

690
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,956
We are looking for a six-year-old
girl from Ssangmun-dong.

691
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,036
She's wearing a blue striped T-shirt...

692
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,036
-Anna.
-Yeah?

693
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,476
If you're in a place like this,

694
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,276
and you lose me or your mom,

695
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,676
what should you do?

696
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,876
I should take a taxi.

697
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,276
And say, "Please go to
Jongro-gu Dohwa-dong No. 1371."

698
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,000
What?

699
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,636
Wow, our Anna is so smart.

700
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,956
Dad, I'm eight years old.
I should know that much.

701
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,956
But Anna, what if it's a place
where you can't take a taxi?

702
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,916
Like a foreign country?

703
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,520
Then I'd have to hurry and look for you.

704
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,876
Anna.

705
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,556
At a time like that, if you look for me

706
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,716
and wander around,
I can't find you, right?

707
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,996
I guess so. Then what should I do?

708
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:39,396
You should stay put in the
place where you lost me.

709
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,876
-Really?
-Yeah.

710
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,036
No matter how scared you
are, you have to bear it and wait.

711
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,796
Then I can come to find you.

712
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,160
I'll come to where you are.

713
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,916
Okay, got it.

714
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,996
I'll stay put in that spot.

715
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,240
You definitely have to come and find me!

716
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,960
Oh, of course!

717
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,076
Of course I switched to the latest phone.

718
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,916
The resolution is no joke.

719
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,236
You don't even need photoshop.

720
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,996
I'll take a picture and send it to you.

721
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,716
-Okay.
-He said to send it?

722
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,040
He said to send a picture.

723
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,236
There.

724
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,960
-This side will look pretty.
-One, two, three.

725
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,440
-How cute.
-This came out pretty.

726
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,080
I found her.

727
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,000
Really?

728
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,560
Ah, right.

729
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,116
We're okay then. Where is she?

730
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,080
She's at Dream Forest in northern Seoul.

731
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,196
Say, Team Leader Seo.

732
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,436
What?

733
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,360
-I have a request.
-What? A request?

734
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,836
Don't you mean an order?

735
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,240
Yeah, it's a request.

736
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,996
Here.

737
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,640
What about Dad?

738
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,080
Your dad is kind of busy.

739
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,240
Your dad sent me here.

740
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,720
It's true.

741
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,356
If your dad hadn't sent me,

742
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,240
how would I have known to come here?

743
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,236
Earlier,

744
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,080
you bore things well.

745
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,640
What did my dad say?

746
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,676
You dad...Well...

747
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,556
What did he say?

748
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,076
He asked you to wait
a little longer, and...

749
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:38,956
If he becomes president...

750
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,996
He didn't get angry?

751
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,120
Since I suddenly appeared?

752
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,440
Angry?

753
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,636
Of course not.

754
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,760
He's very worried.

755
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,196
Take this already. It's all going to melt.

756
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,280
Your dad told me to give you this.

757
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,756
Really?

758
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,160
My dad sent this?

759
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,800
Of course.

760
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,560
I see.

761
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,640
If it's from my dad, I should eat it.

762
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,000
It's good.

763
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,076
This is Team Leader Seo.

764
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,236
Until K2 brings out the VIP,

765
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,160
no one is to approach.

766
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,996
Yes. Understood.

767
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,076
But Observation Team,

768
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,920
what are those two doing now?

769
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,640
They're eating ice cream together.

770
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,040
This used to be Dream
Land, an amusement park.

771
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,680
And...

772
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,596
It was my very own

773
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,880
mundo de ensueno.

774
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:18,716
It was the first amusement
park I ever visited with my dad.

775
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,436
In the past, there was
a scary roller coaster

776
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,360
that would drop you from
up high all the way down.

777
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,916
Although I was too young to ride it.

778
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,916
Truthfully, I was very excited
that my dad came along at all.

779
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,356
Since I had something to
brag about to my friends.

780
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,716
I can imagine.

781
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,680
You must have really liked it.

782
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,716
But I couldn't brag about it.

783
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:54,840
Since people couldn't know who my dad was.

784
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,560
That's what my mom said.

785
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,160
My dad...

786
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,716
My dad

787
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,996
was such a high-up person,

788
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,800
if people found out we were his family,

789
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,876
bad people

790
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,800
would give Dad a hard time.

791
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:21,080
I didn't know it was a lie back then.

792
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,440
I was just scared that bad people

793
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,996
would give Dad a hard time.

794
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,400
So I think I just bore with it.

795
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,436
Hey, Anna.

796
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,040
Are you not well?

797
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,796
Vana ilusion.

798
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,000
Anna, are you okay?

799
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,120
But now I know.

800
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,440
It's me...

801
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,000
It's me who was that bad person.

802
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,076
Anna, what's with you?

803
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,640
Anna!

804
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,676
This is K2. Call an ambulance quick.

805
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,476
-What?
-Call an ambulance!

806
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,596
Damnit...

807
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,960
Wait.

808
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,356
Anna, snap out of it.

809
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,716
Wake up, Anna!

810
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,756
What? Strawberry ice cream?

811
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,796
Oh, dear. This is bad.

812
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,036
Anna has a severe strawberry allergy.

813
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,116
What? A strawberry allergy?

814
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,160
Just eating a little could kill her.

815
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,276
Hey, you! It's because
of the strawberries!

816
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,916
She has a strawberry allergy!

817
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,556
Strawberries?

818
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,636
Really? My dad sent this?

819
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,916
-Of course.
-It's good.

820
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,320
Does she have a pulse?

821
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,836
Yes, she does, but her pulse is weak.

822
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,836
Dang it...

823
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,956
Her airway is blocked right now.

824
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,076
Until the ambulance
comes, use mouth-to-mouth

825
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,760
to keep her breathing, or else she'll die!

826
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,480
Anna, wake up.

827
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,440
Anna, wake up!
