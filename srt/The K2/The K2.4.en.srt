(The K2)

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you all right?

8
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,800
Just a moment.

9
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,516
Well, well.

10
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,480
There are so many unwell people.

11
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,680
Are you all right?

12
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,916
Who's that person? That person!

13
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,356
Who?

14
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,880
The one with gray hair?

15
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,280
Are you joking?

16
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,680
(Episode 4)

17
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,160
Yes, sir.

18
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,076
He's arrived after a private
conversation with Chief Ju.

19
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,920
But he seems to be in poor condition.

20
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,276
Who? The one with gray hair?

21
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,036
Are you joking?

22
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,996
He's Assemblyman Park Gwan-su.

23
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,676
He's currently the strongest
candidate for president.

24
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,796
But most likely, he was also the one

25
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,040
who ordered that you
and Choi Yu-jin be killed.

26
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,920
Okay.

27
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,960
Park Gwan-su, you scumbag!

28
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,196
How old did you say your son was?

29
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,396
I think he's 32 this year.

30
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,680
Yes, that would be right.

31
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,116
When I was newly elected,
and saw you for the first time

32
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,476
in the basement of the
Assembly office building,

33
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,716
he had just started grade school, right?

34
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,916
That's right.

35
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,160
Right. Time flies.

36
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,916
Back then, my hair was black.

37
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,160
It's already gone gray.

38
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,240
Yes, indeed.

39
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,716
But sir...

40
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,036
Yeah?

41
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,716
I think it'd be better to have

42
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,956
a younger man with
good eyes shave you now.

43
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,756
Since I've gotten older,

44
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,636
my vision is fading.

45
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,956
Oh?

46
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,516
What are you saying?

47
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,796
Of all the barbers in the world,

48
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,196
who can I entrust my neck to except you?

49
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,996
Wear reading glasses.

50
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,036
I'm much obliged to you.

51
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,840
There are plenty of barbers out there.

52
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,716
But speaking of which,
you're in trouble now.

53
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,996
Every morning next
year, you'll need to make

54
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,996
a business trip to Mt. Bukak
to reach the Blue House.

55
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,956
Of course I should go.

56
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,276
You've come to me for over 20 years.

57
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,396
How could I not go to
see you for five years?

58
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,000
It's an honor.

59
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,676
You mean it, right?

60
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,676
Yes.

61
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,716
That's a promise.

62
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,480
Of course.

63
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,916
That's good. Please finish up now.

64
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,956
What?

65
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,480
But the shave and shampoo...

66
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,840
I have something urgent to deal with.

67
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,680
Okay.

68
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,080
Thank you.

69
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,756
Oh, this is strange.

70
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,080
What? Did something go missing?

71
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,716
Did you see a business card
holder on the floor anywhere?

72
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,716
A business card holder?

73
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,356
Yes.

74
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,280
Where did it go?

75
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,116
Oh, it was here.

76
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,320
I see.

77
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,320
Kid, you can't go there. Hold on.

78
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,120
Hey. Please wait a bit.

79
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,676
Goodness.

80
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,276
You got stuck after cutting in line.

81
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,276
Serves you right.

82
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,600
Mom!

83
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,556
Don't cry.

84
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,756
It'll start moving again very soon, okay?

85
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,600
Just a moment.

86
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,600
Mom.

87
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,076
-Assemblyman.
-Yes?

88
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,916
-How about going out this way?
-Oh, okay.

89
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,080
Don't cry! Right then.

90
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,400
Mom!

91
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,240
Yeah, I got it. I'm going now.

92
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
Excuse me!

93
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,476
I need to make a brief inspection.

94
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,440
I hope you'll cooperate.

95
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,160
Could you show me your identification?

96
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,396
So it was you.

97
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,840
Nice to see you.

98
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,116
Code Blue. Code Blue.

99
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,996
All agents, block off all hotel entrances

100
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,996
and secure the perimeter.

101
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,120
The suspect is in his 30s with
a white shirt and black pants.

102
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,080
Stop!

103
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,360
Huh? What's this?

104
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,596
Wait...

105
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,440
What is this?

106
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,600
Main gate. Main gate.

107
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,160
A booby trap that'd go off once
he got near the revolving door.

108
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,996
How very like you.

109
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,756
It was a good strategy, but...

110
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,560
I should acknowledge you.

111
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,756
Thank you.

112
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,196
It's caused a real uproar.

113
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,236
It'll be a disaster if
anything happens to you,

114
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,440
yet you go and do such dangerous things.

115
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,396
Are you continuing to delay
the sending of the email?

116
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,440
Isn't that the reason
you're still doing okay?

117
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,960
Kim Je-ha.

118
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,676
When you fire a gun at an enemy,

119
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,476
it is the bullet that kills him?

120
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,196
Is it the gun that kills him?

121
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,320
Or is it the finger pulling
the trigger that kills him?

122
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,156
If you can't pull the trigger
on account of your PTSD...

123
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,720
(Post-traumatic stress disorder)

124
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,956
I'll pull the trigger for you.

125
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,036
There's no need.

126
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,156
Because I'll do it myself.

127
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,916
No. You've been exposed.

128
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,196
You can't do things alone anymore.

129
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,040
You must know after seeing him today...

130
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,836
Park Gwan-su isn't such a pushover.

131
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,400
And in the future, his
security will be much stronger.

132
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,840
I don't know why you're
going after Park Gwan-su,

133
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,120
but the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

134
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,836
Allow us to help you.

135
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,076
And wait for the right time.

136
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,956
At the right time,

137
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,160
JSS will become a gun for you.

138
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,316
You'll become the bullet.

139
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,360
Because I'll pull the trigger for you.

140
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,920
We've each met the right
person at just the right time...

141
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,280
Friend.

142
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,836
Oh, what the heck?

143
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,836
What?

144
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,436
I thought if I came back,
I'd get a huge bonus

145
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,236
and be promoted to a
bodyguard for Ms. Choi.

146
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,796
Working overseas is overrated.

147
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,076
I rotted there for two years
without seeing Lionel Messi once.

148
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,076
Now I come here, and
it's the same situation.

149
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,276
Well, I'm just so thankful
that you came back.

150
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,956
Living overseas where
you couldn't communicate

151
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,196
was basically a prison sentence.

152
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,916
I'm in prison now as well.

153
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,036
If this isn't a prison, what is?

154
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,076
Anna will hear.

155
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,276
I don't care if she does.

156
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,756
You really just...

157
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,520
She's asleep right now.

158
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,036
Right. In the end, I won't get promoted,

159
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,516
won't be able to date,
won't even see the sun,

160
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,636
and will just grow old and
die in here with Anna. That's it.

161
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,676
Bear with it a bit.

162
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,356
There's only a year
left until the election.

163
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,076
Exactly. When exactly will that year pass?

164
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,516
Why am I the only one stuck like this?

165
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,356
Clean up after yourself. What's this mess?

166
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,716
If Assemblyman Jang suddenly shows up,

167
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,316
what will you do? Hurry, hurry.

168
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,996
Assemblyman Jang? The girl's father?

169
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,880
Why would he come here? He'll never come.

170
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,996
He could come.

171
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,680
She's his daughter, after all.

172
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,356
There's no way he'll come.

173
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,756
As long as that scary Ms.
Choi is watching everything here,

174
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,156
no one will ever come to this place.

175
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,960
Anna will hear you.

176
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,440
I'm saying that no one will come.

177
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,240
Right. It's not that my
dad doesn't want to come.

178
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,040
He can't come because of that woman.

179
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,720
Hey. You look pooped out today.

180
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,076
-Me?
-Yeah.

181
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,996
Why do I look pooped?

182
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,960
You just pooped in there.

183
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,596
Oh, I'm going to blow my lid.

184
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,596
Blow your lid?

185
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,960
That would be the most explosive lid ever.

186
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,840
Oh, my. What on earth? Oh, my word...

187
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,756
Oh, Kim Je-ha. Welcome.

188
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,556
-You're here to get your cast off.
-Yes.

189
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,240
Please sit and wait for a moment.

190
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,596
Oh, Kim Je-ha. You're here.

191
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,880
What a foppy-looking little
dandy of a fellow. Hmph.

192
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,556
How is it? Is it okay?

193
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,036
Yes.

194
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,076
You're treating your
patient very differently

195
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,716
from how you treat me.

196
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,036
What are you doing here right now?

197
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,560
Get out already. Please.

198
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,676
Hey!

199
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,956
You! I think your hand is okay now.

200
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,996
Come to the training area starting today.

201
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,836
I cut you slack because of your cast,

202
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,396
but the trainees are supposed
to complete the training course.

203
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,716
Got it?

204
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,040
Come right away.

205
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,196
-That hurts.
-Don't overreact.

206
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,960
It really does hurt. It really does.

207
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,076
Hey! Don't, don't. No need to sit.

208
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,200
Come here.

209
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,720
Come here.

210
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,996
Have you heard my name before?

211
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,280
-No.
-I'm Song Yeong-chun.

212
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,280
-Yes, Song...-Not Song. Just Yeong-chun.

213
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,520
Doesn't it remind you of anything?

214
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,476
-Actor Seo Yeong-chun.
-How ignorant.

215
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,916
Don't you know Wing Chun?

216
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,916
I'm the true heir of
that famous Wing Chun.

217
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,116
I'm Master Song Yeong-chun.

218
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,756
-Yes.
-Anyway, no need to ramble.

219
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,036
Come at me.

220
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,960
-What?
-I'm telling you to attack.

221
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,596
Who told you to do that?

222
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,236
Sparring is about getting into a stance,

223
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,480
making a polite acknowledgment,
and only then starting.

224
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,556
Who taught you that? Well?

225
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,516
Okay, if your opponent is standing there

226
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,040
with his weight shifted to the front...

227
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,876
He can avoid it like that.

228
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,676
So? Got it?

229
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,400
And then you suddenly...

230
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,916
Hey, you did well. You did well!

231
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,760
Really. And then when he's distracted...

232
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,880
Okay, okay. Enough.

233
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,120
Did you see that? You
saw that, didn't you guys?

234
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,516
When your opponent keeps

235
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,556
throwing his weight around,

236
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,196
you need to lower and tighten your stance.

237
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,836
You must counterattack.

238
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,476
Do you get what that means? Do you get it?

239
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,396
-Kim Je-ha.
-Huh? What's this?

240
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,756
Chief Ju is calling for you.

241
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,996
Really?

242
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,116
Hey, I intended to
teach you properly today,

243
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,236
but you got lucky.

244
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,720
I got it. Go ahead, okay?

245
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,000
Okay, wait. What?

246
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,600
Being polite.

247
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
What? What?

248
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,600
You got your cast off.

249
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,836
Yes.

250
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,000
Then your probation
period should be finished.

251
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,636
Starting today, you'll join the VIP team.

252
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,916
Team Leader Seo, assign him to his place.

253
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,080
Chief, this is too fast.

254
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,916
The team members are not prepared

255
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,156
to accept him yet...

256
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,636
If my business is over, I'll leave now.

257
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,756
I'd like to take a shower.

258
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,116
Okay.

259
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,600
Go on.

260
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,476
Chief.

261
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,916
The team members whom he injured before

262
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,036
will be extremely unhappy about this.

263
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,876
Team Leader Seo.

264
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,240
Yes?

265
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,000
Do you like hunting?

266
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,036
Let's say there's a hunter.

267
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,960
He acquires a good hunting dog somewhere.

268
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,916
So he's excited,

269
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,436
and he brings the dog home.

270
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,596
But there are already

271
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,876
a number of hunting dogs at that house.

272
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,516
And of course they start growling

273
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,636
as soon as they see the new hunting dog.

274
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,196
So what now?

275
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
What should the hunter do?

276
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,036
We just put the new dog in
with the other hunting dogs.

277
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,680
They'll figure out the
hierarchy for themselves.

278
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,316
Whether his tail will droop,
whether he gets bitten to death,

279
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,916
whether a new alpha will emerge...

280
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,160
The next day,

281
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,200
can't we naturally tell what happens?

282
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,920
Hey.

283
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,840
How have you been?

284
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,240
Hey, get back. Get back.

285
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,120
Dang it! My eyes sting.

286
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,160
Hey, hey. Careful of
the floor. It's slippery.

287
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,080
I said be careful of
the floor. It's slippery.

288
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,876
Hey! Let's go all at once!

289
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,200
-Let's go!
-Attack!

290
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,920
Gosh.

291
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,036
Master Seo Yeong-chun, the floor...

292
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,960
I'm Song Yeong-chun, not Seo.

293
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,436
Ah! Ugh, my butt...

294
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,516
I was telling you it was slippery.

295
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,360
Anyway, he's in such a rush.

296
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,840
Did you find anything?

297
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,076
No. What would I find in this?

298
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,480
Really?

299
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,876
I will now introduce the new team member

300
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,800
who will work on the
VIP team starting today.

301
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,996
This is Kim Je-ha.

302
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,560
His pager code is K2.

303
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,280
What's with those expressions?

304
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Did you chew on dung or what?

305
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,836
We failed to protect our VIP client.

306
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,156
The attack of just one person

307
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,916
made us crumble uselessly,
and it was a pathetic sight.

308
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,436
But that one person

309
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,636
gave us the chance to clearly identify

310
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,160
what the current problems
are in our security system.

311
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,160
We should be very grateful for that.

312
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,156
So on the basis of this
valuable experience,

313
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,316
the research team should analyze

314
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,116
the problematic aspects
of our security system.

315
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,916
To prevent any future
issues like this from occurring,

316
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,916
we have decided to introduce

317
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,076
a new security system
and revamp its organization.

318
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,796
Thus, there have been unavoidable changes

319
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,760
in personnel assignments and placing.

320
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,676
The new organizational chart

321
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,916
will be posted outside,
so be sure to check it.

322
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
That is all. Good luck.

323
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,680
K2!

324
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,396
You will work

325
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,160
in an environment where
teamwork is not really necessary.

326
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,240
It makes no difference to me.

327
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,956
(JSS 3Q/4Q Emergency Organization)

328

(VVIP-C Team Night Duty Kim Je-ha, K2)

329
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,880
(Chief Medical Officer)

330
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,156
Hi.

331
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,676
Amazing.

332
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,676
-What?
-Did you hear about Kim Je-ha?

333
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,036
No. Why?

334
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,076
He got assigned to C
Team night duty surveillance.

335
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,076
C Team? Night surveillance?

336
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,076
Yikes, he was standing in the wrong line.

337
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,396
Poor guy. What a waste of a fine guy.

338
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,596
He must have been targeted
by Team Leader Seo, like me.

339
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,516
Exactly. He got a raw deal, just like you.

340
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,876
Anyway, Thumbelina won the lottery.

341
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,236
Thumbelina? Lottery?

342
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,916
What? Who's that?

343
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,076
Thumbelina is you.

344
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,636
Huh? Me?

345
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,760
You're on C Team, girl.

346
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,000
Yes, yes, yes!

347
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,000
Great. This is so great.

348
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,080
Yahoo! Kim Je-ha is toast. This is crazy.

349
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,320
But hey. Who on earth
are you people guarding?

350
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,556
Just somebody.

351
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,836
It's obvious.

352
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,076
A girlfriend of our Playboy Jang?

353
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,916
Come on, come on.
Don't ask things like that.

354
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,556
Hey, but are you wearing
nice, clean clothes right now?

355
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,396
Clothes?

356
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,956
You know how clothes
are that you wear at home.

357
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,956
Dear me.

358
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,036
This is why things don't work out for you.

359
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,356
Because Je-ha is on
his way over there now.

360
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,360
What? Je-ha is?

361
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,040
Why are you only telling me now? Geez!

362
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,640
Kim Je-ha?

363
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,956
Can you still not tell me about

364
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,600
your connection with Park Gwan-su?

365
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,920
It'll be better for you not to know.

366
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,756
Who's that girl named Anna?

367
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,800
Assemblyman Jang's hidden daughter.

368
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,920
That means she's not his
wife Ms. Choi's daughter.

369
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,480
So she's a girl who must
not be revealed to the world.

370
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,956
She's a keg of gunpowder
waiting to explode.

371
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,680
Exactly.

372
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,916
Almost no one knows
the truth, even within JSS.

373
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,596
So everyone who learns about this

374
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,800
is subject to careful management.

375
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,996
Including me?

376
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,560
Hey, pal. You always were
subject to special management.

377
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,756
Whatever happens,
until the election is over,

378
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,076
that girl can't have contact
with the outside world.

379
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,880
In particular, if Park Gwan-su's
people come to know about her...

380
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,836
Hello, Chief.

381
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,356
Hi there.

382
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,160
You're working hard.

383
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,520
There have been no issues.

384
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,120
-What's with you?
-What? What do you mean?

385
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,436
Say hello.

386
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,636
This is team member Kim Je-ha.

387
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,240
He'll be on night duty from now on.

388
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,996
You heard the rumors, right?

389
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,476
Rumors?

390
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,040
No.

391
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,356
Why would I?

392
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,516
That's odd.

393
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,316
You really didn't hear any rumors?

394
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,316
You know how Ms. Choi
was taken hostage that time.

395
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,116
No...

396
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,800
You would have been there as well.

397
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,276
Ah, that incident?

398
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,076
Yes, I know it.

399
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,360
Hello. I'm K2, Kim Je-ha.

400
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,320
Hello. I'm J4, Jang Mi-ran.

401
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,996
Hello, Section Head.

402
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,396
Section Head? Whatever.

403
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,076
Say hello.

404
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,040
She's served longer than me.
The ubiquitous Section Head.

405
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
Let's work well together.

406
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,356
Sit down. Well then, shall we begin?

407
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,316
Okay. I will now inform you

408
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,880
of C Team's regulations
and our VIP's tendencies.

409
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,076
J4 Jang Mi-ran.

410
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,076
Yes?

411
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,400
Just sit down.

412
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,760
Ma'am, please just
explain things comfortably.

413
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,996
The truth is,

414
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,556
Anna suffers from a severe panic disorder.

415
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,996
Sometimes she has seizures,

416
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,640
especially if she sees bright lights.

417
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,520
So we always keep the curtains closed.

418
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,796
So, like a vampire, she
can't handle sunlight...

419
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,596
No. She can go out during the day.

420
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,436
But if she's hit directly by strong light,

421
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,276
like sunshine or a camera flash,

422
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,720
she can experience short-term memory loss.

423
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,396
So she hardly does
anything during the day.

424
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,240
And at night, she only moves
around within the house.

425
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,596
She gets up at about 9 p.m.

426
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,080
She goes straight to the
bathroom at the end of the hallway.

427
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,676
She normally spends an hour in there.

428
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,716
In the meantime, we clean
her room and make her bed.

429
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,320
-And at the same time...-
We search her room.

430
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,396
We check for dangerous
or contraband items.

431
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,876
In addition to her panic disorder,

432
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,956
Anna suffers from serious social phobia.

433
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,116
She's obviously afraid of outsiders,

434
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,320
but she doesn't like
running into us, either.

435
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,756
If I prepare food for her
and set it on the table,

436
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,800
she comes down at
night and eats it by herself.

437
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,036
So unless she calls for us,

438
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,356
we don't go to the
second floor past 10 p.m.

439
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,320
We stay in our rooms as much as possible.

440
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,080
Oh my, that's great.

441
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,236
But since I always stay alert,

442
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,036
I come running out whenever she calls me.

443
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,280
(G2)

444
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,440
So what does Anna normally do at night?

445
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,516
She watches TV.

446
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,280
Mostly home shopping channels.

447
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,836
There will be nothing for you
to worry about in the house.

448
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,796
You can stay in another building
and watch surveillance footage.

449
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,996
Of course, if the VIP is
in an emergency situation,

450
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,516
you must enter,

451
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,876
implement the measures
needed, and report it after the fact.

452
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,676
Understood.

453
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,000
You're here?

454
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,116
Yeah.

455
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,160
You two are acquainted, right?

456
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,876
Please look over here.

457
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,440
Yes. It's good to see you.

458
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,796
Assemblyman, look over here.

459
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,036
Please look over here.

460
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,836
Please smile for us.

461
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,240
Yes, thank you.

462
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,236
There are 16 interior cameras

463
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,756
and five exterior cameras.

464
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,036
To maintain minimum privacy
in each bedroom and bathroom,

465
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,796
there are thermal imagery cameras.

466
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,760
Thus, there are no
blind spots in the house.

467
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,796
Recording automatically
occurs 24 hours a day,

468
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,240
and 24 hours later, footage
is automatically erased.

469
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,396
Night duty starts at 9 p.m.

470
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,196
and ends an hour after
the internal guards wake up.

471
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,076
That's at 6 a.m. So
your shift ends at 7 a.m.

472
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,276
That's all.

473
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,640
Any questions?

474
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,120
-None, pal.
-None...

475
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,996
Pal?

476
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,280
Yeah.

477
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,956
Did you just call me "pal"?

478
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,396
Yeah.

479
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,196
You're some young kid and...

480
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,276
Punk!

481
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,836
You look like some young little deer.

482
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,716
I know how old you are!

483
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,040
And I've been at this company
way longer than you, punk.

484
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,196
-Hey.
-You little...

485
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,036
You're from the special forces.

486
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,160
Lieutenant Colonel Ju told me.

487
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,200
That's right.

488
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,836
Why?

489
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,280
I was serial number 04,
class 151. What about you?

490
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,080
What about you?

491
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,200
But...

492
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,560
We're out in society, not in the military.

493
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,876
You're my senior.

494
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,080
Yeah.

495
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,120
-Make me a cup of coffee.
-Yes?

496
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,876
There's nothing but instant coffee.

497
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,436
-Yeah, I want instant coffee.
-Okay.

498
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,640
-Do you drink your coffee strong?
-Yeah. Make two packets.

499
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,076
-I'm okay.
-Two for me.

500
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,760
Ah, two for you...

501
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,436
-And leave your cigarettes here.
-Yes.

502
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,756
There are cigarettes over there.

503
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,080
-And a lighter.
-Yes.

504
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,200
Anything come up?

505
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,716
No. What would come up?

506
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,880
This is all pointless.

507
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,076
Exactly.

508
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,236
You're working hard for zero results.

509
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,556
I came because I thought
there might be something,

510
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,000
but I guess I wasted my time.

511
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,080
Goodness.

512
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,120
Congratulations.

513
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,756
This is my wife.

514
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,556
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

515
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,996
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

516
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,200
-This is my wife.
-She's beautiful.

517
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,920
Fancy seeing you here.

518
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,200
See you soon.

519
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,476
Ma'am.

520
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,756
What is it?

521
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,956
Oh, you scared me.

522
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,280
Why are you walking around
with nothing on underneath?

523
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,476
I'm wearing shorts.

524
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,036
You just can't see them.

525
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,196
What's for dinner tonight?

526
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,756
Oh, just put on a strip show.

527
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,516
Right.

528
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,036
Let's see how far you get this time.

529
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,556
Last time in Barcelona,

530
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,716
you put on quite a show for some time

531
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,156
because of that Western guy.

532
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,836
You'd be on the sofa wearing
disheveled workout clothes

533
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,956
and go like this and this.

534
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,640
The person watching
me is different this time.

535
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,676
I asked what's for dinner.

536
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,440
I'm not sure. I don't
even have an appetite.

537
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,236
Shall we have a marvelous
menu of ramen tonight?

538
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,036
That'd be freaking great.

539
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,956
If you want to get married,
speak in a cultured way.

540
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,436
Freaking great? What's "freaking great"?

541
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,480
Who cares? I'm still
speaking standard dialect.

542
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,916
And besides,

543
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,560
it's not like my Je-ha can hear me.

544
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,320
My Je-ha?

545
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,676
But summer is basically over,

546
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,876
so why is it so hot?

547
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,840
You undid another button, didn't you?

548
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,916
How did you know?

549
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,956
Without looking, I have
a video in my head.

550
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,520
A freaking video.

551
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,476
Dear me. But is Je-ha
watching this right now?

552
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,360
He's probably drooling all over himself.

553
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,236
Hey, aren't you getting off duty?

554
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,920
Huh? Just a second.

555
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,080
Who cooked this, huh?

556
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,000
You did.

557
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,200
Assemblyman Jang is very
popular with the ladies, right?

558
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,996
It's quite fortunate.

559
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,836
Since half the voters are women.

560
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,356
True.

561
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,160
The world is a big place,
and it's full of pretty women.

562
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,960
That's why I keep saying to smile.

563
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,036
I certainly do envy Assemblyman Jang.

564
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,320
He has such an understanding wife.

565
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,360
I Just cannot be here.

566
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:13,640
Of course, a man's loins aren't
ruled by his character, are they?

567
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,556
Right then.

568
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,440
Have you recovered after
getting out of the hospital?

569
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,196
Yes, thanks to your concern.

570
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,076
Truly. I don't know what
the world is coming to.

571
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,196
It's so scary, how can you
relax when you get into a car?

572
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,040
Exactly.

573
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,200
It looks you won't be able to
relax at the barber's anymore.

574
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,960
You heard about what happened?

575
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,276
Yes, I heard.

576
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,880
Fortunately, I think the
culprit will be caught soon.

577
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,160
Then the person behind
it will be revealed, right?

578
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,520
Oh, you're here.

579
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,676
The person responsible for terror
against me will be found soon.

580
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,240
Since there was evidence found in my car.

581
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,840
Hello, Secretary.

582
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,040
Ah, so you're acquainted
with our Miss Kim.

583
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,560
She recently began
working at our foundation.

584
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,360
Good job. You can go.

585
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,196
Even for pretty women like her,

586
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,800
the world is no easy place to live in.

587
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,316
What's the crime in being pretty?

588
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,640
The problem is men who are like snakes.

589
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,356
She does keep saying that

590
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,360
she wants to clear her
conscience about what she did.

591
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,640
What should be done?

592
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,516
Anyway, it's a problem
with the underlings.

593
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,916
They do these pointless things...

594
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Really now...

595
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,076
Exactly.

596
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,196
Why are there so many
underlings these days

597
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,480
who are going out of
bounds with their behavior?

598
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,840
So are we tied now?

599
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,840
Are you suggesting a ceasefire?

600
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,356
Even if we hurt each others' feelings,

601
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,720
how can it be okay to
hurt each other physically?

602
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,876
That's right.

603
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,876
I feel like I'm getting
the short end of the stick,

604
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,720
but I'll accept your offer of a ceasefire.

605
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,240
As expected, you're broad-minded.

606
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,280
Cheers.

607
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,560
Je-ha. Don't go. Don't go.

608
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,240
What?

609
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,520
Whoa, that scared me.

610
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,836
What?

611
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,360
What is it?

612
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,240
Where are you going?

613
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,920
What are you looking for?

614
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,840
Are you hungry?

615
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,080
Is there nothing there?

616
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,156
The cupboard?

617
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,640
On the left.

618
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,920
That's right.

619
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,120
Above!

620
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,640
What? It's not there, either?

621
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,120
What are you looking for?

622
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,440
What is it?

623
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,316
Ah, ramen!

624
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,680
Seriously...

625
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,160
No, that pot is too big.

626
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,520
That's right. That one is perfect.

627
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,240
Okay, now put in the water.

628
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,520
That's enough.

629
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,360
Hey, that's enough.

630
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,516
There's too much water. Too much.

631
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,640
Oh, it's too much...

632
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,316
Ha...

633
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,000
I'm saying there's too much water.

634
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,516
You must have been craving it like crazy.

635
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,840
Ramen.

636
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,600
What?

637
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,200
The flame?

638
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,520
Why isn't the gas lighting up?

639
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,640
Hey. The gas valve is closed.

640
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,360
The valve.

641
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,916
No, not underneath.

642
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,920
Look above. Look above it.

643
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,116
Oh? Left. On the left.

644
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,956
It's on the left. To your 10 o'clock.

645
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,120
30 degrees to the left. The valve.

646
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,440
Open the valve.

647
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,080
No. Why are you looking for
the valve underneath? It's above.

648
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,040
Huh?

649
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,716
Hey! Wait, where are you going?

650
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,956
Won't you eat the ramen?

651
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,920
If you open the valve...

652
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,360
Why take that?

653
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,640
Where did you go?

654
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,916
Don't give up!

655
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,116
Don't go!

656
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,040
No! The ramen!

657
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,680
Ah...

658
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,080
Ah, seriously...

659
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,836
No!

660
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,516
She can't find the gas valve,

661
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,036
and since she can't open
it, she can't eat the ramen...

662
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,996
So that valve! 30 degrees to the left!

663
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,996
So here is...

664
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,636
I'm seriously frustrated to death.

665
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,240
How can a girl be incapable
of boiling a pack of ramen?

666
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,680
Oh, seriously...

667
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,200
This is so frustrating.

668
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,040
Do I have to cook the ramen for her?

669
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,120
Seriously...

670
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,880
Take another car home.

671
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,076
What?

672
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,200
You have to go out again anyway.

673
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,996
Things are complicated
with the underlings,

674
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,236
and you don't want to keep
your lady friend waiting long.

675
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,640
Well...

676
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,120
You don't need to go so far for me.

677
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,036
Okay.

678
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,040
Then I'll see you at the meeting tomorrow.

679
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,676
Bring a car.

680
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,556
Just a moment.

681
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,996
Since there are lots of cameras,

682
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,280
you should wave before you go.

683
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,760
Shall I?

684
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,036
Okay, you've all worked hard.

685
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,956
Assemblyman, could we
see an affectionate pose?

686
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,080
Oh, come on. You can't ask me to do that.

687
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,120
Seriously...

688
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,920
That's good, right?

689
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,680
