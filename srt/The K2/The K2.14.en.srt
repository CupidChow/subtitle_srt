1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,040
(The K2)

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,880
(Ji Chang-wook)

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,120
(Song Yoon-a)

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,080
(Im Yoon-a)

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,520
(Cho Seong-ha)

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,560
(The K2)

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,956
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,756
At the right time,

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,436
JSS will become a gun for you.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,076
You'll become the bullet.

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,400
And I'll pull the trigger.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,956
Joining us on our VIP security team

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,556
is agent Kim Je-ha.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,160
His wireless call code is K2.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
But this kid read me.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,480
He read my mind.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,120
This kid

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,996
didn't need my orders

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,960
or my permission.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,476
He wasn't a hunting dog.

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,596
He was a wolf.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,800
I won't be able to tame him.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,160
Dad.

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,236
It seems I've lost my way.

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,080
Come and get me.

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,916
Really?

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,996
My dad sent this?

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,076
She realized her existence
was a nuisance to her father,

29
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,920
so she ate the strawberries
to get rid of herself.

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,716
Anna, no.

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,760
Don't die. Please don't die.

32
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,396
Promise me.

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,436
That you'll protect Anna to the end.

34
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,040
I promise.

35
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,280
My niece!

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,800
Who...who are you?

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,880
Me?

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,760
I'm your uncle.

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,076
If she's the kid of my brother-in-law,

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,356
then isn't she obviously
my niece? Isn't that right?

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,880
You can't do this.

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
What were you thinking

43
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,120
when you pulled Anna
out of Choi Yu-jin's hands?

44
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,116
I know it's a huge secret

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,316
that Anna is the daughter
of my brother-in-law.

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,236
So if I keep Anna close to me,

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,680
my sister can't easily take
JB Group away from me, right?

48
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,796
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,956
You should've told me in advance.

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,560
I almost had your wife killed.

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,596
I'll protect you in the future.

52
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,440
From now on, I won't let anyone touch you.

53
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
Je-ha.

54
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,520
If it's a totally dangerous situation...

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,836
You can just come back.

56
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,916
You have to come back alive.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,240
That's an order.

58
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,316
No. I can't.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,276
(But due to post-traumatic
stress disorder, Je-ha cannot kill)

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,680
Je-ha can't kill him by himself.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I told you not to mess with Anna.

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,796
That was the first time
anyone hit me in my life,

63
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,996
but you'll probably need
to shake a lot of hands

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,120
during the campaign, so
I won't cut it off right now.

65
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Keep it well.

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,196
Anna.

67
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,156
Later on, shall we live in Spain together?

68
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,356
(Je-ha and Anna dream of the future...

69
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,960
Let's go.

70
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,716
Come on in.

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,756
You're the hero who saved JSS.

72
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,036
I'm a hero?

73
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,600
And now it's time for us to set a trap.

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,556
A trap?

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,316
Yes.

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,840
And you need to gradually

77
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,520
get closer to Park Gwan-su.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,956
Of the tipoffs that have come
in regarding Eom Hye-rin,

79
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,960
this one looks like it has substance.

80
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,436
Don't you remember me?

81
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,356
We met each other that night.

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,556
In your mother's room.

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,236
Ah!

84
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,440
You forgot because I
shined that light in your eyes?

85
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,756
Are you really the one who
spread this article on the Internet?

86
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,996
We must do this so my
sister is called in to testify,

87
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,876
and in the process of that investigation,

88
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
they'll start investigating
the suspicions of murder.

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,476
Someone else's house is on fire,

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,080
but this place is like
a house of feasting.

91
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,680
Yes.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,960
Anna is...

93
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,436
My daughter.

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,676
Eom Hye-rin came to me
with young Anna in tow.

95
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,996
(But everything was a trap laid by Yu-jin)

96
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,036
She informed me that Anna was my child.

97
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,236
After that,

98
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,520
life became a nightmare

99
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,196
for me and my wife.

100
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,760
A nightmare?

101
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
Evidence of Kumargate.

102
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,036
I think I've just about found it.

103
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,116
How did you know about that?

104
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,680
It's a strategy.

105
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,716
-Chief Ju.
-Yes?

106
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
Provide backup for Je-ha.

107
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,436
Keep an eye on this one doctor.

108
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,156
Make it obvious.

109
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,396
Our target

110
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,276
has hidden data that contains key evidence

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,956
somewhere in this hospital.

112
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,636
We must make him nervous

113
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,040
so that he pulls it out
and moves it himself.

114
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,440
(Episode 14)

115
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,000
What are you doing? Catch him already!

116
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
So that's where it was.

117
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,040
Who are you?

118
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,080
-What's going on?
-Ah, right...

119
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,320
(Police Agency/Choi Su-ho)

120
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,916
I came after getting a call from security.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,196
You're Section Chief Kim Seok-han, right?

122
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,040
Yes. What's this about?

123
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,876
Get out for now. I'll escort you.

124
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,676
No, that's all right.

125
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll be going.

126
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,876
Look here...

127
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,560
Start by getting out.

128
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
Okay, hands on your head.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,640
Are you Park Gwan-su's people?

130
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,320
Or Choi Yu-jin's?

131
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Follow me!

132
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,076
Get him!

133
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,520
Stop!

134
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
Are you really going to
run away like a little rat?

135
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,996
Come down already, okay?

136
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,920
Come down already!

137
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
Ah, seriously...

138
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,840
Doctor!

139
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,960
Give that to me.

140
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,240
-Once I climb up.
-Give it to me first!

141
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,280
What should I do...

142
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,320
Damnit...

143
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
Sergeant Kim! Get in quick!

144
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,996
Sergeant Kim. Sergeant Kim!

145
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,360
Get a grip, punk.

146
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,440
Get a grip.

147
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,756
Stay with me.

148
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,036
What are you doing, pal? Step on it!

149
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,000
Hold on tight.

150
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,520
(Police)

151
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,840
Stay with me.

152
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,880
Come on!

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,080
Ma'am, it's Chief Ju.

154
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,600
Hello?

155
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,160
Miss.

156
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,240
Miss. Miss.

157
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
Huh? What is it?

158
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,080
Je-ha...

159
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,000
Je-ha...

160
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,040
Come on. Come on, punk.

161
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,080
Come on.

162
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,160
Come on, punk.

163
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,476
Sir.

164
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,040
-The time is now.
-Got it.

165
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,160
The time is now! Block the police cars!

166
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,720
Come out. Come out!

167
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,756
It's dangerous if you drive like this.

168
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,516
-You were driving all right?
-Hold on a minute.

169
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,920
What?

170
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,836
The president's son? Are you certain?

171
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,996
Right, right. Did they find...

172
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,556
What? JSS?

173
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,040
I got it.

174
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,840
Ah, I'm going to lose it.

175
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,440
You haven't heard anything else?

176
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,080
Je-ha.

177
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,760
You must come back alive.

178
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,120
Please let Je-ha make it back alive.

179
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,200
Please let him come back safely.

180
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,080
Please.

181
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,120
Please.

182
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,956
Miss!

183
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,196
Dr. Kim Seok-han fell
from the parking tower of.

184
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,356
St. Thomas Hospital this afternoon.

185
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,996
The extent of his injuries is unknown.

186
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,436
The wounded suspect

187
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,076
is currently being pursued by the police.

188
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,036
I repeat, this is breaking news.

189
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,396
This afternoon, Dr. Kim
Seok-han, son of the president,

190
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,316
fell from the parking tower

191
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,116
of St. Thomas Hospital where he works.

192
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,996
The extent of his injuries is unknown.

193
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,156
The wounded suspect

194
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,956
is currently being pursued by the police.

195
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,516
Dr. Kim Seok-han stated

196
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,916
that the apparently wounded suspect

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,996
is the employee of

198
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,756
a large domestic security company.

199
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,756
Police are still investigating
why he was wounded...

200
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,920
Right.

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,400
Using the excuse of
hunting for the culprit,

202
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,960
this is a good chance to
strike JSS headquarters.

203
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,960
Okay!

204
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,080
Oh, Commissioner. It's me.

205
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,756
You go personally

206
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,156
and search that Cloud
Nine or whatever it is

207
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,760
on the ninth floor of the JSS building.

208
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,476
We'll send along technicians,

209
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,036
so you go in person

210
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,756
and dig up all dangerous secrets
that Choi Yu-jin is keeping there,

211
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,120
then wipe the main server.

212
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,756
Yes, right.

213
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,720
Good luck.

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,040
Wow. This was all a blessing in disguise.

215
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,596
But what I'm really worried about

216
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,236
is that Kim Je-ha guy.

217
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,996
If he took the memory
card from Kim Seok-han,

218
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,076
and it ends up in Choi Yu-jin's hands,

219
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,040
then...

220
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,396
What about Je-ha?

221
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,396
Where is he now?

222
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,916
All the emergency rooms
are full of police officers,

223
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,720
so we had no choice but to come to JSS.

224
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,996
Good job.

225
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,836
We're taking him to
the medical facility now.

226
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,040
No!

227
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,280
Oh my...

228
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,076
Bring him to Cloud Nine.

229
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,276
The police will be coming.

230
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,480
Yes. Understood.

231
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,076
Get all the needed equipment
for surgery and treatment,

232
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,276
and move it down here quickly.

233
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,800
Understood.

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,236
Dr. Kim.

235
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,396
Yes, ma'am?

236
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,076
Starting now, you are a
member of Cloud Nine.

237
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,600
Pardon?

238
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,556
Ah, right.

239
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,280
Our company's fate is in your hands.

240
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,476
You must save him.

241
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,320
Yes. I'll do my best.

242
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,036
In this place today,

243
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,916
we're going to keep a rat
from getting in or out, okay?

244
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,916
-Yes.
-Yes.

245
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,080
Let's go.

246
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,236
Well, well.

247
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,876
What brings you all the way here?

248
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,320
Things are over for JSS now.

249
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,516
What is that supposed to mean?

250
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,196
Choi Yu-jin

251
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,600
crossed a line that must not be crossed.

252
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Come on, you...

253
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,560
(Search and Seizure Warrant)

254
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,036
For goodness...

255
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
(Infirmary)

256
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,916
Search every nook and
cranny of this building.

257
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,440
-Yes.
-Yes.

258
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,520
Hey, punk!

259
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,080
Sergeant Kim.

260
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,756
No.

261
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,676
No, Je-ha.

262
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,200
Don't die.

263
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,560
No!

264
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,560
Just a bit more!

265
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,520
Je-ha, please.

266
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,756
His heart is beating.

267
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,320
Prepare the defibrillator.

268
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,120
Please, please.

269
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,080
Sergeant Kim. Sergeant Kim.

270
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,316
Je-ha, come down quick.

271
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,440
We'll be late for our flight.

272
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,320
Je-ha.

273
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,120
Anna, don't come over here.

274
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,680
You head down first. I'll be right...

275
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,000
I'll be right behind you.

276
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,036
What's wrong, Je-ha?

277
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,676
What's wrong? What happened...

278
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,636
Je-ha, what's wrong with you?

279
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,160
-No, no, I'm fine.
-What is this?

280
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,916
Je-ha, what is it, huh?

281
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,276
What is this?

282
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,916
Je-ha. Je-ha!

283
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,716
What now?

284
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,916
Je-ha, wake up, okay?

285
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,876
Please wake up.

286
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,920
Je-ha, seriously, what is this...

287
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,076
Je-ha. Kim Je-ha. Kim Je-ha!

288
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,956
Wake up, Kim Je-ha!

289
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,640
Kim Je-ha!

290
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,160
Miss.

291
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,680
Je-ha is at JSS right now.

292
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,000
Sir.

293
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,756
Sir.

294
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,556
I came here knowing everything.

295
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,916
If this elevator doesn't move,

296
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,356
we can arrest you at once.

297
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,240
For concealing a criminal
and obstructing official duties.

298
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,276
Yes, this is the main server.

299
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,560
Really? Okay.

300
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,356
Mirror.

301
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,236
The important data will be safe, right?

302
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,036
Yes. The ninth-floor server

303
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,120
only contains ordinary
data regarding JSS business.

304
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,796
Yes, sir.

305
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,236
We've successfully
taken over the ninth floor.

306
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,156
Really? Good job. Good job, good job.

307
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,316
Handle it quick. Handle it quick.

308
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,600
Right.

309
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,840
Now Choi Yu-jin is nothing
but a toothless old she-cat.

310
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,356
Choi Yu-jin's Cloud Nine
was like a thorn in the eye,

311
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,796
but it's been brought to an end now.

312
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,836
But...

313
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,196
The secret data from Cloud Nine

314
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,276
won't be handed over
to Park Gwan-su, will it?

315
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,836
Don't worry.

316
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,676
We sent our technicians,

317
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,516
so they'll collect it all.

318
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,400
Congratulations on capturing JB Group.

319
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,516
But isn't it a bit early
for congratulations?

320
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,956
We don't know yet

321
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,200
if Seok-han's memory card has
fallen into Choi Yu-jin's hands.

322
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,756
Seeing how his precious son suffered,

323
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,996
I doubt the president will
just sit back and watch.

324
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,636
He won't sit back, but
there's also nothing he can do.

325
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,516
Could Seok-han really have
had the memory card taken?

326
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,996
Who knows?

327
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,040
He'll have to wake up for
us to know with certainty.

328
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,440
Are you awake, Doctor?

329
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,636
That guy...

330
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,076
What happened to that guy?

331
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,476
He's currently on the run.

332
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,316
We think he's hiding at JSS,

333
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,036
so he'll be caught soon.

334
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,160
JSS...

335
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,076
No. You can't touch him.

336
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,356
What? What are you saying?

337
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,036
I mean, he's someone who helped me.

338
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,196
He helped me when I was being chased.

339
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,076
What do you mean?

340
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,596
Starting at the hospital, he was...

341
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,040
If that's what I say, believe me.

342
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,076
That guy

343
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,080
must not be hunted down. Absolutely not.

344
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,316
Call them right away. Quick.

345
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,520
Yes.

346
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,036
-What is it?
-This is strange.

347
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,316
-What's strange?
-It's just administration data.

348
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,916
There's no way.

349
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,200
Search carefully.

350
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,520
What is it?

351
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,000
Pull out?

352
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
Who?

353
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,360
The Blue House?

354
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,916
This is...

355
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,120
Got it!

356
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,000
Dang it...

357
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,920
Seriously...

358
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,596
You're a lucky guy.

359
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,040
Isn't being lucky a skill in itself?

360
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,636
Look.

361
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,076
I told you I wasn't a pushover, right?

362
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,440
Right!

363
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,720
Hey, hey! Bring me some
salt to throw after them.

364
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,916
Tsk, tsk!

365
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,840
What is this? Embarrassing me, seriously...

366
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,400
Seriously, this...

367
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,076
Yes, sir?

368
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,356
We were told to pull out.

369
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,596
What? Pull out?

370
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,160
Yes, sir. About that...

371
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,196
It was an order from the Blue House.

372
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,516
The Blue House?

373
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,080
Goodness.

374
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,476
-So they got the data.
-Pardon?

375
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,720
What...

376
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,916
Dang it...

377
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,320
Ugh.

378
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,916
That's it.

379
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,876
Je-ha definitely took

380
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,356
the memory card away from Kim Seok-han.

381
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,880
What?

382
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,876
That's why as soon as Seok-han
woke up in the hospital...

383
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,076
So he knew that K2 had
gotten it, and he called himself...

384
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,436
That's right.

385
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,160
No one can rashly touch him now.

386
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,116
If they're hasty and pursue him,

387
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,320
Je-ha could reveal the data to our people.

388
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,076
That's it.

389
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,996
It's certain.

390
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,916
That really could be the case.

391
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,640
It's obvious.

392
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,876
Did you search Je-ha's person?

393
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,756
Did he have anything like a memory card?

394
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,000
He didn't.

395
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,516
Since we don't know for sure,

396
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,916
-search the inside of the car.
-Yes.

397
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,716
And manage your facial
expressions from now on.

398
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,956
Manage our expressions?

399
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,040
To look relaxed and
overflowing with confidence.

400
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,680
The memory card is in our hands.

401
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,636
And Chief Ju, find it quickly.

402
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,080
Yes. Understood.

403
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,440
I heard you were in grave danger.

404
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,120
So was it taken from you?

405
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,476
What? What would be taken from me?

406
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Oh, how can you be this way?

407
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,356
Your father's presidential
term is almost over.

408
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,356
You just keep your company
from getting snatched away.

409
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,000
By your sister.

410
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,400
It's that guy Kim Je-ha, right?

411
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,680
It makes sense that
he could get it from you.

412
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,076
Could it really have ended
up in Choi Yu-jin's possession?

413
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,400
Pardon?

414
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,640
What are you referring to?

415
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,596
If Park Gwan-su finds out that
this evidence is in your hands,

416
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
he'll drop out of the
race of his own accord.

417
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,956
Everyone in the economic
realm will bow their heads to you.

418
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,076
And naturally,

419
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,916
Choi Yu-jin and JB Group

420
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,796
can be brought down in one fell swoop.

421
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,996
And this is a way

422
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,960
to punish both Choi Yu-jin and
Park Gwan-su simultaneously.

423
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,716
This would be to protect Anna,

424
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,956
and to restore

425
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,720
the honor of Anna's
mother, like she wants.

426
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,596
Where is Chief Ju right now?

427
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,200
I'll confirm his location.

428
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,796
We can't let it be evident

429
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,520
that we're searching for something.

430
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,680
No matter how much we look, it's not here.

431
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,760
Yes, sir?

432
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,560
Are you looking for
something that Je-ha has lost?

433
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,240
How did you...

434
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,760
Je-ha was going to give it to me.

435
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,276
So that I could bring down Park Gwan-su

436
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,760
and free myself from
being Choi Yu-jin's puppet.

437
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,680
It seems hard for you to believe it.

438
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,876
But it's the truth.

439
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,516
If it weren't, how
would I know about this?

440
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,120
Right.

441
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,840
If you find it, I'd like
you to give it to me.

442
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,036
I want to do that, but...

443
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,076
I know you trust Choi Yu-jin
more than you trust me.

444
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,836
But if Choi Yu-jin acquires this item,

445
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,596
I can't become a proper president.

446
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,876
I would serve my term as a half...

447
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,960
No, as a complete puppet of a president.

448
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,236
The government would become
a playground for businessmen.

449
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,916
To start with, at least
don't tell her if you find it.

450
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,040
I still don't know if
I'll be able to find it.

451
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,476
What are you saying?

452
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,476
Kim Je-ha almost died.

453
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,200
Anyway, leave already.

454
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,396
Yes, ma'am?

455
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,476
I'll head up now.

456
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,836
Head up? To where?

457
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,160
The ninth floor.

458
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,240
Je-ha is on the ninth floor?

459
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,076
Master Song, do you know where Je-ha is?

460
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,996
I'm not sure.

461
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,476
I don't know.

462
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,516
They're saying he's in very bad condition.

463
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,116
Please tell me where he is, okay?

464
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,516
I don't really know,

465
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,476
but since he's a member of Cloud Nine,

466
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,116
wouldn't he be on the ninth floor?

467
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,036
The ninth floor?

468
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,116
Miss.

469
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,876
You can't go there.

470
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,040
It's not a place that just anyone can go.

471
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,520
Please scan your entry card.

472
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,240
We can't go there.

473
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,240
It's no use.

474
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,160
Je-ha. Je-ha.

475
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,080
Drag her away.

476
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,040
Yes.

477
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,476
What are you doing?

478
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,640
Drag the outsider out of
the ninth-floor stairwell.

479
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,356
How is he doing now?

480
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,120
He's stabilized a lot.

481
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,080
Right. Good job.

482
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,836
If anything changes,
contact me immediately.

483
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,120
Yes.

484
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,036
Miss, you can't be doing this here.

485
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,716
Talk to Ms. Choi for me.

486
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,956
Let me meet him just once.

487
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,796
Ask her to let me meet him just once.

488
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,916
Miss, we'll come back later. Later, okay?

489
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,040
It won't be any use for you to come later.

490
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,680
Auntie, please let me meet Je-ha.

491
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,000
Auntie?

492
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,360
What family tree are you basing that on?

493
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,916
Call me "Mom."

494
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,160
Mom.

495
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,680
Isn't a stepmother a mother, too?

496
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,516
Let me meet Je-ha just once.

497
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,076
I'm begging you.

498
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,640
You can't.

499
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,080
Just head back.

500
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,040
Mom.

501
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,040
Mom.

502
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,680
Please, I'm begging you.

503
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,880
Let me meet Je-ha.

504
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,440
Mom!

505
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,316
Hey.

506
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,600
What are you doing?

507
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,200
You poor thing.

508
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,040
Anna, get up.

509
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,520
Oh, you poor thing.

510
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,556
Right.

511
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,120
I need to think of what
happens when Je-ha wakes up.

512
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,240
Anna.

513
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,916
Je-ha is still in critical condition.

514
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The wounds he's had
surgery on aren't closed up yet.

515
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,356
Be careful.

516
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,920
Yes.

517
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,156
But Anna...

518
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,920
You really aren't going to leave?

519
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,356
Won't it be difficult

520
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,440
for Je-ha to protect you in that state?

521
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,640
When Je-ha gets better...

522
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,076
I'll leave.

523
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,520
If he gets better, will you really leave?

524
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,316
Right now,

525
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,560
Je-ha can't even go to
a hospital in that state.

526
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,276
Because the police will
immediately arrest him

527
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,680
for attempting to murder
the president's son.

528
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,640
I'm risking everything to protect Je-ha.

529
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,436
Anna.

530
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,356
Now is the time for you
to protect Je-ha as well.

531
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,916
Je-ha's identity has been exposed.

532
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,556
As long as you're here,

533
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,076
Je-ha won't be able to leave your side.

534
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,996
And then...

535
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,560
In the end, he'll be caught.

536
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,996
I'll save Je-ha.

537
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,556
You just leave.

538
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,960
That's the best thing
you can do for Je-ha.

539
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,440
You go...

540
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,076
And do everything you want.

541
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,280
I'll support you totally.

542
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,000
And then...

543
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,760
When the fates allow...

544
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,640
Meet him again later on.

545
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:20,040
And don't the housekeeper,
Mi-ran, and Seong-gyu

546
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,600
need to be saved as well?

547
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,960
Yes.

548
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,040
I'll leave.

549
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,400
In return...

550
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,560
You must save Je-ha.

551
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,040
Je-ha.

552
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,840
Why did you get so badly hurt?

553
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,040
Je-ha.

554
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,040
It hurts, doesn't it?

555
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,000
Doesn't it hurt a lot?

556
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,040
What now...

557
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,036
What will I do, Je-ha?

558
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,160
What will we do?

559
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,956
Je-ha.

560
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,440
Are you listening?

561
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,360
You can't die.

562
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,720
You can't die, Je-ha.

563
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,160
You have to live.

564
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,520
Je-ha.

565
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,520
I love you.

566
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,040
I love you, Je-ha.

567
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,720
You can't die.

568
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,116
And so?

569
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,356
Where will you be
sending Anna off to again?

570
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,480
To Lafeit.

571
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,596
Don't worry.

572
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,880
I won't hide that kid away anymore.

573
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,356
Now there's no need to hide her.

574
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,276
The whole world knows about her.

575
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,196
That she's the daughter

576
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,600
of the oh-so-famous Eom Hye-rin.

577
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,116
In Korea, Eom Hye-rin has already been

578
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,840
painted as a wicked witch.

579
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,836
The crazy Internet commenters

580
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,276
may have knocked Anna
off her "angel" pedestal,

581
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,720
but won't that be irrelevant
in a foreign country?

582
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,916
That kid

583
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,640
won't even want to glance back at Korea.

584
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,680
I will treat Anna

585
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,356
very, very well.

586
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,116
I'll make her very happy.

587
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,080
Like a real daughter.

588
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,956
So that she won't even

589
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,080
remember her mother anymore.

590
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,440
Yesterday, she even called me "Mom."

591
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,720
I heard that for the
first time in my life.

592
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,240
Mom.

593
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,276
That's a relief.

594
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:43,600
Despite our different goals,
they lead to a happy ending.

595
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,076
It's certain that the memory
card was taken from Seok-han.

596
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,960
Although he denies it.

597
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,476
If it's really fallen into
Choi Yu-jin's hands,

598
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,960
don't we need to reassess our position?

599
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,040
Are you referring to who
will be the next president?

600
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,276
Isn't that a given?

601
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,756
Don't rush into anything too hastily.

602
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,520
First, as we wait and see...

603
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,160
Hello, everyone.

604
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,436
Did all of you receive this message?

605
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,236
It's not an option to wait and see now.

606
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,916
Not if she knows who all of us are.

607
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,120
It looks like we'll have a very
charming addition to our group.

608
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,160
We should reply to her, right?

609
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,480
Congratulations on becoming a member.

610
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,316
Chairman Choi, what
brings you all the way here?

611
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,516
-You're heading to work?
-Yes.

612
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,076
I'll take you there.

613
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,636
For the first time in a
while, let's talk one-on-one.

614
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,040
Pardon?

615
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,080
How much luggage does she even have?

616
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,640
Seeing how we can't go with her...

617
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,640
Isn't someone planning
to get rid of us later?

618
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,400
What?

619
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,960
There's no way.

620
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,876
I got her to promise.

621
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,076
Miss.

622
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,316
Ms. Choi said she
won't touch you or Mi-ran.

623
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,640
So don't worry too much.

624
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:39,080
Won't it be difficult for Je-ha
to protect you in that state?

625
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,356
I'll save Je-ha.

626
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,076
You just leave.

627
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,076
That's the best thing

628
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,920
you can do for Je-ha.

629
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,156
And don't the housekeeper,

630
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,600
Mi-ran, and Seong-gyu
need to be saved as well?

631
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,040
Yes.

632
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,200
I'll leave.

633
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,640
In return...

634
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,200
You must save Je-ha.

635
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,516
Sir.

636
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,640
-You look drained.
-Right, right.

637
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,796
Chairman Choi, you're about
to totally lose your company,

638
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,520
so aren't you feeling the same way?

639
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,080
I suppose so.

640
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,720
But it's too early to assume that.

641
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,916
Would you like to form
an alliance with me?

642
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,160
Then I think we'll hit some good luck.

643
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,676
Things went well for
you in Iraq thanks to me,

644
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,516
but ever since teaming up
with my clueless father-in-law,

645
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,640
it's all been downhill for you.

646
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,596
If I take control of Cloud Nine,

647
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,036
and you acquire the memory
card that Seok-han had,

648
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:07,916
won't it all work out?

649
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,996
Well, of course, but...

650
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,316
If you think you have
anything left to lose, forget it.

651
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,800
I say that after I've already
searched the ninth floor.

652
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,676
But why does everyone think

653
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,320
that Cloud Nine must
be on the ninth floor?

654
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,920
Right, did you find it?

655
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,400
Not yet.

656
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,956
If not even that search makes it turn up...

657
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,516
It would be good if Je-ha
woke up and could tell us.

658
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,036
Exactly.

659
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,236
But if we can't find it,

660
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,880
and time keeps ticking...

661
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,200
Won't Ms. Choi's bluff be exposed soon?

662
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,440
Je-ha needs to wake
up before that happens.

663
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,320
Je-ha.

664
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,920
Are you awake?

665
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,036
Yes, ma'am.

666
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,196
Je-ha regained consciousness.

667
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,676
Really?

668
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,036
Got it. I'll head over there.

669
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,360
Yes.

670
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,920
No, Je-ha. It'll be very
bad if you move right now.

671
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,956
For the time being, you
must lie perfectly still.

672
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,680
But...

673
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,600
Here...

674
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,236
Where is this?

675
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,320
Ms. Choi has hidden you from
the police hunting you down.

676
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,960
And yesterday,

677
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,320
Anna came to see you.

678
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,956
Anna did?

679
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,996
Anna kept begging so much,

680
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,440
it seems that Ms. Choi let her in.

681
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,756
How is she?

682
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,040
What?

683
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,036
How is Anna?

684
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,000
She's just doing okay.

685
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,116
-Mirror.
-Yes, Kim Je-ha.

686
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,836
Do you record what happens in here?

687
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,036
Yes.

688
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,476
Then can I see what happened here

689
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,956
when Anna came yesterday?

690
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,796
Yes.

691
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,760
Okay, show me.

692
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,240
It hurts, doesn't it?

693
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,240
Doesn't it hurt a lot?

694
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,480
Je-ha.

695
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,360
Je-ha, what will we do?

696
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,640
What will we do, Je-ha?

697
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,520
I love you.

698
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,040
I love you, Je-ha.

699
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,436
You have to live. Okay?

700
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,240
Je-ha.

701
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,720
Je-ha.

702
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,116
I'm sorry.

703
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,920
But love

704
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,720
is not something to be shared.

705
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,876
So...

706
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,036
If we make a surprise attack now,

707
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,036
we can capture Cloud Nine and Choi Yu-jin

708
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,000
in one fell swoop?

709
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,956
But on the other hand,

710
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,480
if things go wrong, we'll
be stirring up a beehive.

711
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,876
Timing is key for the surprise attack.

712
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,036
Even if Kim Je-ha manages to get up,

713
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,920
he won't hold up long
in his wounded state.

714
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,840
Are we sure about the person
who will open the doors for us?

715
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,836
Don't you worry.

716
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,240
Just prepare your side of things.

717
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,480
Oh...

718
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,040
You're conscious.

719
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,560
You got that memory
card from Seok-han, right?

720
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,560
Where is it?

721
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,996
Hey, punk.

722
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,316
Now isn't the time to dilly-dally.

723
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,080
I didn't take it

724
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,600
in order to give it to you.

725
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,036
What are you saying?

726
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,196
Punk.

727
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,516
Do you know the danger we
went through to save you...

728
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,040
Forget it.

729
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,516
And so?

730
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,916
Why did you take it?

731
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,036
In order to ruin Park Gwan-su.

732
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,196
Right. So give it to us.

733
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,996
No.

734
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,076
You won't be able

735
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,040
to use it to bring down
Park Gwan-su anyway.

736
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,836
Why not?

737
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,320
Because if the data is revealed,
JB Group will crumble as well.

738
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,436
Aside from the externally
visible consortium,

739
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,636
the most deeply involved person
is Chairman Choi Seong-won.

740
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,156
So unless you plan to bring down JB Group,

741
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,040
you won't be able to reveal that data.

742
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,236
Fine.

743
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,236
In that case...

744
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,560
It should at least become
a means of defense.

745
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,400
No.

746
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,800
As for that...

747
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,316
I didn't take it in order to defend you.

748
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,196
Then why?

749
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,516
Now this data

750
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,040
will become like another
incriminating email.

751
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,240
It will ensure

752
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,200
the safety of me and Anna.

753
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,440
Goodness.

754
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,956
We were all totally wrong.

755
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,596
If he acts like this,

756
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,440
it was wrong to go about it this way.

757
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,280
What should I do
about this rotten feeling?

758
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,396
-What do you mean?
-From what I can see,

759
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,876
Ms. Choi has gone totally nuts.

760
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,036
Gone nuts?

761
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,876
She's been too taken
in by that Je-ha fellow.

762
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,596
-Taken in?
-You are somebody

763
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,916
who's quick on the uptake,

764
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,356
but you're so dense about
how men and women relate.

765
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,916
Look here.

766
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,356
Considering Ms. Choi's personality,

767
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,596
if that guy acts this way,
she's the type of person

768
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,796
to use leg screws or torture him

769
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,956
and find out for sure
where he hid the card.

770
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,560
Seriously...

771
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,356
Right.

772
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,400
Chief Ju, do you plan on staying here?

773
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,476
I mean, your dream of
entering the Blue House

774
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,556
and serving as the dignified
head of security there...

775
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:53,280
Aren't those dreams
going down the drain now?

776
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,276
Sir.

777
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,476
First of all, please calm down.

778
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,880
Huh?

779
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,000
Yeah.

780
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,836
Right.

781
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,036
Aren't you handling security for
the Assemblyman's event today?

782
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,196
Yes, I should get going now.

783
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,996
Let's talk again once I'm back.

784
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,840
Yes, let's do that.

785
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,880
Well then...

786
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,560
Was this intended to bring me down?

787
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,160
So that was it.

788
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,320
But why?

789
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,240
You're my friend.

790
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,680
Have you ever cried out of pity?

791
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:12,040
My life has been full
to the brim with tears.

792
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,480
No, I don't mean self-pity.

793
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,640
I mean crying for someone else.

794
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,800
You probably did little of that.

795
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,956
You people are so
sensitive to your own pain,

796
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:31,036
but as for the pain of others,

797
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,960
you have no feeling at all.

798
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,960
But other people hurt just like you do.

799
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,916
The elderly cleaning lady,
the couple at the orchard,

800
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,920
the housekeeper, Mi-ran, and Seong-gyu.

801
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,040
And Rania.

802
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,920
And those people

803
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,196
want to become happy, just like you do.

804
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,916
Everyone wants to be happy.

805
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,276
Each in their own position.

806
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,956
Just like you people killed Eom Hye-rin

807
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,396
for the sake of your position,

808
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,360
you can kill other people easily as well.

809
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,040
And therefore,

810
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,600
I can't become your friend.

811
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,196
Oh, and also,

812
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,956
what you need now is not a friend.

813
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,996
You need someone to worship
you like Secretary Kim does,

814
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,720
or someone you yourself can worship.

815
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,640
Like Jang Se-jun when you were young.

816
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,876
And I'm sorry,

817
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,520
but neither of those things will suit me.

818
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,040
So have you made your decision?

819
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,640
I'll be waiting.

820
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,440
There's no time. Hurry.

821
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,956
Oh, dear.

822
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,356
I dropped this.

823
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,240
You two, clean this up.

824
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,236
I'll watch the monitor, so clean this up.

825
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,560
Seriously. Right, right.

826
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,316
I don't usually mess up like this.

827
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,396
-I'll get a mop.
-Okay.

828
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,316
Put this back up, okay?

829
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,200
-Get it organized.
-Okay.

830
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,040
Confirm.

831
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,520
What's going on?

832
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,120
Good job. Nice. That's right!

833
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,920
Let's go.

834
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,840
Hey! Lots of pals here, huh?

835
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,880
You're working hard.

836
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,760
Good job.

837
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,240
I don't

838
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,600
want you to worship me.

839
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,480
I just...

840
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,360
-I just...-You just wanted to own me.

841
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,360
Like one more slave.
