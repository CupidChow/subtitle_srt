1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,040
(The K2)

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,880
(Ji Chang-wook)

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,120
(Song Yoon-a)

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,080
(Im Yoon-a)

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,520
(Cho Seong-ha)

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,560
(The K2)

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,996
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,836
At the right time,

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,516
JSS will become a gun for you.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,076
You'll become the bullet.

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,440
And I'll pull the trigger.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,636
I will now introduce the new
VIP team member. Kim Je-ha.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,960
His pager code is K2.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,916
What's she looking for?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,516
(Je-ha feels sympathy when he sees Anna)

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,760
Ah, ramen.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,716
You ride another car.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,996
There are lots of cameras,

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,280
so wave before you go.

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,120
But that kid read me.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,120
He read my mind.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,076
That kid...

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,720
He didn't need my orders or my permission.

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,316
He wasn't a hunting dog.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,476
He was a wolf.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
I won't be able to tame him.

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,560
Dad.

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,076
It seems I've lost my way.

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,920
Come and get me.

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,836
Really? My dad sent this?

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,956
I think she realized

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,756
that her very existence
was a nuisance to you.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,916
So she ate the strawberries
to get rid of herself.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,116
(Je-ha saves her from death's doorstep)

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,356
Anna, no.

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
Don't die. Please don't die.

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,400
Your dad is not going
to appear in front of you.

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,396
You must have lived

39
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,636
thinking that your dad
was everything you had left,

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,120
but you aren't everything to him.

41
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,316
Promise me.

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,436
That you'll protect Anna to the end.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,996
I promise.

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,636
Anna is a hostage.

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,316
I must attain the highest authority

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,200
if I am to save her.

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,000
I missed you, Dad.

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,636
Why did you bring my dad to me?

49
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,120
So that you wouldn't die.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,640
My father is...

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,556
You can't.

52
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,356
Anna is in your hands now.

53
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,156
I'll protect you in the future.

54
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,000
From now on, I won't let anyone touch you.

55
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,240
-Miss.
-Anna!

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,036
Please don't act like this!

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,160
Our child is unwell!

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,196
Anna!

59
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,960
Anna, are you okay?

60
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,040
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,956
(Je-ha and Anna gradually grow closer)

62
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,160
Thanks.

63
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,880
My niece!

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
Who are you?

65
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,520
Me?

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm your uncle.

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,996
As the daughter of your
husband, isn't she my niece?

68
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,400
-Isn't that right?
-You can't do this.

69
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,040
What was he thinking

70
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,440
when he pulled Anna
out of Choi Yu-jin's hands?

71
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,716
I know it's a huge secret

72
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,836
that Anna is the daughter
of my brother-in-law.

73
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,756
So if I keep Anna with me,

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,120
my sister Yu-jin can't easily
take JB Group away from me.

75
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,156
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,556
You should have told me in advance.

77
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,916
I almost had your wife killed.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,276
Big sis.

79
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,876
Don't you know my personality?

80
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,080
If you keep nagging me, I won't go back.

81
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,800
You protect Anna. At my side.

82
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,600
I'll ask this of you.

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,120
If we're together, both of us will die.

84
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,120
Je-ha...

85
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,516
If it's a completely dangerous situation...

86
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,516
(Je-ha plans to kill Park Gwan-su
for himself, Anna, and Yu-jin)

87
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,556
You can just come back.

88
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,000
Come back alive.

89
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,160
That's an order.

90
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,916
No. I can't.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,996
(But due to post-traumatic
stress disorder, Je-ha cannot kill)

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,400
He can't kill Park Gwan-su by himself.

93
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,716
(Se-jun's anger plunges him
and Anna into greater danger)

94
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
I told you not to mess with Anna.

95
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,516
That was the first time
anyone hit me in my life,

96
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,276
so I thought of having
someone cut off your hand,

97
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,956
but you'll probably need
to shake a lot of hands

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,680
during the campaign, so I've let it be.

99
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,440
Keep it well.

100
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,956
Anna.

101
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Later on, shall we go and live in Spain?

102
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,120
Let's go.

103
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,476
Come on in. You're the hero who saved JSS.

104
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,796
I'm a hero?

105
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,160
Now we must set about laying a trap.

106
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,480
-A trap?
-Yes.

107
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,280
You need to gradually

108
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,280
become closer with Park Gwan-su.

109
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,400
You should do your own work now, right?

110
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,156
Yes.

111
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,120
You must not...

112
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Let Je-ha know about this.

113
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,080
(Episode 12)

114
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,556
Welcome to the ring.

115
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,160
Thank you. Let's engage in a fine contest.

116
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,036
Who knows?

117
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,156
This game will end with one us dead,

118
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
so let's wait and see just how fine it is.

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,120
Right. Welcome.

120
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,076
Thank you.

121
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,236
I'll do my best here in the
Democratic Progressive Party.

122
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,000
Please help me out.

123
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,996
When it comes to things like this,

124
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,156
what's the point of
trying to hold it back?

125
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,996
He'll lose the election anyway.

126
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,076
What did he come
crawling into the party for?

127
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,036
A bunch of hot air...

128
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,996
Why not be original and accept it?

129
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
Don't just follow what
everyone else thinks.

130
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,956
Remember that.

131
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,960
As if...

132
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,476
Well, Lieutenant Colonel
Ju. It's been a long time.

133
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,916
Wait, that's not right. You
were promoted to colonel.

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,236
All thanks to Assemblyman Park Gwan-su.

135
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,156
That wasn't the case.

136
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,480
Assemblyman Park is
the reason I left the military.

137
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,956
Thank you.

138
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,796
Thank you for your support.

139
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,120
Congratulations.

140
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,556
Rude scumbag.

141
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,440
He certainly is enjoying this.

142
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,400
Is it over there?

143
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,800
My mom's resting place.

144
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,156
Wow, how could she
resemble her mother so closely?

145
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,956
From her proportions
to the way she walks...

146
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,280
Truly. If someone said she
was Eom Hye-rin, I'd believe it.

147
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,956
But the grave is so shabby
for the top actress of her time.

148
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,316
That's right.

149
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,956
I mean, Choi Yu-jin of JB
Group is Anna's guardian,

150
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
so why would the grave
be in a place like this?

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,200
Exactly.

152
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,276
Anna.

153
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,200
You should pay your
respects to your mother.

154
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,120
Lay down the flowers first.

155
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,240
Mom.

156
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,360
I'm sorry for only coming now.

157
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,120
I wanted to come sooner,

158
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,440
but I couldn't.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,480
Mom.

160
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,956
Dad isn't coming.

161
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,120
So don't wait up for him.

162
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,960
And so...

163
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,956
Without any pills,

164
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,596
just sleep well.

165
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,116
Okay?

166
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,160
What's this about?

167
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,960
Anna.

168
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,920
Your mom has already
met your dad in heaven.

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,760
Mom. Mom...

170
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,796
Hi, Ji-hyeon.

171
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,836
(Tipoff: Jang Du-su,
serving time at Suan Prison)

172
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,187
(Special news on Eom Hye-rin's murder)

173
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,956
Out of all the tips that came
in regarding Eom Hye-rin,

174
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,800
this one seems to have some substance.

175
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,680
Is that so?

176
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,836
Really?

177
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,440
Where is that?

178
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Thank you.

179
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,636
So you made Park Gwan-su
think his home would be invaded,

180
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,036
when you were all actually
lying in wait at his hideout?

181
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,596
-Yes.
-My word...

182
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,720
I didn't even know.

183
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,796
Hold on.

184
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,716
The guys all knew about it,

185
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,316
and I was the only one in the dark?

186
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,080
Well, they must have been
key to the security strategy.

187
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,596
Right, I guess it would be pointless

188
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,596
to tell important details
to an old guy like me.

189
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,840
Why talk like that?

190
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,316
Master Song, there's
something I'm curious about.

191
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,080
What?

192
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,276
You know Chairman Choi Seong-won.

193
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,796
How did he win the competition
to become successor of JB Group?

194
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,236
Choi Yu-jin must have
been a tough opponent.

195
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,876
She was no pushover.

196
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,516
Originally, the presidents
of the subsidiary companies

197
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,916
sided more with Yu-jin
than with Seong-won.

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,076
Yu-jin, I mean Ms. Choi,

199
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,396
was a smart cookie
ever since she was young.

200
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
She studied very hard in school.

201
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,996
But she was clueless about
men. It makes sense, right?

202
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,436
From a young age, she only
ever studied management.

203
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,556
So when a smooth operator
like Jang Se-jun showed up,

204
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,236
wouldn't she fall for his moves?

205
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,236
So she married him
despite family opposition,

206
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,996
and the late chairman got angry...

207
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,116
Yes, you could sum it up that way,

208
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,716
but at the time, following
the financial crisis,

209
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,516
JB Group had some trouble
after poor restructuring.

210
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,356
Hoping to make an alliance
for a financial breakthrough,

211
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,996
the late chairman lined up

212
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,996
a bunch of wealthy suitors
from big conglomerates.

213
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,836
But Yu-jin would have none of it.

214
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,876
So while she opposed it,

215
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,716
Choi Seong-won went along
with his father's choice of bride,

216
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,396
and that's what happened.

217
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,436
So the fact that Chairman
Choi became the chairman

218
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,036
is largely thanks to whom he married.

219
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,956
That's why he practically bows
and scrapes to his father-in-law.

220
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,476
Then Chairman Choi must be
less aggressive than his sister.

221
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,516
What? Yes, that's the case,
but people don't know a thing.

222
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,036
Seong-won is more hardcore than Yu-jin.

223
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,396
Ever since he was young,
he was very cunning,

224
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,036
and no one could ever
tell what he was thinking.

225
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,476
But...

226
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,876
How do you know all this?

227
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,236
You didn't know I'm the most
senior member of JSS, huh?

228
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,076
I started out in security at JB Group.

229
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,956
And JB Group security
was what gave birth to JSS.

230
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,876
So why shouldn't I know every last detail

231
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,440
about this household?

232
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,640
Visitation hours are over.

233
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,760
Don't worry too much. I'm here for you.

234
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,560
(Special Visitor Room)

235
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,956
Don't be nervous, okay?

236
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,200
Right.

237
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,800
Do you have any cigarettes?

238
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,680
Come on now.

239
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,916
Give the man a break.

240
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,440
Isn't this kind of thing
fitting for such a special visit?

241
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,916
Okay.

242
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,160
Let's briefly discuss business first.

243
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,600
You're being too stingy
for someone who has a lot.

244
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,120
That's why I have a lot, right?

245
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,640
Miss.

246
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,640
Don't you remember me?

247
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,520
We met each other that night.

248
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,120
In your mom's room.

249
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,996
Ah!

250
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,280
Since I shined a light at
you, you don't remember?

251
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,680
Mom.

252
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,480
Do you remember now?

253
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,040
I major in burglary.

254
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,276
The house that night
looked fairly well-off,

255
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,480
so I went in there to do what I do best.

256
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,956
I never even dreamed that it was the home

257
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,960
of movie actress Eom Hye-rin.

258
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,236
I did my work thinking
that everyone was asleep.

259
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,996
But suddenly, I got the feeling

260
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,036
that someone had suddenly
snuck inside the house.

261
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,956
So I hid.

262
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,160
Both me and the other nighttime visitor.

263
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,240
But it wasn't a burglar.

264
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,156
That person quietly came into
the bedroom where I was hiding,

265
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,836
and the homeowner,

266
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,160
by which I mean Eom Hye-rin...

267
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,280
I don't know if it's okay for her
daughter to hear me say this.

268
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,640
You might get a shock.

269
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,000
It's okay. Go ahead.

270
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,596
All right.

271
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,640
Brace yourself.

272
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,956
That person came and
loomed over Eom Hye-rin.

273
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,560
Then the person injected
something into her neck.

274
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,240
It was true.

275
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,440
My memory was true.

276
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,720
At that moment, I knew.

277
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,640
I was seeing something that I shouldn't.

278
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,716
Did you see the face of
the person who injected her?

279
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,000
I did.

280
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,436
Do you recall it?

281
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,960
Probably...

282
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,840
Yes, I do.

283
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,156
At this point,

284
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,000
shouldn't you listen to
what my own agenda is?

285
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,836
-Attorney Kim.
-Yes?

286
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,916
What can we do for him?

287
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,676
As for pending litigation
on his three cases,

288
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,996
we can't do anything about
the one he's been sentenced for.

289
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,516
The second charge is breaking
and entering while drunk.

290
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,796
As for the third charge,

291
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,956
his sentence could be canceled

292
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,316
through settlement with the victim.

293
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,756
Then he can avoid additional punishment,

294
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,680
and his time in prison can
be reduced by four years.

295
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,356
Okay.

296
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,080
Do you remember the face of
the person who injected her?

297
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,080
Of course. I definitely remember.

298
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,916
Do you need to see a photo?

299
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,280
No.

300
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,680
It was the woman next to this young lady.

301
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,916
When you were on TV,

302
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,760
that older lady was beside you.

303
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,320
It was that woman.

304
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,800
Can you testify to that in court?

305
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,840
A reduced sentence is all good,

306
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,796
but you'd have to deal with
the people who'd go after me...

307
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,960
Sure. Will you do it, or not?

308
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,920
Sure!

309
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,596
Mi-ran.

310
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,716
Anna isn't answering her phone.

311
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,916
She must be busy at the beauty salon.

312
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,316
Then where are you right now?

313
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,236
I'm doing a design
check at the fashion show.

314
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,236
What?

315
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,236
Then who's guarding Anna?

316
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,916
Don't worry. She's at the beauty salon.

317
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,916
I talked with her on the
phone a little while ago.

318
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,516
She said she'd come with you.

319
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,076
You go and get her.

320
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,240
Got it.

321
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,036
Why not? Why can't we
accuse Choi Yu-jin right now?

322
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,876
If we report her to
the police at this time,

323
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,636
your dad will need to withdraw
from the presidential race.

324
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,000
Would you be okay with that?

325
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,520
It makes no difference to me.

326
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,396
Anna.

327
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,476
It's right for my sister to
be punished for her crime.

328
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,956
But your dad needs to become president

329
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,756
in order for you to be free.

330
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,476
So we need to make your dad into someone

331
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,756
who has nothing to do with this case.

332
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,836
After we engrave it in
the minds of the public

333
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,476
that your dad was a victim
and my sister was a perpetrator,

334
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,676
then we must reveal the
truth of her crimes to the world.

335
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,356
Do you understand what I'm saying?

336
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,076
Then good will come out of evil,

337
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,236
and your dad can get sympathy votes.

338
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,636
We need to turn the
public to our advantage.

339
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,680
It won't take long. A
few days will be enough.

340
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,756
-How do we do it?
-There are ways.

341
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,240
Just trust me.

342
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,316
Ah, and you must not
tell Je-ha about this.

343
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,916
Why not?

344
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,676
If my sister finds out about this,

345
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,316
everything will go down the drain.

346
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,796
You think Je-ha would tell Choi Yu-jin?

347
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,596
There's no way.

348
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,156
Oh, Anna, you're so naive.

349
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,316
Je-ha loves you,

350
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,040
but he can't help that he's
one of Choi Yu-jin's people.

351
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,596
Before Je-ha comes,
let's hurry to the salon.

352
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,160
Tonight, you must become an
angel and capture everyone's hearts.

353
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,916
-You're here?
-Yeah.

354
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,556
Why did you send J4 away first?

355
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,800
Huh?

356
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,356
I mean, if she stayed here,
she'd have to wait too long...

357
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,240
But still, come on.

358
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,116
Right. Don't do that again.

359
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,236
Yeah.

360
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,156
-Let's go.
-Excuse me.

361
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,596
Your relationship doesn't seem to be

362
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,040
that of an ordinary VIP and bodyguard.

363
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,280
-Yes.
-That's not...

364
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,396
He's my boyfriend.

365
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,036
Oh, I see.

366
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,596
Boyfriend, please sit down for a moment.

367
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,796
-No, I'm fine.
-What?

368
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,276
I'll make you two look good together.

369
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,676
Thank you.

370
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,236
-Have a seat here.
-That's okay.

371
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,196
And at a classy fashion show,

372
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,316
it'd be embarrassing to have
a bodyguard look so scruffy.

373
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,316
I look scruffy?

374
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,996
-No, you don't.
-Sit down. I'll spruce you up.

375
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,196
Sit down. She'll make you look nice.

376
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,596
-I look scruffy?
-No, no, you don't.

377
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,240
Sit down, okay?

378
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,040
Okay...

379
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,000
Welcome.

380
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,040
Are you okay?

381
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,956
Did you take the medication I gave you?

382
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,036
Yes, I took it.

383
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,440
Right. Good job.

384
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,876
If you need more, let me know.

385
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,076
Since I have more.

386
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,076
Okay.

387
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,680
Ah! Let's do well today. Got it?

388
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,320
Turn around.

389
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,756
-Not bad, right?
-Yeah.

390
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,796
Fold the sleeves?

391
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,000
No, don't fold them.

392
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,796
Is it okay? Shall I go like this?

393
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,436
Yeah, it's fine.

394
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,556
-Hello.
-Oh, Anna.

395
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,360
Oh, my God.

396
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,276
I didn't know I'd end up doing
the Eom Hye-rin fashion show.

397
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,756
You're standing on my own
runway before Jean-Paul Lafeit's.

398
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,196
It's an honor.

399
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,076
I'm the one who's honored.

400
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,556
But I can't let this fashion
show be ruined on my account.

401
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,436
I don't know if I'll be able
to pull off a good walk.

402
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,956
Anna, what exactly is walking?

403
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,676
It's just that. Walking.

404
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,716
All you have to do is walk.

405
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,676
That's right. My clothes will
become wings for you. Ta-da!

406
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,156
Take good care of our Anna.

407
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,356
Don't worry, Chairman.

408
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,040
Okay, let's start the rehearsal!

409
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,520
Just a moment.

410
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,756
Uncle.

411
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,476
Give me the medication.

412
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,236
Why? Are you not feeling good?

413
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,640
No, I'm just so nervous and anxious.

414
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,160
Then you should take it.

415
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,436
Again?

416
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,680
It's okay. He said it's safe.

417
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,440
Here.

418
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,800
What are you doing?

419
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,156
Just give it to me.

420
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,640
Come over here.

421
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,956
Anna.

422
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,996
If you take this again,
it'll be the third time today.

423
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,036
I looked into what this medication is,

424
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,436
and it's not good to take a lot of it.

425
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,636
You'll only become more dependent on it.

426
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,316
Just let it slide today.

427
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,396
Look. Everyone is gathered
here because of my mom.

428
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,476
There are so many people
who remember her, and...

429
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,516
I'm saying that regardless of that...

430
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,916
This is an event to commemorate my mom.

431
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,040
I really want to do well.

432
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,920
Help me, okay?

433
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,840
I need to do this so I have no regrets.

434
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,836
I want to show people
how my mom is inside me.

435
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,080
Anna.

436
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,240
Got it?

437
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,320
Give it to me.

438
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,836
Anna.

439
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,916
What's taking so long?

440
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,476
We have 20 minutes left until showtime.

441
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,476
Let's hurry over here.

442
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,156
Get Anna ready right away!

443
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,160
Quick!

444
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,236
What are you doing right now?

445
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,396
What?

446
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,080
You ask what? As if you don't know?

447
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,836
Why are you drugging Anna

448
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,680
and showing her off to the public?

449
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,356
We need to commemorate her mom.

450
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,876
Stars may receive love easily,

451
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,956
but they're also easily forgotten.

452
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,876
We need to make the public remember

453
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,956
the Eom Hye-rin they've forgotten.

454
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,236
Also...

455
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,840
We must make them curious
about why Eom Hye-rin died.

456
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,240
That's what Anna and I want.

457
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,956
Anna told me to give this to you.

458
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,076
She said she didn't think
you'd had a sip of water today.

459
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,836
Je-ha, don't worry.

460
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,640
I'll pull off a great walk.

461
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,236
Right.

462
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,876
Right. Understood.

463
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,556
Go Anna, come on out!

464
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,040
Coming out now.

465
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,640
This way.

466
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,036
-Are you all ready?
-Yes.

467
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,280
Hold on, hold on.

468
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,080
The bracelet!

469
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,316
It's a highlight.

470
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,840
Here.

471
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,760
Wow, it would've been bad to miss that.

472
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,716
It's the style that
Hye-rin liked in the past.

473
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,916
I prepared it especially
to give you today.

474
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,076
I thought it'd suit you. Let's see here.

475
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,196
Hair, earrings, bracelet, dress.

476
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,436
Even your face is just
so perfect, it's selfish.

477
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,480
Done. Okay, let's go.

478
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,960
Let's go.

479
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,956
Hello.

480
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,680
I'm Go Anna, the daughter of Eom Hye-rin.

481
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,956
Everyone, I'm appearing
before you like this

482
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,807
since I thought this would
look more familiar to you.

483
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,876
Thank you for still remembering my mother

484
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,600
and coming to attend this fashion show.

485
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,436
Even if it's late,

486
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,036
I'm very happy to be
able to do something good

487
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,920
in my mother's name.

488
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,836
I think that today,

489
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,080
my mother is here with us.

490
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,000
Thank you.

491
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,160
Mom.

492
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,400
There are still so many
people who remember you.

493
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,756
I'll be sure to reveal the
injustice you suffered.

494
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,520
Just wait a little longer.

495
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,000
Good job.

496
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,036
I was so nervous.

497
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,196
Are you okay?

498
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,440
Yeah.

499
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,356
Good job.

500
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,316
Anna, you need to get changed quickly.

501
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,560
Right.

502
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,840
Models heading out now.

503
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,396
Say...

504
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,280
Give me that medication.

505
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,040
Thank you.

506
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,036
Miss.

507
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,720
Are you okay?

508
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,600
(Late Eom Hye-rin Fashion
Show: Daughter Go Anna Modeling)

509
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,520
What is it?

510
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,640
Something popped up on the Internet.

511
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,400
It was hard to bring myself to tell you...

512
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,036
Since when has it been hard
for us to discuss anything?

513
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,280
Read it.

514
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,560
Right away.

515
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,956
The Angel of Barcelona Go Anna
was born of an extramarital affair

516
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,560
between Choi Yu-jin and
film director Go Jun-ho.

517
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,800
So Anna was my daughter?

518
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,156
Keep going.

519
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,996
Eom Hye-rin married the
director without knowing this

520
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,876
and raised Anna.

521
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,996
When Eom Hye-rin later found out

522
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,236
that Anna's mother was Choi Yu-jin,

523
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,916
she returned to Korea to
blackmail Choi for money.

524
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,156
Choi Yu-jin had difficulty
withstanding the threats

525
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,640
that Eom Hye-rin would reveal everything,

526
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,836
so in the end, Choi murdered Eom Hye-rin.

527
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,240
After this, Jang Se-jun and Choi Yu-jin...

528
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,680
Keep going.

529
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,476
Ended up as a couple who
stayed married for show.

530
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,356
Choi Yu-jin's daughter Go Anna

531
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,676
has since been entrusted to
Chairman Choi of JB Group.

532
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,676
That's all.

533
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,240
It's so vulgar, I can hardly listen to it.

534
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,840
The article lets Jang
Se-jun off the hook entirely...

535
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,116
How about canceling

536
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,360
your volunteer event today?

537
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,076
No.

538
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,880
There's no need.

539
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,420
Doing things like that will
make it look more ridiculous.

540
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,800
Uncle.

541
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,796
Were you really the one
who put this article out there?

542
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,476
Yeah.

543
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,916
I mean...

544
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,196
How can you invent such an absurd story?

545
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,120
How can you make my mom
look like such a bad person?

546
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,076
Of course it has to be absurd.

547
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,476
If it made sense, there'd be big trouble.

548
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,236
-What?
-Someone needs to blame your mom

549
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,916
using an absurd story

550
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,356
so that people will denounce that person.

551
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,636
But you're the one
who spread this article.

552
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,520
People should denounce
Choi Yu-jin, not you.

553
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,996
Oh, you're such a naive little angel.

554
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,036
We need to do this

555
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,236
so that the police will request
testimony from my sister.

556
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,956
In the process of that investigation,

557
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,356
an investigation will be launched
regarding suspicion of murder.

558
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,356
And that's when we'll
finally play our trump card.

559
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,880
Got it?

560
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,636
You don't know what I mean, do you?

561
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,000
It's okay. I'll take care of everything.

562
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,476
And do you really think

563
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,236
I would taint your mom's name
with this nonsensical story?

564
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Once the investigation starts,
everything will be revealed.

565
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,120
And Choi Yu-jin will be caught.

566
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,600
You haven't told Je-ha, right?

567
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,756
I haven't.

568
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,236
Right. Good job.

569
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,160
We must go to the police station,
so get ready and come down.

570
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,356
Since the response to
the rumor is explosive,

571
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,680
it's circulating fast, huh?

572
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,996
There are claims that Go Anna

573
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,276
was a product of Choi
Yu-jin's extramarital affair.

574
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,796
But the truth is,

575
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,276
Go Anna was born

576
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,596
before Choi Yu-jin was married

577
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,036
to Assemblyman Jang Se-jun.

578
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,436
Who has an extramarital affair
before they're even married?

579
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,320
Does that even count
as an extramarital affair?

580
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,276
Yes, that's right.

581
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,276
An extramarital affair occurs
once someone is already married.

582
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,716
If we keep nitpicking at this,

583
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,756
all it will accomplish
is smearing the images

584
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,516
of Choi Yu-jin and
Assemblyman Jang Se-jun,

585
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,840
so I'd like this to stop. However!

586
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,796
As to whether Go Anna

587
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,036
is blood-related to Choi Yu-jin,

588
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,316
don't we have great technology nowadays?

589
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,356
Can't they just run a DNA
test to determine maternity?

590
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,996
That's right. Yes.

591
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:39,636
And as for the claims that
Eom Hye-rin blackmailed Choi,

592
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,436
which provoked Choi Yu-jin to murder her...

593
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,436
As for this...

594
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,956
This makes zero sense.

595
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,756
In the end, haven't all these speculations

596
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,916
arisen due to the mystery
surrounding Eom Hye-rin's death?

597
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,036
But Assemblyman,
wasn't Eom Hye-rin's death

598
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,676
legally determined to be an
open-and-shut case of suicide?

599
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,476
Hearing what Go Anna said
when she appeared on TV,

600
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,756
I understand where she's coming from.

601
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,756
Wouldn't anyone have doubts

602
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,996
about their mother's suspicious death?

603
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,156
So taking this opportunity,

604
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,436
I think that Choi Yu-jin

605
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,996
should go to the police and
clearly explain the situation,

606
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,596
and the police should
launch a reinvestigation

607
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,476
to explore Eom Hye-rin's
death mystery in full detail.

608
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,116
Ah, a reinvestigation?

609
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,796
But for that to happen, shouldn't there be

610
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,196
an appeal from a victim, or
some clear new evidence?

611
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,916
Exactly.

612
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,716
What I'm saying is that
this is my personal opinion.

613
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,556
If not, then not.

614
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,196
Is that fellow really on our side?

615
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,040
I don't think he is anymore.

616
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,956
They're coming in!

617
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,356
Please reveal if this rumor is true!

618
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,240
What are your thoughts on this rumor?

619
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Please comment, Chairman.

620
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,516
I've never seen such a
filthy article in my whole life.

621
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,556
Aside from tarnishing
the honor of the deceased,

622
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,276
that person produced a terribly
vulgar story about our family,

623
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,080
and I will find them and
bring them to a court of law.

624
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,356
Are the tabloids lying?

625
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,996
Ms. Anna, how are you feeling right now?

626
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,400
Hey, I'm good at acting, right?

627
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,120
Oh, Chairman.

628
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,040
-Welcome.
-Hello, Commissioner.

629
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,240
-Let's go.
-Right.

630
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,916
I received a report as well.

631
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,956
You must be very distressed.

632
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,476
Distressed?

633
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,400
It'll be dealt with if
we catch the culprit.

634
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,956
This is my official complaint.

635
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,436
My goodness.

636
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,956
Why did you bring it here yourself?

637
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,516
I wondered if I should
send it to my lawyer,

638
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,316
but I wanted to get some
photos taken by reporters

639
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,876
and say a word in front of a
government building, so I came.

640
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,440
What?

641
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,036
I'm counting on you in this investigation.

642
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,476
Of course.

643
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,756
Guys who spread rumors like this...

644
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,960
The rumor is an issue, but...

645
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,076
-About Anna's mom's case.
-Yes?

646
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,916
The starting point here is that
the deceased was defamed,

647
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,600
but if you find testifiers
who have some connection,

648
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,916
couldn't it yield some unexpected results?

649
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,120
When you say testifiers...

650
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,680
(Sharing Love, Sharing Food)

651
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,320
Ma'am, I'll help you. You take a break.

652
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,956
You don't need to help to this extent.

653
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,956
-Thank you very much.
-It's nothing.

654
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,636
You're always doing such
good work like this, Father.

655
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,920
I'm more thankful.

656
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,436
Shall we put out more chairs?

657
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,836
What did you say?

658
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,516
-Is that true?
-Yes.

659
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,036
It's clear that Chairman
Choi is targeting Choi Yu-jin.

660
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,036
It seemed like he'd already
lined up people to testify.

661
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,916
Wow.

662
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,676
These kids really get

663
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,356
down and dirty with their
family fights. My word.

664
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,756
What should I do?

665
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,956
Look, Commissioner. Why do you ask?

666
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,876
Of course you should investigate.

667
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,196
Don't the deceased deserve
to have their honor upheld?

668
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,120
You need to resolve the injustice here.

669
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,440
Right, right.

670
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,036
Injustice?

671
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,396
What are you referring to?

672
00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:00,480
Even if we do nothing, things
will crumble on their own.

673
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,236
Give a call to the
prosecutors' office, okay?

674
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,716
I'll do that.

675
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,240
I feel very good about this. Very good.

676
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,076
Inspector.

677
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,036
What's happening with the
charges related to Go Anna?

678
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,756
What do you mean?

679
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,756
An accusation was made,

680
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,036
so won't the police obviously
need to do an investigation?

681
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,636
A vicious and groundless Internet rumor

682
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,236
calls for a serious investigation.

683
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,676
No, I don't mean that. The
people who were mentioned.

684
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,796
I'm talking about Choi Yu-jin
and Assemblyman Jang Se-jun.

685
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,396
We'll only know once the police
conduct an initial investigation,

686
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,276
Assemblyman Jang Se-jun
will probably suffer disgrace,

687
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,316
-but I doubt that involves us.
-You doubt it?

688
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,756
Shouldn't Choi Yu-jin

689
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,356
be investigated as
someone who can testify?

690
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,076
Since she's also a victim of that rumor.

691
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,480
Really?

692
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,476
-And so?
-What do you mean, "and so"?

693
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,956
If suspicions arise that match.

694
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,196
Go Anna's level of suspicion
regarding her mother's death

695
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,556
as we investigate the people who testify...

696
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,476
You're saying you'd reinvestigate
the death of Eom Hye-rin?

697
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,480
Isn't that a given?

698
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,636
You mean it, right? This is an exclusive.

699
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,080
Please wait just one hour
until I can upload an article.

700
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,960
I'll wait half an hour.

701
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,960
(Late movie star Eom Hye-rin's
death suspected to be murder)

investigation after 14 years.

703
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,000
-If it's not enough, have more.
-Yes, I'll enjoy this.

704
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,396
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

705
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,596
Please eat up.

706
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,316
Enjoy this. If it's not
enough, you can have more.

707
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,080
Hello.

708
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,276
-Please eat up.
-What's going on?

709
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,876
Just a moment!

710
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,000
Father, just a moment!

711
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,600
She's coming!

712
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,116
Ms. Choi, did you know the
police and prosecutors' office

713
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,076
said they're reinvestigating
the death of Eom Hye-rin?

714
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,636
Is the rumor true that
you witnessed her murder?

715
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,636
You may be investigated,

716
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,916
not as a testifier, but as a victim.

717
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,196
Tell us how you feel.

718
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,316
Please leave.

719
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,240
We'll do an interview later. I apologize.

720
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,436
-Ms. Choi!
-Ms. Choi!

721
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,556
Ms. Choi, get a grip!

722
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,196
-Ms. Choi!
-Ms. Choi!

723
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,596
Call emergency services right away.

724
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,676
-Yes, I will.
-Ma'am!

725
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,000
Ma'am!

726
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,956
What is the health status of the patient?

727
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:01,956
Please say a word.

728
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,560
Why did she suddenly collapse?

729
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,840
Please comment.

730
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,836
Choi Yu-jin, wife of presidential
hopeful Assemblyman Jang Se-jun,

731
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,076
passed out at a charity event today

732
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,716
and was taken to the emergency room.

733
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,436
It is known that she was suffering

734
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,716
on account of a vicious rumor
circulating from a recent article.

735
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,956
My sister must have been in a big hurry.

736
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,356
With that temper, she decided
to go hide in the hospital.

737
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,320
(Choi Yu-jin hospitalized
in wake of vicious rumor)

738
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,956
So Ms. Choi really did collapse?

739
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,596
It wasn't for show?

740
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,516
Yes, that's what it looks like.

741
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,920
Come on. No way...

742
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,716
Even if she got hit by a bullet,

743
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,876
she would be sure to
collapse well out of sight.

744
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,036
She's just putting on a show.

745
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,716
I truly wish that was the case.

746
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,156
Come on. Don't worry.

747
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,156
It's all a strategy, without a doubt.

748
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,440
Seriously...

749
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,316
The idea that Choi
Yu-jin gave birth to Anna

750
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,236
is clearly absurd to everyone.

751
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,636
But for her not to know that
Lafeit and Eom were close,

752
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,356
and then pretend to know later...

753
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,276
Eom Hye-rin's death seems
suspicious to everyone,

754
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,556
so it's weird that Choi
Yu-jin claims to know nothing.

755
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,996
And there's the rumor
that there was a witness

756
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,156
at the time that Eom
was allegedly murdered.

757
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,916
If you're a reporter, write
things based on facts.

758
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,440
Oh, give me a break.

759
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,036
The hearts of the public are so filthy.

760
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,556
Up until yesterday,
everyone sang her praises,

761
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,396
but now there are all kinds of
negative comments about her.

762
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,996
About who? Choi Yu-jin?

763
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,836
Who else would it be?

764
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,836
-What about Jang Se-jun?
-He's mostly getting support.

765
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,956
-Really?
-Doesn't that make sense?

766
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,636
If he really married a wife
who had another man's child...

767
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,156
Right. If things keep
going in this direction,

768
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,276
our Angel of Barcelona
will become a laughingstock.

769
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,040
Yikes...

770
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,236
Well...

771
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,760
She's being stubborn
and refusing to come out.

772
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,676
Okay.

773
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,920
Then I should go to her.

774
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,920
He never showed up back
when she was waiting for him.

775
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,520
Anna.

776
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,840
Anna?

777
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,680
Please open the door.

778
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,596
Anna.

779
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,956
Let's talk face-to-face.

780
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,240
I have something to say to you.

781
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,240
I have nothing to say, so please leave.

782
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,440
I think you should quickly
go to see Chairman Choi.

783
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,560
Then Anna...

784
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,760
I'll leave for today.

785
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,680
Let's see each other next time.

786
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,276
(VIP Patient Room)

787
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,276
Master Song.

788
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,876
Hey! Is Ms. Choi in there?

789
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,836
Yes, she is, but what brings you here?

790
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,516
What do you mean?

791
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,720
She's unwell, so I'm here to visit.

792
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,756
Just head back.

793
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,356
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Master Song, just go.

794
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,316
You guys, move aside.

795
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,596
No, the thing is, she's not feeling well.

796
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,356
Move aside so I can go in.

797
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,036
-Just go back.
-Come on, you punks!

798
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,956
-Please just go.
-Move, move.

799
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,516
-Hey.
-Please just go.

800
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,676
I'm telling you to move.

801
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,636
Ma'am! It's me, Master Song.

802
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,956
I'm telling you, she's not well right now.

803
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,080
-Master Song.
-What are you people doing?

804
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,836
Secretary Kim.

805
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,240
Let him come in.

806
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:22,440
-What?
-See, kids? You kids...

807
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,120
How are you feeling, ma'am?

808
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Ma'am!

809
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,880
Please have this.

810
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,036
What do you think you're doing?

811
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,636
This is the juice I always liked.

812
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,036
That's right.

813
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,156
Whenever you were sick,
you wanted to have this.

814
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,876
So this product is still around.

815
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,480
Yes.

816
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,836
It's good.

817
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,156
Right, it's good.

818
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,916
-Master Song.
-Everyone leave.

819
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,840
I have some things to discuss
with Master Song privately.

820
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,516
Now that I drink this, I
think I'm feeling better.

821
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,996
Really?

822
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,156
That's such a relief.

823
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,596
Ma'am, please shake this
off and make a full recovery.

824
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,560
Let's just talk comfortably, Song.

825
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,200
Shall we?

826
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,956
Yu-jin.

827
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,916
Yes, Song?

828
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,956
As much as possible,

829
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,680
leave Anna alone.

830
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,276
You came here to say that?

831
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,760
Yeah.

832
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,396
When you're hunting animals,

833
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,556
even if you kill the mother,

834
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,040
you're supposed to let the offspring live.

835
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,400
Song.

836
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,240
This is uncomfortable for me to listen to.

837
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,596
Yu-jin.

838
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,076
Had your father been alive right now,

839
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,000
I don't think he would've
approved of this.

840
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,760
Song.

841
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,760
If you really act this way to the end,

842
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,280
I'll have no choice but
to be a whistleblower.

843
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,640
Show Master Song out.

844
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,760
Oh, you're here. Please sit down.

845
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,036
Someone else's house is on fire right now,

846
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,680
but this place seems
like a house of feasting.

847
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,956
We are having a feast.

848
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,236
But you don't seem to
know who that feast is for.

849
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,600
Who else would it be?
The dear son-in-law Jang.

850
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,036
Were you worried on account
of your wife, Assemblyman Jang?

851
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,160
Didn't you feel anything when
you saw that Internet article?

852
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,996
-What?
-You got off the hook.

853
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,880
You're going to rise high,
exactly according to our plans.

854
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,080
Abandon Choi Yu-jin now.

855
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,280
Then everything will go well for you.

856
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,160
Are you okay?

857
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,200
I'm okay.

858
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,120
You should have agreed
to meet with your dad.

859
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,120
There's no need.

860
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,120
Anna.

861
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,756
I know you're sticking close
to Chairman Choi these days,

862
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,236
but Choi Yu-jin isn't the kind of person

863
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,836
to get blood on her own hands.

864
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,080
And had there been a
witness to your mother's death,

865
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,956
Choi wouldn't have taken
the risk of letting them live.

866
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,040
It's not like that this time.

867
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,520
But...

868
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,756
Are you on my side, or Choi Yu-jin's side?

869
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,236
What are you saying right now?

870
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,716
Of course I'm on your side.

871
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,036
Then why are you sticking
so close to Choi Yu-jin?

872
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,716
Mi-ran and Seong-gyu

873
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,116
transferred their employment to
the JB Group chairman's office.

874
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,840
But you're still working at JSS.

875
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,516
What work are you doing with Choi Yu-jin?

876
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,040
Anna.

877
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,916
The reason I'm not telling you

878
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,880
what work I'm doing with Choi Yu-jin

879
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,560
is because nothing good
will come of your knowing.

880
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,116
Because the work

881
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,600
entails killing someone.

882
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,000
Here.

883
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:10,396
Here, it's the 40-year
whiskey that I promised you.

884
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,076
Isn't this fake?

885
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,076
What? Fake?

886
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,476
Hey, I went to Scotland
and got this myself...

887
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,596
You give out fake insurance,

888
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,200
so why wouldn't you give out fake liquor?

889
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,920
Hey, that's what you were saying?

890
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,560
I'm sorry. That's why I'm buying
such expensive whiskey for you.

891
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,360
Pour me a shot.

892
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,440
Okay, cheers.

893
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,676
How is it? Is it good?

894
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,320
Well, it's just...

895
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,440
Great, right?

896
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,880
It's great.

897
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,640
Right, right.

898
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,596
Right.

899
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,556
Are you here to dig up
information on Choi Yu-jin?

900
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,796
What information? I know everything.

901
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,196
I think it'll be hard for me to
give you anything this time.

902
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,680
If it's hard, we'll take the hard route.

903
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,956
Ah! Still, in the end,

904
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,996
Assemblyman Jang was
brought into the party, right?

905
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,996
And even if Choi Yu-jin is
in a bit of trouble right now,

906
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,160
Assemblyman Jang will
save her, so don't worry.

907
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:47,076
So are you here to win me over?

908
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,116
Win you over? Come on!

909
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,796
That's not it, pal.

910
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,360
You need to stick close to
Assemblyman Park Gwan-su.

911
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,236
-What?
-That way, in an emergency,

912
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,996
you can get insurance
from Assemblyman Park.

913
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,356
So in times of emergency,

914
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,396
I can also get help from Assemblyman Jang?

915
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,320
Of course.

916
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,916
You already have insurance from me.

917
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,356
You have no need to worry.

918
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,116
How great is this?

919
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,076
As a junior and senior colleague,

920
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,956
we have solid insurance on both sides.

921
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,116
Whoever becomes president,
we'll be able to survive.

922
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,036
That's right.

923
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:31,036
Okay now. Let's drink up.

924
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,040
Yes, sir.

925
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,836
As for me,

926
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,596
even if you say you killed Anna's mother,

927
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,640
I won't be surprised.

928
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,600
It's not like you've only killed
one or two people before.

929
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,840
So I'd like you to tell me.

930
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,680
Why?

931
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,960
Why do you want to know that?

932
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,760
Because of Anna.

933
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,480
Anna is truly convinced
that you killed her mother.

934
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,316
And I don't know whether

935
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,240
I should stop her or not.

936
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,160
Just leave her be.

937
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,400
So she can do whatever she wants.

938
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,120
Fine.

939
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,836
Then out of pure curiosity,

940
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,640
let me ask you just one thing.

941
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,480
Was Eom Hye-rin

942
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,560
killed by you?

943
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,520
Fine.

944
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,320
I'll tell you and only you.

945
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:25,996
I didn't kill Eom Hye-rin.

946
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:31,480
Of course, I didn't order
her to be killed, either.

947
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,396
But then why...

948
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,516
Why do you still allow
Assemblyman Jang and Anna

949
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,080
to believe that you killed her?

950
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,196
Because that way,

951
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,076
Jang Se-jun will believe

952
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,120
that I really might kill Anna.

953
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,440
Because that way...

954
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,876
On that day,

955
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,316
and afterwards as well,

956
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:05,800
Jang Se-jun was unable to leave me.

957
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:15,640
And because I know
who the real culprit is.

958
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:23,080
But I can't say that name.

959
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,156
If there's anything else
you're curious about,

960
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,440
ask the Mirror.

961
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,720
Since the Mirror knows everything.

962
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,480
I set the Mirror to respond
to your voice in the future.

963
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,120
The only voice other than my own.

964
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,800
Now I have no choice but to
make an appearance to the police.

965
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,036
And I will confidently
submit to investigation.

966
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,996
However...

967
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,040
Who knows what tricks my
enemies will play throughout this?

968
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,036
So shouldn't someone

969
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,876
be able to access the Mirror?

970
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,120
But why me, of all people?

971
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,840
You trusted me and threw
away that incriminating email.

972
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,000
The email that was
worth the price of your life.

973
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,000
The Mirror is like that to me.

974
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,680
It's my life.

975
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,840
I'll entrust it to you.

976
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,040
Did I forget to knock again? I'm sorry.

977
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,996
Huh?

978
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,760
But what's with the mood here?

979
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,360
You may leave.

980
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,080
Well, you seem to be in
better shape than I've heard.

981
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,680
Seong-won.

982
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,440
I was disappointed by your writing skills.

983
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,076
What are you talking about?

984
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,036
In years gone by, I even
won a prize for my writing.

985
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,836
Don't do things you'll regret.

986
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,680
At this rate, I might
just destroy JB Group.

987
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:07,156
Of course. You just hand JSS over to me.

988
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,636
Wait, no.

989
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,756
You keep JSS, and give me Cloud Nine.

990
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,076
That'll work.

991
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,760
Seong-won.

992
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,920
Here's what I've been
thinking about these days.

993
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,556
When our father left the position
of JB Group chairman to you,

994
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,960
why did he entrust me
with nothing but JSS?

995
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,156
Forming a marriage
alliance with Jinhan Group

996
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,920
was a necessary survival
strategy at the time,

997
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,076
but did he leave me
JSS in order to prevent.

998
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,120
Jinhan Group from taking
over JB Group in the future?

999
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,320
Your father-in-law has
his eye on JB Group.

1000
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,480
What's the reason he's so eager
to get his hands on Cloud Nine?

1001
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:53,756
Rather, our father
couldn't have imagined that.

1002
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,040
JB might absorb Jinhan in the future.

1003
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,636
Sis.

1004
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,040
Had I trusted my father-in-law,

1005
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,876
do you think JB Group
would've survived until now?

1006
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,160
With that treacherous old man?

1007
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,596
If you hadn't been holding me back

1008
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,636
with all your Cloud Nine surveillance,

1009
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,640
Jinhan might have already
been absorbed by JB Group.

1010
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,640
I see.

1011
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,200
What a relief that

1012
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:34,360
you don't take after your mother.

1013
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,676
Right, good.

1014
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,956
Pick a few JB Group subsidiaries.
I'll give them to you first.

1015
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,516
I'm moved to tears.

1016
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,636
Isn't it great being brother and sister?

1017
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,996
But...

1018
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,596
You won't be able to
take your time choosing.

1019
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,996
Pick them quickly.

1020
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,756
Who knows if you'll only
be questioned as a testifier,

1021
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,596
or if you'll end up

1022
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,840
arrested for committing
Eom Hye-rin's murder.

1023
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,596
Mirror. Do you know who I am?

1024
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,196
Yes. You are Kim Je-ha.

1025
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,520
Right.

1026
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,676
Then can you answer my questions?

1027
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:17,236
Yes, Kim Je-ha. You have access rights.

1028
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,836
Are there any limits on my access rights?

1029
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,036
There are none.

1030
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,916
Then can I ask any type of question?

1031
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,916
Of course.

1032
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,476
Questions about Choi Yu-jin, too?

1033
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,320
Of course.

1034
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,716
Why are you asking to see
me first thing in the morning?

1035
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,716
Since I have to go to
the police station anyway,

1036
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,556
I thought it would look best

1037
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,640
if I went of my own volition.

1038
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,000
Well, I suppose so.

1039
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,640
I'd like it

1040
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:12,960
if you were there right next to me.

1041
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,240
Why?

1042
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,600
Do you need someone
to catch you if you fall?

1043
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,320
Shall I send my bodyguards with you?

1044
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,916
Here they come.

1045
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,040
They're here.

1046
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,276
Please make a comment.

1047
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,316
Is Anna your real daughter?

1048
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,316
Please make a comment.

1049
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,636
Is she the real daughter of Choi Yu-jin

1050
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,400
and not Eom Hye-rin?

1051
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,880
How are you feeling right now?

1052
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,196
Please comment on the rumors.

1053
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,276
Please say a word!

1054
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,200
Is Anna your real daughter?

1055
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,280
Please comment on the rumors.

1056
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,320
Reporters.

1057
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,276
(Choi Yu-jin's voluntary
visit to prosecutors' office)

1058
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,040
And...

1059
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,720
Citizens.

1060
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:33,560
I'm sorry that I couldn't
tell you the truth all this time.

1061
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,440
Everything was brought about

1062
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,040
by my shortcomings.

1063
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,040
Yes.

1064
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,400
Anna is

1065
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,120
my daughter.

1066
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,516
And Anna is

1067
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,076
like my own daughter.

1068
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,316
Is she saying she's not her real daughter?

1069
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,480
Does that mean Anna
isn't her real daughter?

1070
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,640
Anna is...

1071
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,680
My husband, Assemblyman Jang Se-jun's...

1072
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,240
Biological daughter.

revealed to be Jang Se-jun's daughter)
