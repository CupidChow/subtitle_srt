00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,040
(The K2)

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,880
(Ji Chang-wook)

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,120
(Song Yoon-a)

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,080
(Im Yoon-a)

(Cho Seong-ha)

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,560
(The K2)

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,240
This is the second
meeting I mentioned to you.

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,440
Shoot!

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,680
Shoot!

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,840
Shoot!

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,120
Help me.

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,000
Save me.

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,160
Save me.

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,680
Shoot! Shoot!

15
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,716
I'm telling you to shoot! Shoot!

16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,200
Kill her! Go ahead and kill her!

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,040
Shoot! Kill her already! Kill her!

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,800
Shoot her! Shoot! Shoot already!

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,636
Kill her! I said kill her!

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,480
Kill her! Go ahead and kill her!

21
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,840
Aside from me...

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,560
It looks like someone
else wants you dead, too.

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,280
Ma'am!

24
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,640
Drop your guns.

25
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,436
Drop your guns!

26
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
She's in danger.

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,916
All of you get out.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,120
Prepare a car outside.

29
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,480
Do as he says.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,320
Prepare Ms. Choi's car.

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,000
Did you come back to kill me?

32
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,396
But what's to be done?

33
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,236
If you kill me,

34
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,716
there's no way you
can get out of here alive.

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,396
Enough useless worries.

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,076
Shouldn't you be worried
about yourself right now?

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,396
Even now, you should throw that gun away

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,236
and beg me for your life.

39
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,200
That'll give you the best
chance of staying alive.

40
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,996
Right now my finger

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,996
is half-pulling the trigger.

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,240
Also...

43
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,320
This gun is a Walther,
so it has a light trigger.

44
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,876
Understood.

45
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,996
Turn the car around and go to the house.

46
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
Full speed. Step on it.

47
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,076
What's going on?

48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,800
Your wife was taken hostage.

49
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,640
Pull over up there.

50
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,720
What?

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,640
You have a cigarette, right?

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,080
What are you doing right now?

53
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,400
I sent an email.

54
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,076
Everything you've said,

55
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,036
and everything that's happened here,

56
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,080
was recorded and
included as an attachment.

57
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,840
The email goes to the Blue
House, press, and prosecutors' office.

58
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,076
But don't despair.

59
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,196
Since I set the email
to be automatically sent

60
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,160
24 hours from now.

61
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,680
So...

62
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,360
Don't lay a hand on me
or the people around me.

63
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,480
If you do kill me,

64
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,040
there's no one to delay
the sending of that email.

65
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,196
So all of you people

66
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,756
should just pray

67
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
that I stay alive and well.

68
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,240
As for this...

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,360
-No!
-Don't!

70
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,076
You go out now and
deal with the situation.

71
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,956
If your bodyguards do something stupid

72
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,640
and end up killing me,

73
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,320
you'll be in serious trouble.

74
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,156
Chief Ju.

75
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,276
Isn't it your duty to
protect me from danger?

76
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,556
-That's right.
-But...

77
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,360
It's dangerous to go home right now.

78
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,036
Isn't that right?

79
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,676
I'm keeping my promise to you.

80
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,996
What? Your promise?

81
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,680
Right now,

82
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,000
Anna is at the house.

83
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,760
What are you doing? Step on it!

84
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,716
(Episode 3)

85
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,960
Oh, Ms. Choi.

86
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,960
Hello.

87
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,476
Right.

88
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,036
You're working hard.

89
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,556
Oh, it's nothing.

90
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,156
Some thief stole a motorbike

91
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,440
and drove it up this peaceful alleyway...

92
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,720
Ms. Choi even acts as a driver?

93
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,120
-Quick! Quick!
-Yes, ma'am.

94
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
I underestimated you.

95
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,200
More than that, you took
too much notice of me.

96
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,036
I had no interest in
your husband's affair.

97
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,120
And I had no interest in you whatsoever.

98
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,596
Fine.

99
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,720
At any rate, I acknowledge my mistake.

100
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,076
So, shall we bargain now?

101
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,076
Bargain?

102
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,080
Name your price.

103
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,000
In exchange for that email?

104
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,040
Everything in the world has a price.

105
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,316
That's right.

106
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,076
The price of the email

107
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,076
is the same as the price of my life.

108
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,556
If I hand over the email, I'm a dead man.

109
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,076
Just try naming a price.

110
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Since I'll give you double.

111
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,880
In that case...

112
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,840
What's the price on you?

113
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,796
If I offer your husband

114
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,276
the choice of buying
either you or that email,

115
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,640
which do you think he'll choose?

116
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,076
Will he give up the
presidency and choose you?

117
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,320
Or will he sell you to
gain the presidency?

118
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,920
What? You're not sure?

119
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,080
So are you worth less than that email?

120
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,240
Your underlings don't
listen to orders very well.

121
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,360
Team Leader Kim!

122
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,876
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,716
We failed to protect your wife.

124
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,076
Dang it.

125
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,596
What about Anna?

126
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,520
She's safe.

127
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,000
Where is she?

128
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,160
Shall I call Anna for you?

129
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,120
No, that's okay.

130
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,360
I need to rest.

131
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,956
I'm tired.

132
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,360
Right.

133
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,636
Hey, would you slow down? Well?

134
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,436
I'm not stepping on the accelerator.

135
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,000
The car is acting strange.

136
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,160
The brakes aren't working!

137
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,040
It looks like it's been hacked.

138
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,640
So there was yet another
person who wanted you dead.

139
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,996
What? Who?

140
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,240
Those guys.

141
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,236
-Who are they?
-Them?

142
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,996
There's a motorcycle
tailing Ms. Choi's car.

143
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,440
A motorcycle?

144
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,080
It's no use. The glass is bulletproof.

145
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,240
Into the intersection. The intersection!

146
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,240
Here's our chance. Move
into the passenger seat, fast.

147
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,996
They're speeding up too much.

148
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,076
Something is off.

149
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,476
They've spotted us. Go after them faster.

150
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,040
We must not lose them.

151
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,596
They've switched who's driving.

152
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,476
What? Ms. Choi and her kidnapper?

153
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,916
And the motorcycle
is still following them?

154
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,160
Yes.

155
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,236
Who on earth are these guys?

156
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,916
What? Aren't they working as one team?

157
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,840
A team operation wouldn't look like this.

158
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,756
There's a big curve coming up in 5 km.

159
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,800
It's an ideal place to fake an accident.

160
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,916
What are you doing right now?

161
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,236
If we can't slow down,
we can still speed up.

162
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,596
You're crazy! Why go faster?

163
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,036
The range of their remote
control is 20 meters or less.

164
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,596
That's why they're trying
so hard to keep up with us.

165
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,916
We have to get further away

166
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,840
to escape from their
remote control's range.

167
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,516
Ms. Choi's car is speeding up even more.

168
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,716
What should I do?

169
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,080
What do you mean? Hurry after them.

170
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,960
We absolutely must not lose them.

171
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,276
They're speeding up?

172
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,760
But they're approaching a major curve.

173
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,276
Keep pressing the window button.

174
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,800
Until the window opens.

175
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,120
We can't lose them. Faster!

176
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,556
We'll lose them at this
rate. Step on it already!

177
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,880
Yes.

178
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,160
We're good.

179
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,480
Watch out.

180
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,636
Sir! A gun went off in the car.

181
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,516
What? Was Ms. Choi shot?

182
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,836
No. It was shot out the window.

183
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,200
Ms. Choi is safe.

184
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,880
Out the window. Out the window...

185
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,916
The motorcycle!

186
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,560
Take care of that motorcycle! And quickly!

187
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,956
Your people are finally using their heads.

188
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,760
Though, it's already too late.

189
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,040
Kill them.

190
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,120
What is this? What happened?

191
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,240
Fire!

192
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,120
Damnit.

193
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
Hey. Hey!

194
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,160
Secretary Kim. Secretary Kim!

195
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,520
Hey. Wake up! Hey, hey!

196
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Hey. Wake up! Hey, hey!

197
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,436
Secretary Kim! Are you all right?

198
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,080
What about Ms. Choi?

199
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
No!

200
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,036
Secretary Kim, it's already too late.

201
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,636
The car will explode.

202
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,360
That's nonsense! Rescue Ms. Choi, quick!

203
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,996
You can't! If you get close...

204
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,076
If you get close, it's dangerous.

205
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,996
Let go! Move!

206
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,716
-You can't!
-Let go of me!

207
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,040
Ma'am!

208
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,276
Ma'am...

209
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,680
Ma'am!

210
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,080
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am!

211
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,040
Ma'am!

212
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,956
He's alive. What should we do?

213
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,676
Take him to the medical room.

214
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,036
Make preparations for his interrogation.

215
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,280
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,640
Hospital...

217
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,996
Yes, ma'am?

218
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,876
-Move to a hospital.
-Yes, ma'am.

219
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,476
We'll take you to a hospital right away.

220
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,080
No.

221
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,360
Take that person to a hospital.

222
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,080
What?

223
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,640
That person must not die.

224
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,320
Right. Understood.

225
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,956
No.

226
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,520
You don't know.

227
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,800
Will the sunset in heaven
be more beautiful than this?

228
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,960
In heaven?

229
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,516
Is there such a place?

230
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,196
Heaven is a place with no war.

231
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,000
So Korea will be heaven, too.

232
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,840
To someone, it could be heaven,

233
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,080
and to someone else,
it could be the opposite.

234
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,436
Oh? And Korea has the singers, 2NE1.

235
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,356
That's why it's heaven.

236
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,120
They sing like this.

237
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,040
What? Did I mess up again?

238
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,796
No.

239
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,436
You've never even been to Korea,

240
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,396
but you speak Korean this well.

241
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,076
Rania, you must be practically a genius.

242
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,036
Even when studying Korean,

243
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,080
I'm the best.

244
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,000
You're good.

245
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,520
Rania.

246
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,480
The things are...To tell the truth...

247
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,520
I think I have to go back to Korea.

248
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It turns out I won't be
able to work here anymore.

249
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
I know.

250
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
I know you can't help it.

251
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,636
Then someday, in Korea...

252
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,476
Will you come with me?

253
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,120
What?

254
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,520
This! This.

255
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,596
If you wed me,

256
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,440
you can get a passport.

257
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,040
Wed?

258
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,680
So what I mean is...The thing is...

259
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,400
Marriage.

260
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,956
It's too hard to find a ring
in this area, so for now...

261
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,240
Just this.

262
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,636
I mean, don't misunderstand.
We'd be married on paper.

263
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,080
It's because I want to
get you out of here, Rania.

264
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,316
Why...

265
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,316
Why are you crying all of a sudden? Hey!

266
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,796
Hey, I just thought you...

267
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,236
So you could come with me to Korea,

268
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,876
and if you really don't
like living that way,

269
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,916
you can go somewhere else you want.

270
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,280
Yes! Let's get married.

271
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,680
Don't think of anything stupid.

272
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,720
I said don't.

273
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,436
Hey!

274
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,956
We really are the police.

275
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,760
I know.

276
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,040
I'm going crazy here.

277
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,916
It's chaos outside. People
say it was a terror attack.

278
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,196
And the person in here is a victim.

279
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,916
He's the most important witness.

280
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,360
You're obstructing me
from executing my duty.

281
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,680
I don't know about any of that.

282
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,956
The person in there needs absolute rest.

283
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,676
That's what the doctor said.

284
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,276
If you still want to go in,

285
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,396
you'll need a warrant.

286
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,076
Got it?

287
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,236
I'm going nuts.

288
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,080
Who are you people?

289
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,916
Tell the head of security
to come here now.

290
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,996
If you want to meet him, then go ahead.

291
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,036
He has nothing to do with us.

292
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,156
Seriously now...

293
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,156
Since when was Korea such a dirty place

294
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,560
that a detective can't even do his job?

295
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,400
Hey.

296
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,000
Hey!

297
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,476
Let's go. Come along.

298
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,840
What?

299
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,596
Detective. Detective.

300
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,916
How can you just leave?

301
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,436
What? Those guys were right.

302
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,676
-They said to follow the law.
-But still...

303
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,320
Who on earth are those guys?

304
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,436
JSS Security.

305
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,756
Security...Are they a guard company?

306
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,800
Or there are the contractors we supervise.

307
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,276
These guys are so arrogant...

308
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,236
Hey, hey. Come here, punk.

309
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,520
Come here already, punk.

310
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,036
Hey.

311
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,076
The CEO of JSS is a former police chief,

312
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,596
and the Prosecutor General
used to be his adviser.

313
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,756
-Prosecutor General...-
You don't even know.

314
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,876
These guys aren't your typical bodyguards

315
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,316
who follow pop stars around.

316
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,716
You don't have a clue.

317
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,200
Where are we supposed to go?

318
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,360
Detective.

319
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,156
In this footage, we can see.

320
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,796
Choi Yu-jin, wife of
Assemblyman Jang Se-jun,

321
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,756
arriving at the hospital by ambulance.

322
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,316
Assemblyman Kim, how do
you see the current situation?

323
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,876
As for this, it's very obvious.

324
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,916
It's a clear case of terrorism.

325
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,476
Here in one of the OECD
nations, here in Korea,

326
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,396
how could this utterly pathetic, barbaric,

327
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,480
uncivilized act of political terror occur?

328
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,116
I can't stop lamenting this.

329
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,596
But at this point, isn't it difficult

330
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,956
to clearly define this
as political terrorism?

331
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,876
Considering the scale,

332
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,796
don't we have clear evidence?

333
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,916
Think about this.

334
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,996
To fake an accident

335
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,916
by hacking a car...

336
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,036
The use of such cutting-edge technology

337
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,236
stands on its own as proof
that terrorists were mobilized.

338
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,716
This far exceeds the threshold

339
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,436
of a crime that can be
committed by an individual.

340
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,596
Yes. What I'm saying is...

341
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,036
That is true.

342
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,836
But at any rate,

343
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,836
won't they need to finish
investigating the dead suspects

344
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,276
before they can find the precise motive?

345
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,036
Yes, of course. However...

346
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,916
As for individuals or groups

347
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,836
who will benefit from these crimes,

348
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,756
shouldn't they all be seen

349
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,116
as the primary suspects?

350
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,916
Assemblyman Kim, the times we live in...

351
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,036
In these times,

352
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,156
what you're saying could be construed

353
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,036
as very dangerous remarks.

354
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,956
Well, the thing is,

355
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,036
what I'm saying could
in fact sound like that.

356
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,316
Did I ever say the crime was committed

357
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,280
by a candidate opposing Assemblyman Jang?

358
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,956
And any individuals or groups
who may gain something

359
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
from this crime...

360
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,716
Hey, this fellow is quite a hoot.

361
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,040
He's openly painting Park
Gwan-su as the culprit.

362
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,876
Secretary Kim, did
you give him guidelines?

363
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,516
No, I did not.

364
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,836
He's saying those
things of his own accord.

365
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,116
When the broadcast ends,
call him and praise him.

366
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,236
Tell him to come over once I'm discharged.

367
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,076
There's no need for you to go that far.

368
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,876
For people we manage at that level,

369
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,320
it's normal for them to handle that much.

370
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,960
Assemblyman.

371
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,560
Ma'am.

372
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,040
Did you sleep well?

373
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,396
Yes, thanks to you. Thank you.

374
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,796
Oh, no need for thanks.

375
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,996
The fact that you chose our hospital

376
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,276
is a great honor.

377
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,680
I'll come running whenever you call.

378
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,636
By the way,

379
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,956
how is the fellow who was
admitted along with me?

380
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,560
Ah, that bodyguard?

381
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,996
Ah, a bodyguard?

382
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,716
His left thumb was
fractured and is in a cast.

383
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,036
He needed stitches in a few places,

384
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,636
but the CT scan showed no issues.

385
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,476
It seems he's always
had a strong constitution,

386
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,000
so I doubt there will
be any major problems.

387
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,916
I see. That's a relief.

388
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,836
That bodyguard seems very well-trained.

389
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,356
If you had been exposed
to those shocks yourself,

390
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,520
it would have been very serious for you.

391
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,956
Can he regain consciousness

392
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,876
by this evening?

393
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,476
Of course. He'll be up very soon.

394
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,236
Well, I'll excuse myself then.

395
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,956
If you experience any
discomfort, please call me anytime.

396
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Yes.

397
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,720
That bodyguard...

398
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,676
If he wakes up and blabbers,

399
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,400
won't that be an issue?

400
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,956
I'm going to use him as a real bodyguard.

401
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,476
Do you think he'll agree?

402
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,196
Him?

403
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,200
I'm not sure. I wouldn't know that.

404
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,640
Is it that important?

405
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,316
The people I need to be most wary of

406
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,960
should be kept the closest to me.

407
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,640
Like Anna.

408
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,916
I can't

409
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,200
leave Anna at your side.

410
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,440
Hey, Sergeant Kim.

411
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,640
Have you been well?

412
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,876
Why are you so surprised?

413
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,760
Relax, friend.

414
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,036
Hey, what's all this?

415
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,276
Chief Ju!

416
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,076
It's okay.

417
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,160
This stuff is useless anyway.

418
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,440
Also, you get out.

419
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,120
What are you doing? I said get out.

420
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,160
Striking the source was a trap.

421
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,956
You were behind it, Lieutenant Colonel.

422
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,120
Hey, friend.

423
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,676
I transferred as a colonel.

424
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,000
And I was discharged as a private.

425
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,236
I'm sorry. Back then, I had no power.

426
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,200
It wasn't about power.
You had no desire to help.

427
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,560
It takes power to fulfill your desires.

428
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,636
My big sis!

429
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,756
Who did this to you?

430
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,836
Are you okay?

431
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,916
Next time you open the door to my room,

432
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,116
would you knock first?
Like a refined person?

433
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,240
Ah. Sorry.

434
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,080
Oh, it's my brother-in-law.

435
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,716
Chairman Choi, have you been well?

436
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,840
I'm always the same.

437
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,076
But Sis, are you okay?

438
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,876
Park Gwan-su did this, didn't he?

439
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,956
-I'm not sure.
-No, it was Park Gwan-su.

440
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,516
He's capable of that much and worse.

441
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,400
Nasty son of a...

442
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,720
Oh, I swore again. Like
an unrefined person.

443
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,356
Chairman Choi.

444
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,036
If you want to look
refined in front of others,

445
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,996
shouldn't you start using
respectful speech with me, too?

446
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,036
Sis, I'd really hate that.

447
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,516
It's awkward. It makes us feel distant.

448
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,356
No way!

449
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,436
But really,

450
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,280
we've never been that close.

451
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,476
Assemblyman, it's time
for the news broadcast.

452
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,996
Even the cameras have arrived.

453
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,676
Okay.

454
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,116
Then you two enjoy

455
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,476
your first brother-sister
reunion in a long while.

456
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,880
Shall I get moving now?

457
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,556
I'll wish you a good fight.

458
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
Go for it.

459
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,320
Go for it!

460
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,840
Come here for a moment.

461
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,840
Me?

462
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,716
Why?

463
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,640
A little closer.

464
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,516
If you looked after your
unwell wife all night,

465
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,480
shouldn't you look like this?

466
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,476
As expected, you're such a
good wife and wise mother.

467
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,600
Ah!

468
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,640
Since you have no children,
take out the "wise mother" part.

469
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,160
All of you stay a step behind.

470
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,076
Assemblyman! What is
your wife's current condition?

471
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,756
Who do you think was behind this?

472
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,916
Did you talk on the
phone with Park Gwan-su?

473
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,040
Oh, don't be like this.
Tell us how you're feeling.

474
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,600
Did you ask how I'm feeling?

475
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,316
To a man

476
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,956
who watched his wife all night

477
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,720
as she came back from death's doorstep...

478
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,000
You ask how I'm feeling?

479
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,876
Seeing someone

480
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,916
who knows nothing but how to serve others,

481
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,196
seeing her horror-struck and
full of painkillers and sedatives,

482
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,440
talking incomprehensibly
in her sleep all night long...

483
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,520
To the foolish husband who
could do nothing but watch...

484
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,120
You ask how I'm feeling?

485
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,127
(Presidential Candidate
Jang Se-jun's Frank Position)

486
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,956
Huh?

487
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,436
They're adding background
music on a live news program?

488
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,480
My wife is someone who
has given up everything for me.

489
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,716
Though she was the heiress
of a major conglomerate,

490
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,836
she gave up all those special privileges

491
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,840
and became the wife of a poor politician,

492
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,160
walking a path of thorns.

493
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,956
I was so foolish back when I was young.

494
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,156
When I was involved in labor
and democratization movements,

495
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,240
rolling on the cold floor
of a police holding cell...

496
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Starting back then, I
brought hardship upon her.

497
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,436
As someone who only grew twisted

498
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,240
from my rage against the world,

499
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,680
I was unable to grasp the
hand she stretched out to me.

500
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,040
Just because she came from
a conglomerate background,

501
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,716
I was unable to accept her sincerity,

502
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,640
and that was stupid of me.

503
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,920
But my wife

504
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,120
was a courageous person.

505
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,240
She threw away all she had...

506
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:30,080
And she loves me, who has nothing.

507
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,636
Wow...

508
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,076
He's doing an incredible job.

509
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,080
He's really got a feel for it.

510
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,196
Since that was the truth.

511
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,076
I was unable to protect
my one and only kind wife,

512
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,716
and it was hard for
me to live with myself.

513
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,956
So as for the powerful
position where I must share

514
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,040
in the pain and sadness
of 50 million Koreans...

515
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,120
Can I bear the weight of that position?

516
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,080
No, before that...

517
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,076
When I think of my wife

518
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,436
still sobbing in horror
in her hospital bed,

519
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,116
can I even ask her

520
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,640
to continue down this path with me?

521
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,636
As for me,

522
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,356
starting now,

523
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,760
all my campaigning as a
presidential candidate...

524
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,120
Will cease.

525
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,640
What's he saying?

526
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,160
Are you saying you'll retire
from the political realm?

527
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,636
-No!
-Right!

528
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,036
You must not retire!

529
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,000
You must not!

530
00:47:53,040 --> 00:48:00,040
Instead, I will commence a new fight now.

531
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,396
The opposing powers who
incite terror with base violence,

532
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,476
who attack the innocent wives
and daughters of this land,

533
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,716
who trample on the weak and
powerless members of society...

534
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,000
I will face and fight all
the terror in this land.

535
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,236
If someone is a politician,

536
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,756
it's more meaningful for them

537
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,316
to muster up all their strength

538
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,916
to fight against evil

539
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,920
than to become president.

540
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,796
That can be done without
becoming president.

541
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,996
That's right!

542
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,756
Jang Se-jun! Jang Se-jun!

543
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:46,320
That can be done
without being a politician.

544
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,080
That can be done by all of us.

545
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,080
And I will stand on your side, everyone.

546
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,116
In this fight alongside all of you,

547
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,040
I shall win without fail!

548
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,956
President Jang Se-jun!
President Jang Se-jun!

549
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,036
President Jang Se-jun!

550
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:23,120
President Jang Se-jun!
President Jang Se-jun!

551
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,796
Do well, Mr. President!
Do well, Mr. President!

552
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,480
He does quite well.

553
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,480
Even if his conscience is dead,

554
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,080
his feeling is alive.

555
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,956
Right. Isn't this a rather
shocking announcement?

556
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,676
Assemblyman Kim, what do you think of it?

557
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,196
It really is rather...Rather shocking.

558
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,356
To give up the presidency
for his beloved wife...

559
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,356
Wow.

560
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,996
It's somewhat ambiguous,

561
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,356
but we can take his
announcement as meaning that

562
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,356
he's dropping out of the
presidential race, right?

563
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,756
What are you talking about?

564
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,716
Isn't Assemblyman Jang Se-jun

565
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,876
making a proclamation about this society's

566
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,156
violence and corrupt powers?

567
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,156
That's right.

568
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,036
But if that kind of person

569
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,156
gave up the presidency due to violence,

570
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,236
wouldn't that mean, in the end,

571
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,476
he'd be surrendering to those powers?

572
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,880
The people who were
behind this act of terrorism...

573
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,360
I'm sorry.

574
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,036
The people who were
behind this act of terrorism

575
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,916
want exactly that.
This is what I'm saying.

576
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,276
I think such a thing must not happen.

577
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,116
Right.

578
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,756
Besides, if by some chance

579
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,076
candidate Jang Se-jun's wife

580
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,956
is watching this broadcast now,

581
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,280
I have something I must tell her.

582
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,320
What...

583
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,196
Be strong.

584
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,916
And please send candidate Jang Se-jun

585
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,200
back into the arms of the people.

586
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,080
I earnestly implore you.

587
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,800
Right. Now we'll briefly
hear from our sponsors.

588
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,640
Look, aren't you going
too far overboard with this?

589
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,716
No, no.

590
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,956
It's okay to do this much.

591
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,280
Today will be the turning
point of this election.

592
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,080
Wait and see.

593
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,996
Ah, ee, oh, ah, ee...

594
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,916
President Jang Se-jun!
President Jang Se-jun!

595
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,760
Jang Se-jun.

596
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,640
Prepare my car.

597
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,236
Where will you...

598
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,636
Goodness.

599
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,596
Someone is unwell,
so I should pay a visit.

600
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,596
What?

601
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,080
Bring my clothes.

602
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,920
Yes.

603
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,200
Jang Se-jun. Seriously now...

604
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,600
Here. A gift.

605
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,720
What is this?

606
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,876
(National Identity Card Kim Je-ha)

607
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,520
Kim Je-ha?

608
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,240
So, am I supposed to be a
pawn of JB Group or what?

609
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,400
Just think of yourself as
the vassal of an empire.

610
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,560
Don't worry. The ID card is real.

611
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,996
It's for a person who went
missing working overseas.

612
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,116
There are no issues.

613
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,120
We transferred your
fingerprints under his name.

614
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,996
But don't try to apply
for a passport with this.

615
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,120
We still haven't resolved
the overseas side of things.

616
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,000
Hey. Sis!

617
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,840
At this rate, you really will
end up in the Blue House.

618
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,076
Take good care of yourself.

619
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,320
I'll be going.

620
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,036
But...

621
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,676
These days, is JB Group
financially strapped?

622
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,916
Why is the campaign team
talking about the funds?

623
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,196
Ah, about that...

624
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,636
People are watching,

625
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,276
so how can anyone take what's yours?

626
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,956
Just wait a bit, Sis.

627
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,436
Your holdings are being kept far overseas,

628
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,080
so it takes time to access them.

629
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,036
-So that's what it is?
-Of course.

630
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,996
I thought you were

631
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,276
feeling protective of that money again.

632
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,036
Protective?

633
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,320
If you end up in the Blue House,
you'll pay me many times more.

634
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,040
You won't? Huh?

635
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,200
I'll be going.

636
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,596
-Hello, Assemblyman.
-Hello.

637
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,560
Hold on. Why the weapons?

638
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,560
What, are you going to arrest me?

639
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,476
As if that would happen.

640
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,956
Due to the recent incident,

641
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,520
we were warned to employ special security.

642
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,000
Wow. Going to such lengths.

643
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,996
Sir, will you be all right?

644
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,676
I'm sure they've been
lying in wait for this.

645
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,520
Let's not be talking about foolish things.

646
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,796
Is this camera recording?

647
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,036
No, it's not.

648
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,320
-You're sure about that, right?
-Yes.

649
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,796
There are rumors that you
were behind the terror incident.

650
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,156
Hey, how about I get terrorized, too?

651
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,556
I'd gain support in the polls,

652
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,480
and I could rest for a few
days in a place like this.

653
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,996
Do you think this incident

654
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,516
may have been planned by
Assemblyman Jang's camp...

655
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,276
There you go again.

656
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,316
Stop making things up.

657
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,280
That's a habit of yours.

658
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,916
What, am I not funny?

659
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,956
What do you plan to discuss
with Assemblyman Jang?

660
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,676
No, no, the thing is, I'm
making a hospital visit.

661
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,036
This is serious, and it's
no time for things like this.

662
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,556
Absolutely not. See you
later. Never mind, never mind.

663
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,756
More questions later.

664
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,320
Thank you.

665
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,556
You must be very upset.

666
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,680
How could something like this happen?

667
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,880
-Excuse me.
-Yes, sir.

668
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,680
A bodyguard?

669
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,956
Yeah.

670
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,716
That's the kind of work you did in Iraq.

671
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,480
It's hard to find jobs nowadays.
You'd get great benefits.

672
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,756
Experience is required,
so you'd be paid well, too.

673
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,200
I have no loyalty to anyone now.

674
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,440
Not to a country. Not to an organization.

675
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,436
Loyalty? What's all that?

676
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,356
Loyalty is for dogs.

677
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,996
Loyalty isn't my thing, either.

678
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,556
Just give them as much as you receive.

679
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,036
Then how much do you
receive for the work you do?

680
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,676
In the end, you'll just be
used and thrown under the bus.

681
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,160
You know that well.

682
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,600
We can throw them
under the bus before then.

683
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,156
Right.

684
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,000
You've changed a lot.

685
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,040
It's the world that has changed.

686
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,076
My current employer, JSS,

687
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,040
is no ordinary security company.

688
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,476
In military terms, they're a huge
data and information agency.

689
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,636
They keep track of all JB
Group's company secrets

690
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,516
and records of all their transactions.

691
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,676
Through the JB economic research center,

692
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,636
they collect and track
information on personal networks

693
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,196
of the ruling class of this nation

694
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,156
in the realms of politics,
the economy, and the media.

695
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,076
These people are not to be trifled with.

696
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,436
They're going to gain
control of the Blue House.

697
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,840
And then you can receive a total pardon.

698
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,476
Lieutenant Colonel.

699
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,800
As for me...

700
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,840
I'm just a straggler
soldier. I'm worn out.

701
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,956
And now...I'm no longer of any use.

702
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,120
Why? Because you're
unable to kill people anymore?

703
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,476
PTSD.

704
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,240
This morning, I read
Blackstone's file on you.

705
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,516
Don't worry.

706
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,320
Only I saw it, and I destroyed it.

707
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,916
I saw our strike team
members who tried to kill you

708
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,876
were left alive,

709
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,156
and I thought it was suspicious.

710
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,320
If you know this much,

711
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,440
why are you clinging to me like this?

712
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,156
Hey, friend.

713
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,640
Do you think a bodyguard is
a mercenary who kills people?

714
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,596
In war, you had animal senses

715
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,916
and were the ultimate attacker,

716
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,596
which means you can
read your enemy's attacks

717
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,280
and can be the ultimate defender.

718
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,640
And now you can't bite
the hand that feeds you.

719
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,160
You have the best qualifications
for being a bodyguard.

720
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,036
I'd like you to remember that

721
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,440
I still have the leverage of that email.

722
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,040
Sergeant Kim.

723
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,040
Come into the Blue House with me.

724
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,796
As for the scum who made us like this...

725
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,360
We can make them all kneel down before us.

726
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,560
The Blue House?

727
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,040
That scum?

728
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,400
I swore

729
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,356
to never come back to this hellish Korea,

730
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,236
and I spat on the floor
of Incheon Airport as I left,

731
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,240
and even the reason
for it is fading in my mind.

732
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,116
Making people kneel before us?

733
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,036
That's more and more bothersome.

734
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,036
It's just until the election.

735
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,436
Just stay at JSS until then.

736
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,876
Then neither of us has any reason

737
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,080
to be anxious or run away.

738
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,476
I came back because I was tired.

739
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,800
I lost interest in the
world a long time ago.

740
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,956
If you don't mess with me,

741
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,240
then no one else will get hurt.

742
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,036
After the election is
over, I'll delete that email.

743
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,520
Hey, Sergeant Kim.

744
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,000
Hey! Sergeant Kim!

745
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,756
How are you feeling?

746
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,920
Fine, thanks for your concern.

747
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,720
(Praying for your recovery
/President Kim Jeong-hun)

748
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:50,316
The head of the State
Affairs Committee visited.

749
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,636
The head of the committee?

750
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,676
The chief presidential secretary
should've come in person.

751
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,676
Oh dear. These people.

752
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,636
No, they're too busy with national affairs

753
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,756
to be making hospital visits...

754
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,236
Hardly.

755
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,716
I'm sure they ate your bean
paste stew as dinner guests before.

756
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,956
So their behavior now
is really ill-mannered.

757
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,116
A man of integrity like
the presidential secretary

758
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,436
would never have come to our humble abode.

759
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,756
-Is that so?
-That's right.

760
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,956
Ah, but speaking of which,

761
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:24,236
you ate lots of bean paste
stew at our house, didn't you?

762
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,680
Back when my father was alive.

763
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,876
And these days,

764
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,796
we don't usually serve bean paste stew.

765
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,720
Since it has a strong odor.

766
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,360
It was very delicious. Very delicious.

767
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,396
Looking back, your father
was a very insightful person.

768
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,596
He even had the forethought

769
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:54,120
to appoint your younger
brother CEO rather than you.

770
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,836
At any rate, I'll hope for
your speedy recovery.

771
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,076
I'm rather busy, so excuse me.

772
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,156
I'm sorry. I'm physically
unable to see you out.

773
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,960
No, no. There's no need at all.

774
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,360
What a daring hussy.

775
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,640
A daring hussy.

776
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,680
(The K2)

777
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,280
This is Kim Je-ha, who
will be joining our VIP team.

778
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,916
As long as the terrible Ms. Choi
is keeping her eye on everything,

779
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,316
no one comes here.

780
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,956
It's not that Dad isn't coming.

781
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,720
Because of that woman, he can't come.

782
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,076
Since there are lots of cameras,

783
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,040
you should be waving a bit.

784
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,240
We put the hunting dogs
together and leave them to it.
