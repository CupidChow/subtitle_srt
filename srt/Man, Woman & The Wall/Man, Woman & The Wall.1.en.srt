1
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:47,718
Uh huh... Yea... That's interesting

2
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:51,764
That's not good... Really?

3
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:53,599
What a thin wall!

4
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:01,732
Hey. How's the new house?

5
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:04,986
Oh yes! The wall's a bit too thin

6
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:06,112
that I can hear voices from next door

7
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:08,614
but this is the first time
I got an apartment with a bathtub

8
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:09,782
so there's nothing much
to complain about

9
00:01:09,782 --> 00:01:10,908
So it comes with a bathtub?
Yes

10
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:11,742
So you've finally made it this far

11
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,287
It's all thanks to the Chief Editor

12
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:16,581
Now you're at the peak of your life

13
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:17,748
Huh? You mean having a bathtub?

14
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:20,626
Yup' having an apartment with a bathtub
is the peak of your life

15
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:21,961
That's just sad...

16
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,879
Am I really that low?

17
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,550
Isn't this just like the time
with the Romanian Pub?

18
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,635
I agree it's quite similar

19
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:32,471
Don't you have anything new?

20
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:36,601
It is getting conservative these days

21
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,644
It's hard to get interesting stories

22
00:01:38,644 --> 00:01:41,022
Keep working' informer

23
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:44,984
Oh yea. An IT company is working with

24
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:50,156
Singapore affiliated Chinese mafia to
control a Chinese company from the back

25
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:52,658
So you've got something good after all

26
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:56,287
They specialize in
counterfeit credit cards

27
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:57,580
Pretty big business at the time

28
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:23,606
I am doing my best but Mom
you should hang in there too

29
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:27,610
Isn't Kazuyuki taking the exam this year

30
00:02:57,765 --> 00:03:02,019
Cut it out.
What are you getting out of this?

31
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:08,275
When you get arrested
your life will be all messed up

32
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,298
Hmm? It's not here

33
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:07,955
Welcome back

34
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:50,706
Good night

35
00:08:26,385 --> 00:08:27,678
Hello?

36
00:08:29,763 --> 00:08:33,559
Cut it out.
What are you getting out of this?

37
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:37,646
It's very... fun...

38
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:41,275
When you get arrested
your life will be all messed up

39
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:46,739
I want to screw you...

40
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:58,125
Hello? Yuta? Yes, the same guy

41
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,127
I am so scared

42
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:03,797
Yea' it's just disgusting

43
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:06,842
Yea' please come over

44
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:54,473
I was so scared...

45
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:57,226
Isn't this becoming more frequent?

46
00:09:58,352 --> 00:10:01,480
At first it's just silent calls

47
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,358
But now it's becoming threatening

48
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:06,777
He said he wants to screw me over...

49
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:07,361
I can't take it anymore- -

50
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:11,490
Don't worry! I am going to be with you

51
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:15,994
But it's already been three weeks
this guy's a freak

52
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:18,997
I think you should contact the police

53
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:22,000
The police...

54
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:27,381
The thing is, I was asked out for a date
by my coworker recently

55
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:29,133
Really?

56
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:31,677
Of course I turned him down

57
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:35,389
I suspected him
because he seemed a bit difficult...

58
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:39,518
But the voice is completely different
so it's probably not him

59
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:42,020
He's definitely fishy

60
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,691
Voices can be changed easily
on the phone

61
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:50,404
Just watch for him
Anyway, let's change the phone number

62
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:52,030
I will handle it tomorrow

63
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,657
You can do that?

64
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:55,659
Well, if I explain the situation
to the phone company

65
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,119
they will get something done

66
00:10:57,536 --> 00:11:02,291
So Satsuki, you should get in touch
with the police

67
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,834
Ok

68
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,882
It's great having you here.
Huh?

69
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:14,136
Because, if I am by myself
I wouldn't know how to handle this

70
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:15,304
I am the one
who's supposed to handle this

71
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,556
We are dating each other after all

72
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:20,601
We've been dating for two months?

73
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:25,189
Yup, next Wednesday
and it will be two months

74
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:29,026
So it's not been two months

75
00:11:29,026 --> 00:11:31,486
Yah, it's not been two months

76
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:37,326
Don't you think
we get along well so soon?

77
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:40,078
Don't you like it?

78
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,333
Of course, I do

79
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,920
We don't see each other often

80
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,300
But I'm fine with that
When I see you, I feel like fresh

81
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:55,510
We get along well

82
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,095
Getting along...

83
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:04,394
Oh my god, just do it already!

84
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:46,014
That's fast!

85
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:03,198
What are you up to?

86
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,827
Ok... She comes back
when the train's not running

87
00:15:06,827 --> 00:15:09,830
She doesn't look like
she rides the taxis either

88
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,834
That means she must be working close by

89
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:18,839
For someone like her
it must be a family restaurant

90
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,173
Wha...?

91
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:22,509
May I take your order?

92
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:25,846
Oh, yes. An order of chili cheese fries

93
00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:10,265
Welcome!

94
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:19,900
Welcome! Here's the menu

95
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:43,882
Sorry to make you wait

96
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:45,926
Who ordered the junior burger?

97
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:50,639
Here you go.
Thank you

98
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:32,926
Hello. Hi, I got
a package delivery notice

99
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:38,598
Yes. I am wondering if you can deliver
it to Sugiura at Room 6085 instead?

100
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:41,601
Yes, Sugiura

101
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:45,480
I think she will be back by 6:30

102
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:50,318
Yes, sorry for the trouble. Thank you

103
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:30,942
Hello, I got your package

104
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:34,654
Oh! Thank you!
I am very sorry for the trouble

105
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:35,822
No, not at all

106
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:38,199
The thing is I am out
at work most of the time

107
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,660
so the delivery man said he will
just leave it with the neighbor

108
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,911
I am really sorry about this

109
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:44,080
Don't worry about it

110
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,499
Did you recently move here?

111
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:49,377
Yes. I am sorry.
I didn't even let you know

112
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:51,254
I am Kawase. Pleasure to meet you

113
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:54,340
I am Sugiura. Nice to meet you too.
Sorry about that

114
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,886
Ok then, I will see you later.
Yes. Thank you so much

115
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:39,552
Ah, please take these.
Thanks so much for the package

116
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:41,721
Eh? Is it ok?

117
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:43,389
Just sharing what I got

118
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:45,058
I guess you can call it a greeting gift
from the new neighbor

119
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:46,100
Thank you

120
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,852
Bye
Bye

121
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:38,069
How, how did you know this number?

122
00:22:38,236 --> 00:22:40,613
It doesn't matter what you do...

123
00:22:40,613 --> 00:22:43,658
I will be with you... no matter...

124
00:22:43,658 --> 00:22:44,993
NO!!!

125
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:52,292
Yuta!

126
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,420
How did he find out the new number?

127
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:59,132
This is weird. Did you call the police?

128
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:02,635
Not yet...

129
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:06,306
I am scared, Yuta.
He said he's going to come...

130
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:08,433
-Don't worry
-Just once a week?

131
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:12,604
I will find him.
For god's sake do it more often!

132
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:24,866
Hello?
Yes, I would like to place a request

133
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:29,162
Yes, race queen please. Yes

134
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:45,136
Sorry to make you wait

135
00:23:45,303 --> 00:23:46,554
Eh?

136
00:23:47,347 --> 00:23:49,849
Huh? Is that how it is?

137
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:54,354
I don't mind
but it is going to cost you extra

138
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,272
Who are you?

139
00:23:56,272 --> 00:24:00,318
I am Rena from Sukima Switch

140
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:02,737
Sukima Switch?

141
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:08,785
Um, what is that? I mean... but...

142
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:10,912
That's what people call a pervert

143
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:13,790
I am becoming quite drawn to it

144
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:17,543
So? You're living a quiet
or should I say a silent life?

145
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:21,214
Miss Satsuki is becoming the center
of my daily routine

146
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:25,343
I know more about her than someone
who share a room with her

147
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:29,430
Well, yea. She's not hiding
anything behind that wall

148
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,184
But you don't see a girl
like this nowadays

149
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:36,270
She goes to work during the day

150
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,356
and work part time at the restaurant
during the night

151
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:41,609
She even sends money back home

152
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:45,989
Don't you think that's admirable?
No way I could've done that

153
00:24:46,406 --> 00:24:47,407
That's true

154
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:51,160
But, she comes back 3AM
in the morning day after day

155
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:53,871
when she finish her night shift

156
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:56,040
Above all, I stayed up with her

157
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:58,167
I get very sleepy from that

158
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,420
That's quite unhealthy

159
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:02,255
I can't agree more

160
00:25:03,047 --> 00:25:08,594
Oh yea. There's one place where I keep
getting noise from the microphone

161
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:10,263
Is it a malfunction?

162
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:14,434
How am I suppose to know? Come on

163
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,604
But, there is only one place where
I can't hear well with the mic

164
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,481
What do you think it could be?

165
00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:23,276
Ask the master of eavesdropping, Ono

166
00:25:23,443 --> 00:25:25,987
The debugger Ono

167
00:25:25,987 --> 00:25:29,198
Before, you know too don't you

168
00:25:29,198 --> 00:25:31,659
He places hidden mics in houses

169
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:37,540
Later he goes to the owner and say
something like "your house is bugged"

170
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:45,089
After that he goes in and
retrieve the mics and get the payment

171
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:50,136
At the end he got caught for this fraud

172
00:25:50,136 --> 00:25:52,472
Now they say he's working as
a eavesdropper underground

173
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:57,310
Yea, in that field he's
more famous than before

174
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,229
Master of eavesdropping, Ono...

175
00:26:05,318 --> 00:26:11,324
I can see your effort, but normally
shouldn't you be using a wireless?

176
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:14,243
I was thinking about saving up a bit...

177
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:26,047
This is because someone else
installed a mic

178
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:28,341
Eh!? Who could it be?

179
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:32,637
That mic's radio wave is
interrupting yours, creating the noise

180
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:34,013
Eh!?

181
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:44,148
Hmm... Who could that be?
Satsuki is at work today

182
00:26:44,315 --> 00:26:47,026
He must be the one
who installed the mics

183
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:07,421
It seems he installed something else

184
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:08,339
Let's go take a look

185
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:09,674
Eh?

186
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:52,508
Wow!? So this is what the room is like!

187
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:58,890
It's different from
my imagination after all

188
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:47,355
Ryo, here

189
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,317
Ah, this is it?

190
00:28:51,317 --> 00:28:54,779
I've seen this one on TV

191
00:28:55,363 --> 00:28:59,742
It's the type you can place anywhere

192
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:03,246
My magazine made a special report
on this type before too

193
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:09,293
It seems he's here to install this today

194
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,294
What is it?

195
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,630
-Wow, a hidden camera.
-Yea

196
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:16,759
This type does not send off
strong radio signals

197
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,843
That means he's not far

198
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,513
Really? Is he a real pervert?

199
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:22,682
You're not that much different either

200
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,934
What do we do with this and the mic?

201
00:29:24,934 --> 00:29:28,437
Just leave it. If we remove it
he will just install new ones

202
00:29:28,437 --> 00:29:29,480
That's true

203
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:40,199
Let's move.
If we hang around for too long

204
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,701
he's going to be back
to check on the equipment

205
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,077
Ok

206
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,348
That's it, there's no mistake

207
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:41,719
Excuse me

208
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,516
Do you know where
the Suguzaki Ichizen Ramen House is?

209
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:49,769
I am not from around here
so I am not sure

210
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:50,603
What?

211
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:54,982
I don't live around here
so I don't know where it is

212
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:07,495
Ah. Got it. Thank you

213
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,543
Yuta, you swine

214
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:19,590
Welcome

215
00:31:29,058 --> 00:31:30,476
Oh hi

216
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:31,769
Thanks for the gifts from before

217
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:32,978
So you work here?

218
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:36,482
That's right. During the day
I work full time at a company

219
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:37,775
But during the night
I work part-time here

220
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:40,027
Really? I didn't notice at all

221
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:41,779
I come here quite frequently lately

222
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:44,949
Eh? Really? Sorry, here's the menu

223
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:51,247
The canned crab
from before was delicious

224
00:31:51,247 --> 00:31:52,206
Thank you so much

225
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:53,582
No, it's nothing

226
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:55,668
When you go out again
please let me know

227
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:58,337
You really saved me that time

228
00:31:58,337 --> 00:32:00,631
I look forward to my share

229
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,218
I see.
Next time let's get Matsusaka beef

230
00:32:04,218 --> 00:32:06,345
Matsusaka beef? Yay!

231
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:10,141
Fried banana and cherry coke

232
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:12,852
Fried banana and cherry coke?

233
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:14,311
Please wait for awhile

234
00:32:29,702 --> 00:32:32,413
-Ah, Mr. Kawase
-Oh, hi!

235
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:34,123
-You have the day off today?
-Today my work start during the night

236
00:32:34,123 --> 00:32:34,957
How about you?

237
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:38,711
I work till noon so I was working up
a sweat at the gym

238
00:32:38,878 --> 00:32:40,838
I see. Would you like to
have a cup of tea?

239
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:43,466
The cakes at Patisserie Hiroaki
are irresistible

240
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:45,843
I know that store.
They're delicious aren't they?

241
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,473
So Mr. Kawase, you work with the media?

242
00:32:50,473 --> 00:32:54,810
That's right.
But under a small publisher

243
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,438
I think I would feel easier
if you just call me Ryo

244
00:32:57,438 --> 00:32:59,815
Mr. Ryo, I am Satsuki

245
00:32:59,815 --> 00:33:00,733
Miss Satsuki

246
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,740
During the day I work for
an importing company

247
00:33:07,907 --> 00:33:08,365
Really!

248
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,826
But I really wanted to
work with the media

249
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:14,288
You're kidding.
It's no walk in the park

250
00:33:14,288 --> 00:33:16,624
Working for a magazine company
you lose all of your free time

251
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:23,172
But I am quite envious that you can get
in a job you're interested in

252
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:25,090
Well, that's true

253
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:33,098
To have play time and work time merge
into one is actually quite interesting

254
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:37,937
So what do you do?

255
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:38,812
During work?

256
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:43,234
Meet all types of people
and gather information

257
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,902
Do you meet anyone famous?

258
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:47,696
For us, we don't get the chance

259
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:50,783
-It's a pretty old fashioned magazine.
-Old fashion...?

260
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:55,829
We don't have any luck with
the entertainment industry

261
00:33:55,829 --> 00:33:58,165
What exactly do you mean?

262
00:33:58,165 --> 00:34:01,502
For example, introducing the
underground sewers across the nation

263
00:34:01,502 --> 00:34:02,169
Underground sewer?

264
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:03,587
That's right

265
00:34:03,754 --> 00:34:07,299
Normally you wouldn't even
think about it right?

266
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:10,135
But according to area and its land

267
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:11,470
there's actually various type
of underground sewer

268
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:15,849
to handle different kind of conditions

269
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:18,602
Not a very popular field

270
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:24,275
but some people think
it's a very interesting topic

271
00:34:25,526 --> 00:34:30,698
That's interesting... And it's so true

272
00:34:30,698 --> 00:34:31,740
Isn't it?

273
00:34:35,244 --> 00:34:37,997
Mr. Kawase, I mean Mr. Ryo

274
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:40,416
I can't imagine you doing it

275
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:41,917
Doing what?

276
00:34:42,084 --> 00:34:53,095
Traveling to and researching
every underground sewage in the nation

277
00:34:53,095 --> 00:35:00,936
You can't just judge someone
by their appearance

278
00:35:00,936 --> 00:35:02,688
Do you travel a lot?

279
00:35:02,855 --> 00:35:04,481
Well, yea, quite often

280
00:35:05,149 --> 00:35:06,483
That's nice

281
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,819
Why? You don't travel
with your boyfriend?

282
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:13,240
Yea. He just got hired this year
and he's been quite busy

283
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,493
So it's just not possible

284
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,456
I see. Of course you would
have a boyfriend

285
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:22,499
Though we've only been
dating for two months

286
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:26,670
Ah, I see. Then you don't know him all
that well yet right?

287
00:35:26,837 --> 00:35:31,175
2 months is the stage where
you really start to get to know him

288
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:33,427
That's right

289
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:37,931
How about you? Mr. Ryo? Your girlfriend

290
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:40,976
Me? I don't have one

291
00:35:40,976 --> 00:35:44,355
So Miss Satsuki's already
got a boyfriend...

292
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:45,773
What a dark life I am leading...

293
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:47,232
You said it

294
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:52,988
If you date with me
you will be able travel a lot

295
00:35:52,988 --> 00:35:56,492
You mean I get to travel the waters?

296
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:57,618
Underground sewage

297
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,872
It sure seems interesting

298
00:36:02,748 --> 00:36:03,999
Touring the waterways

299
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:06,043
Underground sewage? Interesting?

300
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,170
You serious? It seems fun?

301
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:11,090
It's not fun?

302
00:36:11,423 --> 00:36:12,883
It can't be

303
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:15,594
I guess it can't be then

304
00:36:51,714 --> 00:36:53,382
That swine

305
00:37:18,157 --> 00:37:20,075
How are you?

306
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:23,287
I will get you soon

307
00:37:23,996 --> 00:37:26,832
I will have you...

308
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:31,712
What do you want!? Stop calling!

309
00:37:31,712 --> 00:37:34,173
What are you doing now?

310
00:37:34,882 --> 00:37:38,510
That bastard

311
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,429
No!!

312
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,691
Hello?

313
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:54,485
Oh, what is it?

314
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:56,862
Could you come over today?

315
00:37:57,029 --> 00:37:59,114
Today might be a difficult

316
00:37:59,114 --> 00:38:00,574
I am in the middle of work right now

317
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:01,992
Something wrong?

318
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:06,288
It's that guy again

319
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:06,872
Eh?

320
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,751
It's seems like
it's getting more serious

321
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:14,671
I am so scared, Yuta

322
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:19,259
I really want to do something for you
but I can't get away today

323
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:22,763
I will give the police a call and see
if they can send a patrol over

324
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:23,847
I am sorry

325
00:38:24,932 --> 00:38:25,974
Don't be

326
00:38:26,141 --> 00:38:28,811
If anything happens give me a call

327
00:38:29,895 --> 00:38:33,607
Being able to talk to you makes me
feel more calmed down now

328
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:37,236
I feel alright now. Thanks

329
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:40,739
I wish I can be with you more often...

330
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:42,658
I am sorry I am not dependable
at a time like this

331
00:38:43,575 --> 00:38:45,160
That's not true

332
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,162
You've been a great help

333
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,625
Really? I am glad you said that

334
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:55,045
Ok then, hang in there

335
00:38:55,754 --> 00:38:59,675
If you feel uneasy again, give me a call

336
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:02,553
-Good night
-Good night

337
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:46,722
Miss Satsuki, that guy's dangerous...

338
00:40:06,825 --> 00:40:07,951
Sorry to have you out during work

339
00:40:08,118 --> 00:40:09,953
Don't worry about it. What is it?

340
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,122
I am starting to worry

341
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:15,125
What kind of freak would
do something like this...?

342
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:17,252
He must be a pervert

343
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:18,712
Excuse me

344
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:24,051
Sorry to keep you waiting

345
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:26,428
Tibet style spicy steamed dumplings

346
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:30,057
Thai style spicy yakisoba

347
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:31,558
Vietnamese spring rolls

348
00:40:33,185 --> 00:40:36,021
Spicy steamed dumplings, spicy yakisoba
and spring rolls?

349
00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:37,522
Will that be all?

350
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:39,816
Please wait for awhile

351
00:40:41,026 --> 00:40:42,861
So you're working around here today?

352
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:44,363
I've been working with 30 companies
since the morning

353
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:45,614
Wow

354
00:40:45,614 --> 00:40:48,283
But I can't handle it at all
I am worn out

355
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:52,871
Hello, this is Konishi

356
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:55,207
Thank you, Mr. Isono

357
00:40:57,042 --> 00:41:00,462
Is that so? I am glad to hear it

358
00:41:01,004 --> 00:41:02,589
That's great

359
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:04,132
That would really help me out

360
00:41:05,384 --> 00:41:11,890
I will be there in an hour then.
Thank you

361
00:41:12,975 --> 00:41:15,060
Phew, the client I was handling
this morning gave me the OK

362
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:16,019
That's great

363
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:17,813
It's been going well today

364
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:21,775
I guess I should go to
the police after all

365
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:24,736
Like I said.
Sorry, excuse me for a second

366
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:30,242
Hello, Konishi. Thank you

367
00:41:30,409 --> 00:41:33,787
I am sorry for troubling you
a few days ago. I appreciate it

368
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:40,752
Regarding the goods we talked
about a few days ago

369
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:46,425
We'll just go with it. Thank you

370
00:41:48,427 --> 00:41:49,636
What was it?

371
00:41:50,262 --> 00:41:52,180
Don't worry, it's taken care of

372
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,265
I see

373
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:56,768
Excuse me. Sorry to keep you waiting.
Here's the spring rolls

374
00:41:56,935 --> 00:41:59,229
-The rest will be here shortly.
-Ok

375
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:32,763
Delivery

376
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:33,430
Thanks

377
00:42:33,597 --> 00:42:35,682
You have a caring mother.
She sent you stuff again

378
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:36,475
I will give you your share in a bit

379
00:42:36,475 --> 00:42:37,476
Thank you!

380
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:41,563
Oh, and there's one more

381
00:42:42,564 --> 00:42:44,483
-It's moving...
-You want to know what's inside?

382
00:42:44,483 --> 00:42:45,192
Eh?

383
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:47,110
-Come on in.
-Eh?

384
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:50,113
But I want to know...

385
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:53,784
Wow! shrimps!

386
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,411
If you cook these they taste great.
Take some with you

387
00:42:56,411 --> 00:42:59,539
I've never seen live shrimps before

388
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:01,833
Or should I say
I don't know how to cook these

389
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,627
It's easy, here

390
00:43:06,963 --> 00:43:11,885
Satsuki, help me out

391
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:17,849
What the hell is she doing!?
Where did she go?

392
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,731
Ahh... That was great

393
00:43:24,731 --> 00:43:27,442
It makes me wonder what those
fried shrimps I've had before were

394
00:43:27,442 --> 00:43:28,193
Didn't I say that?

395
00:43:28,193 --> 00:43:30,320
Wait, didn't you say
they look so sad before?

396
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,614
That's because they were alive
before you fried them

397
00:43:32,614 --> 00:43:34,116
Well, that's true

398
00:43:34,116 --> 00:43:37,369
Live shrimps and fried shrimps
are completely different

399
00:43:37,536 --> 00:43:39,538
They are

400
00:43:39,538 --> 00:43:44,543
Before they were fried

401
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:47,754
they looked like aliens
and it's just disgusting

402
00:43:47,754 --> 00:43:49,214
But when they are fried

403
00:43:49,214 --> 00:43:56,638
it's like I know these
fried shrimps, I've seen them..

404
00:43:56,805 --> 00:43:57,681
Yea

405
00:43:57,848 --> 00:44:00,058
You are good at cooking

406
00:44:00,225 --> 00:44:02,477
Well, I've been living alone for awhile

407
00:44:02,477 --> 00:44:04,396
I got trained for it

408
00:44:04,563 --> 00:44:06,356
You don't cook often?

409
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:07,899
Not at all

410
00:44:07,899 --> 00:44:11,403
Eh? Why? It's fun if you try it

411
00:44:12,904 --> 00:44:14,990
Ahh...

412
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:19,578
you seem to get along with your family

413
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:22,080
Well, yea

414
00:44:23,081 --> 00:44:28,003
For me, my family is
on the verge of breaking down

415
00:44:28,003 --> 00:44:29,588
Why?

416
00:44:30,422 --> 00:44:32,924
When I was in high school

417
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:36,469
a robbery case occurred in my area

418
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:43,560
At the time, my father quitted his job
and was in the house

419
00:44:43,727 --> 00:44:48,607
For some reason
he was suspected as the robber

420
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:50,775
Suspected as the robber?

421
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:59,534
My family was treated as criminals
in the entire area

422
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:06,082
We got the stares, and my brother
and I get harassed at school

423
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:08,585
But, the case was solved right?

424
00:45:08,752 --> 00:45:14,216
They soon found the real robber
and my father's name cleared

425
00:45:14,382 --> 00:45:22,140
But due to this, my father
and mother divorced

426
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,103
Really? Wow
that's some pretty serious talk

427
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:30,899
It seems if you have that happen once

428
00:45:32,317 --> 00:45:36,446
you just can't get back
on your feet again

429
00:45:36,863 --> 00:45:41,117
We moved and transferred

430
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:45,163
and my mother was all drained out

431
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:47,832
Wow, that's some serious talk

432
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:53,421
That's tough. But I can't see that
from you, Miss Satsuki

433
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:54,839
You seem cheerful

434
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:58,385
and it's hard to imagine you're
carrying all that on your mind

435
00:46:00,512 --> 00:46:04,140
It might be because I try not
to think about it

436
00:46:04,307 --> 00:46:05,767
I see

437
00:46:05,934 --> 00:46:09,479
But I won't forgive the police.
I hate them

438
00:46:09,646 --> 00:46:15,568
That's understandable... You are strong

439
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:19,864
When I talk with you, Ryo

440
00:46:20,782 --> 00:46:23,159
I feel I can say stuff that
I usually don't talk about

441
00:46:23,326 --> 00:46:29,040
Maybe because you work with the media

442
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:29,708
Me?

443
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:31,501
You're good at making people talk

444
00:46:31,668 --> 00:46:35,005
Really? I am flattered

445
00:46:36,464 --> 00:46:37,674
Excuse me

446
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:48,351
Hello?

447
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:57,402
I was giving
the neighbor's package to him

448
00:46:57,402 --> 00:46:58,862
and he treated me to dinner...

449
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:01,740
Stop being an airhead!

450
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:06,369
I got some time now
so I will head over now

451
00:47:06,536 --> 00:47:08,621
I will be there in 5 minutes

452
00:47:08,621 --> 00:47:10,415
Ok

453
00:47:10,582 --> 00:47:12,208
I will see you later

454
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,804
Um... I have to go back to my room

455
00:47:24,804 --> 00:47:25,555
So I will excuse myself

456
00:47:25,722 --> 00:47:27,932
Ah, ok. Come again anytime

457
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:29,768
It was delicious. Thanks for the meal

458
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:31,019
Good night

459
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:32,729
Good night

460
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:55,168
Yes?

461
00:47:55,752 --> 00:47:57,712
Is this alright?
I know it's not Matsusaka beef

462
00:47:57,879 --> 00:48:00,173
It's Matsusaka beef! Or not...

463
00:48:00,173 --> 00:48:01,424
Didn't I just say that?

464
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:02,967
But all these... Thanks

465
00:48:03,134 --> 00:48:04,969
Alright, come again anytime. Good night

466
00:48:05,136 --> 00:48:06,179
Good night

467
00:48:22,487 --> 00:48:23,738
Yes

468
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:25,824
Who's that?

469
00:48:26,157 --> 00:48:27,742
The neighbor I was talking about

470
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:29,661
He gave me some of the stuff
he got in the package

471
00:48:29,828 --> 00:48:32,038
Oh? I see

472
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:35,708
Is everything alright?

473
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:38,044
Eh? What are you talking about?

474
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:40,171
Ah, the phone harassment?

475
00:48:40,547 --> 00:48:42,340
I guess I forgot about it

476
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,675
Everything's fine

477
00:48:44,175 --> 00:48:45,635
That's good

478
00:48:46,177 --> 00:48:50,181
Huh? Stop

479
00:48:50,348 --> 00:48:51,558
Stop it!

480
00:48:54,352 --> 00:48:56,312
Yuta, you're acting funny today

481
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,190
You're the one who's acting funny

482
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,196
Stop it

483
00:49:38,688 --> 00:49:40,231
Be gentle...

484
00:49:40,398 --> 00:49:41,608
Sorry

485
00:49:43,943 --> 00:49:45,361
Don't be rough

486
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:47,405
I know

487
00:49:49,115 --> 00:49:51,075
You're scary today, Yuta

488
00:49:51,868 --> 00:49:53,578
That's not true

489
00:49:56,498 --> 00:49:57,707
I don't want this

490
00:49:59,584 --> 00:50:03,046
You're interested in the guy next door?

491
00:50:03,963 --> 00:50:06,341
Satsuki, that guy's no good

492
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:10,136
I tell you

493
00:51:11,155 --> 00:51:13,032
Damn it

494
00:52:06,878 --> 00:52:08,338
Good evening

495
00:52:09,964 --> 00:52:15,970
I am the one who's dating
Sugiura Satsuki next door

496
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:18,723
Please take these...

497
00:52:18,723 --> 00:52:22,685
I am wondering
could you have sex with Satsuki please?

498
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:24,312
What are you talking about?

499
00:52:24,312 --> 00:52:26,189
You've given her quite a lot of gifts

500
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:30,526
Tell me the truth, you just want to have
sex with Satsuki right? I don't mind

501
00:52:30,693 --> 00:52:34,947
-You're an idiot.
-But, do it at her room please

502
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:37,241
She will feel easier that way

503
00:53:02,767 --> 00:53:06,771
What is it? Cut it out already

504
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:26,249
-You waited?
-No

505
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:29,752
-I got it.
-Ah... That's good

506
00:53:33,756 --> 00:53:35,007
Thank you

507
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,557
It's just as delicious as before

508
00:53:44,976 --> 00:53:46,728
It's different from the others after all

509
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,775
It used good red beans
and the sweetness is right on the spot

510
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:57,613
The outside is crispy
and the inside is soft

511
00:54:01,117 --> 00:54:04,203
This will be it for awhile.
It's tough over here too

512
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:05,621
I know

513
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:13,045
You come here often when you were little

514
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:14,630
Really?

515
00:54:15,381 --> 00:54:16,924
You don't remember?

516
00:54:17,091 --> 00:54:20,178
You often trip over there
and cried about it

517
00:54:21,471 --> 00:54:22,764
Really?

518
00:54:23,765 --> 00:54:25,516
You're such a helpless daughter

519
00:54:25,683 --> 00:54:27,685
Look who's talking

520
00:54:29,437 --> 00:54:31,397
The way they baked this is good too

521
00:54:33,399 --> 00:54:36,068
It's probably because
they used good flour

522
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:56,923
Satsuki

523
00:54:59,091 --> 00:55:00,134
You're going back now?

524
00:55:00,134 --> 00:55:02,178
It's a piece of cake till today

525
00:55:02,178 --> 00:55:04,972
Starting in two days
it's going to be hell though

526
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,432
You're early today too, Satsuki

527
00:55:06,432 --> 00:55:07,016
I got early shift today

528
00:55:07,183 --> 00:55:08,559
Eh? You want to go to dinner together?

529
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,394
Eh? Should I?

530
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:13,481
OK! It's been decided.
Let's go. Let's go

531
00:55:34,043 --> 00:55:38,005
My mother said it was all
paid up a long time ago

532
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:57,233
Okay, Hide close in, close in, close in.
Kyoko, look frightened

533
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,154
Over there yes. Hide, lines

534
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:05,533
Whatever, just pay up

535
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:32,393
That's not possible

536
00:56:32,977 --> 00:56:35,563
Don't make fun of me

537
00:56:36,981 --> 00:56:40,860
My mother said it was all paid up
a long time ago

538
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,112
That old hag's...

539
00:56:49,452 --> 00:56:52,622
That old hag's...

540
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:03,799
Lying

541
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:11,557
I know that old hag's lying

542
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:16,062
But, it's surprising
you didn't turn me down today

543
00:57:16,062 --> 00:57:17,438
Surprising?

544
00:57:17,438 --> 00:57:18,856
Because, usually girls
that have boyfriends

545
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:20,483
have it pretty tough in
this kind of situation

546
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:22,735
But don't they at least
go out for dinner?

547
00:57:22,735 --> 00:57:24,904
Oh, really?

548
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:27,031
Isn't that the case?

549
00:57:27,031 --> 00:57:29,033
Although I usually don't

550
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:33,037
But you're such a charming guy

551
00:57:33,204 --> 00:57:35,831
Whatever...

552
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:42,254
Ryo, you've talked about it before

553
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:46,300
That the second month is when you really
get to see your partner

554
00:57:46,467 --> 00:57:47,343
I said that?

555
00:57:47,343 --> 00:57:49,136
You don't remember?

556
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:50,721
Well, you said it

557
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:53,224
Right now I can really feel
those words coming at me

558
00:57:53,224 --> 00:57:57,353
Oh, something good.
Isn't that a good sign? What is it?

559
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,940
It's getting harder
and harder to understand him

560
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,317
I thought he was this type of person

561
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:05,069
but recently
he's been completely different

562
00:58:05,236 --> 00:58:06,862
Seeing him like this makes me uneasy

563
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:08,906
I wonder if I can still keep going

564
00:58:09,073 --> 00:58:11,492
If that's what you think
you should just quit

565
00:58:11,492 --> 00:58:12,702
Is it that easy?

566
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:14,954
I mean, isn't that a very important part
of the relationship?

567
00:58:14,954 --> 00:58:17,581
If you are beginning to
have trouble seeing

568
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:23,504
how you two connect
then that's not good

569
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:25,506
That's true

570
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:28,384
There are many ways to make money
and I am going to teach you

571
00:58:28,551 --> 00:58:31,137
I am going to teach you, so...

572
00:58:31,137 --> 00:58:33,431
Please stop. Let me go...

573
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:37,768
Before I sell you off you're going to
make some money for me

574
00:58:39,437 --> 00:58:41,772
Stop. Stop it

575
00:58:43,107 --> 00:58:44,734
Well, if I can't get anything out of you

576
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,112
There are others I can get money from

577
00:58:48,112 --> 00:58:49,905
Like your boyfriend for example

578
00:58:52,116 --> 00:58:54,952
Give it back! What are you doing!?

579
00:58:56,912 --> 00:58:58,247
Bug off

580
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:01,208
Oww

581
00:59:04,295 --> 00:59:07,590
I see you've got a lot of calls from him

582
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,680
Yuta, phone call~

583
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,849
Why is it me?

584
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:20,686
It doesn't have anything to do with me!

585
00:59:21,145 --> 00:59:25,816
Well, we'll just have Yuta
pay off everything

586
00:59:27,193 --> 00:59:29,070
This room...

587
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:33,074
I just can't shake the feeling
that I am being watched

588
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:36,077
Don't you feel it too?

589
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:43,626
Something's fishy. Who's peeping at us!?

590
00:59:44,627 --> 00:59:46,253
I am gonna kill you!!

591
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:11,195
...and I order a hot cocoa

592
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:13,030
and what do you think my friend ordered?

593
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:16,742
A hot ice tea

594
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:20,579
Hot ice tea. What in the world is
that suppose to mean?

595
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:22,665
-I was shocked.
-I wouldn't be able to understand that.

596
01:00:22,665 --> 01:00:23,791
Ah, good night

597
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:25,960
Good night. Thanks for the meal

598
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:27,878
No, let's go again sometime

599
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:28,504
Good night

600
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:30,256
Good night

601
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,728
What do we do with this?

602
01:00:46,147 --> 01:00:48,149
If no one wants it, I will take it

603
01:00:48,149 --> 01:00:49,650
Okay

604
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:51,902
Nope

605
01:00:55,322 --> 01:00:57,449
Okay, I will leave the rest to you guys

606
01:00:57,449 --> 01:01:00,619
I am going to get my share from Yuta

607
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:03,122
Thanks

608
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:10,087
This is a present from Yuta

609
01:01:18,596 --> 01:01:20,723
Mr. Konishi

610
01:01:20,723 --> 01:01:25,561
I have important business with you
regarding Satsuki Sugiura

611
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:29,273
Mr. Konishi

612
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:31,066
I'm not here!

613
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:33,194
Konishi, get your butt out

614
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:37,114
Konishi!

615
01:01:53,923 --> 01:01:56,008
Mr. Konishi moved out already

616
01:01:57,301 --> 01:01:59,053
I think it was 2 days ago?

617
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,222
Oh really?

618
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:14,068
I don't know what to do anymore

619
01:02:14,652 --> 01:02:16,695
The cell phone won't connect

620
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:19,782
When I went to his house
I found out he moved

621
01:02:19,949 --> 01:02:22,618
I have no idea where he works

622
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:25,996
He went missing and
I lost contact with him completely

623
01:02:25,996 --> 01:02:29,583
Hmm... I don't know.
It seems like a mystery novel

624
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,960
Okay, your left hand's index finger

625
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,338
Using this kind of method
to shake me off

626
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:35,798
That's so low

627
01:02:35,965 --> 01:02:38,425
Ok, thank you

628
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:40,386
If I know he's going to do this

629
01:02:40,386 --> 01:02:42,805
I would've break up with him

630
01:02:42,805 --> 01:02:43,889
Ahh~ so annoying

631
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:47,768
If he's that kind of man
isn't it just perfect?

632
01:02:47,768 --> 01:02:49,979
You don't have to deal with him
and he disappears from your life

633
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:52,064
Consider yourself lucky

634
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:55,192
In fact, I think it's better for you
to thinking that way

635
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:57,528
Really?

636
01:02:59,697 --> 01:03:03,867
Hey, Ryo, do you find me attractive?

637
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:04,952
Of course

638
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,495
You think so?

639
01:03:06,662 --> 01:03:09,123
Then have you ever thought
about having sex with me?

640
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,749
You are drunk aren't you?

641
01:03:10,749 --> 01:03:13,085
Answer me

642
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:15,629
Yea, I've thought about it

643
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:18,382
Eh? Since when?

644
01:03:18,382 --> 01:03:20,968
Eh? Since when...?

645
01:03:22,011 --> 01:03:23,220
When we first met

646
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,805
Ah... I suppose

647
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:26,849
That's so dirty...

648
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:31,103
That means when I came here
with packages

649
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:32,646
you wanted to do me?

650
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:36,692
-How indecent.
-You're too drunk

651
01:03:39,945 --> 01:03:43,907
The thing is, even though he breaking up
with me is still very irritating

652
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:46,702
I don't feel sad at all

653
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:50,956
Instead, I feel a sense of freedom

654
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:55,669
That's right, maybe I am lucky

655
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:01,925
Ryo, let's dance

656
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:03,802
No, I am fine

657
01:06:46,548 --> 01:06:48,050
What is it?

658
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:51,053
Something wrong?

659
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:54,014
No, it's something with me

660
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:56,016
What's the problem?

661
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:58,560
It's just...

662
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:04,566
you are different from
the Satsuki I know

663
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:06,735
Isn't that a funny thing to say?

664
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:11,406
You don't know anything about me

665
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:13,325
But...

666
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:19,748
It's alright, I forgive you

667
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:23,585
I am going back

668
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:29,341
Don't worry, I am not mad or sad

669
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:30,634
Good night

670
01:07:32,094 --> 01:07:34,721
Ahh... Good night

671
01:09:36,927 --> 01:09:38,220
Yes

672
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:42,516
What now?

673
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:44,142
What do you want?

674
01:09:45,018 --> 01:09:48,897
Why do I have to pay for your debt?

675
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:50,482
-Give it back.
-Debt? What debt?

676
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:52,317
Give my money back!

677
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:58,240
Satsuki, because of you
my life is all messed up

678
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:02,285
I want to screw you...

679
01:10:02,703 --> 01:10:07,916
I want to screw you...

680
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:10,752
Yuta, don't tell me you're the one...

681
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:12,587
It doesn't matter what you do

682
01:10:12,587 --> 01:10:16,049
no matter where you are
we'll be together...

683
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:17,092
NO!!!

684
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:23,223
Such a pretty face

685
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:33,191
Come on. Cry! Scream!

686
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:35,694
Someone help me...

687
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:53,003
I got you... I caught you... See?

688
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:55,297
Someone help me...

689
01:10:57,632 --> 01:11:03,430
-No...
-Cry, come one!

690
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:07,184
Get out, Satsuki. Get out of here!

691
01:11:33,585 --> 01:11:35,545
So have you slept with Satsuki already?

692
01:11:35,545 --> 01:11:37,422
That's none of your business.

693
01:11:38,089 --> 01:11:39,758
Did you make her lick?

694
01:11:40,258 --> 01:11:41,843
Did Satsuki lick yours already?

695
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:45,347
Yea. It was great.
I made her do it the whole day!

696
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:48,141
What a bitch

697
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:56,107
Aren't you embarrassed? What a shame!

698
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:07,285
Did you do her back?

699
01:12:09,412 --> 01:12:11,039
Did you do her from the back?
Huh? How was it?

700
01:12:11,206 --> 01:12:12,541
Of course I did

701
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,543
Back, top, whatever
I screwed her over and over!

702
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:15,961
What have you done...?

703
01:12:56,501 --> 01:12:58,920
Die!

704
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:07,596
I am not going to give in
to your conspiracy!

705
01:13:08,513 --> 01:13:10,640
You had sex with her!

706
01:13:11,683 --> 01:13:15,395
You had sex with Satsuki!

707
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:21,693
Hey, that's no good, Yuta

708
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:23,111
Out doing something like this...

709
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,907
Get a hold of yourself
and pay back your debt

710
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:29,910
-With that said, let's go, Yuta.
-Yes, let's go

711
01:13:48,762 --> 01:13:49,888
Ryo

712
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:53,266
You okay?

713
01:13:53,266 --> 01:13:54,309
Yea, I am fine. I am fine

714
01:13:54,309 --> 01:13:56,186
-There's blood coming out
-Don't worry

715
01:13:56,186 --> 01:13:59,856
-what do we do?
-It's just a scratch

716
01:14:01,691 --> 01:14:03,652
Oh man... He's really lost it

717
01:14:03,652 --> 01:14:05,904
He's crazy

718
01:14:07,864 --> 01:14:13,328
Ryo, I am going to wash myself off

719
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:15,163
When I am calmed down

720
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,748
I will come back and properly thank you

721
01:14:16,748 --> 01:14:18,291
Got it
