1
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,708
Are you okay?

2
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:50,708
One summer night

3
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:56,375
（Summer 2016, Korea）.

4
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:21,458
A, E, I, O, U Hello,

5
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,207
Yes.

6
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,000
How are things going?

7
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:42,749
I'll call you back.

8
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,166
Cut the crap, you son of a bitch.
Bring the money now.

9
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,041
I told you I'll call you back.

10
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:52,625
You son of a bitch,
How should I trust you?

11
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,208
Give me some money you owe.

12
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,583
Why?

13
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,332
Madam, business is good, isn't it?

14
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,207
Why? Are you gonna come earlier?

15
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,874
I will come to work 2 hours earlier,

16
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:13,458
mop the floor and wash the dishes,

17
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,458
Really? You are being nice today.

18
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:22,750
It has been 2 years
since you made me happy.

19
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,708
Can you pay me in advance?

20
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,541
My family got an accident

21
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,582
I am the only one who help them out,

22
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,042
Please do me a favor.

23
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,542
Your family got an accident?

24
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,458
What a pity!

25
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,958
It's none of my business.

26
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,999
Your payday is coming next week.
You can't change the payday.

27
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,707
Don't you ever underestimate
my restaurant which is small.

28
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,958
Am I right?

29
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,875
Why are you fucking alone?

30
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,250
I am sorry.

31
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,625
Who is it?

32
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,042
What the heck?

33
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,417
Are you kidding me?

34
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,417
I'm sorry..

35
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:51,083
It is chicken feed.

36
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,667
I will pay you soon.

37
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:56,667
You look fucking good.

38
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,999
My son's left eye is getting blind.

39
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,125
He has no sensation in his eyes.

40
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:08,583
You should bring money
or have your eye scooped.

41
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Here you are..

42
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,375
I am starving.

43
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,667
What you got for me?

44
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,250
You always got hamburger
even though you don't eat

45
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:05,833
I like it though,

46
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,417
You look so worn out.

47
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,667
Washing the dishes is a pain in the ass.

48
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,500
That's why you got hamburger.

49
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,292
If you cook, I will wash the dishes.

50
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,082
Let's eat meat.

51
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,833
- Why Hamburger everyday?
- Did you play with the gun?

52
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:30,958
I didn't. It's....

53
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:35,291
No, I just practiced
before I go to the military.

54
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:36,875
Are you happy to go to military.

55
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,083
I am not,

56
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,542
I am not happy at all.

57
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,208
I just played with a toy gun,
don't overreact.

58
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,083
Don't take this gun out of fishbowl,

59
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,417
I warn you.

60
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,375
You don't like me at home doing nothing.

61
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,708
My left eye is blind,
I am not qualified to work.

62
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,208
I am not as lazy as you think.

63
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,291
You don't love me any more, do you?

64
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,833
Are you sick of tired of me?

65
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,125
Tae-kyu,

66
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,375
Tae-kyu.

67
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:14,625
Tae-kyu,

68
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,542
Tae-kyu.

69
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,708
Come to me,

70
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,917
Come on..

71
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,500
Come on..

72
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,292
I am so sorry...

73
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,958
I love you so much,

74
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:24,500
You are the apple of my eye.

75
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:29,417
You have been so angry at me.

76
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,667
I didn't mean it,

77
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,958
I was so afraid of being alone.

78
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,708
You don't have to worry about that..

79
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,333
I won't leave you

80
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,792
I'll behave..

81
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,833
What a nice day!

82
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,792
Tae-Kyu,.

83
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,042
Can we go out and get some fresh sir?

84
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:45,708
Really?

85
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,458
Am I being a troublemaker?

86
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,458
Ah...

87
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,625
When are you gonna stop working?

88
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,833
You told me not to work with guys.

89
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,166
I will work my ass off with old women

90
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,917
until all guys disappear in this world.

91
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,125
Give it up,

92
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,667
I will send my paycheck
from the military.

93
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:47,124
Buy some meat with your first paycheck.

94
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,333
Meat? Let's eat meat today.

95
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,207
Why did you keep peeping out
of the fridge,

96
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,375
You looked so suspicious.

97
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:37,333
I ain't a thief,

98
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,875
I don't steal nothing.

99
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:05,667
Stop bugging me,

100
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,542
what a jerk!

101
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:10,875
When are you gonna give us money?

102
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,832
I will tell your father,
Fuck off, you son of a bitch.

103
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,792
Stop taking advantage of my shortcoming.

104
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,624
No matter how hard you threat,

105
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,958
I won' give you pennies.

106
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:39,625
If you dare,

107
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,625
cut yourself now,

108
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,583
come on..

109
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,542
Come on!

110
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,958
I don't want this,

111
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,833
give me some money.

112
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,500
Is it Yong-jun?

113
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,167
That son of a bitch is every where,
Yong-jun.

114
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,000
Yong-jun..

115
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,667
Take it,

116
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,042
Take it, take it,

117
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,667
You are driving me crazy.

118
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,208
Hey, you still take care of him,
don't you?

119
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,624
You have been here for 2 years,

120
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,208
All you change is your way of speaking.

121
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:03,291
You are still poor
as you used to be in North Korea.

122
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:08,000
Look at me, I look like a typical Korean.

123
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,667
So what?

124
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,333
So what?

125
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,958
Watch your mouth,

126
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,582
Dial this number right now.

127
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,957
You like meat?

128
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,582
I will make you eat meat every night..

129
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,583
Call now.

130
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,833
Wow..

131
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,417
It looks yummy.

132
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,208
Come and join us.

133
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,583
Eat it,

134
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,125
You must eat mine,

135
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,666
Don't even think about cheating,

136
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:04,958
I will kill you.

137
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,625
When do you think
KIM jong-un kick the bucket?

138
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,166
In 40 years.

139
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,000
Fucking 40 years.

140
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,750
What if the war breaks out
while I am in the military?

141
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,124
KIM jong-un is not as crazy as you think.

142
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,666
They have nuclear bombs.
They are much stronger than us.

143
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:48,082
Have you seen his bear belly?　-Yes.

144
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,541
He wants to live life as emperor,

145
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,832
By the way, We got Obama.

146
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,041
Oh, Obama.

147
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,874
So The war never break out.

148
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,875
If South Korea versus North Korea
without USA, which one wins?

149
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,458
North Korea!

150
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,417
How come you are so sure of it?

151
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:11,625
North Korean are very submissive,

152
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:15,583
they will do everything
what Kim jong-un ask.

153
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:21,083
They even slit their wrist
if they are ordered.

154
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,708
They have nothing to lose.

155
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:49,000
What took you so long?

156
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,333
Why don't you go to barber shop.

157
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,083
No, you should do it.

158
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,167
Ah...

159
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,708
There is no time for this shit. Hurry up!

160
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,875
Ah...

161
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:57,833
I will feed you every day,

162
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,083
so don't go any where.

163
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,417
Yong-joon, hurry up,

164
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,208
Let's go.

165
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,583
You son of a bitch,
Let me scoop your eyes out.

166
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,332
Keep your eyes open, you bastards.

167
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:50,000
Keep your eyes open,
I will burn your eyes.

168
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,458
Stay away from Tae-kyu.

169
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,042
Give me some money you owe.

170
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,625
Are you okay?

171
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,083
He was here for me,

172
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,375
Am I being troublemaker?

173
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:36,625
Don't worry,

174
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:42,292
I will cure your eye.

175
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:54,375
I am on my way to the military.

176
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,250
Yong-joon, It's a nice day.

177
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:58,792
Look at that mountain behind,

178
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:03,792
I will stay there with a bunch of guys
for 2 years.

179
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:07,083
They may like me, you must be jealous,

180
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:12,458
Look at my hair,

181
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,457
It's pretty short.

182
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:18,792
I look like a skinhead.

183
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:24,042
Can you see that drafts,

184
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:29,042
It's 1.7km from here,

185
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:31,374
I am fucked up.

186
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:35,250
KIM Jong-un is a pain in the ass.

187
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:39,500
That son of a bitch
made my life miserable.

188
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:41,957
Do you agree with that?

189
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:44,917
He is the one who brought me here.

190
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,500
That piggy jerk!

191
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:53,833
Are you gonna see someone else
while I am in the military?

192
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:57,042
If you do,
I will find one in the military,

193
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:02,583
Tell me now,
I will look for good looking boys.

194
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,250
I was kidding, don't be mad at me.

195
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,750
Where are you going?

196
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,249
Hey, KIM Yong-joon, Look at my hair,

197
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,792
Do I look still handsome?

198
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:13,749
You should be thankful to

199
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,750
have a good looking boyfriend like me.

200
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:22,375
Don't even try to cheat on me.

201
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,583
My heart belongs to you.

202
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:40,917
I will be on vacation soon.
Please wait for me.

203
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:46,500
I will become mature in the military.

204
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,917
As soon as I get discharged,

205
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,167
I will get part time job.

206
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,667
How is it going?

207
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,792
How long should I wait?

208
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:14,625
You got a text massage, give me money.

209
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:24,542
What a loser?

210
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:32,417
My life with one eye
is not as miserable as you think.

211
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:38,791
Hello, hey pop, I got money,

212
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,999
I will get some toothpaste and shampoo

213
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,625
on my way home.

214
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,333
Give me some money.

215
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,958
I am under stress because of you.

216
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:02,375
I need to get rid of my stress
at karaoke.

217
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:04,625
Get me some money.

218
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:12,500
You are way worse than KIM Jong-un.

219
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:16,333
Cut the crap.

220
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,250
Give me some money, you son of a bitch!

221
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,792
You never steal? Give me a break.

222
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:53,458
You got a call from errand center
or what?

223
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,292
Ah...

224
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,375
Yong-joon,

225
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,042
Yong-joon,

226
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,083
It has been a long time since you left.

227
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:12,750
Here we go,

228
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:30,792
Aren't you curious?

229
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,000
How I came,

230
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:40,833
why I came something like that?

231
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:47,000
Every year more than 2000
fucking North Koreans

232
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,000
come to South Korea for freedom

233
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:55,583
like you.

234
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,750
There are more than 2000
Fucking North Koreans

235
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:06,417
who come to this tiny fucking country.

236
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:13,125
Your Korean is awesome, no accent at all.

237
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:05,458
I don't need you any more,

238
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:07,500
Get the fuck out of my face,

239
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,958
Listen up!

240
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,875
Don't say a word,

241
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,875
You never listen what I say.

242
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:28,958
Why should I hear what you say?

243
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,958
Today is closed, go home.

244
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:12,708
I am desperate, Please...

245
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:45,958
Yong-Joon..

246
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:56,708
Can you show me Seoul?

247
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:02,833
You got money?

248
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,291
Give some.

249
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:07,958
Give me one million.

250
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:16,042
If don't, shut your mouth.

251
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:50,000
Northern, if you go this way,
Gangnam is over there,

252
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:58,333
If you want to go shopping,

253
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:37,375
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

254
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:44,708
What is your relationship?

255
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:52,833
Hey, you, are you with me?

256
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:07,792
Do you like boys and girls?

257
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:17,667
Which gender do you like?

258
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:25,000
Are you fucking deaf or what?

259
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:40,333
Yong-joon,

260
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,750
Have you washed yourself?

261
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,958
Let me wash your body.

262
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:55,000
Who the fuck is he?

263
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:00,833
Who is he?

264
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,542
Are you cheating on me?

265
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:11,958
He is just my buddy,

266
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,917
he even got married.

267
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:23,917
Why did you get rained?
You will catch a cold.

268
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,458
Here we go, water,

269
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:42,333
hey, bro, where is your wife?

270
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:50,625
She... is in North Korea,

271
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,583
North Korea? What...

272
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:01,958
Are you from North Korea?

273
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:18,917
Is your buddy from North Korea?

274
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:22,208
How did you get to know that buddy?

275
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:30,624
When I was young, I studied in China.

276
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:32,042
China?

277
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,542
Yes...

278
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:40,333
I didn't know that.

279
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:45,250
I'm just going to head out for a bit..

280
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:01,958
Oh, boy!

281
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:05,500
Let me see...

282
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,833
I got something for you.

283
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:12,542
Take a look at it.

284
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:19,500
You don't want to send your boyfriend
to jail,

285
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:20,832
do you?

286
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:23,542
Read it carefully..

287
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,750
Why? What the fuck are you gawking at me?

288
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:37,042
Hit me,

289
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,583
if you dare.

290
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:14,917
Leave the door closed.

291
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:19,958
I am very anxious.

292
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:37,500
Aren't you hungry?

293
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:46,167
Let me buy you breakfast.

294
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:54,250
How long have you been together
with Yong-joon?

295
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:57,708
Why asking?

296
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:03,333
I heard you guys are best buddies.

297
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:05,542
Tell me.

298
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:06,791
What?

299
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:09,250
How did you meet Yong-joon in China?

300
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,583
Where did you meet him?

301
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:18,917
I met him in Yanji, how about you?

302
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:20,292
What?

303
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:23,542
How long have you guys been together?

304
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:31,208
834 days.

305
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,125
You guys must be very close.

306
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,333
I am so bitchy.

307
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:44,333
So, I got no money, no friend, no family.

308
00:51:44,792 --> 00:51:45,958
So what?

309
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:50,750
I don't need anything.

310
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,958
All I need is Yong-joon.

311
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:11,708
Let me ask you something.

312
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:13,250
What?

313
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,167
If South Korea versus North Korea,
which ones win?

314
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:39,167
North Koreans obey an order

315
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,375
no matter what KIM jong-un ask,

316
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:47,333
He can control mental world

317
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:56,625
and manipulate people.

318
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,542
Why?

319
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:06,542
I was just curious.

320
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:19,500
Can I ask you some favor?

321
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:34,083
Bro, please don't tell Yong-joon.

322
00:53:58,708 --> 00:53:59,957
Fuck!

323
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:01,583
Do you always play like this?

324
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:02,958
What the heck?

325
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:05,707
I was a sniper in the military.

326
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:06,958
So what?

327
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,792
I just shot for fun.

328
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,875
For fun?

329
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:20,250
Your playing around
is really getting out of hand,

330
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:29,375
The one eyed
is not as miserable as you think.

331
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:15,958
That bastard is your buddy?

332
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:20,250
Let me ask you something.　-Go ahead.

333
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,583
What happened to your son's eye?

334
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:28,125
Don't you have a clue?

335
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:32,208
Don't bother my buddy any more.

336
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:37,042
Bother?

337
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,707
My son is a victim.

338
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:43,833
I don't care who is victim,
You son of a bitch,

339
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,458
If you bother my buddy,

340
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:51,958
I will kill you.

341
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:27,833
Are you mad at me?

342
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,250
Why did you come into my life?

343
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:58,167
You wanted to eat it, didn't you?

344
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:06,083
I don't want to eat it any more.

345
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:07,375
Good boy!

346
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,666
I know you are very scared of it,

347
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:15,875
Don't worry about it.
It's a piece of cake.

348
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:26,125
The demand for this job
exceeds the supply.

349
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:32,208
In capitalist system,
How do people call this job?

350
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:35,416
It's called Blue ocean.
What is blue ocean?

351
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:40,457
Have you been to the sea?
Half water half fish.

352
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:44,791
If you throw a net,
you can catch many fishes.

353
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:49,124
In capitalist system,
you and I will rake in the dough.

354
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,250
Making money is a piece of cake.

355
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:20,750
Woo, it's meat. It looks yummy.

356
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,957
Help yourself.

357
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:27,333
Okay.

358
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:33,542
Bro, come and join us.

359
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:49,042
Eat it.

360
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:52,125
Why not?

361
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:27,583
Do you miss your wife?

362
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:31,707
Wife?

363
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:34,792
Your wife in North Korea.

364
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:39,500
I missed... her so much.

365
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:42,833
I missed...

366
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:48,125
I really wanted to see that person.

367
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,375
I am not sure of how that person feels...

368
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:06,874
Let's toast,

369
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:12,625
One two, three,

370
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:57,375
From now on.

371
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,667
Live and let live.

372
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:31,625
Aren't you sleeping?

373
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:25,667
Don't take it seriously,

374
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:30,500
you are just one of customers.

375
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:26,292
Let me ask you something.

376
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,833
I got to go.

377
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:38,167
Are you gonna be late?

378
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:42,500
Can we have dinner together?

379
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,208
What are you wearing?

380
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:17,792
I like it, Your Military uniform

381
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:21,375
is way better than North Korea's uniform.

382
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:25,417
Take off my military uniform.

383
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:33,833
Can you show me Seoul?

384
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:51,458
How amazing Chosun Dynasty!

385
01:12:53,792 --> 01:12:55,292
What are you talking about?

386
01:12:55,417 --> 01:13:00,750
After the liberation,
Korea is divided into north and south.

387
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:06,292
How did Chosun Dynasty last
for 600 years?

388
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:15,500
If we were in Chosun Dynasty,
We would see each other.

389
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:21,708
Why did you meet Tae-kyu?

390
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:29,875
Do you know why I met you in North Korea?

391
01:13:32,167 --> 01:13:37,125
We didn't do anything by our own will.

392
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:41,042
That's why we met.

393
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:48,750
I don't need anyone who help me out.

394
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:57,375
All I need is someone
who can share sorrow

395
01:13:58,083 --> 01:14:03,625
and go through obstacle together,

396
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:11,083
Tae-kyu replaced your position.

397
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:16,167
I don't need your help.

398
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,167
Yong-joon.

399
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:33,375
Don't work too late,

400
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,750
take care of yourself.

401
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,708
What the hell are you doing?

402
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:29,542
I said, what are you doing?

403
01:15:34,792 --> 01:15:37,375
Don't touch my stuff.

404
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:42,750
You don't touch my stuff either.

405
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:45,125
What the hell?

406
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:54,000
I told you not to touch my stuff.

407
01:15:55,167 --> 01:15:57,333
What the hell are you talking about?

408
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:28,417
I saw flyers,

409
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,000
where should I go?

410
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:31,042
Have you lived like this?

411
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:39,083
You came all the way from North Korea
fucking like this.

412
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:43,750
Live and let live?

413
01:17:44,917 --> 01:17:46,625
We need money.

414
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:51,167
Let go of my hand,

415
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,333
I got to go buy meat.

416
01:18:59,792 --> 01:19:02,417
What the fuck!

417
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:05,167
You son of a bitch,

418
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,208
you gave Yong-joon a hard time.

419
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:11,791
- What the fuck are you taking about?
- I will do anything for Yong-joon.

420
01:19:11,792 --> 01:19:13,374
I will cut your throat.

421
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:16,082
You son of a bitch.

422
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:17,749
What the heck!

423
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,041
Yong-joon is in trouble because of you.

424
01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:21,125
Shut the fuck up!

425
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,499
Fuck!

426
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:28,042
Bro! You like boys, Don't you?

427
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:30,453
Get the fuck out of my house, Now,
you son of a bitch!

428
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:43,167
Shut the door!

429
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,583
Leave the door open.

430
01:20:51,667 --> 01:20:53,042
Jae-sung!

431
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,667
Jae-sung!

432
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,333
Jae-sung!

433
01:21:09,917 --> 01:21:11,333
Jae-sung!

434
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:36,375
I am going to return to force,
Don't go to work.

435
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:41,833
Don't leave me alone.

436
01:22:03,292 --> 01:22:04,542
Where's my money?

437
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,333
I gave it to you.　-What?

438
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,500
I gave you 10,000$.

439
01:22:12,042 --> 01:22:13,792
Who gave it to me?

440
01:22:14,792 --> 01:22:16,875
That fucking bastard?

441
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:19,500
You gave it to me, did you?

442
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:22,166
I got nothing in my pocket.

443
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,917
You can go now,

444
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:27,625
I will catch up with you.

445
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:42,750
All I need is money. Give some.

446
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:49,125
If I got money,
our son wouldn't wear an eye patch.

447
01:22:55,417 --> 01:22:57,625
You fucking pinko.

448
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:09,917
My patience is nearly expired.

449
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,583
I am giving you fucking lesson.
You son of a bitch.

450
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:55,375
Don't worry, they won't come back.

451
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:00,167
I will handle this.

452
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:08,292
How come you didn't tell me

453
01:24:10,917 --> 01:24:13,958
that you studied in China.

454
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:19,417
I felt blue

455
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:28,375
because I don't know about your secret.

456
01:24:33,958 --> 01:24:36,792
Don't leave it behind.

457
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,625
Tell me everything.

458
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,167
I got nothing to hide,

459
01:24:47,042 --> 01:24:48,500
Are you sure?

460
01:24:54,667 --> 01:24:56,250
How was China?

461
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:58,958
What?

462
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:05,957
Beijing was still shrouded by smog
on most days.

463
01:25:05,958 --> 01:25:08,125
The street was very foggy.

464
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:12,083
I really wanted to eat jajangmyeon

465
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:14,958
Beijing?

466
01:25:17,458 --> 01:25:19,624
Not Yanji.

467
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:23,750
I will get you some drink.

468
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:12,375
Are you still mad at me?

469
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:13,958
What do you want from me?

470
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:20,250
I just want to say good-bye.

471
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:27,042
Do you have any idea why people
stop coming to this amusement park?

472
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:34,000
If no one takes care of his dog,

473
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:36,750
dog will leave,

474
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:41,957
No one hasn't been taking care of his dog
for 2 years.

475
01:26:41,958 --> 01:26:43,917
That't why he left.

476
01:26:46,417 --> 01:26:51,750
All I need is someone who look after me.

477
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:57,875
It's not easy to eat Hamburger together

478
01:26:58,417 --> 01:27:02,292
neither North korea or South Korea.

479
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:06,750
When we were together in the military,

480
01:27:06,875 --> 01:27:09,208
you wanted to eat American hamburger.

481
01:27:10,667 --> 01:27:16,167
I thought you would come back to me.

482
01:27:16,958 --> 01:27:23,333
When you were gone, My life went to hell,

483
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:29,083
I was almost beaten to death.

484
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:34,292
I am coward in all ages.

485
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:45,750
I am out of your sight.

486
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:52,667
Where are you heading?

487
01:27:54,917 --> 01:27:58,167
I am going someplace where I am welcomed.

488
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:05,708
Where the Fuck are you going?

489
01:29:20,042 --> 01:29:21,167
Tae-kyu,

490
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:24,583
Tae-kyu,

491
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:56,292
Tae-kyu.

492
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:19,249
I didn't see anything.

493
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:23,208
Come and take me.

494
01:30:26,667 --> 01:30:28,833
I want you to come.

495
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,875
Don't leave.

496
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:55,624
Yong-joon, Please, Don't leave!

497
01:30:55,625 --> 01:30:58,792
I am begging you. Stay with me.

498
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:02,417
Don't go. I am begging you.

499
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,958
Yong-jun, Yong-jun,
Please don't leave me alone,

500
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:12,583
Please...

501
01:34:47,417 --> 01:34:52,166
You can see that "E" is prounced
with much stress.

502
01:34:52,167 --> 01:34:55,791
That's why people say "E" gi yo'
or "E mart".

503
01:34:55,792 --> 01:34:58,666
Then how should we pronounce
this "e" sound?

504
01:34:58,667 --> 01:35:02,332
Relax your lips, lower your tone

505
01:35:02,333 --> 01:35:08,332
and allow the sound
to flow past your vocal cords.

506
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:12,750
Make a short "e" sound.

507
01:35:19,292 --> 01:35:20,582
E mart.

508
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:21,833
E mart.

509
01:35:22,208 --> 01:35:23,667
E mart.

510
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:32,125
E mart.

511
01:35:33,458 --> 01:35:34,625
Intonation.

512
01:35:35,958 --> 01:35:37,042
SK

513
01:35:38,125 --> 01:35:39,250
500 won.

514
01:35:40,417 --> 01:35:41,833
Induckwon

515
01:35:43,083 --> 01:35:45,083
2 squared

516
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:49,167
2 squared

517
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:52,583
2... squared
