1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,000
   

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:24,060



3
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,420
   

4
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,000
   

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,016
   

6
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,540
   

7
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:25,769
 The hefty chick would make killer soup.  
    

8
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,540
 Chubby, we've got plenty to eat. 

9
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,720
 No need for extra food. 

10
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,040
Who said it's just food?

11
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,360
It's my soulmate, my life-saving energy boost,

12
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,200
and the lighthouse in the chaos of life.

13
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,300
If it had a phone, I'd add it to my group chat.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,260
Cao Yan Hua, where's Yan Hong Sha?

15
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,400
Still wandering, I guess.

16
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,620
Then, hop in the car first.

17
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,680
We're making a quick stop at the station.

18
00:01:58,764 --> 00:02:00,100
I promised my family.

19
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,220
I'll stay with them for a few days.

20
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,260
Just got the call. My master's seriously ill.

21
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,020
You're my disciple. You need her blessing to join the sect.

22
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,100
- I'll go. 
 - Go, go, go!

23
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,920
Finally, I got some breathing room.

24
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,420
Didn't see this coming.

25
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,496
New rules from the Railway Ministry.

26
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:39,180
No live poultry on trains.

27
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,560
You and Thirteen will have rough days.

28
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,340
Hey, lucky you!

29
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,800
Cao Yan Hua!  You...

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,680
- Listen to me, okay? 
 - No. I'm leaving.

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,420
I haven't even named it yet. So don't just call it anything.

32
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,680
It'll be hard to change later.

33
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,820
It's so pretty.

34
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,540
I'm sorry. I can't come to visit your master.

35
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,300
We're about to part. Give me a hug?

36
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:20,636
♫  Whenever memories whisper silently  ♫

37
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:24,460
♫  Our eyes meet, fighting back tears  ♫

38
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,520

If someone really comes at you, react fast and hit hard.

52
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,740
Don't you dare get hurt, got it?

Stay safe on the road, alright?

72

♫  I just want to slowly, slowly hold you tight  ♫

73
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,260
Master, have a sip.

74
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,220
No. You drink it.

75
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,340
Wait. What's with that look?

76
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:29,138
What's wrong?

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,460
Nothing.

78
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,500
I know you all look down on me.

79
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,080
Master... Honestly, you're letting me come along. I'm really happy.

80
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,852
With my background, I never thought I would be accepted into your sect.

81
00:05:48,852 --> 00:05:50,997
Just seeing it and that's enough.

82
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:54,102
Wait. What "background" are you talking about?

83
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,180
Let's talk frankly.

84
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,000
I heard everything.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,344
My ancestors were on the bad side.

86
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:04,465
Ran with the Saturn Star Lord or something.

87
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,925
I'm descended from villains.

88
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,100
So what? Seriously, what era are we in?

89
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,380
Still judging people by bloodlines?

90
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,720
Whatever your ancestors did, how's that on you?

91
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,753
When evaluating someone, it matters what kind of person they are at heart.

92
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,313
Since when did bloodline become everything?

93
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,480
I mean, that sounds nice,

94
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,409
but if you guys really believed that, why'd you keep it from me?

95
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:31,155
It's all Luo Ren's fault. He worried you'd overthink it.

96
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:32,937
That's why he didn't tell you.

97
00:06:32,937 --> 00:06:36,077
 Luo Ren. Why didn't you tell Chubby? 

98
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:38,278
 Yes, why didn't you? 

99
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:41,419
 So what if his ancestors followed some Star Lord? 

100
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:43,941
 You don't actually suspect him, do you? 

101
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,177
 No. 

102
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:49,753
 I just didn't want it to trouble him and mess with his head. 

103
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:52,453
Turns out he was right.

104
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,800
I wasn't overthinking.

105
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,039
Really?

106
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,240
Luo Ren was overthinking.

107
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,660
He overthought that I would overthink.

108
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,980
So, he kept it from me, and then I actually did overthink it.

109
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,040
That's pretty much how it went, right?

110
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:15,831
Master. You think I've got a shot at becoming a disciple?

111
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:18,464
What does Grandmaster usually look for in disciples?

112
00:07:18,464 --> 00:07:20,840
Good character? Good look?

113
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,320
Horoscope compatibility or something?

114
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,540
She probably values fate more than anything.

115
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,147
Fate?

116
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,108
 This was about eight years ago. 

117
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:32,300
 I had a friend, Wen Wen. 

118
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,950
 She had an accident. 

119
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,380
 It hit me pretty hard. 

120
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,640
 Then, Auntie Hong told me to go to the temple and listen to the chants. 

121
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,280
 And while I was there, I ran into the Master, who was visiting Lixi. 

122
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,659
 Holy Bodhisattva, I dreamt of Wen again last night. 

123
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:55,079
 She didn't blame me at all. 

124
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,540
 But my heart still hurts so much. 

125
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:07,715
 If only I knew martial arts back then, 

126
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,120
 maybe I could've protected her. 

127
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
 Sorry. 

128
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,750
   

129
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,040
 Hey, young lady. 

130
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:06,116
 Just now, you said you wanted to learn martial arts. 

131
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:07,936
 Why's that? 

132
00:09:09,502 --> 00:09:12,322
 My best friend was killed by some bad people. 

133
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:17,925
 If I'd known martial arts at the time, I could've protected her. 

134
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,726
 And now? 

135
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,746
 Do you still want to learn? 

136
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,427
 Yes. 

137
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:31,774
 Back then, I felt that Master was warm and kind, 

138
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:34,827
 just like Auntie Hong. 

139
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:38,090
 I felt so wronged deep down, 

140
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,420
 even though I didn't know why. 

141
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,060
 Then, I just poured my heart out to her, all of it. 

142
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,540
A-And you became her disciple?

143
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,860
That's just... You've got insane luck, you know that?

144
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,241
People say the ancestors bless you with opportunities.

145
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:55,627
But look at you! It wasn't just an opportunity.

146
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,988
It's like you were the chosen one!

147
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:00,660
She had been wanting to take on a final disciple.

148
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,870
She saw me crying and begging to learn martial arts.

149
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,180
And she just happened to be ready to teach.

150
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,560
What a coincidence!

151
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,700
That's what we call fate.

152
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:16,514
Master, that means you really were the destined one.

153
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:18,335
I may not have it.

154
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:19,938
Of course, you had it!

155
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:22,915
Let me ask you this. Did you ever want to buy a pheasant before?

156
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,376
What would I want that for?

157
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,315
I just wanted to eat some chicken.

158
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:30,676
Then, why did you want to buy a pheasant today, and actually buy one?

159
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:32,347
Yes.

160
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:33,588
I honestly didn't know.

161
00:10:33,588 --> 00:10:38,320
 Guess I was in that mood at that place and that moment. 

162
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,180
I looked into its eyes, and I knew I had to buy it.

163
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,300
That one.

164
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,027
This right here is fate.

165
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:47,667
You get what I mean?

166
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:51,050
I think I might have a little fate.

167
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,701
So... what if my fate's kinda weak?

168
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:55,422
Like, I only have a bond with this little creature,

169
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,603
and maybe not with a master.

170
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:59,604
No, you do have it with a master too!

171
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:05,502
If you don't, would we be on our way to see my master right now?

172
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,500
You... You have a way with words.

173
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,800
I got myself trapped before.

174
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,260
Impressive. Really impressive.

175
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,840
You want it to ride with us the whole way?

176
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,762
If you want it to fly alongside outside, I don't mind if it can keep up.

177
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:42,157
Or just tie it to the roof?

178
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:44,918
Imagine how cool that'd look at highway speed.

179
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:46,878
Super Chicken Car!

180
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,640
That's hilarious.

181
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,441
Maybe later we can find a place and get it a cage.

182
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:56,580
Put it in the trunk, yes?

183
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,600
No worries. I like holding it anyway.

184
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,860
 Hey, Aoki. 

185
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,980
 I'm on my way now. I'll meet you tomorrow night. 

186
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,245
Plans changed. I'm in Lixi.

187
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:10,940
 We need to move Ping Ting and Uncle Zheng quickly. 

188
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,525
Tell them I'm one of them.

189
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,265
Why?

190
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,180
Leopard has crossed the border.

191
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,760
You okay, chick?

192
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,780
What's going on, Luo Ren?

193
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,140
You scared it right out of its nap!

194
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,760
Wait up for me, okay?

195
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,160
Is the intel solid?

196
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,100
- She really crossed the border? 
 - Absolutely.

197
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,940
She's got multiple passports and used one of them.

198
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,980
 I know you're out of town. 

199
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,940
I'll take care of your family for you. Don't worry about it.

200
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,500
Where is she now? Can you track her down?

201
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,800
I'll try my best.

202
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
She just crossed the border. She probably won't make any big moves.

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,600
 But sooner or later, she'll come for you. 

204
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,160
 After all, you blinded one of her eyes. 

205
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,560
Maybe it's better that way. Save us the trouble of searching all over for her.

206
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,840
I'll update you if I hear anything.

207
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,480
By the way. Keep your little lamb in check.

208
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,740
What do you mean?

209
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,960
 Find a way to hide your girlfriend. 

210
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,440
 Don't give Leopard a chance to use her against us. 

211
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,480
Peanuts, sunflower seeds, and fresh fruit!

212
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,500
Anyone want some?

213
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,380
- Sorry for waking you. 
 - Peanuts!

214
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,440
- Hey! 
 -  Mu Dai, what's your next stop? 

215
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,000
Next stop?

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,540
Nanping Mountain stop. Why?

217
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,520
Just get off there.

218
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,080
I'll come to pick you up.

219
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
I need to talk to you.

220
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,505
 Tell Chubby to go ahead. 

221
00:13:56,505 --> 00:14:00,440
We'll meet up at the last stop.

222
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,000
Hong Sha and the others are back in Lixi.

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,380
No live poultry on the bus.

224
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,021
So, we got a separate car for it.

225
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:16,581
Chubby's chicken is costing a fortune.

226
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,020
You're coming back with me to Yun Ridge.

227
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,200
What about your business?

228
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,840
That has been postponed.

229
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,640
All right then.

230
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,620
Let's go see your master.

231
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,340
How do you like this outfit?

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,440
Nice outfit.

233
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,940
As for the person, it's barely okay.

234
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,960
So, what is it you want to say?

235
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,940
Let me tell you something about my past.

236
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,000
Back then I had a falling out with my family.

237
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,760
I ran off abroad.

238
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,725
 After bouncing around, I ended up in Heisha. 

239
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:08,160
 You know Heisha. It's pretty rough there. 

240
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,640
 If you can survive there,
you can stay here forever. 

241
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,520
   

242
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,320
 Come on, you lazybones! Move it! 

243
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,560
 At first, I didn't know my way around. 

244
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,180
 I had to do tough manual labor to get by. 

245
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,740
 The boss knew I had no connections. 

246
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,680
 He always shortchanged me 

247
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,320
 and gave me the hardest, dirtiest jobs. 

248
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,640
 The constant exhaustion and poor nutrition finally made me sick. 

249
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,080
 I was supposed to come home then. 

250
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,960
 But I held it in. 

251
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,440
 I was scared my father would just laugh at me. 

252
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,380
 Later, someone got me into fighting. 

253
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,260
Fighting? Like boxing matches?

254
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,540
Ever seen cockfighting?

255
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,200
 People bet on the fights. 

256
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,680
 You fight in the ring with your life on the line. 

257
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,460
So, you took some serious beatings, huh?

258
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,160
I learned a lot of fighting moves, but still got hit plenty.

259
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,620
 The underground fights pay well. 

260
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,685
 So, even if I broke an arm or leg, it was worth it. 

261
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,506
 But I always had my limits. 

262
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:22,187
 I never fought to kill. 

263
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:24,688
 What's "fighting to kill"? 

264
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:31,533
 It means you have to kill someone in the ring to end the match. 

265
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:36,128
 But this makes the stakes even higher. 

266
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,760
 The promoters make double the money. 

267
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,960
 Anyway, I pissed off the promoters. 

268
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,400
 They drugged me and bet on me to get killed. 

269
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,080
 He won! 

270
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,680
 It was pure luck. 

271
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:12,180
 That day, Aoki and Yuris came to the fight club to recruit security staff. 

272
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,800
 Stand up! Stand up! 

273
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,040
 They're doing security work for an international hotel, 

274
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,980
protecting the guests, and the hotel's property.

275
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,780
Aoki...

276
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,700
invited me to join.

277
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,160
Sounds like a good deal.

278
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,540
Yes.

279
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,840
In a place that dangerous, having a steady job feels pretty good.

280
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,420
So, I agreed to join.

281
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,680
Pretty soon, I had a great group of teammates.

282
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,680
 We'd often train and spar at the jungle camp. 

283
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,640
 Even our downtime was pretty nice. 

284
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,049
Eat more. There's a long night ahead.

285
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,809
We'll reach Yun Ridge by tomorrow afternoon.

286
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,680
Mister, buy this pretty lady a rose, please?

287
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,960
She's so beautiful.

288
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,020
Five yuan a rose.

289
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,380
No thanks, really.

290
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,840
Come on, just one flower. Only five yuan.

291
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,700
I bet this lady would love it.

292
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,900
Here's the money.

293
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,340
The flower...

294
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,700
No, thanks.

295
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,260
Why don't you ask me why I didn't buy a rose?

296
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,320
You'd tell me anyway.

297
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,100
After joining security, we stayed at the base.

298
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,480
It facilitates daily training.

299
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,240
 The closest bar to the jungle is called Tipsy. 

300
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,400
 We often went there to grab a drink. 

301
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,480
 Luo, there are some pretty girls over there. 

302
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,760
 Let's have a drink with them later. 

303
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
 Luo, Luo. 

304
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,900
 Luo! There's a special beauty. 

305
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,080
 You're going to like her. 

306
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,180
 - She's your type. 
 - Where? 

307
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,520
 Over there. 

308
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,400
 - Where? 
 - Right there. 

309
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,180
What kind of pretty girl was it that you "were going to" like?

310
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,560
Someone's jealous.

311
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,680
 Look at her, dressed so fancy. 

312
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,180
 She's way out of our league. 

313
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,640
 I think so too. 

314
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,201
 People like her are off limits. 

315
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:40,258
 Yuris, be careful not to risk your life. 

316
00:20:40,258 --> 00:20:41,719
 It doesn't concern me. 

317
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:44,720
 I already got mine anyway. 

318
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,420
 You should give it a shot too. 

319
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,140
 Hurry up. 

320
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,180
 The fight's about to start. Let's go, move! 

321
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,700
 Don't you get tired of always scowling? 

322
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
 Smile for once. 

323
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,060
 Hey there. 

324
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,265
 Hey. 

325
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:34,369
 Not going to buy me a drink? 

326
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,140
 You don't seem like the type who needs someone to buy your drinks. 

327
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,585
 I feel pretty good about how I look today. 

328
00:21:55,585 --> 00:22:00,690
 I even made a bet with my friends that I'd get hit on a lot tonight. 

329
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,716
 But no one even noticed me. 

330
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:06,056
 Guess the dancers are way more popular. 

331
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,280
 That's because you're dressed too formally. 

332
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,960
 - If... 
 - Handsome boy! 

333
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,792
 - Okay, give it to me. 
 - If you dressed like her... 

334
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,850
 - You'd get way more attention. 
 - Thanks. 

335
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,180
 - Hey, hi. 
 - Hi. 

336
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,922
 Can I borrow your clothes? 

337
00:22:21,922 --> 00:22:23,940
 My clothes? 

338
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,740
 Yes, I'll give you my jewelry. 

339
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,340
 No. I can't. 

340
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,240
 These are real diamonds. 

341
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,380
 - No, I can't take it. 
 - No, no! Just take them. 

342
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,920
 Let me just borrow your clothes, okay? 

343
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,560
 - Really? 
 - Yes. 

344
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,580
 Here, this is yours. 

345
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,460
 Come here. 

346
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,660
 Fine. 

347
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,260
 - Let's go. 
 - Okay. 

348
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,540
 Go. 

349
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,260
 Wait for me. 

350
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,000
 Hey man, how's it going? 

351
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,600
 - Cheers! 
 - Cheers! 

352
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,360
 Cheers! 

353
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,720
 Let's go. 

354
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,565
 Miss, may I buy you a drink? 

355
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,285
 I only drink with him. 

356
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,177
 Is it okay now? 

357
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,940
 Do I look good? 

358
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:42,620
 I should be the one buying you a drink. 

359
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,000
 You can give me something else. 

360
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,845
 Drink up. 

361
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:06,946
You don't mean to say you didn't give me roses

362
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:11,931
because you gave roses to an unforgettable pretty girl before, do you?

363
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,340
Do the roses come with a steel stamp?

364
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,020
Why could she accept them, but I couldn't?

365
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,060
I'm not done yet.

366
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,320
That day, everyone was drinking and having fun.

367
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,180
 I wanted to help her get her jewelry back. 

368
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,121
 Is Nina still inside? 

369
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:33,821
 I don't know. 

370
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,261
She's dead?

371
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:50,041
Her name was Nina.

372
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,640
Her husband was an alcoholic.

373
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,500
She supported the whole family all by herself.

374
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,220
She had a daughter.

375
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,780
She once asked me how much it would cost to get her daughter out of Heisha.

376
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,660
She wanted her daughter to go somewhere safe.

377
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,840
To study.

378
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,340
To learn in a school.

379
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,080
She didn't want her daughter

380
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,383
stuck in a hopeless swamp like she was.

381
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:23,603
The one who killed her

382
00:25:24,596 --> 00:25:26,476
was Leopard.

383
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,081
You thought Leopard was just some innocent girl

384
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:42,860
who traded her own jewelry for a plain dress, right?

385
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,346
She's the heiress to Heisha's crime family.

386
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:52,053
Whatever she wants, she just takes.

387
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:54,410
No need to trade.

388
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,697
In her eyes,

389
00:25:56,697 --> 00:26:01,757
it was bold for a mere nightclub dancer to take her stuff.

390
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:05,000
I was the one who got Nina killed.

391
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,200
If I hadn't told Leopard to change clothes,

392
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,800
Nina would still be alive.

393
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:17,922
Luo Ren.

394
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:21,386
I'm fine.

395
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:24,199
I'm tired.

396
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:27,285
You should get some sleep first.

397
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,620
Leopard is the third-gen heir to the family.

398
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,466
She's wildly ambitious.

399
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,620
She's hell-bent on ruling Heisha.

400
00:27:51,954 --> 00:27:54,874
She tried to buy our hotel, but we refused.

401
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,632
 That pissed her off. 

402
00:27:58,632 --> 00:28:01,710
 So, she sent thugs to attack us 

403
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,010
 and swore to wipe all of us off. 

404
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:08,165
That woman is terrifying.

405
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,545
 It was chaos that night. 

406
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:13,690
 We had no choice. 

407
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,550
 Get ready to retreat. 

408
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,340
I don't even know what I was thinking.

409
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,760
But I couldn't help but save Nina's daughter.

410
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,100
Maybe it's the fate between the two of you.

411
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,440
 I've never regretted saving her. 

412
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,380
 She's the sweetest little girl in the world. 

413
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,460
You know. She called me Daddy.

414
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:49,424
In that moment, I felt like the world softened.

415
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,280
 It was not safe for Tasha to stay with us. 

416
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,424
 After we lost the hotel, Leopard tried to force us to work for her. 

417
00:28:56,424 --> 00:28:57,688
 We said no. 

418
00:28:57,688 --> 00:29:00,888
 And saying no to her is dangerous. 

419
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,280
We sent Tasha to her uncle's, thought she'd be safe there.

420
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,920
But that scoundrel was blinded by greed.

421
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,700
He sold Tasha to Leopard.

422
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,840
What happened then?

423
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,660
 Leopard called me and said we humiliated her. 

424
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,460
 She set up a fight for me. 

425
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,760
 She bet on me to win. 

426
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,247
 If I helped her win money and made her happy, 

427
00:29:45,247 --> 00:29:47,527
 she'd give Tasha back. 

428
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:39,253
 Congrats. 

429
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,760
 I told you I don't take threats. 

430
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,740
 I told you he's not that honest. 

431
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,180
 He would definitely make a move. 

432
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,080
 I won this game. 

433
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,340
 I was stupid. 

434
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,582
 Of course, someone like her has decoys. 

435
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:21,802
She never bet on me to win.

436
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,060
Her real bet

437
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,320
was that I'd double-cross her.

438
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,680
So, did you get away?

439
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,940
She let me go.

440
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,800
Told me to go home.

441
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,760
And wait for her gift.

442
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
What gift?

443
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,600
 Tasha's hair clip. 

444
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,000
 It was soaked in blood. 

445
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,640
 I'm sorry. 

446
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,040
 Luo... 

447
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,420
 This isn't just your fight. 

448
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,000
 And I'm dying to test her bite. 

449
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,757
 Luo Ren, how could you not let me in on this? 

450
00:32:29,757 --> 00:32:31,498
 Leopard's that cruel. 

451
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:33,678
 I've hated her guts for ages. 

452
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,060
 How dare you say I can't drink? 

453
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,820
 Cheers! 

454
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,200
 Kill them except Luo.

473
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,500
What's going on?

474
00:36:20,604 --> 00:36:22,264
Chubby?

475
00:36:23,532 --> 00:36:25,313
Master! Luo!

476
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:27,061
What's happening here?

477
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:28,902
It's rough...

478
00:36:28,902 --> 00:36:33,988
Master. Even though I'm here and I still don't know who our sect's examiner is,

479
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:38,680
you and Grandmaster must've seen how well I've done.

480
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,901
I passed the trial, right?

481
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:43,681
 Is that from Luo? 

482
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,635
 Well... 

483
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:48,979
 I'm getting off at the next stop. 

484
00:36:48,979 --> 00:36:50,564
 You ride it all the way to Yun Ridge. 

485
00:36:50,564 --> 00:36:52,685
 We'll pick you up once you're there. 

486
00:36:52,685 --> 00:36:54,325
 Wait, what for? 

487
00:36:57,594 --> 00:36:59,995
 It's part of your trial. 

488
00:36:59,995 --> 00:37:01,695
 A trial? 

489
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:37,747
 You two can only swap it. 

490
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:41,988
 If you let me join you, the Three Shell Game will be more fun! 

491
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,841
 A pro, huh? 

492
00:37:46,905 --> 00:37:50,026
 Well, you want to join us? 

493
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:53,571
 If it were two years ago, maybe I'd have joined in. 

494
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:57,956
 But now, I only join righteous sects. 

495
00:37:57,956 --> 00:38:00,160
 Thieves! Officers! Him too! 

496
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,720
 - That one! 
 - Get down! 

497
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,780
 Train police! Over here! 

498
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,980
 Train police! 

499
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,810
Not bad!

500
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,971
Good job.

501
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:11,119
Oh, right. Thirteen-Thousand texted me.

502
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,980
He's getting to Lixi tonight.

503
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,506
He said my chick won't shut up, and he couldn't deal with it.

504
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:18,347
I'd better give it a name quickly.

505
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:20,347
Any suggestions?

506
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,514
Spicy Stir-fried Chicken!

507
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:26,775
- Hop in the car. 
 - Wait, that's a dish, not a name.

508
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,545
If you name it that, won't it get some kind of trauma?

509
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,348
It's a chicken. What else is it for?

510
00:38:33,348 --> 00:38:38,380
Naming it that is just a way to remind it to behave itself.

511
00:38:40,722 --> 00:38:42,500
Or how about Free Cao? What do you think?

512
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,760
Free Cao?

513
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,481
Same as me, you know?

514
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:47,762
I took some wrong turns before.

515
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:51,980
But thanks to you, I pulled back just in time and found my way again.

516
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,909
Now I'm free, my body, soul, everything.

517
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:56,509
Free.

518
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,760
I like it.

519
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,670
All right, that's the name then.

520
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,400
Brother Luo.

521
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,124
   

522
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:44,000



523
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,880
 'Palm Print' - An Qi 

524
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,360
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

525
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,820
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

526
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,040
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

527
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:28,520
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

528
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,100
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

529
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:40,560
♫  Every hand has two sides  ♫

530
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,420
♫  One offers blessings  ♫

531
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,629
♫  One waits in silence  ♫

532
00:40:46,629 --> 00:40:51,840
♫  There's no end to this game  ♫

533
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:58,240
♫  Following the traces left behind  ♫

534
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,860
♫  If you were me  ♫

535
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:08,240
♫  You'd understand every tear of mine  ♫

536
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:10,180
♫  (The reason they fall)  ♫

537
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,720
♫  If I were you  ♫

538
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,740
♫  I'd feel each breath you take  ♫

539
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,040
♫  Then we'd move forward  ♫

540
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,565
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

541
00:41:26,565 --> 00:41:30,900
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

542
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,260
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

543
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:42,120
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

544
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,262
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

545
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:49,800
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

546
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,120
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

547
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,525
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

548
00:41:58,525 --> 00:42:05,580
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

549
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,620
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

550
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,960
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

551
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,180
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫
