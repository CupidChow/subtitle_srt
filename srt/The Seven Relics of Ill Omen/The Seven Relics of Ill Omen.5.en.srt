5
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,770
I don't care what you are.

6
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,770
Stay put.

7
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,290
I'll get you sooner or later.

8
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,290
Pingting.

9
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:48,900
Here.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,820
Duckie.

11
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,050
It's fine.

12
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,740
You're saying the skin moved,

13
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,620
with a pattern on it?

14
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,930
Hard to say.

15
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,850
Just a flash. I didn't get a good look.

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,410
That sounds like

17
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,610
a parasite.

18
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,010
They are like some kind of parasite

19
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,850
and its host.

20
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,220
By the way,

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,170
Pingting was humming a song at the time.

22
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,380
Could there be a connection?

23
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,260
I...

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,940
I'll send you a video.

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,060
Just a moment.

26
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,410
Mr. Kun,

27
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,060
you're using a smartphone?

28
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,340
Which rule says I can't?

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,450
I'm not out of touch with the times.

30
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,850
Just didn't want to be bothered
by you guys, so...

31
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,570
This melody...

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,730
It's the song Pingting was humming.

33
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,220
And who are you?

34
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,170
That's Luo Ren.

35
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,450
I've mentioned him before.

36
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,500
Hello, Mr. Shen.

37
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,820
I'm Pingting's guardian

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,100
and also

39
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,010
a friend of Mu Dai's.

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,060
A friend of Pocketty's
is a friend of mine.

41
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,500
I compared many tunes
with the one Pingting sang.

42
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,850
That is not an ordinary tune.

43
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,540
More like a ritual chant from Lengquan

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,540
used to invoke deities.

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,980
Then why were Pingting

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,340
and my uncle humming it?

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,820
That part is unclear.

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,100
Needs more investigation.

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,890
Pocketty, Radishie,

50
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,290
keep working on it.

51
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,690
Call me if you find anything new.

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,690
If not,

53
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,730
don't.

54
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,730
Alright.

55
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,380
Radishie? Pocketty?

56
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,540
Just Mr. Shen's quirk.

57
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,450
No offense meant.

58
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,380
He mainly gives you a nickname

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,410
because he regards you as a friend.

60
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,540
It's a sign of approval.

61
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,980
And radishes

62
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,450
are nutritious.

63
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,380
In many regions,
they're called "earth ginseng".

64
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,340
He's basically saying
you're like ginseng.

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,730
Sorry

66
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,820
for splashing ginseng water
on your face.

67
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,450
Thank you.

68
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,220
Hey, Cao,

69
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,660
life is just beautiful.

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,290
Why the sigh?

71
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,540
You wouldn't understand the struggles
of chasing dreams.

72
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,540
They say the mountain will not come
to Muhammad,

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,780
then Muhammad must go to the mountain.

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,370
But now?

75
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,930
The problem has rolled away
on its own!

76
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,700
Xiaoshang River is so far from here.

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,700
And yet Mu Dai had to personally

78
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,850
deal with that Luo guy's mess.

79
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,850
If I'd been there,

80
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,250
I'd never have let her go alone.

81
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,490
At least someone
should've gone with her.

82
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,850
Unbelievable.

83
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,730
Poor thing.

84
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,780
Mr. Zhang,

85
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,020
have you ever been to Xiaoshang River?

86
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,050
No.

87
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,100
Good. You shouldn't.

88
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,100
Let me tell you,

89
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,100
that place is really dangerous.

90
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,370
No one should go there alone.

91
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,410
Oh? You've been?

92
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,170
Of course I have.

93
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,290
And that Luo Ren guy?

94
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,290
A holier-than-thou hypocrite.

95
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,900
Even Chubby

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,460
called him a stalker.

97
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,730
You'd trust someone like that?

98
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,810
Wait, really?

99
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,290
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

100
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,980
Because...

101
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,020
Look,

102
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,100
Lady Dai is stubborn.

103
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,290
No phone call's bringing her back.

104
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,490
So what do you do?

105
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,340
Must send a brave and resourceful person

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,810
to assist her immediately.

107
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,140
Mr. Zhang,

108
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,930
Madam Hong entrusted her to you.

109
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,540
If anything happens to her,

110
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,370
well,

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,220
you're responsible.

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,810
We do need to send someone reliable.

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,100
But who?

114
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,140
Would you stop hovering around me?

115
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,410
You're making me dizzy.

116
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,660
I see what's going on here.

117
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,220
You're just mooching off Mr. Zhang

118
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,410
to dodge work

119
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,610
and live the easy life.

120
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,780
Look,

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,730
it's normal for workers
to want to slack off a bit.

122
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,050
Don't tell me you want to work.

123
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,250
Seriously,

124
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,140
are you going to see Mu Dai?

125
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,730
Of course.

126
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,730
Why wouldn't I?

127
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,730
I'll just snap a few pics

128
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,780
and check in.

129
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,730
Hey,

130
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,900
why don't you come with me?

131
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,900
Why would I?

132
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,020
Mr. Zhang's only covering
your food and lodging.

133
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,020
No perks for me.

134
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,610
You could just

135
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,410
freeload off me.

136
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,810
You just need to
pay your own travel costs.

137
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,730
Oh, please.

138
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,780
You just don't want to go alone

139
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,730
and need a travel buddy.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,460
That's a vicious misreading.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,140
I have your best interests at heart.

142
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,100
Think about it.

143
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,780
You want to be her disciple, right?

144
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,170
If she won't come to you,

145
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,220
you go to her.

146
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,140
If she runs away,

147
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,610
you chase her.

148
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,370
Traveling all the way to Xiaoshang River

149
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,810
shows devotion.

150
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,140
Even the coldest one would be moved.

151
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:14,900
Go on.

152
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,170
Alright.

153
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,410
If that wretched woman

154
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,140
ends up in trouble,

155
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,290
and you swoop in

156
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,730
to save her,

157
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,700
what would she do?

158
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,100
She'd beg you

159
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,100
like, "Cao Yanhua,

160
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,220
you're a great disciple."

161

Thirteen-Thousand,

162
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,820
you know, you come off as very annoying

163
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,250
when you're saying these things,

164
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,940
but I have to admit,

165
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,610
you're a genius.

166
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,980
Let's go.

[Xiaoshang River Service Area]
[Motel]

168
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,610
You've got food all over your face.

169
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,610
Take your time.

170
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,850
Go eat.

171
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,010
I'll cover for you for a while.

172
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,060
You sure? You're still hurt.

173
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,010
Don't worry. I've rested well.

174
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,420
I'm mostly recovered.

175
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,530
Alright.

176
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,490
Your lips are chapped.

177
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,580
Haven't had enough water.

178
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,180
Don't lick them.

179
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,460
It'll only make it worse.

180
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,460
Drinking water won't help.

181
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,220
Is that so?

182
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,300
Do you have a lip balm?

183
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,860
I left in a hurry.

184
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,580
Use mine.

185
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,660
I'll buy you one later.

192
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,740
Mu Dai.

193
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,460
Come here.

194
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,580
Come and eat.

195
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,860
- Have a seat.
- Mr. Zheng.

196
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,060
Thank you.

197
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,620
Thank you.

198
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,420
You've helped us a lot these two days.

199
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,140
You have no idea

200
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,660
how chaotic it was before.

201
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,700
Luo Ren's upstairs.

202
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,940
He's watching Pingting eat.

203
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,540
They're so close.

204
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,940
Of course.

205
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,380
When Luo Ren first came
to the Luo family,

206
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,580
he was stubborn

207
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,780
and quiet.

208
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,860
But Pingting

209
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,740
stuck to him like a shadow.

210
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,540
Followed him everywhere.

211
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,420
Here, have some soup.

212
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

213
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,580
Later,

214
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,700
Luo Ren left and no longer lived here.

215
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,620
But

216
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,460
their bond stayed the same.

217
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,060
There was a time when his uncle and I

218
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,580
even tried to set them up.

219
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,540
Who would have thought

220
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,500
something like this would happen?

221
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,180
Setting them up?

222
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,700
But aren't they cousins?

223
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,140
Same surname, no blood relation.

224
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,180
Calling them cousins

225
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,100
was just out of habit.

226
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,380
Just out of habit.

227
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,980
Go on, eat.

228
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,580
What's wrong with you?

229
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,300
You're here to help, remember?

230
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,900
Luo Ren and Pingting

231
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,020
are a perfect match.

232
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,660
What's it to you?

233
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,980
Look at you.

234
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,540
Just do your job

235
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,220
and stop overthinking.

236
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,860
We're out of drinks. Stop looking.

237
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,900
That's a nice building.

238
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,540
Right?

239
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,940
Wait.

240
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,020
Hold on.

241
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,860
I think it's over there.

242
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,500
Keep going this way,
and we'll be off course.

243
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,700
See that arrow?

244
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,820
Right?

245
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,300
Yeah.

246
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,900
Any farther and we'll overshoot it.

247
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,020
Let's go.

248
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,140
This is it.

249
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,180
It has to be here.

250
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,020
I'll check in with Mr. Zhang.

251
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,860
There isn't even a doorbell.

252
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,060
I can't see.

253
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,260
Move a bit to the side.

254
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,060
A bit more.

255
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,820
See anything?

256
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,660
I see something.

257
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,460
Are we trespassing?

258
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,620
I haven't gone inside.

259
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,180
At most, it's peeking.

260
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,140
Fair point.

261
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,660
Any findings?

262
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,780
I don't see anything.

263
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,180
Are you blind?

264
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,620
There's a window boarded up with planks.

265
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,980
Boarded up?

266
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,220
Yeah.

267
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,060
And between the cracks, I see a woman!

268
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,700
Is that Mu Dai?

269
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,500
No.

270
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,580
Definitely not her.

271
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,700
Maybe she's one of those

272
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,980
imprisoned girls

273
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,900
from the movies?

274
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,500
Get down now.

275
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,260
Let's call the police.

276
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,900
No.

277
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,860
We haven't even gotten a clear look.

278
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,460
If this turns out to be nothing,

279
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,660
and Lady Dai is still inside,

280
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,660
you think you can ever be her disciple,

281
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,700
and I can get away with this?

282
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,700
That's true.

283
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,620
Keep observing, then.

284
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,260
Try to get some useful information.

285
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,660
I see that Hummer.

286
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,500
Duh, it's Luo Ren's.

287
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,220
Mu Dai.

288
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,060
In a minute.

289
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,060
What's wrong?

290
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,260
What else did you see?

291
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,780
If I'm not mistaken,

292
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,900
these two are from your bar, right?

293
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,860
I saw a surveillance camera too.

294
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,260
Make yourselves comfortable.

295
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,460
Here.

296
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,260
It's fine.

297
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,740
Have some water.

298
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,780
Out with it.

299
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,580
What are you two doing here?

300
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,580
Look, it's like this.

301
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,380
You've been gone for days.

302
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,500
We missed you terribly.

303
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,060
Please, let's respect
each other's intelligence.

304
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,060
Why beat around the bush?

305
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,980
Then you tell her.

306
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,180
Mr. Zhang is worried about you.

307
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,340
What's he worried about?

308
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,580
You're in an unfamiliar place,

309
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,860
far from home,

310
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,980
and with a guy we know nothing about.

311
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,500
He...

312
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,020
Well,

313
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,780
Mr. Zhang doesn't know you.

314
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,060
He only knows you're a man.

315
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,780
Well, she's a woman.

316
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,020
Of course, he'd be worried

317
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,980
if the two of you went out together.

318
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,540
Right.

319
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,860
I'll explain things

320
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,060
to Mr. Zhang.

321
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,860
You two

322
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,620
head back where you came from.

323
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,980
Don't get in the way here.

324
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,620
Come on.

325
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,180
We came all this way

326
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,340
- and haven't even had a sip of water.
- Ren

327
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,180
I just...

328
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,700
Hey, come on.

329
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,500
Step outside for a sec.

330
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,580
Give me a hand.

331
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,820
I bought too much stuff.

332
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,460
Luo Ren!

333
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,260
Mr. Zheng.

334
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,740
- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng.

335
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,380
Mr. Zheng.

336
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,540
Who are you guys?

337
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,380
They are...

338
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,220
They are Mu Dai's friends.

339
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,740
They'll be staying here for a few days.

340
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,220
Perfect.

341
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,220
The lamb shank today is excellent.

342
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,060
I couldn't help but buy extra.

343
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,780
I was worried we couldn't finish it.

344
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,900
It's great that you're here.

345
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,660
The more, the merrier.

346
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,940
Let's finish it.

347
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,020
Here, let me grill it.

348
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,580
I'll definitely help.

349
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,420
- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng,

350
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,860
I know how to handle lamb legs.

351
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,100
Let me take that.

352
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,180
- Let me.
- Thank you.

353
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,020
- Thank you.
- We should have come earlier

354
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,940
to help you with the shopping.

355
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,380
Alright.

356
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,300
Where's the kitchen?

357
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,900
- Come on.
- This way.

358
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,260
Over here.

359
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,940
It's here.

360
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:21,900
Alright.

361
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,020
Come on.

362
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,660
Mr. Zheng.

363
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,340
Mr. Zheng.

364
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,020
Have some grilled meat.

365
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Thank you.

366
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,780
It's so lively with you here.

367
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,580
Have a taste.

368
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,300
- Wait.
- Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

369
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,420
You're not letting us do anything.

370
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,780
Just sit and relax.

371
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,500
How nice.

372
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,100
How is it?

373
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,340
Not good.

374
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,180
- Really, it's not good.
- Give it to me.

375
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,260
Hey, give it to me.

376
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,780
Mr. Zheng, let me do that.

377
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,220
You take some to Pingting.

378
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,100
Oh, alright.

379
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,540
Mr. Zheng,

380
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,220
this portion has more lean meat.

381
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,100
Mr. Zheng,

382
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,060
switch all the utensils
to disposable ones.

383
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,500
Don't let her touch anything hard again.

384
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,300
Alright.

385
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,580
Is this done?

386
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,220
Is it good?

387
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,420
The tomatoes are even better.

388
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,420
I've had four already.

389
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,620
Where is Thirteen-Thousand?

390
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,460
He went to the toilet.

391
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,620
Such good lamb.

392
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,380
But he can't handle it.

393
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,340
Weak stomach.

394
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
He gets diarrhea.

395
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,420
Mr. Zheng, are you alright?

396
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,820
My waist.

397
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,420
Did you twist it?

398
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,860
It's nothing.

399
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,940
You need to go upstairs, right?

400
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,780
Let me help you.

401
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,580
Alright.

402
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,900
Be careful.

403
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,020
Okay, thank you.

404
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,220
It's actually my fault.

405
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,180
I wasn't watching

406
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,580
where I was going

407
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,780
and strained my back.

408
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,140
It's fine.
Just call me if you need anything.

409
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,980
Alright.

410
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,140
Could you carry this for me?

411
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,780
I won't look.

412
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,780
The passcode is just six zeros?

413
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,940
That's so amateur.

414
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,340
Pingting is sick.

415
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,100
Please keep your voice down.

416
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,420
Pingting, it's time to eat.

417
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,500
Pingting.

418
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,060
Your favorite grilled meat.

419
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,260
Here, give it to me.

420
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,020
Help me.

421
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,100
It's tender. Have some more.

422
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,340
Help me.

423
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,540
What's on your mind?

424
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,740
You're still up?

425
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,100
I saw you from upstairs.

426
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,820
Did you eat something greasy,

427
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,980
and now you have stomach trouble?

428
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,620
No.

429
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,540
I was thinking about Pingting.

430
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,500
I just messaged Mr. Kun

431
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
to ask for updates,

432
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,660
but he hasn't replied yet.

433
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,660
This whole thing is just bizarre.

434
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,580
He's probably just

435
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,340
as confused.

436
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,220
I don't think so.

437
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,220
He is an expert in this field.

438
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,620
Anyway, I believe in him.

439
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,460
Thank you.

440
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,460
Thank you.

441
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,220
Come on.

442
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,260
Come here.

443
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,620
Do you remember me?

444
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,940
Earlier today, did you ask me for help?

445
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:48,860
Alright.

446
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,700
Then I'll get straight to the point.

447
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,460
I need to confirm two things.

448
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,180
First, are you Luo Ren's cousin?

449
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,300
Second, is your name Luo Pingting?

450
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,100
Yes.

451
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,260
Help me. Get me out of here.

452
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,180
I still need to call the police.

453
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,420
Tell me about your situation.

454
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,460
I need to give them details.

455
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,820
Otherwise, even if I get you out,

456
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,340
you won't get far.

457
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,900
They will catch you again.

458
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,580
Right?

459
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,540
I am not Luo Ren's cousin.

460
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,780
What?

461
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,860
Alright, then tell me now.

462
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,140
I'll go get you some warm water.

463
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,500
Thirteen-Thousand!

464
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,740
Cao Yanhua.

465
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,660
Pingting!

466
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,100
Pingting.

467
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,660
Pingting!

468
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,140
Pingting!

469
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,420
Mu Dai!

470
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,900
Pocketty,

471
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,780
the image you sent is crucial.

472
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,380
It just hit me.

473
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,100
That pattern on the skin

474
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,540
might not be

475
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,820
a pattern at all.

476
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,420
It could be text.

477
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,540
Ancient text.

478
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,340
The ancient character for "blade".

479
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,820
"Blade"?

480
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,100
In every
fishing line puppet murder scene,

481
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,700
someone takes a blade.

482
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,580
Is this how relic of ill omen kills?

483
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,900
This confirms one thing.

484
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,300
Every time this pattern appears,

485
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,300
Pingting has an episode.

486
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,460
No wonder she's desperate to escape.

487
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,580
Luo Ren,

488
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,820
you have to stop me from killing.

489
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,660
Lock me up.

490
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,180
Just like my uncle.

491
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,940
Driven to kill.

492
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,620
Then we'll keep

493
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,980
constant watch over her

494
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,220
and make sure she never gets to leave.

495
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,300
But what if she stays like this forever?

496
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,780
And I don't think
guarding her will work.

497
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,900
Why not?

498
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,580
Haven't you noticed?

499
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,740
Pingting is so desperate to escape

500
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,980
that she even tried to jump

501
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,980
from the third floor. It's so high.

502
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,260
High enough to kill her.

503
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,860
So why would she jump
without hesitation?

504
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,180
Think about it.

505
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,700
Is there even the slightest possibility

506
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,260
that she...

507
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,140
What possibility?

508
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,260
I'm just guessing.

509
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,300
Look,

510
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,620
the cases

511
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,220
of Liu, Luo, and Pingting

512
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,740
reveal a pattern.

513
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,620
The relic of ill omen

514
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,060
only moves

515
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,260
to another host after someone dies.

516
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,820
If

517
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,620
Pingting is kept locked up,

518
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,220
the relic of ill omen will decide

519
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,580
she's useless.

520
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,260
So

521
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,620
it'll abandon her.

522
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,100
So it might force her to kill herself?

523
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,340
That's a possibility.

524
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,940
Someone has to die

525
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,060
for the relic of ill omen to leave.

526
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,420
What about faking death?

527
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,420
Faking death?

528
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,020
You'd have to stop your heartbeat
and breathing.

529
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,180
Try pulling that off.

530
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,300
It's not a real solution anyway.

531
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,660
Once the relic of ill omen leaves,
it'll just find a new host,

532
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,900
and that will harm innocent people.

533
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,620
We can't save Pingting
at the expense of others.

534
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,500
Pocketty, you're absolutely right.

535
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,220
I'll keep researching.

536
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,140
I'll call you

537
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,460
if I find anything.

538
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,300
Hello?

539
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,500
Just a power outage.

540
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,180
Scared me half to death.

541
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,300
Well, don't be frustrated.

542
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,060
Try to look on the bright side.

543
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,540
We're finally getting somewhere.

544
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,460
Mu Dai, you...

545
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,020
You're hurt.

546
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,340
You mean this?

547
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:19,980
Don't touch it.

548
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,460
It will breed bacteria.

549
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,020
Here.

550
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,540
Thank you.

551
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,540
By the way,

552
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,220
I'll book two rooms

553
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,380
at a nearby hotel.

554
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,420
You can take Cao Yanhua
and Thirteen-Thousand there.

555
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,540
Thirteen-Thousand messed up.

556
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,900
Kicking him out makes sense.

557
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,580
But you don't have to
send me away, too, do you?

558
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,940
What are you talking about?

559
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,100
The window repairman is coming soon.

560
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,900
It'll be noisy.

561
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,700
And you haven't slept all night, right?

562
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,300
Also,

563
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,820
don't blame Thirteen-Thousand
and Cao Yanhua.

564
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,460
I'm sending them away

565
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,580
for safety reasons.

566
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,980
Was it really Pingting
who knocked me out?

567
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,100
I am so strong.
How could she knock me out?

568
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,740
Strong? More like clueless.

569
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,340
All that talk about "surviving
the streets since your teens"?

570
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,500
You'd better watch out.

571
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,100
You're the type society weeds out.

572
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,740
You will be weeded out.

573
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,860
You came all this way to freeload,

574
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,460
then turned the place upside down.

575
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,820
You two are something else.

576
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,220
Hey, Lady Dai,

577
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,180
as law-abiding citizens,

578
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,100
shouldn't we lend a helping hand

579
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,940
when we see a girl

580
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,980
possibly being held captive?

581
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,300
Right.

582
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,620
So you're saying Luo Ren

583
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,780
should reward you both, is that it?

584
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,300
What's so funny?

585
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,540
Go back to where you came from!

586
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,180
This is all your fault.

587
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,860
You are also to blame.

588
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,020
If Pingting is kept locked up,

589
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,100
the relic of ill omen will decide

590
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,220
she's useless.

591
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,340
So it'll abandon her.

592
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,140
So it might force her to kill herself?

593
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
What about faking death?

594
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,060
Faking death?

595
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,740
You'd have to stop your heartbeat
and breathing.

596
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,980
Try pulling that off.

597
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,020
Once the relic of ill omen leaves,
it'll just find a new host,

598
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,180
and that will harm innocent people.

599
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,860
We can't save Pingting
at the expense of others.

600
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,820
Hello, Dr. Zhao.

601
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
Please come by tomorrow.

602
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,540
Money won't be an issue.

603
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,580
Bring your full emergency kit.

604
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,900
Where are we going?

605
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,380
Since Pingting's asleep,
I thought I'd take you out

606
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,900
to see the desert.

607
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,180
We could always see it
after everything's settled.

608
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,740
Just take a ride with me.

609
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,980
The desert is so quiet at night.

610
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,180
Yeah.

611
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,820
I've always enjoyed driving at night.

612
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,340
It helps me calm down

613
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,380
and think

614
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,740
when I am troubled.

615
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,460
Scared?

616
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,980
No, are we going

617
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,180
a bit too fast?

618
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,660
If this were your last moment alive,

619
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,580
what would you do?

620
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,900
What do you mean?

621
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,060
Luo Ren!

622
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,940
There's no road ahead, is there?

623
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,660
Stop the car!

624
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,580
That was terrifying.

625
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,620
How was it?

626
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,380
This is a classic local experience.

627
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,940
Using visual illusions
to simulate a brush with death.

628
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,740
I wasn't ready just now.

629
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,820
Let's do it again.

630
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,340
Only once.

631
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,220
It's no fun

632
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,500
when you know what's coming.

633
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:47,980
So?

634
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,020
How did it feel
to have a brush with death?

635
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,300
Obviously, living is better.

636
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,700
I must cherish life

637
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
and live well.

638
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,180
Live to a hundred years old.

639
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,020
You will.

640
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,580
That was thrilling.

641
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,980
I've never seen so many stars.

642
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,020
Feels like

643
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,980
I could reach out and grab one.

644
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,180
The stars are very far from us.

645
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,940
Their light

646
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,620
takes years to reach Earth.

647
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,020
What we see now

648
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,860
is the light they emitted long ago.

649
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,740
Like, that star

650
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,940
might already be dead.

651
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,540
The way you put it,

652
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,940
it's like all the stars
hanging in the sky

653
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,900
are skeletons.

654
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,620
And all starlight is like souls.

655
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,300
Did you come here often
to see the stars?

656
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,660
I brought Pingting here before.

657
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,620
Pingting and I aren't related by blood.

658
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,780
I went to live with my uncle

659
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,780
because of my father.

660
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,620
He had two wives.

661
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,140
Two wives?

662
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,900
My mother was his first wife.

663
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,500
She endured hardship with him
and helped him build his career.

664
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,980
Later, when he finally made money,

665
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,020
he decided to pursue

666
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,740
what he really wanted.

667
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,340
Like love.

668
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,540
That was just an excuse.

669
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,260
Later,

670
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,980
that woman finally married
into our family.

671
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,260
They didn't dare register the marriage.

672
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,220
But they had a grand wedding.

673
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,900
Even grander than my mother's.

674
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,420
Life was bearable at first.

675
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,020
But after that woman gave birth
to a son,

676
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,140
everything changed.

677
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,900
Two things happened to me that year.

678
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,100
First, I was nearly killed by a car.

679
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,420
Later,

680
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,260
I was poisoned

681
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,620
and had my stomach pumped.

682
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,500
Was it that woman's doing?

683
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,540
That's how it goes in dramas,

684
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,380
scheming over inheritance

685
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,620
and such.

686
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,780
My mother thought so.

687
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,220
Where are you going?

688
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
So she sent me to live with my uncle.

689
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,020
Pingting was only
four or five back then.

690
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,460
She had two pigtails

691
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,860
and was holding a big wooden sword.

692
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,180
She said to me,

693
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,220
"Ren,

694
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,180
Dad said someone is bullying you."

695
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,180
"But don't be afraid."

696
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,380
"If they come after you again,

697
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,780
I'll chop them."

698
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,980
Luo Wenmiao was my uncle.

699
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,020
But he felt more like

700
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,500

00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,620
We're leaving just like that?

756
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,140
Listen,

757
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,500
that wretched woman
is furious right now.

758
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,220
We need to play along for now.

759
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,700
Know what this is called?

760
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,300
Strategic retreat.

761
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:51,780
Follow her.

762
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,380
Hey,

763
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,700
I know their passcode.

764
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,700
Let me handle this.

765
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,540
You're here.

766
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,900
Luo Ren, open the door.

767
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,540
So you all here.

768
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,220
Luo Ren!

769
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:01,980
Let me enter the code.

770
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,620
Luo Ren!

771
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,140
Hurry.

772
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,660
He's already changed it.

773
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,700
You won't be able to open it.

774
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,540
Luo Ren, open the door!

775
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,660
- Luo Ren!
- Luo Ren!

776
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,500
Open the door!

777
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,940
What should we do then?

778
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,180
Now you need me!

779
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,340
You're hopeless.

780
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,580
A wise man won't sell his secrets,

781
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,100
but shares them freely with friends.

782
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,580
Today, I'll show you something dirty.

783
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,500
Locks keep out gentlemen, not rogues.

784
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,420
Watch this.

785
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:32,980
See?

786
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,780
Luo Ren.

787
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,620
What's going on?

788
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,740
Luo Ren, what are you doing?

789
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,980
Luo Ren, don't be rash!

790
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,740
Luo Ren, what are you doing?

791
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,300
Luo Ren...

792
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,020
Luo Ren!

793
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,060
You...

794
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,900
Luo Ren, you...

795
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,660
Quiet!

796
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,860
Mr. Zheng,

797
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,220
is the doctor ready?

798
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,380
He's right next door.

799
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,100
Doctor?

800
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,140
