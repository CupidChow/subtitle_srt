00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,140
Who's to say the cards

380
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,700
weren't coated with some scent?

381
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,180
Exactly.

382
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,900
See?

383
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,980
There have always been
people like you in every era.

384
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,820
This is called
having an inquisitive spirit.

385
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,820
You wouldn't understand.

386
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,020
Well then,

387
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,460
what do you suggest?

388
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,660
Let me write it.

389
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,220
If that dog can still
pick the right one,

390
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,460
I'll give you a silver coin.

391
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,140
No way.

392
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,300
How do we know you're not
in cahoots with the troupe leader?

393
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,020
You...

394
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,420
Everyone, give me some advice.

395
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,500
Why not

396
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,580
have Mr. Wei from the private school
in Long Town write it.

397
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,460
That'd be fair.

398
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:43,940
Makes sense.

399
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,140
His daughter,

400
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,380
Miss Wei, is right here.

401
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,060
She's literate too.

402
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,620
It would be the same if she wrote it.

403
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,140
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

404
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,380
Isn't she

405
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,700
the one from the private school...?

406
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,980
Another dog.

407
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,020
And one that can even read.

408
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,820
Though some dogs can be

409
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,300
as smart as a child,

410
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,260
being able to read
is going a bit too far.

411
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,540
Hard to say.

412
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,340
Maybe those cards

413
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,380
really were scented.

414
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,700
Based on the information we have so far,

415
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,780
the story seems roughly complete.

416
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,620
Let's go through it.

417
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,540
First, in a place called Long Town,

418
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,940
there was a private school
run by an old scholar named Mr. Wei.

419
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,340
His daughter was literate.

420
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,740
One day, a troupe performed in town.

421
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,940
One of the acts
is called "The Literate Dog".

422
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,740
The onlookers
questioned its authenticity

423
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,060
and invited Miss Wei
to write something for a retest.

424
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,500
Later, the same dog appeared
at the private school,

425
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,420
and Miss Wei fed it regularly.

426
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,900
This suggests

427
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,940
she likely adopted the dog

428
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,820
after the troupe's performance.

429
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,620
Later on, Miss Wei got married.

430
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,180
The dog, deeply attached to its owner,

431
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,420
may have followed her to her new home.

432
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,540
Since dogs are easy to keep,

433
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,940
her husband's family took it in.

434
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,700
An embracing couple
in the shadow of water

435
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
likely depicts their daily life.

436
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,260
Meanwhile, the dog lurked
in the shadows.

437
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,140
Maybe it was so attached to its owner

438
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,220
that it harbored resentment
towards the husband.

439
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,940
Then came a devastating fire.

440
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,540
Miss Wei and her husband

441
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,460
perished in the flames.

442
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,500
My goodness.

443
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,340
Could the dog have started the fire?

444
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,380
That seems far-fetched.

445
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Yet, the dog did remain indifferent

446
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,260
when disaster struck its owners.

447
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,300
But if the dog
had the relic of ill omen,

448
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,140
arson wouldn't be impossible.

449
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,660
I don't think it did.

450
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,420
Recall the first shadow of water?

451
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,700
We didn't notice

452
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,220
the topographical mountain lines before.

453
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,980
But now? Isn't this Fengzi Ridge?

454
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,460
Now we know

455
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,140
that around 280 years ago,

456
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,100
Meihua Yizhao and others
went to Fengzi Ridge

457
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,140
to seal the relics of ill omen.

458
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,380
And the Literate Dog

459
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,900
appeared about a hundred years ago.

460
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,100
Combined with this picture,

461
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,100
it seems more likely
that after its owners perished,

462
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,620
the Literate Dog wandered around.

463
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,180
Later, for some reason,

464
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,420
when it was at Fengzi Ridge,

465
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,060
it unlocked the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle

466
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,220
and released the relics of ill omen.

467
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,820
Remember

468
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,660
when we went to Fengzi Ridge?

469
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,060
Ding Laojiu mentioned

470
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,220
an old dog
that had lived there for ages.

471
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,180
My father said he'd seen it as a child.

472
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,700
Just how old was that thing?

473
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,540
That old dog was crafty and cunning.

474
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,500
But don't worry.

475
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,100
Over twenty years ago,

476
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,900
it was beaten to death
by one of my guests.

477
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:30,940
That old?

478
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,740
Could it be the same dog
from the shadow of water?

479
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,380
This is a lot to process.

480
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,020
I just searched.

481
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,860
There's no place called Long Town now.

482
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,860
Not surprising.

483
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,460
Before my master passed away,
she craved Lai City's Shaodaozi,

484
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,380
but we found the city

485
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,300
had long since changed its name.

486
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,300
Many cities no longer
use their old names.

487
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,300
This is easy to handle.

488
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,220
Leave it to Wan Fenghuo.

489
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,740
Now I understand.
The shadow of water is trying to tell us

490
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,020
how the relics of ill omen
escaped this time.

491
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,140
After entering the world, they want
to continue their previous schemes.

492
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,260
I won't let them succeed.

493
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,380
The color of the relics of ill omen
are fading.

494
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,260
The cycle of seven sevens
is approaching.

495
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,580
Based on the location clues,
the seventh one

496
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,660
should be near Xiagu Pass.

497
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,980
But where exactly is it?

498
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,740
This day

499
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,540
is finally coming.

500
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,420
Wan Fenghuo sent word.

501
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,860
This area is where Long Town
used to be located.

502
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,940
Tong County?

503
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,540
[Fengzi Ridge]
Right next to Fengzi Ridge.

504
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,380
It seems Fengzi Ridge is the key.

505
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,940
But this area is so vast.

506
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,980
How are we supposed to find it?

507
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,740
We'll figure it out step by step.

508
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,180
Everyone, go back and get prepared.

509
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,220
We'll set off soon.

510
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,380
How long will you be gone this time?

511
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,780
If all goes well, seven or eight days.

512
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,860
That's not too bad.

513
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,260
You don't need to take too many things.

514
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:51,820
Right.

515
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,140
I have no idea what you're up to.

516
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,380
Just don't

517
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,540
scare me

518
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,180
like last time.

519
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,100
I know. Don't worry.

520
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,620
When I return,

521
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,380
I'll stay with you at the bar

522
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,340
and won't go anywhere else.

523
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,700
Really?

524
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,260
Of course.

525
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,460
That's sweet.

526
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,340
But young folks like you

527
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,220
should see the world.

528
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,300
- Alright.
- Take care of your health

529
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,260
and stay safe outside.

530
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,700
Understood.

531
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,980
Okay. All packed.

532
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,540
You have to get up early tomorrow.

533
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,380
Go to bed early.

534
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,180
Got it.

535
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,940
I am off.

536
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,100
Master!

537
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,900
We saw the vision again.

538
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,420
I remember I just wanted to

539
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,860
open the window to get some fresh air.

540
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,260
After I opened the window,

541
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,620
what I saw was a sea of green.

542
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,220
It was just like a primeval forest.

543
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,180
Trees.

544
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,220
Trees. So many trees.

545
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:12,620
Right.

546
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,700
There was an open space in the middle.

547
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,380
And there was a strange tree there.

548
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,620
It was like those ancient trees

549
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,100
at the botanical garden.

550
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,900
Its trunk was crooked.

551
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,780
Crooked.

552
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,660
With a burl?

553
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,980
Wait, why do the relics of ill omen
pick who gets visions?

554
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,100
I've never...

555
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,340
I've been part of this squad.

556
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,820
Why have I never seen one?

557
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,660
Fiery,

558
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,020
you can't blame others for this.

559
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,340
You skipped the early team fights.

560
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,980
Normally, you're underdeveloped
in the later stages.

561
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,220
Who's underdeveloped?

562
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,180
Who?

563
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,820
Go get some water for everyone.

564
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,340
Come on.

565
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,020
It is Fengzi Ridge.

566
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,780
I remember

567
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,220
there were records
at the Guansi Memorial Archway.

568
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,540
The Great Virtuous One and Meihua Yizhao

569
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,700
went to Fengzi Ridge

570
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,500
to end the relics of ill omen
at their origin.

571
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,780
Perhaps the place we saw

572
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,820
is exactly this one.

573
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,300
The origin?

574
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,420
Then this

575
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,300
really is the final battle.

576
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,420
Based on this vision,

577
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,180
is the seventh relic of ill omen
in Fengzi Ridge?

578
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,740
The seventh star

579
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,680
[Mighty Kun]
on the Stargazing Platform

580
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,640
has never lit.

581
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,220
Has it never been activated?

582
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,820
And never left?

583
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,820
Makes sense.

584
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,460
Among the seven,

585
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,900
there's always one that's a homebody

586
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,020
and doesn't want to move.

587
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,980
Or maybe it can't move?

588
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,180
Maybe its nature

589
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,340
binds it

590
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,060
to its origin.

591
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,340
Thirteen, you're sharp.

592
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,340
That's quite possible.

593
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,900
I think maybe

594
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,100
Little Seven

595
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,540
was locked up by us

596
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,820
before it even had a chance to grow up.

597
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,020
Mr. Kun,

598
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,540
no nicknames

599
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,380
for the relic of ill omen, please.

600
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,300
I don't think we should be
too optimistic.

601
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,740
Maybe Little Seven
has some hidden tricks up its sleeve.

602
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,660
It doesn't matter.

603
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,860
Evil never prevails.

604
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,340
Stay confident, guys.

605
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,420
I've been receiving

606
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,380
more and more news

607
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,540
about the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

608
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,060
My intuition tells me
we'll find it soon.

609
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,220
And the doctor said

610
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,700
Ma's condition

611
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,460
is improving.

612
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,060
Everything is getting better

613
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,140
in an unstoppable way.

614
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,500
Exactly.

615
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,780
That's the spirit.

616
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,340
Stay positive.

617
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,540
I believe

618
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,460
that with this chicken

619
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,260
[Chicken to Success]
we'll definitely succeed.

620
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,940
But here's the problem.

621
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:34,860
Go on.

622
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,180
If that ancient tree
is in Fengzi Ridge...

623
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,100
The area spans hundreds of miles.

624
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,060
That's vast.

625
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,420
How are you supposed to find it?

626
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,500
Easy.

627
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,740
That tree looks so peculiar.

628
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,740
And it must be thousands of years old.

629
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,940
Elders nearby would know

630
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,100
about it.

631
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,500
And I happen to know someone like that.

632
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,860
You mean that ancient tree?

633
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,020
The mountains are high

634
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,380
and the forests are dense.

635
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,660
Yet there's this one spot

636
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,700
where nothing grows at all.

637
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,740
Only that tree is alive.

638
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,700
Your words

639
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,020
have jogged my memory.

640
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:09,860
Are you tired?

641
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:10,820
Mr. Ding,

642
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,060
why is this trek

643
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,420
harder than last time?

644
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,020
And it's getting colder.

645
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,220
We're deeper in the mountains now.

646
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,500
The altitude is getting higher.

647
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,900
The climate in the mountains

648
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,940
is really strange.

649
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,100
Snow in June

650
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,660
or buds in winter.

651
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,420
All sorts of weird things occur.

652
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:26,660
Are you okay?

653
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,740
Recently, someone said

654
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,100
it's because a star of ill omen

655
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,020
has fallen to the ground

656
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,820
- and disrupted the earth's veins.
- Perseverance leads to victory.

657
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,740
Star of ill omen?

658
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,100
Superstitious nonsense.

659
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,900
Just a made-up story to scare people

660
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,140
from entering the mountains

661
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,180
and getting into danger.

662
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,460
Be careful.

663
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,300
Careful now.

664
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,180
If there really were a star of ill omen,

665
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,500
our lives wouldn't be so prosperous now.

666
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,020
Come on, keep up.

667
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,380
We still have to climb higher.

668
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,460
Let's take a rest.

669
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,540
Take a break.

670
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,060
I've got

671
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,020
a little goal.

672
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,300
To build

673
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,940
a high-quality business.

674
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,180
Didn't I take photos
with you guys last time?

675
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,420
I make sure to take a group photo

676
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,140
with every team I guide.

677
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,500
Here, let me show you.

678
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,060
Look.

679
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,540
These were taken when I was young.

680
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,060
All with film cameras.

681
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,700
It's been several decades.

682
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,540
That guy looks familiar.

683
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,260
Mr. Ding,

684
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,180
do you recognize this man?

685
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,140
Yes.

686
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,940
He's the guest of mine

687
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,820
who killed that old dog.

688
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,060
What was his name again? Zhang...

689
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,940
Zhang Guanghua.

690
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,300
Yes. That's his name.

691
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,540
Are you familiar with him?

692
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,300
Well, your acquaintance

693
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,260
should thank.

694
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,620
How so?

695
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,420
Times were lean back then.

696
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,740
We rarely got to have some meat.

697
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,020
So he killed that old dog

698
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,220
and stew it to give himself a boost.

699
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,660
But I stopped him.

700
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,980
Because that dog

701
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
was too strange.

702
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,940
Strange how?

703
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,780
Strange how?

704
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,460
It had

705
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,340
many hairless patches on its body.

706
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,700
Not the kind that shed naturally.

707
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,860
It was more like someone
had stuck tape on it

708
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,020
and then ripped it off,

709
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,220
pulling the hair out along with it.

710
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,900
How many of those tape-like strips
were there?

711
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,420
There were three, four...

712
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,180
They were intertwined.

713
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,700
I didn't count them.

714
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,020
Mr. Ding,

715
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,100
let's go.

716
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,300
Alright.

717
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,340
Once we climb over, we'll be there.

718
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:51,860
Let's go.

719
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,540
Come on.

720
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,100
Look.

721
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,740
We're here. This is the tree.

722
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,700
Come on.

723
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,340
Mr. Ding,

724
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,380
thank you.

725
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,940
Thanks.

726
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,660
Don't stay too long in there.

727
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,620
The weather in the mountains
changes quickly.

728
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,140
It can turn cold all of a sudden.

729
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,780
Stay safe.

730
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,820
Be careful.

731
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,260
Remember.

732
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,700
Be careful.

733
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,660
Careful.

734
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,660
Stay sharp.

735
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:30,860
It seems

736
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,300
that dog was the Literate Dog.

737
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,580
It got lost in the mountains

738
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,220
and by chance,

739
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,900
broke the seal
of the relics of ill omen,

740
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,860
staying alive all this time.

741
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,700
Based on past experiences,

742
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,980
the relics of ill omen

743
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,220
likely chose Zhang Guanghua themselves.

744
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,100
Otherwise, as an ordinary person,

745
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,620
he couldn't have taken down that dog.

746
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,700
Hard to say how many of them

747
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,740
attached themselves to him.

748
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,820
If Zhang Guanghua
had two relics of ill omen

749
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,620
and lost one to Liu Shuhai

750
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,180
after falling into the water,

751
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,460
