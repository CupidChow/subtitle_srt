1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,840
 

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:20,010



3
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,020
 

4
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,900
 

5
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,460
This is a sailor's whistle,
and it's very loud and sharp.

6
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,280
Just blow it if you're ever in danger.

7
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,060
Let me play you a tune.

8
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,780
How do you do that?

9
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,420
Why can I only make a basic whistle sound?

10
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,100
Not telling you.

11
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,040
It's my signature trick.

12
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,980
Luo Ren.

13
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,520
Luo,

14
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,400
it's over.

15
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,720
Still clutching that dagger
with death at your doorstep.

16
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,860
Hoping to catch me off guard?

17
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,660
I've got a surprise for you too.

18
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,460
I fed your girl

19
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,160
a micro-bomb.

20
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,700
Luo, you're dying.

21
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,980
And I've arranged a splendid
fireworks show for you.

22
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,360
Looking forward to it?

23
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,200
This is the place.

24
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,700
Let's go.

25
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,820
Aoki. Aoki!

26
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,420
Wake up, Aoki.

27
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,020
Aoki!

28
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,120
Aoki!

29
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,620
Aoki, they're fighting inside.

30
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,940
What do we do?

31
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,180
They're fighting.

32
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,820
Fighting?

33
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,200
Where?

34
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,520
Luo Ren.

35
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,660
Let me apply pressure.

36
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,840
I'm sorry.

37
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,300
Sorry.

38
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,200
Sorry.

39
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,600
Go.

40
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,600
Now.

41
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,440
Hong Sha, keep pressure on his wound.

42
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,960
Dare attack my sect?

43
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,360
I'll kill you!

44
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,060
Cao!

45
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,880
Get back here!

46
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,040
Sorry, I missed.

47
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,680
Found anything when you searched Leopard?

48
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,220
Whatever.

49
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,400
Thought I was done for, so I took everything.

50
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,840
Get Thirteen-Thousand to bring the car.

51
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,260
Luo Ren's fading fast.

52
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,080
Hurry!

53
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,140
Hear that? Gunfight inside.

54
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,740
- Where?
- Right in there.

55
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,420
Leopard?

56
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,500
Can we catch up?

57
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,440
Wrong turn, Aoki.

58
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,680
- Aoki!
- Hold on tight.

59
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,060
Thirteen-Thousand?

60
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,380
Where's the car?

61
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,980
Where did that guy go?

62
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,640
Is she dead?

63
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,380
Leopard!

64
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,300
Come on!

65
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,100
Free.

66
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,780
We all made it back safely.

67
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,820
Not good.

68
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,040
The doctor said the chances of him waking up...

69
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,700
Senior Master's still at Heisha,
handling the aftermath.

70
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,000
We'll return as soon as we can.

71
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,620
Where's Ren?

72
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,540
Where's Ren?

73
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,220
How is he?

74
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,000
He's sleeping.

75
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,660
Alright.

76
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,520
Be careful.

77
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,620
People...

78
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,640
Sometimes people really are just monsters.

79
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,740
Mr. Kun, any luck with the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle?

80
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,100
 

81
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,400
Not great.

82
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,060
I've asked those who have any leads to send me photos and videos first.

83
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,740
Gone through dozens with phoenix motifs.

84
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,900
None of them is the right one.

85
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,380
But we're on the right track.

86
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,020
Radishie still hasn't woken up?

87
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,260
No.

88
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,140
Why have all of you collapsed like this?

89
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,640
I need to figure something out.

90
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,600
Here to see your boyfriend again?

91
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,380
Heard her boyfriend might never wake up.

92
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,860
 

93
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,020
Hong Sha, where should I put this balloon?

94
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,000
Not there. Lower.

95
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,420
It's supposed to be a heart shape.

96
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,420
Too much in the middle, right?

97
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,700
Higher on this side.

98
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,260
- Lift the left side a bit, right?
- Let me see.

99
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,380
 
What are you...?

100
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,520
Mu Dai, you're here.

101
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,020
Come here.

102
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,200
- What is this?
- I want to show you something.

103
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,180
Luo, wake up soon.

104
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,620
Mu Dai misses you.

105
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,220
We all miss you.

106
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,580
 

107
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,340
Welcome to Phoenix Pavilion.

108
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,220
Come back again.
Bring friends, and I'll give you a discount.

109
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,300
- Then I'll have the udon.
- Got it.

110
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,060
Extra cilantro on mine.

111
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,380
- Understood.
- Thank you for coming.

112
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,480
Welcome to Phoenix Pavilion.

113
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,900
Extra cilantro on your noodles, right?

114
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:24,335
 ♫ In the deepest night, longing takes shape ♫ 

115
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:31,200
 ♫ Warm memories slowly embrace you tight ♫ 

116
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,460
 ♫ The path of growth is inevitably lonely ♫ 

117
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,020
Mu Dai.

118
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,620
If Luo Ren never wakes up, will you keep waiting for him?

119
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,060
Yes.

120
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,100
Of course, I'll wait.

121
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,860
I'm waiting for someone worth waiting for.

122
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,060
Every day, I hope with all my heart
that he wakes up.

123
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,635
 ♫ Stubbornness and courage keep you strong ♫ 

124
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:01,940
 ♫ In the gaps of time within memories ♫ 

125
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,160
Luo Ren, you know what?

126
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,640
 Leopard is paralyzed. 

127
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,720
 She's lost all normal mobility. 

128
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,320
 She was handed over
to the stabilization organization, 

129
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,720
 and she will face sentencing and imprisonment. 

130
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,400
 Tasha went back to Western Australia. 

131
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,220
 My senior contacted her guardian and got her into the best rehab center. 

132
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,160
 They ran a mental assessment, 

133
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,380
 but the results weren't good. 

134
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,180
 She won't return to a normal life anytime soon. 

135
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,405
 ♫ Companionship and care
are like gentle beams of light ♫ 

136
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:38,120
 ♫ Embark on the journey, healing all loneliness ♫ 

137
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,020
 ♫ Waiting together for the sunrise ♫ 

138
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,500
Kneel.

139
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,260
Bow.

140
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,980
 

141
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,220
Don't forget to buy cabbage,
pork ribs, and potatoes.

142
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,700
And get a few bottles
of good Huangjiu if they have it.

143
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,140
Got it.

144
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,700
Hong Sha's the reliable one around here.

145
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,340
Tell me about it.

146
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,620
I don't work for free though.

147
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,660
You should pay me on time.

148
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,620
I've got debts to settle.

149
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,680
Don't worry about it.

150
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
Ren.

151
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,220
Ren?

152
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,260
You've been asleep for a month.

153
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,540
When do you plan to wake up?

154
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,880
What if I get used to only visiting you once

155
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,380
every couple of weeks?

156
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,820
The cycle of seven sevens is approaching.

157
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,500
You can't keep sleeping.

158
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,880
We're still waiting for you to lead us to subdue the seventh relic of ill omen.

159
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,540
For that table over there.

160
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,920
Aoki.

161
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,540
What's wrong with Luo?

162
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,480
I can't hear you.What's wrong with Luo?

163
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,780
Luo Ren.

164
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,380
Don't worry. He woke up once before.

165
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,800
He asked me if you were safe.

166
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,300
I told him everyone was safe.

167
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,800
The doctor said it's a good sign.

168
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,540
Family members don't need to worry.

169
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,260
Since Luo Ren's out of danger,
I've booked a flight

170
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:53,860
and will go home tomorrow.

171
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,680
You're going back?

172
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,540
Hey, Noriko.

173
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,560
How are you doing?

174
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,000
Wish you and Luo Ren happiness together.

175
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,060
I'm entrusting him to you.

189
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:20,837
Over a month.

190
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,382
Are you hungry?

191
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:23,903
Want something to eat?

That was life-or-death combat.

198

My injuries were nothing.

199
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,908
They healed long ago.

200
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:47,940

This time,

00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:19,568
I didn't do well enough.

210
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:22,550
Don't say that.

211
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,740
You've done a great job.

212
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,920
All along, you've been leading
and taking care of us.

213
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,160
Now it's my turn, our turn to take care of you.

214
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,340
And don't be sad.

215
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,440
It's alright now.

216
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,740
Everyone made it through.

Right?

221
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,780
Is it tiring for you
to listen to me talk like this?

222
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,500
We can always talk later if you need to rest.

223
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,165
Not at all.

224
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,100
Mu Dai.

225
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,700
Back then, we were fighting
each other in that cage.

226

 ♫ Through all the time we've spent together ♫

228
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:07,920
 ♫ Countless memories forever ♫ 

229
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,880
I summoned Dark Mu Dai.

230
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,960
From where I was trapped,
I could see the signal tower.

231
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,260
I timed it. The signal came every three seconds.

232
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,900
Perfect for hypnosis.

233
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,500
Leopard wants to brainwash us

234
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,720
and turn us into another
Tasha to use against Luo Ren.

235
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,220
We can't let her succeed.

236
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,965
Of course not.

237
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:47,545
Luckily, she never knew I existed.

238
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,500
You're exhausted. Sit down.

239
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,220
Here.

240
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,240
Leopard wasn't easy to fool.

241
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,820
Pretending to be brainwashed is impossible.

242
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,300
So one of us has to sleep while the other surrendered to it.

243
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,300
I just couldn't figure out the trigger to break the hypnosis.

244
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,920
Luo Ren's whistle.

245
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,120
He said it was his signature trick.

246
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,274
After hearing the whistle,
the sleeper will wake up,

247
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:33,974
and the brainwashed one can't be kept.

248
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:37,282
They must take their own life to eliminate future troubles.

249
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,363
Why do you know everything?

250
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:45,543
Because I am you.

251
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,316
Brainwashing hurts.

252
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:53,856
Let me take it.

253
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:01,476
Don't cry.

254
00:24:01,476 --> 00:24:05,556
You little crybaby, this world is full of storms.

255
00:24:05,556 --> 00:24:08,196
I was made to protect us.

256
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,676
Listen up, I'll fight this last battle

257
00:24:10,676 --> 00:24:13,576
as bravely as our master did.

258
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,736
It's just a pity

259
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:22,576
I won't get to see you take the field again.

260
00:24:28,356 --> 00:24:30,196
Don't be afraid.

261
00:24:31,156 --> 00:24:32,916
You're unbreakable.

262
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:35,036
You'll come back alive.

263
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:40,781
Ren.

264
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,381
I...

265
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:51,221
I miss her so much.

266
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:53,096
Sometimes when I wake up
in the middle of the night,

267
00:24:53,096 --> 00:24:55,376
I feel so lonely.

268
00:24:55,956 --> 00:25:00,672
Like a part of me

269
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:04,336
has been torn away.

270
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,456
Yes, Mu Dai.

271
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:17,696
People say growing up means the old self keeps tearing apart

272
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:20,441
while the new self is being reforged.

273
00:25:20,441 --> 00:25:22,961
But I don't see it that way.

274
00:25:22,961 --> 00:25:27,636
I believe growing up is the old self constantly embracing the new self.

275
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:30,076
They know and melt into each other.

276
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:37,736
Mu Dai,

277
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:43,776
she is you, and you are her.

278
00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:46,556
She has never disappeared.

279
00:25:48,156 --> 00:25:52,016
She just chose not to show herself anymore.

280
00:26:17,716 --> 00:26:19,516
 Look how lively Free is. 

281
00:26:19,516 --> 00:26:22,041
 
 There's something even livelier. 

282
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,696
- He's awake.
-  You only filmed yourself. 

283
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:25,736
Oh, thank God.

284
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:27,641
His eyes are even bigger than mine.

285
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:28,656
What are you doing?

286
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:29,798
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

287
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:32,696
- Don't crush him.
- I'm fine.

288
00:26:32,696 --> 00:26:36,016
Look at you, laughing and celebrating.

289
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:37,816
Eat well, alright?

290
00:26:37,816 --> 00:26:40,996
Get back to your old, unstoppable self soon.

291
00:26:40,996 --> 00:26:42,760
Congratulations.

292
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,920
 Got it. Thanks, Mr. Kun. 

293
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,436
 We'll hang up now. 

294
00:26:46,436 --> 00:26:50,036
 

295
00:26:51,436 --> 00:26:53,936
Ma,

296
00:26:53,936 --> 00:26:56,476
please wake up soon.

297
00:26:57,476 --> 00:27:02,136
My cooking is nowhere near as good as yours.

298
00:27:07,316 --> 00:27:10,116
Here, let me massage you a bit.

299
00:27:15,156 --> 00:27:17,656
Come on, wake up.

300
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:38,396
- Great!
- Wonderful.

301
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:39,536
Thank you all.

302
00:27:39,536 --> 00:27:42,276
- Did the monkey get it right? 
  - Yes!

303
00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:43,876
Was the performance good?

304
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:45,836
Yes!

305
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:49,196
Next, we'll show something
even more amazing, the Literate Dog.

306
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:53,516
We'll have the dog pick the word "joy" from these.

307
00:27:56,136 --> 00:27:57,901
Isn't it that dog?

308
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:00,616
Alright. et's see.

309
00:28:00,616 --> 00:28:02,836
 
It picked the word "joy".

310
00:28:02,836 --> 00:28:03,916
- Amazing!
- Wonderful!

311
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,976
Next, we'll have it pick the word "prosper".

312
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,874
Another one. Let's see.

313
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:10,436
 
Prosper.

314
00:28:10,436 --> 00:28:12,496
May you all prosper and thrive!

315
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:14,836
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

316
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:16,116
Wait a minute.

317
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:17,696
A dog's nose is way too sharp.

318
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,556
Who's to say the cards
weren't coated with some scent?

319
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:22,096
- Exactly.
- See?

320
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:24,036
There have always been
people like you in every era.

321
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,676
This is called having an inquisitive spirit.

322
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:27,116
You wouldn't understand.

323
00:28:27,116 --> 00:28:29,780
Well then, what do you suggest?

324
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,140
Let me write it. If that dog can still pick the right one,

325
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,384
I'll give you a silver coin.

326
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:34,416
No way.

327
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:36,356
How do we know you're not
in cahoots with the troupe leader?

328
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:38,576
- You...
- Everyone, give me some advice.

329
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:41,436
Why not have Mr. Wei
from the private school in Long Town write it.

330
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:43,036
That'd be fair.

331
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:46,576
- Makes sense.
- His daughter, Miss Wei, is right here.

332
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:48,076
She's literate too.

333
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:50,136
It would be the same if she wrote it.

334
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:51,396
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

335
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,656
Isn't she the one from the private school...?

336
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,756
Another dog.

337
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:04,156
And one that can even read.

338
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:07,836
Though some dogs can be as smart as a child,

339
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:10,596
being able to read is going a bit too far.

340
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:12,636
Hard to say.

341
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:16,136
Maybe those cards really were scented.

342
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:19,036
Based on the information we have so far,

343
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:20,636
the story seems roughly complete.

344
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:22,376
Let's go through it.

345
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,636
First, in a place called Long Town,

346
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:31,116
there was a private school
run by an old scholar named Mr. Wei.

347
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:33,556
His daughter was literate.

348
00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:35,716
One day, a troupe performed in town.

349
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,796
One of the acts is called "The Literate Dog".

350
00:29:37,796 --> 00:29:39,736
The onlookers questioned its authenticity

351
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,516
and invited Miss Wei
to write something for a retest.

352
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:45,796
Later, the same dog appeared
at the private school,

353
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,516
and Miss Wei fed it regularly.

354
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:51,236
This suggests she likely adopted the dog

355
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:53,436
after the troupe's performance.

356
00:29:53,436 --> 00:29:56,156
Later on, Miss Wei got married.

357
00:29:56,156 --> 00:29:58,136
The dog, deeply attached to its owner,

358
00:29:58,136 --> 00:30:00,356
may have followed her to her new home.

359
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:03,096
Since dogs are easy to keep, her husband's family took it in.

360
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:07,356
An embracing couple in the shadow of water likely depicts their daily life.

361
00:30:07,356 --> 00:30:09,956
Meanwhile, the dog lurked in the shadows.

362
00:30:09,956 --> 00:30:14,856
Maybe it was so attached to its owner that it harbored resentment towards the husband.

363
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:18,076
Then came a devastating fire.

364
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:21,716
Miss Wei and her husband perished in the flames.

365
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:22,876
My goodness.

366
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:24,516
Could the dog have started the fire?

367
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:26,456
That seems far-fetched.

368
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:29,456
Yet, the dog did remain indifferent when disaster struck its owners.

369
00:30:29,456 --> 00:30:31,316
But if the dog had the relic of ill omen,

370
00:30:31,316 --> 00:30:32,996
arson wouldn't be impossible.

371
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:34,876
I don't think it did.

372
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:37,276
Recall the first shadow of water?

373
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:46,556
We didn't notice the topographical mountain lines before.

374
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,936
But now? Isn't this Fengzi Ridge?

375
00:30:49,496 --> 00:30:52,316
Now we know that around 280 years ago,

376
00:30:52,316 --> 00:30:55,056
Meihua Yi Zhao and others went to Fengzi Ridge to seal the relics of ill omen.

377
00:30:55,056 --> 00:30:58,836
And the Literate Dog appeared about a hundred years ago.

378
00:30:58,836 --> 00:31:00,296
Combined with this picture,

379
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:02,156
it seems more likely
that after its owners perished,

380
00:31:02,156 --> 00:31:03,796
the Literate Dog wandered around.

381
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:06,776
Later, for some reason,
when it was at Fengzi Ridge,

382
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:10,076
it unlocked the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle and released the relics of ill omen.

383
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:14,896
Remember when we went to Fengzi Ridge?

384
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:18,316
Ding Lao Jiu mentioned an old dog that had lived there for ages.

385
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:21,196
My father said he'd seen it as a child.

386
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:23,436
Just how old was that thing?

387
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:25,496
That old dog was crafty and cunning.

388
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:26,876
But don't worry.

389
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:30,356
Over 20 years ago, it was beaten to death by one of my guests.

390
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:33,916
That old? Could it be the same dog
from the shadow of water?

391
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:36,596
This is a lot to process.

392
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:37,976
I just searched.

393
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,816
There's no place called Long Town now.

394
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:40,876
Not surprising.

395
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:43,316
Before my master passed away,
she craved Lai City's Shaodaozi,

396
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:46,156
but we found the city
had long since changed its name.

397
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:48,496
Many cities no longer use their old names.

398
00:31:48,496 --> 00:31:50,081
This is easy to handle.

399
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,881
Leave it to Wan Feng Huo.

400
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:01,956
Now I understand.
The shadow of water is trying to tell us

401
00:32:01,956 --> 00:32:04,656
how the relics of ill omen escaped this time.

402
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:08,096
After entering the world,
they want to continue their previous schemes.

403
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:10,636
I won't let them succeed.

404
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:12,756
The color of the relics of ill omen are fading.

405
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:14,636
The cycle of seven sevens is approaching.

406
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:18,836
Based on the location clues, the seventh one should be near Xiagu Pass.

407
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,136
But where exactly is it?

408
00:32:33,376 --> 00:32:39,596
This day is finally coming.

409
00:33:23,056 --> 00:33:24,536
Wan Feng Huo sent word.

410
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:27,036
This area is where Long Town used to be located.

411
00:33:27,036 --> 00:33:28,896
Tong County?

412
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:31,716
 
Right next to Fengzi Ridge.

413
00:33:31,716 --> 00:33:33,716
It seems Fengzi Ridge is the key.

414
00:33:33,716 --> 00:33:34,896
But this area is so vast.

415
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:36,836
How are we supposed to find it?

416
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:40,036
We'll figure it out step by step.

417
00:33:40,036 --> 00:33:41,416
Everyone, go back and get prepared.

418
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:43,176
We'll set off soon.

419
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,736
How long will you be gone this time?

420
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:49,116
If all goes well, seven or eight days.

421
00:33:49,116 --> 00:33:51,116
That's not too bad.
You don't need to take too many things.

422
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:52,676
Right.

423
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:56,596
I have no idea what you're up to.

424
00:33:56,596 --> 00:34:00,036
Just don't scare me like last time.

425
00:34:00,036 --> 00:34:02,496
I know. Don't worry.

426
00:34:02,496 --> 00:34:06,416
When I return, I'll stay with you at the bar
and won't go anywhere else.

427
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:07,556
Really?

428
00:34:07,556 --> 00:34:08,919
Of course.

429
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:11,416
That's sweet.

430
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:15,756
But young folks like you should see the world.

431
00:34:15,756 --> 00:34:18,376
- Alright.
- Take care of your health and stay safe outside.

432
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:19,556
Understood.

433
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:21,396
Okay. All packed.

434
00:34:21,396 --> 00:34:23,696
You have to get up early tomorrow. Go to bed early.

435
00:34:23,696 --> 00:34:25,796
Got it. I'm off.

436
00:34:58,816 --> 00:35:00,516
Master!

437
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,996
We saw the vision again.

438
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:04,816
I remember I just wanted to open the window to get some fresh air.

439
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:08,876
After I opened the window, what I saw was a sea of green.

440
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:10,276
It was just like a primeval forest.

441
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,476
- Trees. Trees. So many trees. 
 - Right.

442
00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:14,676
There was an open space in the middle.

443
00:35:14,676 --> 00:35:16,616
And there was a strange tree there.

444
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:21,496
It was like those ancient trees at the botanical garden.

445
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,176
Its trunk was crooked.

446
00:35:23,176 --> 00:35:26,416
- Crooked.
- With a burl?

447
00:35:27,096 --> 00:35:28,916
Wait, why do the relics of ill omen
pick who gets visions?

448
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:32,336
I've never... I've been part of this squad.

449
00:35:32,336 --> 00:35:33,876
Why have I never seen one?

450
00:35:33,876 --> 00:35:36,228
Fiery, you can't blame others for this.

451
00:35:36,228 --> 00:35:38,876
You skipped the early team fights.
You're underdeveloped in the later stages.

452
00:35:38,876 --> 00:35:40,476
Who's underdeveloped?

453
00:35:40,476 --> 00:35:42,496
Who?

454
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:43,616
Go get some water for everyone.

455
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:45,096
Come on.

456
00:35:55,056 --> 00:35:56,956
It is Fengzi Ridge.

457
00:35:56,956 --> 00:36:00,196
I remember there were records at the Guansi Memorial Archway.

458
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:02,896
The Great Virtuous One and Meihua Yi Zhao went to Fengzi Ridge

459
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:04,543
to end the relics of ill omen at their origin.

460
00:36:04,543 --> 00:36:08,096
Perhaps the place we saw is exactly this one.

461
00:36:08,096 --> 00:36:10,616
The origin?

462
00:36:10,616 --> 00:36:14,156
Then this really is the final battle.

463
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:23,556
 Based on this vision, is the seventh relic of ill omen in Fengzi Ridge? 

464
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,696
 The seventh star 

465
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:27,036
 
 on the Stargazing Platform has never been lit. 

466
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:29,516
 Has it never been activated? 

467
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:30,716
 And never left? 

468
00:36:30,716 --> 00:36:32,316
 Makes sense. 

469
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:36,196
Among the seven, there's always one that's a homebody and doesn't want to move.

470
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:38,176
Or maybe it can't move?

471
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:43,136
Maybe its nature binds it to its origin.

472
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,316
Thirteen, you're sharp.

473
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:46,476
That's quite possible.

474
00:36:46,476 --> 00:36:50,796
I think maybe Little Seven was locked up by us

475
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:53,196
before it even had a chance to grow up.

476
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:55,376
Mr. Kun,

477
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:59,516
no nicknames for the relic of ill omen, please.

478
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:01,556
I don't think we should be too optimistic.

479
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:03,596
Maybe Little Seven
has some hidden tricks up its sleeve.

480
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,643
It doesn't matter.

481
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:06,676
Evil never prevails.

482
00:37:06,676 --> 00:37:09,396
Stay confident, guys.

483
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:14,076
I've been receiving more and more news about the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

484
00:37:14,076 --> 00:37:17,096
My intuition tells me we'll find it soon.

485
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:21,356
And the doctor said Ma's condition is improving.

486
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:24,835
Everything is getting better
in an unstoppable way.

487
00:37:24,835 --> 00:37:26,876
Exactly. That's the spirit.

488
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:28,236
Stay positive.

489
00:37:28,236 --> 00:37:30,516
I believe that with this chicken,

490
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:32,676
 
we'll definitely succeed.

491
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:35,036
- But here's the problem.
-  Go on. 

492
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:37,036
If that ancient tree is in Fengzi Ridge...

493
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:39,276
The area spans hundreds of miles.

494
00:37:39,276 --> 00:37:40,536
That's vast.

495
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:41,796
How are you supposed to find it?

496
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:42,916
Easy.

497
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:44,916
That tree looks so peculiar.

498
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,916
And it must be thousands of years old.

499
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:50,516
Elders nearby would know about it.

500
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:53,456
And I happen to know someone like that.

501
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:57,876
You mean that ancient tree?

502
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:00,280
The mountains are high, and the forests are dense.

503
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,656
Yet there's this one spot
where nothing grows at all.

504
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,436
Only that tree is alive.

505
00:38:05,436 --> 00:38:09,037
Your words have jogged my memory.

506
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,116
Are you tired?

507
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:13,316
Mr. Ding, why is this trek harder than last time?

508
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:14,916
And it's getting colder.

509
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:16,176
We're deeper in the mountains now.

510
00:38:16,176 --> 00:38:17,496
The altitude is getting higher.

511
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:20,036
The climate in the mountains is really strange.

512
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:23,756
Snow in June or buds in winter.

513
00:38:23,756 --> 00:38:26,116
All sorts of weird things occur.

514
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:28,273
- Are you okay?
- Recently, someone said...

515
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,216
it's because a star of ill omen
has fallen to the ground

516
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:32,396
- and disrupted the earth's veins.
- Perseverance leads to victory.

517
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:33,696
Star of ill omen?

518
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:35,516
Superstitious nonsense.

519
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:37,876
Just a made-up story to scare people

520
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:43,236
from entering the mountains
and getting into danger.

521
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,556
- Be careful.
- Careful now.

522
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,136
If there really were a star of ill omen,

523
00:38:48,655 --> 00:38:52,000
our lives wouldn't be so prosperous now.

524
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,960
Come on, keep up.

525
00:38:58,096 --> 00:38:59,276
We still have to climb higher.

526
00:38:59,276 --> 00:39:00,796
Let's take a rest.

527
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,396
Take a break.

528
00:39:06,216 --> 00:39:09,076
I've got a little goal.

529
00:39:09,076 --> 00:39:13,076
To build a high-quality business.

530
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:15,036
Didn't I take photos with you guys last time?

531
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:18,316
I make sure to take a group photo
with every team I guide.

532
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:20,356
Here, let me show you.

533
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:23,816
Look.

534
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,556
These were taken when I was young.

535
00:39:26,556 --> 00:39:28,396
All with film cameras.

536
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:30,216
It's been several decades.

537
00:39:30,216 --> 00:39:32,496
That guy looks familiar.

538
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,096
Mr. Ding, do you recognize this man?

539
00:39:41,096 --> 00:39:42,696
Yes.

540
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:46,960
He's the guest of mine who killed that old dog.

541
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,236
- What was his name again? Zhang...
- Zhang Guang Hua.

542
00:39:50,236 --> 00:39:52,296
Yes. That's his name.

543
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:54,496
Are you familiar with him?

544
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,701
Well, your acquaintance should thank me.

545
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:02,196
How so?

546
00:40:02,196 --> 00:40:04,756
Times were lean back then.

547
00:40:04,756 --> 00:40:05,836
We rarely got to have some meat.

548
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:10,416
So he killed that old dog and stew it to give himself a boost.

549
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,780
But I stopped him.

550
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,980
Because that dog was too strange.

551
00:40:15,756 --> 00:40:16,836
Strange how?

552
00:40:16,836 --> 00:40:18,216
Strange how?

553
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:21,516
It had many hairless patches on its body.

554
00:40:21,516 --> 00:40:23,956
Not the kind that shed naturally.

555
00:40:23,956 --> 00:40:26,916
It was more like someone had stuck tape on it

556
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,476
and then ripped it off,

557
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:31,076
pulling the hair out along with it.

558
00:40:31,076 --> 00:40:33,756
How many of those tape-like strips were there?

559
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:39,756
There were three, four... They were intertwined.

560
00:40:39,756 --> 00:40:41,756
I didn't count them.

561
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:46,656
Mr. Ding, let's go.

562
00:40:46,656 --> 00:40:51,236
Alright. Once we climb over, we'll be there.

563
00:40:51,236 --> 00:40:52,716
Let's go.

564
00:40:57,876 --> 00:40:59,296
Come on.

565
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:03,036
Look.

566
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:05,796
We're here. This is the tree.

567
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:13,036
- Come on.
- Mr. Ding, thank you.

568
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:16,836
Thanks. Don't stay too long in there.

569
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:18,596
The weather in the mountains changes quickly.

570
00:41:18,596 --> 00:41:20,136
It can turn cold all of a sudden.

571
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:21,676
Stay safe.

572
00:41:21,676 --> 00:41:23,516
Be careful.

573
00:41:23,516 --> 00:41:24,696
Remember.

574
00:41:24,696 --> 00:41:26,136
Be careful.

575
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:28,516
- Careful.
- Stay sharp.

576
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:33,436
It seems that dog was the Literate Dog.

577
00:41:33,436 --> 00:41:36,576
It got lost in the mountains and by chance,

578
00:41:36,576 --> 00:41:37,916
broke the seal of the relics of ill omen,

579
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:39,476
staying alive all this time.

580
00:41:39,476 --> 00:41:41,476
Based on past experiences, the relics of ill omen

581
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:43,656
likely chose Zhang Guang Hua themselves.

582
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:45,056
Otherwise, as an ordinary person,

583
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:46,876
he couldn't have taken down that dog.

584
00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:50,256
Hard to say how many of them attached themselves to him.

585
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:53,676
If Zhang Guang Hua had two relics of ill omen
and lost one to Liu Shu Hai

586
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:57,316
after falling into the water,
then he'd have one left.

587
00:41:57,316 --> 00:41:59,796
In that case, he might still be alive.

588
00:42:00,836 --> 00:42:03,116
If he still has the relic of ill omen within him,

589
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:05,556
then this one is the seventh one.

590
00:42:08,836 --> 00:42:10,648
Let's go.

591
00:42:10,648 --> 00:42:12,788
Time to find out.

592
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:18,156
Move.

593
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:26,990



594
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,600
 'Palm Print' - An Qi
