1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,060
   

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:24,000



3
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,460
   

4
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,020
   

5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,980
   

6
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,310
I don't care what you are. Stay put.

7
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,190
I'll get you sooner or later.

8
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,190
Ping Ting.

9
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,737
Here. Duckie.

10
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,459
It's fine.

11
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:04,080
 You're saying the skin moved, with a pattern on it? 

12
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,592
Hard to say. Just a flash.

13
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,180
I didn't get a good look.

14
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,630
That sounds like a parasite.

15
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,470
 They are like some kind of parasite and its host. 

16
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,330
By the way, Ping Ting was humming a song at the time.

17
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,490
Could there be a connection?

18
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,840
I... I'll send you a video.

19
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,960
Just a moment.

20
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,980
Uncle Kun, you're using a smartphone?

21
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,360
 Which rule says I can't? 

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,470
 I'm not out of touch with the times. 

23
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,770
 Just didn't want to be bothered by you guys, so... 

24
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,730
This melody... It's the song Ping Ting was humming.

25
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,040
And who are you?

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,530
That's Luo Ren. I've mentioned him before.

27
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,260
Hello, Mr. Shen. I'm Ping Ting's guardian

28
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,600
and also a friend of Mu Dai's.

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,510
A friend of Pocketty's is a friend of mine.

30
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,870
 I compared many tunes with the one Ping Ting sang. 

31
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,270
That is not an ordinary tune.

32
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:07,860
More like a ritual chant from Lengquan used to invoke deities.

33
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,740
Then why were Ping Ting and my uncle humming it?

34
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,840
That part is unclear.

35
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,020
Needs more investigation.

36
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,852
Pocketty, Radishie,

37
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:18,310
 keep working on it. 

38
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,860
 Call me if you find anything new. 

39
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,540
 If not, don't. 

40
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,795
All right.

41
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:28,630
Radishie? Pocketty?

42
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,370
Just Mr. Shen's quirk. No offense meant.

43
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,330
He mainly gives you a nickname because he regards you as a friend.

44
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,560
It's a sign of approval.

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,370
And radishes are nutritious.

46
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,300
In many regions, they're called "earth ginseng."

47
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,340
He's basically saying you're like ginseng.

48
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:52,673
Sorry for splashing ginseng water on your face.

49
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,550
Thank you.

50
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,263
Hey, Buddy Cao.

51
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:13,449
Life is just beautiful. Why the sigh?

52
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,230
You wouldn't understand the struggles of chasing dreams.

53
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,560
They say the mountain will not come to Muhammad,

54
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,700
then Muhammad must go to the mountain.

55
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,830
But now? The problem has rolled away on its own!

56
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,720
Xiaoshang River is so far from here.

57
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,850
And yet Mu Dai had to personally deal with that Luo guy's mess.

58
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,800
If I'd been there, I'd never have let her go alone.

59
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,070
At least someone should've gone with her.

60
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,980
Unbelievable.

61
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,640
Poor thing.

62
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,221
Uncle Zhang, have you ever been to Xiaoshang River?

63
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,542
No.

64
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,173
Good. You shouldn't.

65
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:57,120
Listen, that place is extremely dangerous.

66
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,390
No one should go there alone.

67
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,970
Oh? You've been?

68
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,650
Of course, I have.

69
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,600
And that Luo Ren guy?

70
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,410
A holier-than-thou hypocrite.

71
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,620
Even Chubby called him a stalker.

72
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,750
You'd trust someone like that?

73
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,830
W-Wait, really?

74
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,310
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

75
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,970
Because...

76
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,460
Look, Little Boss Lady Dai is stubborn.

77
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,410
No phone call will bring her back. So, what do you do?

78
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,360
Must send a brave and resourceful person to assist her immediately.

79
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,950
Uncle Zhang, Madam Hong entrusted her to you.

80
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:34,720
If anything happens to her, well, you're responsible.

81
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,160
We do need to send someone reliable.

82
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,200
But who?

83
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,060
Would you stop hovering around me?

84
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,410
You're making me dizzy.

85
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,580
I see what's going on here.

86
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,720
You're just mooching off Uncle Zhang to dodge work

87
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,870
Look, it's normal for workers to want to slack off a bit.

88
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,050
Don't tell me you want to work.

89
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,960
Seriously, are you going to see Mu Dai?

90
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,860
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

91
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,790
I'll just snap a few pics and check in.

92
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:32,920
Hey, why don't you come with me?

93
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,040
Why would I? Uncle Zhang is only covering your food and lodging.

94
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,680
No perks for me.

95
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,330
You could just freeload off me.

96
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,730
You just need to pay your own travel costs.

97
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,140
Oh, please.

98
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,840
You just don't want to go alone and need a travel buddy.

99
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,000
That's a vicious misreading.

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,210
I have your best interests at heart.

101
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,390
Think about it. You want to be her disciple, right?

102
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,430
If she won't come to you, you go to her.

103
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,770
If she runs away, you chase her.

104
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,760
Traveling all the way to Xiaoshang River shows devotion.

105
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,050
Even the coldest one would be moved.

106
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,330
Go on.

107
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,060
All right. If that wretched woman ends up in trouble,

108
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,720
and you swoop in to save her, what would she do?

109
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,060
She'd beg you like

110
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,620
"Cao Yan Hua, you're a great disciple."

111
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,852
Thirteen-Thousand, you know, you come off as very annoying when you're saying these things,

112
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:37,940
but I have to admit,

113
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,100
you're a genius.

114
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,980
Let's go.

115
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,440
   

116
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,610
You've got food all over your face.

117
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,510
Take your time.

118
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,410
Go eat. I'll cover for you for a while.

119
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,135
You sure? You're still hurt.

120
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:02,184
Don't worry. I've rested well.

121
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,945
I'm mostly recovered.

122
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:05,615
All right.

123
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,550
Your lips are chapped.

124
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,532
Haven't had enough water.

125
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:15,480
Don't lick them.

126
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,360
It'll only make it worse. Drinking water won't help.

127
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,880
- Is that so? 
 - Do you have a lip balm?

128
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,760
I left in a hurry.

129
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,800
Use mine.

130
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,220
- I'll buy you one later. 
 - Thank you.

131
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,540
Wait.

132
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:41,581
I don't mind.

133
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,600
- All done. 
 - Thank you.

134
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,880
I'll go eat now.

135
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,460
Mu Dai, come here. Come and eat.

136
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,180
- Have a seat. 
 - Uncle Zheng.

137
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,920
Thank you.

138
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,720
- Thank you. 
 - You've helped us a lot these two days.

139
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,400
You have no idea how chaotic it was before.

140
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,360
Luo Ren's upstairs.

141
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,140
He's watching Ping Ting eat.

142
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,620
They're so close.

143
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,140
Of course.

144
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,780
When Luo Ren first came to the Luo family, he was stubborn and quiet.

145
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,640
But Ping Ting stuck to him like a shadow.

146
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,440
Followed him everywhere.

147
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,500
- Here, have some soup. 
 - Thank you, Uncle Zheng.

148
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,840
Later, Luo Ren left and no longer lived here.

149
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,440
But their bond stayed the same.

150
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,540
There was a time when his uncle and I even tried to set them up.

151
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,880
Who would have thought something like this would happen?

152
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,720
Setting them up?

153
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,960
But aren't they cousins?

154
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,040
Same surname, no blood relation.

155
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,320
Calling them cousins was just out of habit.

156
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,900
Just out of habit.

157
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,880
Go on, eat.

158
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,700
What's wrong with you?

159
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,660
You're here to help, remember?

160
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,220
Luo Ren and Ping Ting are a perfect match.

161
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,940
What's it to you?

162
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,680
Look at you.

163
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,920
Just do your job and stop overthinking.

164
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,860
We're out of drinks. Stop looking.

165
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,680
That's a nice building. Right?

166
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,360
Wait, wait, wait.

167
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,020
Hold on.

168
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,200
I think it's over there.

169
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,325
Keep going this way, and we'll be off course.

170
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:20,660
See that arrow? Right?

171
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,040
Yes. Any farther and we'll overshoot it.

172
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,020
Let's go.

173
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,920
This is it.

174
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,660
It has to be here.

175
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,220
I'll check in with Uncle Zhang.

176
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,860
There isn't even a doorbell.

177
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,260
I can't see. Move a bit to the side.

178
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,000
- A bit more. 
 - See anything?

179
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,360
- I see something. 
 - Are we trespassing?

180
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,120
I haven't gone inside. At most, it's peeking.

181
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,040
Fair point.

182
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,680
Any findings?

183
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,260
I don't see anything.

184
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,180
Are you blind?

185
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,060
There's a window boarded up with planks.

186
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,620
Boarded up?

187
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,340
Yeah.

188
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,480
And between the cracks, I see a woman!

189
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,700
Is that Mu Dai?

190
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:17,527
No. Definitely not her.

191
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,980
Maybe she's one of those imprisoned girls from the movies?

192
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,560
Get down now. Let's call the police.

193
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,940
No. We haven't even gotten a clear look.

194
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,560
If this turns out to be nothing, and Boss Lady Dai is still inside,

195
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,760
you think you can ever be her disciple, and I can get away with this?

196
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,500
That's true.

197
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,700
Keep observing, then. Try to get some useful information.

198
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,560
I see that Hummer.

199
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,580
Duh, it's Luo Ren's.

200
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,260
- Mu Dai. 
 - In a minute.

201
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,440
What's wrong?

202
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,560
 What else did you see? 

203
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,720
If I'm not mistaken, these two are from your bar, right?

204
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,880
 I saw a surveillance camera too. 

205
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,780
Make yourselves comfortable.

206
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,300
Here.

207
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,640
It's fine. Have some water.

208
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,480
Out with it. What are you two doing here?

209
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,580
Look, it's like this.

210
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,480
You've been gone for days. We missed you terribly.

211
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,400
Please, let's respect each other's intelligence.

212
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,040
Why beat around the bush?

213
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,760
Then you tell her.

214
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,240
Uncle Zhang is worried about you.

215
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,340
What's he worried about?

216
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,860
You're in an unfamiliar place, far from home,

217
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,280
and with a guy we know nothing about. He...

218
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,680
Well, Uncle Zhang doesn't know you.

219
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
He only knows you're a man. Well, she's a woman.

220
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,880
Of course, he'd be worried if the two of you went out together.

221
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,440
Right.

222
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,120
I'll explain things to Uncle Zhang.

223
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,840
You two head back where you came from.

224
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,180
Don't get in the way here.

225
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,520
Come on. We came all this way and haven't even sipped water.

226
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,065
- Ren. 
 - I just...

227
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:30,500
Hey, come on. Step outside for a sec.

228
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,780
Give me a hand. I bought too much stuff.

229
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,480
Luo Ren!

230
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,500
Uncle Zheng.

231
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,640
- Uncle Zheng. 
 - Uncle Zheng.

232
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,540
- Uncle Zheng. 
 - Who are you guys?

233
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,680
- They are... 
 - They are Mu Dai's friends.

234
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,440
They'll be staying here for a few days.

235
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,400
Perfect.

236
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,220
The lamb shank today is excellent.

237
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,100
I couldn't help but buy extra.

238
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,920
I was worried we couldn't finish it.

239
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,600
It's great that you're here. The more, the merrier.

240
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,840
Let's finish it.

241
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,380
- Here, let me grill it. 
 - I'll definitely help.

242
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,860
- Uncle Zheng. 
 - Uncle Zheng, I know how to handle lamb legs.

243
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,440
Let me take that.

244
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,840
- Thank you. 
 - We should have come earlier to help you.

245
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,841
- All right. 
 - Where's the kitchen?

246
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:07,900
- Come on. 
 - This way.

247
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,860
Over here. It's here.

248
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,920
All right. Come on.

249
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,020
- Uncle Zheng. 
 - Uncle Zheng.

250
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,320
- Have some grilled meat. 
 - Thank you.

251
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,805
It's so lively with you here.

252
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:31,200
- Have a taste. 
  - Thank you, Uncle Zheng. 

253
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,320
You're not letting us do anything.

254
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,740
Just sit and relax.

255
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,400
How nice.

256
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,900
How is it?

257
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,240
Not good.

258
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,460
- Really, it's not good. 
 - Give it to me. Hey, give me some.

259
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,240
Uncle Zheng, let me do that.

260
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,100
- You take some to Ping Ting. 
 - Oh, all right.

261
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,340
Uncle Zheng, this portion has more lean meat.

262
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,025
Uncle Zheng, switch all the utensils to disposable ones.

263
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:05,365
Don't let her touch anything hard again.

264
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,200
All right.

265
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Is this done?

266
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,260
Is it good?

267
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,500
The tomatoes are even better. I've had four already.

268
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,280
- Where is Thirteen- Thousand? 
 - He went to the toilet.

269
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,500
Such good lamb.

270
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,721
But he can't handle it. Weak stomach.

271
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:36,621
He gets diarrhea.

272
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,460
Uncle Zheng, are you all right?

273
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,000
My waist.

274
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,640
Did you twist it?

275
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,840
It's nothing.

276
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,680
You need to go upstairs, right? Let me help you.

277
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,640
All right.

278
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,780
Be careful.

279
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,580
Okay, thank you.

280
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,220
It's actually my fault.

281
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,580
I wasn't watching where I was going and strained my back.

282
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,040
It's fine. Just call me if you need anything.

283
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,540
All right, all right.

284
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,840
Could you carry this for me?

285
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,840
I won't look.

286
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,460
 The passcode is just six zeros? 

287
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,120
 That's so amateur. 

288
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,800
Ping Ting is sick.

289
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,100
Please keep your voice down.

290
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,520
Ping Ting, it's time to eat.

291
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,940
Ping Ting. Your favorite grilled meat.

292
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,260
Here, give it to me.

293
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,020
Help me.

294
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,100
It's tender. Have some more.

295
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,240
Help me, please.

296
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,440
What's on your mind?

297
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,320
You're still up?

298
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,740
I saw you from upstairs.

299
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,840
Did you eat something greasy, and now you have stomach trouble?

300
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,540
No. I was thinking about Ping Ting.

301
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:59,700
I just messaged Master Kun to ask for updates, but he hasn't replied yet.

302
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,820
This whole thing is just bizarre.

303
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,360
He's probably just as confused.

304
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,040
I don't think so.

305
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,380
He is an expert in this field.

306
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,520
Anyway, I believe in him.

307
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,260
Thank you.

308
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,260
Thank you.

309
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,200
Come on. Come here.

310
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,800
Do you remember me?

311
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,240
Earlier today, did you ask me for help?

312
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,980
All right. Then I'll get straight to the point.

313
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,600
I need to confirm two things.

314
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,180
First, are you Luo Ren's cousin?

315
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,260
Second, is your name Luo Ping Ting?

316
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes. Help me. Get me out of here.

317
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,180
I still need to call the police.

318
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,460
Tell me about your situation. I need to give them details.

319
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,340
Otherwise, even if I get you out, you won't get far.

320
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,500
They will catch you again. Right?

321
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,340
I am not Luo Ren's cousin.

322
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:24,014
What?

323
00:23:24,014 --> 00:23:26,874
All right, then tell me now.

324
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,140
I'll get you some warm water.

325
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,600
Thirteen-Thousand!

326
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,740
Cao Yan Hua.

327
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,600
Ping Ting!

328
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,000
Ping Ting.

329
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,460
Ping Ting!

330
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,140
Ping Ting!

331
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,320
Mu Dai!

332
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,920
 Pocketty, the image you sent is crucial. 

333
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,520
 It just hit me. 

334
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,120
 That pattern on the skin  might not be a pattern at all.

335
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,153
It could be text. Ancient text.

336
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:31,273
The ancient character for "blade."

337
00:25:31,982 --> 00:25:33,842
"Blade"?

338
00:25:35,374 --> 00:25:39,140
In every fishing line puppet murder scene, someone takes a blade.

339
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,960
Is this how a relic of ill omen kills?

340
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,640
This confirms one thing.

341
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,200
Every time this pattern appears, Ping Ting has an episode.

342
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,800
No wonder she's desperate to escape.

343
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,040
Luo Ren, you have to stop me from killing.

344
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,000
Lock me up.

345
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,180
Just like my uncle.

346
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,040
Driven to kill.

347
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,461
Then we'll keep constant watch over her and make sure she never gets to leave.

348
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:16,070
But what if she stays like this forever?

349
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,060
 And I don't think guarding her will work. 

350
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,560
Why not?

351
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,680
 Haven't you noticed? 

352
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,020
 Ping Ting is so desperate to escape 

353
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,300
 she even tried to jump from the third floor. It's so high. 

354
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,660
 High enough to kill her. 

355
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,160
So, why would she jump without hesitation?

356
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,720
Think about it.

357
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,960
Is there even the slightest possibility that she...

358
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,740
 What possibility? 

359
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:47,181
I'm just guessing.

360
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,797
Look...

361
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:58,772
the cases of Liu, Luo, and Ping Ting reveal a pattern.

362
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,780
The relic of ill omen...

363
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:08,160
only moves to another host after someone dies.

364
00:27:10,132 --> 00:27:15,480
If Ping Ting is kept locked up,

365
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,369
the relic of ill omen will decide she's useless.

366
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,540
So, it'll abandon her.

367
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,100
Then, it might force her to kill herself?

368
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,840
That's a possibility.

369
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,280
Someone has to die for the relic of ill omen to leave.

370
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,480
What about faking death?

371
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,700
Faking death? You'd have to stop your heartbeat and breathing.

372
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,520
Try pulling that off.

373
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,360
It's not a real solution anyway.

374
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,320
Once the relic of ill omen leaves, it'll just find a new host,

375
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,900
and that will harm innocent people.

376
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,700
We can't save Ping Ting at the expense of others.

377
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,945
 Pocketty, you're absolutely right. 

378
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,240
I'll keep researching.

379
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,460
I'll call you if I find anything.

380
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,200
 Hello? 

381
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,140
Just a power outage.

382
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,180
Scared me half to death.

383
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,779
Well, don't be frustrated.

384
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,481
Try to look on the bright side.

385
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:07,521
We're finally getting somewhere.

386
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,092
Mu Dai, you...

387
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:18,020
You're hurt.

388
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,420
- You mean this? 
 - Don't touch it.

389
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,460
It will breed bacteria.

390
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,620
Here.

391
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,440
Thank you.

392
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,320
By the way, I'll book two rooms at a nearby hotel.

393
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,380
You can take Cao Yan Hua and Thirteen-Thousand there.

394
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,600
Thirteen-Thousand messed up.

395
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,120
Kicking him out makes sense.

396
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,700
But you don't have to send me away, too, do you?

397
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,400
What are you talking about?

398
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,920
The window repairman is coming soon. It'll be noisy.

399
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,600
And you haven't slept all night, right?

400
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,320
Also, don't blame Thirteen-Thousand and Cao Yan Hua.

401
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,480
I'm sending them away for safety reasons.

402
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,856
Was it really Ping Ting who knocked me out?

403
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:39,257
I am so strong. How could she knock me out?

404
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:42,280
Strong? More like clueless.

405
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,680
All that talk about "surviving the streets since your teens"?

406
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,221
You'd better watch out. You're the type society weeds out.

407
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,641
You will be weeded out.

408
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,660
You came all this way to freeload, then turned the place upside down.

409
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,840
You two are something else.

410
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,960
Hey, Boss Lady Dai...

411
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,244
as law-abiding citizens, shouldn't we lend a helping hand

412
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:06,140
when we see a girl possibly being held captive? Right?

413
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,680
So, you're saying Luo Ren should reward you both, is that it?

414
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,200
What's so funny?

415
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,440
Go back to where you came from!

416
00:31:18,098 --> 00:31:19,799
This is all your fault.

417
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,859
You are also to blame.

418
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,340
 If Ping Ting is kept locked up, 

419
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,340
 the relic of ill omen will decide she's useless. 

420
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,680
 So, it'll abandon her. 

421
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,780
 Then, it might force her to kill herself? 

422
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,220
 What about faking death? 

423
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,360
 Faking death? You'd have to stop your heartbeat and breathing. 

424
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,980
 Try pulling that off. 

425
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:56,600
 Once the relic of ill omen leaves, it'll just find a new host, 

426
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,260
 and that will harm innocent people. 

427
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,860
 We can't save Ping Ting at the expense of others. 

428
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,743
Hello, Dr. Zhao.

429
00:32:10,743 --> 00:32:12,475
Please come by tomorrow.

430
00:32:12,475 --> 00:32:14,447
Money won't be an issue.

431
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:17,487
Bring your full emergency kit.

432
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,000
 Where are we going? 

433
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,880
 Since Ping Ting's asleep, I thought I'd take you out to see the desert. 

434
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,500
We could always see it after everything's settled.

435
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,740
Just take a ride with me.

436
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,380
The desert is so quiet at night.

437
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,580
Yes. I've always enjoyed driving at night.

438
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:55,240
It helps me calm down and think when I am troubled.

439
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,880
Scared?

440
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,940
No, are we going a bit too fast?

441
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,940
 If this were your last moment alive, what would you do? 

442
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,240
 What do you mean? 

443
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,180
Luo Ren! There's no road ahead, is there?

444
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,660
Stop the car!

445
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,070
   

446
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,840
That was terrifying.

447
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,800
How was it? This is a classic local experience.

448
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,140
Using visual illusions to simulate a brush with death.

449
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,800
I wasn't ready just now.

450
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,280
Let's do it again.

451
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,960
Only once.

452
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,120
It's no fun when you know what's coming.

453
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,020
So? How did it feel to have a brush with death?

454
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,060
Obviously, living is better.

455
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,800
I must cherish life and live well.

456
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,240
Live to be a hundred years old.

457
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,020
You will.

458
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,680
That was thrilling.

459
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,600
I've never seen so many stars.

460
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,980
Feels like I could reach out and grab one.

461
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,540
The stars are very far from us.

462
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,520
Their light takes years to reach Earth.

463
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,980
What we see now is the light they emitted long ago.

464
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,840
Just like that star, it might already be dead.

465
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,800
The way you put it, it's like all the stars hanging in the sky are skeletons.

466
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,420
And all starlight is like souls.

467
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,200
Did you come here often to see the stars?

468
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,460
I brought Ping Ting here before.

469
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,720
Ping Ting and I aren't related by blood.

470
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,680
I went to live with my uncle because of my father.

471
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,900
He had two wives.

472
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,140
Two wives?

473
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,940
My mother was his first wife.

474
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,342
She endured hardship with him and helped him build his career.

475
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:19,860
Later, when he finally made money,

476
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:24,620
he decided to pursue what he really wanted.

477
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,340
Like love.

478
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,340
That was just an excuse.

479
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,040
Later, that woman finally married into our family.

480
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,060
They didn't dare register the marriage.

481
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,540
But they had a grand wedding.

482
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,240
Even grander than my mother's.

483
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,320
Life was bearable at first.

484
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,000
But after that woman gave birth to a son, everything changed.

485
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,080
Two things happened to me that year.

486
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,900
First, I was nearly killed by a car.

487
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,780
Later, I was poisoned and had my stomach pumped.

488
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,071
Was it that woman's doing?

489
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,917
That's how it goes in dramas,

490
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:22,357
scheming over inheritance and such.

491
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,780
My mother thought so.

492
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,080
Where are you going?

493
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:39,560
So, she sent me to live with my uncle.

494
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,920
Ping Ting was only four or five back then.

495
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,460
She had two pigtails

496
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,140
and was holding a big wooden sword.

497
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,180
She said to me,

498
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:00,319
"Brother Ren, Dad said someone is bullying you."

499
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:04,558
"But don't be afraid. If they come after you again,"

500
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,880
I'll chop them."

501
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,942
Luo Wen Miao was my uncle.

502
00:37:12,942 --> 00:37:15,030
But he felt more like...

503
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,440
a father to me.

504
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,520
♫  Whenever memories whisper silently  ♫

505
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,540
After he passed away,

506
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,320
Ping Ting became my closest family.

507
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,540
Family.

508
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:40,120
♫  Together we brave the storms of adversity, oh ~  ♫

509
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:45,400
My uncle told me to stop him from killing.

510
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,743
♫  This unpredictable fate  ♫

511
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:49,560
But I failed.

512
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,120
♫  (Fate) Is like a cliff of thorns  ♫

513
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,440
♫  But we'll press onward through the pain  ♫

514
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,700
I told Ping Ting to guard my uncle,

515
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,920
assured her not to be afraid, that I'd handle everything.

516
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,960
But she went crazy.

517
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,440
♫  I just want to slowly love you with all my hope, oh ~  ♫

518
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,800
My words meant nothing.

519
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,160
I failed at every single thing.

520
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,520
♫  Through all the time we've spent together  ♫

♫  And countless memories  ♫

522
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,180
So this time,

523
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,640
♫  I just want to slowly, slowly hold you tight  ♫

524
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,700
I don't want Ping Ting to get hurt again.

525
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,080
♫  I'll shatter the mirage in the fading light  ♫

526
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,040
Mu Dai. Thanks for last night.

527
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,707
It's a pleasure to meet you.

530
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,960
Funny, someone held a knife to my throat when we first met.

531
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,200
Didn't seem too happy about it at all.

532
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,500
You still remember that?

533

This is for you.

For me?

537

♫  I'll shatter the mirage in the fading light  ♫

538
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,800
Next time you're reminded of this,

539
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,120
just take the knife out and stomp on it a few times to vent.

540

♫  I'll take your hand till the world ends  ♫

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,320
Don't dwell on the worst of me.

542
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,140
Then tell me, what is the best in you?

543

Hello, Uncle Zheng.

548
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,400
Mu Dai.

549
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,500
Did Luo Ren act strangely around you yesterday?

550
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,600
 Or did he say anything unusual? 

551
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,640
What do you mean?

552
00:40:29,438 --> 00:40:32,060
We're leaving just like that?

553
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:36,760
Listen, that wretched woman is furious right now.

554
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,360
We need to play along for now.

555
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,920
Know what this is called?

556
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,300
Strategic retreat.

557
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,680
Follow her.

558
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:57,830
Hey, I know their passcode. Let me handle this.

559
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,060
You're here.

560
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,440
- Luo Ren, open the door. 
 - You're all here.

561
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,780
- Luo Ren! 
 - Let me enter the code.

562
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,540
- Luo Ren! 
 - Hurry.

563
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,760
He's already changed it. You won't be able to open it.

564
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,600
Luo Ren, open the door!

565
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,780
- Luo Ren! 
 - Luo Ren!

566
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,800
Open the door!

567
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,140
- What should we do then? 
 - Now you need me!

568
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,740
You're hopeless.

569
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,080
A wise man won't sell his secrets, but shares them freely with friends.

570
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,580
Today, I'll show you something dirty.

571
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,500
Locks keep out gentlemen, not rogues.

572
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,420
Watch this.

573
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,040
See?

574
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,720
- Luo Ren. 
 - What's going on?

575
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,740
Luo Ren, what are you doing?

576
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,980
Luo Ren, don't be rash!

577
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,640
Luo Ren, what are you doing?

578
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,440
Luo Ren... Luo Ren!

579
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,160
You...

580
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,812
Luo Ren, you...

581
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:52,660
Quiet!

582
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,280
Uncle Zheng, is the doctor ready?

583
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,360
He's right next door.

584
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,040
- Doctor? 
 - Come on.

585
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:38,110
