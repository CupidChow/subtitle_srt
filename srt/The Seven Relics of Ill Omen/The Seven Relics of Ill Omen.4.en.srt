[Episode 4]

5
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,620
Come in.

6
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,460
Madam Hong,

7
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,420
what happened to Mr. Li?

8
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,420
You all know now.

9
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,580
I'm Li Yaqing.

10
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,900
The victim was Huo Zihong,

11
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,180
my twin sister.

12
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,620
[In Memory of Huo Zihong]
She shouldn't have died.

13
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,580
It should have been me.

14
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,460
The whole story

15
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,100
started with Zhang Guanghua.

16
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,900
Zhang Guanghua?

17
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,780
I asked Wan Fenghuo about him.

18
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,340
There doesn't seem to be
any connection between you.

19
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,660
I was pregnant
with Zhang Guanghua's child.

20
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,820
Back then,

21
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,420
he was a married man.

22
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,220
Normally,

23
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,660
such a scandal

24
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,820
could not be uncovered.

25
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,780
In those days,

26
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,580
in our small town,

27
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,660
Zhang Guanghua was handsome,

28
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,500
educated,

29
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,820
and naturally romantic.

30
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,780
He was melancholic,

31
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,660
lamenting his unhappy family.

32
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,300
He sweet-talked me,

33
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,380
promising to divorce for me.

34
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,940
I actually believed him.

35
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,260
By the time I was pregnant,

36
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,340
he had disappeared.

37
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,020
That's when I realized
how foolish I had been.

38
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,100
My parents
were deeply disappointed in me.

39
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,700
Gossip runs rampant in small towns.

40
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,780
To avoid prying eyes,

41
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,620
they took me elsewhere

42
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,860
to have the child aborted.

43
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,620
Take it easy.

44
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,660
Are you still dizzy?

45
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,140
Have some water.

46
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,780
I'll make you some noodles.

47
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,580
My father couldn't swallow
the injustice.

48
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,860
He pulled strings

49
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,940
and had Zhang Guanghua
transferred away.

50
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,540
Later, he introduced me to Li Tan.

51
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,220
But the atmosphere at home

52
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,740
was never the same again.

53
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,140
Food is ready.

54
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,300
Go ahead.

55
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,180
Why aren't you eating?

56
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,500
Does it not taste good?

57
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,740
Dad,

58
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,340
you should eat more greens.

59
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,420
I'm full.

60
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,820
You two go ahead.

61
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,740
I have work to do.

62
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,500
I was ashamed.

63
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,460
Never mind him.

64
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,860
It was all my fault.

65
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,660
Then one day,

66
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,500
Have some of the braised pork.

67
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,740
I got a call.

68
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,580
It was from Huo Zihong.

69
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,540
Madam Hong,

70
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,220
are you saying

71
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,540
your abducted sister
came back on her own?

72
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,780
She was targeted

73
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,540
and secretly taken away.

74
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,460
Later, the couple who took her
had a car accident.

75
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,060
Before they died,

76
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,180
they told her the truth.

77
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,980
So she moved back to Luoma Lake

78
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,700
and lived in Chenqian Alley.

79
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,100
She found my number in the phone book

80
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,660
and gave me a call.

81
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,580
Oh my goodness.

82
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,740
We look exactly alike.

83
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,180
Let me see.

84
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,380
Just identical.

85
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,620
My gosh, exactly the same.

86
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,620
Perhaps it's true
that blood is thicker than water.

87
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,420
Though it was our first meeting,

88
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,780
there was no distance between us.

89
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,580
We were as close
as if we'd never been apart.

90
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,700
Zihong, come here.

91
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,900
I realized then

92
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,580
Sit down.

93
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,100
that this was a good thing.

94
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,900
A great joy.

95
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,620
So delicious.

96
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,060
It would lift the gloom at home.

97
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:56,700
Here.

98
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,100
I wanted to pick the perfect day

99
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,620
to introduce her properly

100
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,060
and give my parents a surprise.

101
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,660
So silly.

102
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,940
Then

103
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,060
came on the day

104
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,300
of our birthday.

105
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,460
Zihong.

106
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,660
Yaqing.

107
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,300
You look beautiful.

108
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,020
Come in.

109
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,180
I'm still a bit nervous.

110
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,460
It's alright. Come in.

111
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,740
Is that Li Tan?

112
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,900
No.

113
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,420
Just the cake I ordered.

114
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,420
Come in.

115
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,940
Just relax.

116
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,220
Make yourself at home.

117
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,500
Take off your coat.

118
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,060
Just do everything like normal.

119
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,140
Don't be afraid.

120
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,620
I'll hide in the closet.

121
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,620
Here.

122
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,180
Will this work?

123
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,060
It's fine.

124
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,220
Remember, you are now Li Yaqing.

125
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,260
I'm Huo Zihong.

126
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,580
Just do whatever you need to do.

127
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,220
Hurry up.

128
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,380
Go on.

129
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,580
Yaqing,

130
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,060
bring me some hot water.

131
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,780
In a minute.

132
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,740
What are you standing there for?

133
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,060
Give me the water.

134
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,740
Silly girl.

135
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,060
Is... Is everything okay?

136
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,780
Mom?

137
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,540
Mom!

138
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,820
What's wrong?

139
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,780
What are you doing?

140
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,460
You...

141
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,740
Dad!

142
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:39,900
No.

143
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,940
No, don't.

144
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,260
Stay back!

145
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,780
No! Please, no!

146
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,020
No, no!

147
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,780
Don't...

148
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,180
Don't come any closer!

149
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,620
My mind went completely blank.

150
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,060
I kept telling myself

151
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,180
not to go out.

152
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,180
If I did, it'd all be over.

153
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,860
Then

154
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,460
everything faded

155
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,060
and I passed out.

156
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,380
What happened next?

157
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,860
Was the person

158
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,300
really using fishing line?

159
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,220
When I woke up,

160
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,500
I vaguely

161
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,980
heard him going out.

162
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,180
After I crawled out of the closet...

163
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,340
Madam Hong.

164
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,900
I saw

165
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,180
the bodies of my parents

166
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,860
and my sister.

167
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,380
Madam Hong.

168
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,780
They were hung in the middle of the room
with fishing line.

169
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,020
Mom!

170
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,540
I completely lost my mind.

171
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,740
I grabbed a knife from the floor

172
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,540
and ran out.

173
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
How ironic.

174
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,100
The man I loved with all my heart

175
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,180
and who was always on my mind

176
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,460
could kill me and my family

177
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,660
so brutally.

178
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,900
I kept asking why.

179
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,740
Why would he do this to me?

180
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
Did you call the police?

181
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,260
No.

182
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,940
I was numb at first.

183
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,980
I wasn't thinking about anything.

184
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,860
But then,

185
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,500
I felt

186
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,180
a fire burning within me.

187
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,460
I wanted to kill him myself.

188
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,300
I wanted to kill this beast

189
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,860
most cruelly.

190
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,780
I wanted to make him suffer

191
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,580
exactly as he had made us suffer!

192
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,900
Madam Hong.

193
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,300
He didn't go home that night.

194
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,020
He went
to the long-distance bus station.

195
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,860
I followed him.

196
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,380
Bought the same ticket.

197
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,660
Boarded the same bus.

198
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,780
Hatred can transform a person
in an instant.

199
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,620
I was able

200
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,340
to disguise myself so calmly

201
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,180
and follow him

202
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,900
without being noticed.

203
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,500
After two days and nights

204
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,980
and multiple transfers,

205
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,540
we finally arrived

206
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,300
in Datong.

207

[Datong]

208
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,340
After what he'd done,

209
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,820
that beast could still

210
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,220
eat calmly.

211
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,500
What are you doing?

212
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,940
Pay the bill.

213
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,180
Why are you running?

214
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Are you in a hurry to kick the bucket?

215
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,540
The flood discharge
starts in three minutes.

216
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,860
Residents downstream
of the floodgates must evacuate now.

217
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,900
The flood discharge
starts in three minutes.

218
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,380
Residents downstream
of the floodgates must evacuate now.

219
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,100
Ya... Yaqing?

220
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,820
How could it be you?

221
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,140
How could it be me?

222
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,020
What do you think?

223
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,300

224
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,660
What did I ever do

225
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,980
to make you want to kill me?

226
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,180
And even my family!

227
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,780
Why did you kill them?

228
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,420
Why?

229
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,380
I didn't want to kill you!

230
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,500
I swear I didn't!

231
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,700
I don't know why!

232
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,500
Why did you do this to me?

233
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,300
Answer me!

234
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,820
You devil!

235
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,820
Go to hell!

236
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,940
Of course, I was no match
for Zhang Guanghua.

237
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,380
I was losing strength.

238
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,740
But maybe my family

239
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,580
was protecting me.

240
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,620
I managed to climb up
along the guardrail.

241
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,540
I sat there all night,

242
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,780
thinking.

243
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,460
I didn't kill anyone.

244
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,740
But Zhang Guanghua's death

245
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,620
was indirectly caused by me.

246
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,860
And if I went back,

247
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,100
I'd have to explain everything
to the police.

248
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,060
Then our affair

249
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,420
would've been exposed.

250
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,100
In those days, in that small town,

251
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,380
gossip could ruin lives.

252
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,740
Even my dead parents

253
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,620
would be dragged through the mud.

254
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
At dawn,

255
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,380
watching the sunrise,

256
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,020
I suddenly felt

257
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,220
heaven had given me a second chance.

258
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,460
So

259
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,980
you decided to impersonate Huo Zihong?

260
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,260
The murderer was dead.

261
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,100
My family was avenged.

262

Li Yaqing's old life

263
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,580
was over.

264
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,220
It was best

265
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,740
to start fresh with a new name.

266
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,900
You already knew Zhang Guanghua's fate,

267
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,220
yet you still asked Wan Fenghuo
about him?

268
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,100
I need to see him, alive or dead.

269
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,100
I couldn't rest easy

270
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,940
without confirmation.

271
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,260
Then what about Mr. Li?

272
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,740
Didn't you think about him?

273
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,380
No.

274
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Not at all.

275
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,500
I only dated Li Tan

276
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,540
to make my father happy.

277
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,380
So you never loved him?

278
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,340
It was all an act?

279
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,300
Is that what you told him?

280
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,060
He looked devastated earlier.

281
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,620
He left without a word.

282
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,380
Madam Hong,

283
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,060
don't you think this is cruel?

284
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,380
He'll see his entire life's devotion

285
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,540
as a joke.

286
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,620
At least you could tell him a white lie.

287
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,340
It's exactly

288
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,260
because he wasted half his life

289
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,220
that I don't want him

290
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,540
to keep wasting it

291
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,620
on someone like me.

292
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,620
That's enough.

293
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,220
I've told you everything I need to.

294
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,460
I'm tired.

295
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,740
You should go now.

296
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,300
You don't need to feel sorry for Li Tan.

297
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,580
Love can't be faked.

298

He will find out the truth eventually.

299
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,540
He deserves to know.

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,900
Things seem to be clearer,

301
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,780
but also confusing.

302
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,580

What are you going to do next?

304
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,140
Investigating may lead nowhere.

305
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,300
And even if it does,
it might not be satisfying.

306
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,100
I'll take it step by step.

307
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,580

That's wise.

310
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,780
It's more reassuring for you
to be by Pingting's side.

But when I think about

317
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,700
how my cowardice and avoidance

318

brought misfortune to so many,

to waste half their lives,

320

384
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,100
have a little chat with me

385
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,380
and offer some free service

386
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,460
to keep me interested?

387
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,860
You're right.

388
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,780
That makes a lot of sense.

389
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,420
Alright.

390
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,580
So what would you like to discuss?

391
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,900
Well,

392
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,500
you handled the Luoma Lake case.

393
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,380
And you know it's full of doubts

394
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,340
and weird aspects.

395
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,780

you've got connections.

397
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,220
Do you know any reliable experts,

398
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,700
like someone who studies

399
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,700
supernatural phenomena?

400
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,660
I figure

401
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,540
it's best to consult experts,

402
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:51,940
right?

403
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260

An expert in supernatural phenomena.

Also deeply interested
in ancient mysticism and aliens.

410

He's known in the field as Master Kun.

411
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,380
He's a walking encyclopedia

412
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,060
and has read countless ancient texts.

413
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,180
A true polymath.

414
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,660
You can consult him about this.

Hello, Mr. Mighty.

417

Mr. Kun, hi.

418

Wan's referral?

421
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,820
He mentioned you.

422
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,740
Honestly, that guy...

423
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,060
I've been busy writing a book lately.

424
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,380
But since you're his friend,

425
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,140

Here's the thing.

428
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,180
In your research, have you ever

429
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,380
encountered cases

430
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,700
where a person
is controlled by some force,

431
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,060
leading them to do

432
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,900
bad things against their will?

433
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,940
And this force

434
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,940
can leave the body and harm others?

435
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,820
Your description is rather vague.

436
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,900
Maybe I'm not phrasing it well.

437
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,100
Listen,

if you want answers,

439
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,900
you need to provide five specifics:

who, what,

441
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
when, where,

442

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,020

446
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,740
Yes.

447
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,220
Each victim was missing a piece of skin.

448
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,380
Quite rectangular.

449
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,060
Rectangular?

450
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,020
How precise? Any measurements?

Twenty-three point five centimeters long

454
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,740
and five centimeters wide.

455
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,500
That's not very rectangular.

456
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,620
That's the size of a long strip.

00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
This size

458
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,380

459
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,340
and highly indicative.

460
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,620
Very special?

00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,140
From your reaction,

or learn history, do you?

that's about
twenty-three point five centimeters.

470
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,220
Twenty-three point five
multiplied by five.

471

That was the common size
for all wooden slips.

That's why I'm calling you that.

while talking,

494
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,940
it means he considers you a friend.

00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,260

Be gentle.

00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,100
Nothing.

529
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,700
Pingting just had a fall.

530
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,620

What are you doing?

533
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,700
Why do you sound so far away?

534
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,980
Then I'll move closer.

I'm fine.

538
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,660
By the way,

539
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,780
what else did Mr. Kun mention?

540
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,300
Nothing else for now.

541
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,900
He heard about it over ten years ago

542
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,740
during his travels up north.

543
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,260
It's a kind of folk tale.

544
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,020
The records are limited.

545
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,700
What are you standing there for?

546
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,700
You're bleeding out.

547
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,700
This isn't how you treat a wound.

548
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,220
Mr. Zheng, please get me some water.

549
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,060
Alright, sure.

550
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,340
But that cut is so deep.

551
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,020
What if

552
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,580
it gets infected?

553
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,460
You're injured?

554
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,540
Is it serious?

555
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,060
Nothing. Just a scratch.

556
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,260
I got careless.

557
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,820
What happened?

558
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,060
Pingting's condition

559
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,460
has worsened.

560
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,780
She's started attacking people,

561
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,620
and she doesn't just do it randomly.

562
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,060
She actually

563
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,820
uses strategies.

564
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,460
Strategies?

565
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,020
Yes.

566
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,940
She first sabotaged the lamp,

567
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,260
then pretended to be hit by it.

568
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,380
Thankfully, I got there in time.

569
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,060
What's your plan now?

570
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,780
I just gave her a sedative.

571
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,580
Then I dismissed the caregiver.

572
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,020
With Pingting like this,

573
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,060
I don't dare let anyone near her.

574
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,620
Do you need help?

575
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,420
It's fine. But with her like this,

576
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
there's no one I can turn to.

577
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,420
Me.

578
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:36,940
You?

579
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,420
Forget it.

580
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,220
Pingting is dangerous now.

581
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,380
Luo Ren,

582
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,220
are you doubting me

583
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,860
or my skills?

584
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,740
Mr. Zheng is getting old,

585
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,700
you're injured,

586
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,860
and Pingting is unstable.

587
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,940
You need someone
who can restrain her, watch over her,

588
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,340
and help with personal care.

589
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,940
Who else fits better than me?

590
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,260
That's not appropriate.

591
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,380
And you're in Lixi.

592
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,580
It's too much trouble.

593
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,740
I'm not offering to help for free.

594
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,700
I have conditions.

595
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,420
What conditions?

596
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,340
You know I'm in Lixi.

597
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,660
You're covering
my round-trip flight tickets, right?

598
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,300
No problem.

599
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
And room and board?

600
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:26,980
Sure.

601
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,460
Mu Dai.

602
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,900
Thank you.

603
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,220
Come on, we're friends.

604
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,300
It's a matter of urgency.

605
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,140
Don't be so formal.

606
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:47,980
Well,

607
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,300
see you later.

608
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,620
I brought a suitcase.

609
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,700
Let me get that.

610
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,820
Thank you.

611
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,300
Luo Ren.

612
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,340
Sorry,

613
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,940
I couldn't pick you up,

614
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,980
and you had to take a cab.

615
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,500
It's fine. You're injured.

616
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,900
It's nothing.

617
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,820
Serves you right.

618
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,300
This morning,
when changing the dressing,

619
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,820
the wound was still bleeding like crazy.

620
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,500
You always

621
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,100
play the tough guy.

622
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,340
Old folks exaggerate.

623
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,500
Let's go.

624
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,900
Pingting.

625
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,780
Mu Dai.

626
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,460
This iron gate is new.

627
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,980
Here's the switch.

628
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,500
Usually, meals are passed
through this opening.

629
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,380
All utensils are made of paper.

630
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,900
Let me.

631
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:25,860
Pingting?

632
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,580
What's going on?

633
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,820
Hasn't she showered in days?

634
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,780
Time to get to work.

635
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,420
Pingting?

636
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,100
Here.

637
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,340
Pingting,

638
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,900
this is Mu Dai.

639
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,380
She's here to help you.

640
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,820
Be good, will you?

641
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:03,820
Let's go.

642
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,220
Come on.

643
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,060
