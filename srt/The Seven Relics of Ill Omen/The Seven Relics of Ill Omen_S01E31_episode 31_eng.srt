1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,040
 

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:24,070



3
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,390
title

4
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,020
 

5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,018
 

6
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,202
This tree looks exactly like the one
I saw in the vision.

7
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:24,500
Everyone, don't make any rash moves.

8
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,100
This is the final battle.

9
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,680
This tree...

10
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,540
Free!

11
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,740
- Catch it!
- Free.

12
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,040
You're tall enough. You can reach it.

13
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,400
Free, don't act impulsively.

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,520
Is it hungry? Haven't you...?

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,020
I've been feeding it all along.

16
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,020
Do you think Free might be influenced by the seventh relic of ill omen,

17
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,440
and now it's acting like a woodpecker?

18
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:54,280
I saw light flowing within the burl in the vision.

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,240
Now Free is chasing after it.

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,840
Is the relic of ill omen inside the burl?

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,460
I don't think so.

22
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,900
We had such a perilous time getting the first six.

23
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,060
Would the seventh just be there for us to take?

24
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,160
How would we know unless we try?

25
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,980
Well?

26
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,980
It seems like the relic of ill omen
is really inside.

27
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,140
Is it really there?

28
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,340
- I think...
- Be careful.

29
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,260
I'll cut it down.

30
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,100
It's appearing.

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,635
 

32
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,340
Be careful. Don't jostle it out.

33
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,060
So what if I do?

34
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,160
It's just a freebie anyway.
Is it going to cause any trouble?

35
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,520
What's wrong?

36
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,460
I just checked on the relics of ill omen
through the surveillance.

37
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,152
Their color is still fading.

38
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:15,652
Shouldn't the cycle of seven sevens restart?

39
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,180
Let's hope it's just a slow reaction.

40
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,220
Mu Dai. This one was too easy to subdue.

41
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,520
I feel like something is off

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,780
Then let's not rush back.

43
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,700
Should we observe at Fengzi Ridge
for a couple more days?

44
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,400
I'll have my senior securely send over the relics of ill omen from Lixi.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
The reunion of all seven should lead to new clues.

46
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,300
 

47
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,380
The color seems to have faded quite a bit.

48
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,512
Come on.

49
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:05,552
You're quite strong.

50
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,640
Now, we'll let your family reunite.

51
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,904
Three, two, one, go!

52
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,080
- Oh my god!
- Oh my god!

53
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,200
How did these seven get twisted together?

54
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,700
Radishie, draw some blood.

55
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,220
Don't just stand there.

56
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,680
Let's see if there's
any shadow of water this time.

57
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,164
Come on.

58
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,220
I'll seal you away even if it kills me!

59
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,740
It's just a life.

60
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,100
Take it!

61
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,980
Take care. I'll be right there!

62
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,960
It's just a death ritual.

63
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,920
I'll go ahead!

64
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:06,852
So, this time you saw a different shadow of water?

65
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,580
Previously, it was always the story
of the Literate Dog.

66
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,580
Why is it like this now?

67
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,100
The previous shadows of water
released the memories of the Literate Dog.

68
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,860
This time is different.

69
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,040
With all seven gathered, it should release more crucial and significant memories.

70
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,620
Why does it look like the scene of the previous sealing?

71
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,380
Exactly.

72
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,232
They're dressed in ancient costumes, and they look very familiar.

73
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:38,600
I remember now. Last time
we went to the Guansi Memorial Archway.

74
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,980
Didn't Yu Qiao Ran, Meihua Yi Zhao and others
look like this?

75
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,540
Wait, what are you guys talking about?

76
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,240
Am I the only one worried about the death ritual?

77
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,740
What's a "death ritual"?

78
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,000
The records in the Guansi Memorial Archway never mention a death ritual.

79
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,780
Do you still remember?

80
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,940
The relics of ill omen will grow.

81
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:04,340
I analyze that with each growth, their energy will strengthen.

82
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,340
Consequently, the methods
to subdue them will also change.

83
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,440
Perhaps during the era of the Great Virtuous One,

84
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,380
they could be lured into the wooden slips

85
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,920
and sealed with the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

86
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,820
However, during the era of Meihua Yi Zhao,

87
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,405
the difficulty increased.

88
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:24,401
His letter also stated,

89
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:29,880
"This time, subduing it will not be easy."

90
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,100
So, aside from the death ritual, do we have no other options to completely seal them?

91
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,652
Well, we can only seal them by sacrificing.

92
00:07:44,652 --> 00:07:46,520
And if we can't seal them, we'll die.

93
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,180
Look how clever this is.

94
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,280
We've been through a life-or-death struggle!

95
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,680
Death?

96
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,580
I'm concerned about my life.

97
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,520
After surviving all those near-death
experiences, you still want me to die?

98
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,980
Why should I die?

99
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,420
I'm no saint. Let anyone die if they must.

100
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,180
We're all doomed!

101
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,540
 
 In just two days, the Ilta Star 

102
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,980
 will reach its optimal observation time. 

103
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,740
 Astronomers say this phenomenon
occurs only once every 289 years. 

104
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,160
 However, it is important to note that under the influence of the Ilta Constellation, 

105
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,500
 the geomagnetic indices
will experience sustained fluctuations. 

106
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,140
 This may trigger extreme weather or even natural disasters in some regions. 

107
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,580
 Citizens are advised
to minimize outdoor activities. 

108
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,220
 

109
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,880
Mr. Kun said he's on his way.

110
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,656
He told us not to lose hope.

111
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:03,520
Not to lose hope?

112
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,260
What good is that?

113
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,280
Meihua Yi Zhao had the Imperishable Wood and the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle,

114
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,840
yet still needed a death ritual.

115
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,560
And us?

116
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,800
We've got nothing. Not even worthy of a death ritual.

117
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,760
What are you doing?

118
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,540
Come back!

119
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,620
Drink up. Order whatever you like.

120
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,320
There might not be many chances left.

121
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,780
Drink up!

122
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320

- Yeah.
- See?

166
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,920
And I even scoured three convenience stores to piece together this cake.

167
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,060
It was a bit rushed. But you have to accept it.

168
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,780
Happy birthday!

169
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,620
The birthday star shouldn't cry.

170
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,260
Wipe those tears away. Make a wish.

171
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,596
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

172
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:13,300
Make a wish.

173
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,760
I hope we find a new way to subdue the relics of ill omen tomorrow.

174
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,160
Why did you wish for that?

175
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,260
Make a wish for yourself.

176
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:30,400
Alright. I wish the heavens favor the just and we can all make it through.

177
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,020
Many years later, we'll still be together.

178
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,860
Even when our hair turns gray,

179
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,060
we'll still celebrate birthdays
and hang out together.

180
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,660
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

181
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,760
Happy birthday, Yan Hong Sha!

182
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,040
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

183
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,420
- Let's drink up.
- Come on.

184
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,060
Drink up. Party time.

185
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,500
Here, the bottle opener.

186
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,280
To the Phoenix Squad!

187
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,780
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

188
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,745
I think Chubby is right.

189
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,626
We have been walking the right path.

190
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:12,095
Good people should be rewarded.

191
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:14,820
This can't be how it ends.

192
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,129
You're right.

193
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:20,268
Yes, it shouldn't be like this.

194
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,780
We'll never accept it.

195
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,280
Doesn't sealing the relics of ill omen require a lot of power?

196
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,000
What power do the dead have?

197
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,500
Wake up!

198
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,000
The siblings, parents, uncles and aunts,

199
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,082
and grandparents
of the relics of ill omen are all here!

200
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:17,398
Mr. Kun, what's wrong with you?

201
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:21,600
I've repeatedly emphasized not to lose hope.

202
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,860
There's always
a way around every difficulty, right?

203
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,360
I even splurged on my favorite
chicken bucket to cheer you up.

204
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,120
Look at you all moping around.

205
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:36,522
Morning.

206
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:39,297
Where's Radishie?

207
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:40,942
He said he needed some fresh air.

208
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:42,862
No idea where he went.

209
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,960
What's wrong with all of you?

210
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:54,660
Anyone wants to give it a try?

211
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,960
Connect to the exit in ten seconds.

212
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,260
The prize is 500 yuan!

213
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,120
 

214
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,640
I'll do it.

215
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,640
- Ready?
- Yes.

216
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,240
Go.

217
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,720
Time's up.

218
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,320
This is a scam.

219
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,920
The maze is huge and chaotic.

220
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,880
Even tracing the solution would take a minute.

221
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,785
Ten seconds is impossible.

222
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:30,180
How is it impossible?

223
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,940
One second is enough.

224
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,020
One second? Show me.

225
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,080
Then you try.

226
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,720
You're not following the rules.

227
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,080
- Is this allowed?
- Drawing like this?

228
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,200
If that counts, anyone can do it.

229
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,264
- Exactly.
- Indeed.

230
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:49,080
The rule says to connect to the exit.

231
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,920
But it never said you had to follow the lines.

232
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,320
Facing a dead end,
sticking to the rules leads nowhere.

233
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,560
Only by thinking outside the box can you find a new way.

234
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,020
- What was that?
- What nonsense.

235
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,200
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go.

236
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,080
Scammer.

237
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,320
On the way, I kept thinking

238
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,640
that if the Imperishable Wood

239
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,020
is a vessel that stabilizes
the activity of the relics of ill omen,

240
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,020
then the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle is the inhibitor that reduces their activity.

241
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,460
So, as long as we have these two functions,

242
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,920
we can seal the relics of ill omen

243
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,240
even without the Imperishable Wood and the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

244
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
Mr. Kun is right.
We have what we need in this room.

245
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,520
Luo?

246
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,500
The solution's right here in this room.

247
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,600
- Where? 
 - Let's be clear.

248
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,660
We refuse a death ritual.

249
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,280
But we can't just give up, right?

250
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,100
Even if we want to give up,

251
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,160
once the cycle of seven sevens ends

252
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,580
and the relics of ill omen escape,
will they spare us?

253
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,480
And they already know everything about our families and friends.

254
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,440
I'm really worried they'll target them.

255
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,960
We lack the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle
and the Imperishable Wood

256
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,920
and can't complete the so-called death ritual.

257
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,880
So we have to find another way.

258
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,220
What's your idea?

259
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,210
My idea is

260
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,600
the Living Buckle.

261
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,040
Living Buckle?

262
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,400
The Living Buckle means drawing the relics of ill omen into our bodies.

263
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,320
We'll use our bodies as living Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle and Imperishable Wood.

264
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,260
Who?

265
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,280
Well, I have to say Radishie's idea is quite interesting.

266
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,280
You are indeed living vessels and inhibitors.

267
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,403
Mr. Kun, does that mean it's feasible?

268
00:18:52,403 --> 00:18:54,100
Well, not really.

269
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,340
I... It's unprecedented.

270
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,080
I can't guarantee anything.

271
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,800
But it's definitely unconventional.

272
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,580
There's potential for unexpected success.

273
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,080
So what's the success rate of this unexpected victory?

274
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,320
Either it succeeds or fails.

275
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,800
50-50. 50%, I guess.

276
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,080
50%.

277
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,680
50.

278
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,880
If it's 50%, I'm in.

279
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,720
Better than a 100% fatal death ritual. Right?

280
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,700
Count me in.

281
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,600
Me too. We don't have other options anyway.

282
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,200
This is what the Plum Blossom Sect does.

283
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,780
If not us, then who? Right, Master?

284
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,160
Kill all demonic blocks.

285
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,100
Let's go take our chances.

286
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,380
Alright.

287
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,860
Then let's go take our chances tomorrow.

288
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,340
Come on.

289
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,120
Also, I got you a massage chair.

290
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,400
I know. I've been worried about your back.

291
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,860
And Dad's drinking.

292
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,260
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

293
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,040
- Don't push him too hard.
- How's business at the shop lately?

294
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,660
I don't think quitting is the answer.

295
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,900
I'll send him some good stuff.

296
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,440
Listen, stop sourcing from Beard.

297
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,280
Most of the wine he sells is counterfeit.

298
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,844
If you're shorthanded, just hire a few helpers.

299
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:20,304
You'll manage.

300
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:25,720
I just wanted to say
if I don't make it back this time,

301
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,020
just sell everything in my room.

302
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,540
Or throw it all away if you prefer.

303
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:36,100
I'm not terminally ill.

304
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,380
Memorize my bank card PIN.

305
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,765
You can tell Ping Ting.

306
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:46,171
Alright. That's all.

307
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:47,991
Mr. Zheng.

308
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,280
It's nothing.

309
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,540
I'll hang up now.

310
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,740
Finished your call?

311
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:17,300
What? You're not calling Madam Hong?

312
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,600
After careful consideration, I've decided not to.

313
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,600
The more I say, the more she'll overthink things.

314
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,520
Ren, it'll be fine.

315
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,577
Human determination conquers all.

316
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:36,677
Everyone will be safe.

317
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,920
The slopes at Fengzi Ridge are quite challenging indeed.

318
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,980
I really don't get it.

319
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,160
If we're just absorbing the relics of ill omen,

320
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,720
why can't we do it lying in our beds?

321
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,640
Why trek all the way
to this so-called origin site?

322
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,800
The ancient texts state all previous sealings occurred at the origin site.

323
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,100
There must be a reason.

324
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,680
We should follow the records.

325
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,121
Exactly. Something this important deserves a proper ceremony.

326
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:32,380
You're just lazy.

327
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,140
You call this lazy? So heavy.

328
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,460
Is this the tree?

329
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,920
Yes.

330
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:58,765
Could this be where the meteorite fell millions of years ago?

331
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,129
 ♫ Whenever memories whisper silently ♫ 

332
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:28,740
Mu Dai.

333
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,600
It's snowing.

334
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,040
 ♫ Together we brave the storms of adversity, oh ♫ 

335
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,400
Perfect timing for the snow.

336
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,630
Then these phoenixes
will be the first to turn white.

337
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,750
 ♫ This fickle fate ♫ 

338
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,861
 ♫ Is like a cliff of thorns ♫ 

339
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:53,300
Mu Dai.

340
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,960
 ♫ Through the pain we march on ♫ 

341
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,720
When we return safely...

342
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,048
 ♫ Dreams arrive where perseverance holds fast ♫ 

343
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:00,420
let's get married.

344
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:06,620
 ♫ See our future, I believe, I believe,
I believe love's horizon awaits ♫ 

345
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,160
We'll come back when we're old.

346
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,640
 ♫ Just want to slowly love you
with all my hope, oh ♫ 

347
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,060
Phoenixes whitened by snow, couples growing old together.

348
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,740
Alright. We'll come back when we're old.

349
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:23,400
 ♫ Countless memories forever ♫ 

350
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,901
 ♫ Just want to slowly, slowly hold you tight ♫ 

351
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,310
 ♫ Shatter the mirage in fading light ♫ 

352
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,840
 ♫ Face the authentic future ahead ♫ 

353
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,101
 ♫ I'll take your hand till the world ends ♫ 

354
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:43,360
This snow is beautiful.

355
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,580
Like a wedding veil.

356
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,820
Almost makes me want to fall in love.

357
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:54,260
 ♫ See our future, I believe, I believe,
I believe love's horizon awaits ♫ 

358
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,475
 ♫ Just want to slowly love you
with all my hope, oh ♫ 

359
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:02,600
I really hate to ruin the moment.

360
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,180
But shouldn't we be doing something?

361
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:11,412
It does kill the mood.

362
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,280
Let's begin.

363
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,580
It's time.

364
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,560
You go first.

365
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,500
Well...

366
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,020
I'll go first.

367
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,273
Mr. Kun, if...

368
00:25:56,273 --> 00:25:58,733
If anything happens to me,

369
00:26:03,456 --> 00:26:05,176
don't hesitate.

370
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,940
Radishie, it's been ten minutes.

371
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,740
You were the first one injected. Do you feel anything?

372
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,245
Not really.

373
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:11,285
Nothing at all?

374
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,580
What about you two? Do you feel any different?

375
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,480
My neck hurts a little.

376
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:29,700
Did I sleep on it wrong?

377
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,480
Most likely.

378
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,260
And you? Any changes?

379
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,280
Me? Nothing.

380
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,140
Just feeling warm by the fire.

381
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,540
Any different sensations for you guys?

382
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,525
Anything at all?

383
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:49,840
I don't feel anything.

384
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,160
Just hungry. I want to eat something.

385
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,960
I do.

386
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,320
I need to take a dump.

387
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,880
That's it?

388
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,360
Nothing else?

389
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,360
Then that means no feeling.

390
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,960
Mr. Kun.

391
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,320
You're... Feeling it now?

392
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,885
No.

393
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:12,446
My car's still at Ding Lao Jiu's place.

394
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:13,722
Take it back for me.

395
00:28:13,722 --> 00:28:15,480
The one I spent ages modifying.

396
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,520
You're not feeling anything, yet you're talking

397
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,160
- about your car?
- Mr. Kun.

398
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,460
I've got a request too.

399
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,440
If I die, can you take care of Free Cao for me?

400
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,833
Just one thing.

401
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,480
You love chicken too much. Can you quit it?

402
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,626
Then you take care of Madam Hong for me too.

403
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,540
I... Kids say the darndest things.

404
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,440
They speak without restraint.

405
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,420
You're not feeling anything, yet you're making all these arrangements?

406
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,319
No feeling is a good thing.

407
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,561
You scared me to death.

408
00:28:42,561 --> 00:28:45,240
I was so nervous. I broke into a sweat.

409
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,400
Listen, this is a historic moment!

410
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,840
- Really?
- This is a moment worth remembering!

411
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,700
Just now, with the two of you standing here

412
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,280
and snow falling from the sky,
it was breathtaking.

413
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,480
Let's take a photo. So beautiful.

414
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,840
Come on, stand over here.

415
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,020
Hurry up, come on!

416
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,300
Stand over here.

417
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,720
- Make sure the tree's in the shot.
- Good point.

418
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,800
Get the whole tree in.

419
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,840
This is a good thing.

420
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,120
- We're fine!
- We were due for some luck, right?

421
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,220
- Alright. Come on, strike a pose.
- No side effects at all.

422
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,660
It's been ages since we took a photo.

423
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,380
- You've lost weight.
- Right?

424
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,220
- Look over here!
- Photogenic.

425
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,300
- Come on.
- Three, two, one.

426
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,840
Got it. Let's see.

427
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,240
Now, switch up your pose.

428
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,340
I like his idea. The heart shape would be cute.

429
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,815
Strike a new pose.

430
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:29,060
No, move a little. Just adjust slightly.

431
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,200
Can you hear me?

432
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,180
Move a little.

433
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,420
What's wrong with...?

434
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:45,905
Oh no.

435
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:49,960
- Where is this?
- What kind of place is this?

436
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,680
Weren't we just taking a photo?

437
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,140
Did we get pulled into the photo?

438
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,885
Mu Dai. Are you feeling alright?

439
00:29:57,885 --> 00:29:59,400
I'm fine.

440
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,760
This is creepy.

441
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,140
Let's split up and look around.

442
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,520
Don't bother.

443
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,780
Zhang Guang Hua?

444
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,260
It's you.

445
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,240
Welcome to my world.

446
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,920
No. He's not Zhang Guang Hua.

447
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,220
If I'm not mistaken, you're the seventh relic of ill omen.

448
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,220
You're right and also wrong.

449
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,880
With all seven gathered, I, the leader, have been fully awakened.

450
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,400
Under my guidance,

451
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,700
you've smoothly implanted
the relics of ill omen into your bodies.

452
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,560
 Facing a dead end, sticking
to the rules leads nowhere. 

453
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,700
 Only by thinking outside the box   can you find a new way. 

454
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,100
So that person was arranged by you?

455
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,073
You deliberately guided us.

456
00:31:00,073 --> 00:31:03,300
Exactly. You're sharp.

457
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,300
Quick to connect the dots.

458
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,340
Then what is this place?

459
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,800
How to describe it?

460
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,980
Your bodies remain where they were.

461
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,380
You're simply trapped in the vision
I created for you.

462
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,740
Or more precisely,

463
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,620
I... Am...

464
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,540
Inside your minds.

465
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,940
You're messing with our brains now?

466
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,300
Get out!

467
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,060
No wonder subduing the seventh relic of ill omen was so easy.

468
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,320
So this was the trap.

469
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,620
What a sneaky scumbag.

470
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,280
He's trying to turn us into idiots.

471
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,760
I'm warning you, let us out.

472
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,600
I need to take a dump!

473
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,100
Childish.

474
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:53,620
Because every one of you holds something I want in your minds.

475
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,560
What do you mean?

476
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,760
All along, you've been dealing
with individual relics of ill omen.

477
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,400
But the seven were always meant to be one.

478
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,820
This kind of convergence last occurred during the era of Bo Yang Zi.

479
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,400
The one your kind called the Great Star Lord.

480
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,840
- He just vanished?
- Where did he go?

481
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,730
I can tell you this.

482
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,860
To reunite as one, we need the connectors.

483
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,000
And there are five of them.

484
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,000
Those things are inside our minds?

485
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,720
When we finally achieved union and were ready to thrive,

486
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,880
Bo Yang Zi shattered and sealed us
into wooden slips.

487
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,740
Knowing it was irreversible,

488
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,040
so the Great Star Lord left a contingency plan.

489
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,705
Bo Yang Zi took the seven relics of ill omen.

490
00:32:57,705 --> 00:33:00,520
But the five connectors...

491
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,200
 Five disciples fell unconscious for days, 

492
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,280
their lives in grave danger.

493
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
It seemed they might not survive.

494
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,920
Yet seven days later, they were all fine.

495
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,360
You planted the five connectors in the five disciples of the Great Virtuous One.

496
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,400
Clever.

497
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,240
The connectors are passed down by blood.

498
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,360
Hidden deep within your minds,

499
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,720
buried in your subconscious.

500
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,740
You're saying the five of us are descendants of those disciples?

501
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,200
Exactly. But his disciples had many descendants, scattered everywhere.

502
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,480
I picked you five because the connectors within you guys remain most intact.

503
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,180
So all our encounters with the relics of ill omen were never coincidences.

504
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,900
Of course not.

505
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,120
Why else would the relics of ill omen
keep appearing

506
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,760
among those connected to you?

507
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,120
All by my design.

508
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:05,000
I orchestrated your meeting
and dragged you into this.

509
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,620
Mom!

510
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,740
It was destined that you'd come here

511
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,460
to complete our union ritual.

512
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,780
Can you hear me?

513
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,080
Can you see me?

514
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,640
At last, we're about to fulfill our purpose.

515
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,400
You lowlifes will be crushed beneath me.

516
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,200
If you're in such a hurry, then let's begin!

517
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,100
Ren.

518
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,060
Ren?

519
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,800
Hong Sha?

520
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,020
Chubby? Thirteen-Thousand?

521
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,440
Mu Dai.

522
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,300
Where am I?

523
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,821
Where are my friends?

524
00:36:22,821 --> 00:36:24,900
This is the origin point.

525
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,227
Your friends are each at their own origin points.

526
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,834
What kind of trick are you pulling now?

527
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:32,875
 Pitiful humans. 

528
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:38,600
 Your time flows in one direction, ever forward,   never back. 

529
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,360
 But here, everything can begin anew. 

530
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,100
 Do you see? 

531
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,560
 Every moment of your life is here. 

532
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,320
 Regrets can be undone. 

533
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,960
 Wounds can be healed. 

534
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,840
 Your story can be rewritten as you wish. 

535
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,480
I...

536
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,040
What's past is past.

537
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,640
I like the life I have now.

538
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,940
I don't need to rewrite it.

539
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,500
Is that so?

540
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,640
Don't worry. I won't force you.

541
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,480
I'm just offering you the choice.

542
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,520
 Your life, your decision. 

543
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,520
Where's Free Cao?

544
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,640
Where's Free Cao?

545
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,260
Free Cao?

546
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,760
No time to worry about that now.

547
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,860
Hey, Jiu.

548
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,200
Listen, I've got a minor situation here.

549
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,280
Any chance you could get me a ride?

550
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Yeah, I... I know cars can't get in here.

551
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,200
Of course, I know cars can't get in here!

552
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,560
I mean, get me like an ox cart,
a horse cart, or a donkey cart.

553
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,040
Any kind of cart will do.

554
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,940
I'll pay you a generous amount, alright?

555
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,560
If that's not enough, I'll write you
a letter of commendation.

556
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,320
And I'll give you a certificate of merit.

557
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,080
You can hang it on your wall.

558
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,680
How prestigious would that be, right?

559
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,940
Tomorrow morning?

560
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:59,260
Jiu, is there any way you could speed things up?

561
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,280
Make it fast. Say, show up in an hour or so?

562
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,285
That'd really make my day.

563
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:07,706
Is tomorrow morning the earliest?

564
00:39:07,706 --> 00:39:09,180
Fine, okay.
Just get here as fast as you can, okay?

565
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,520
Please.

566
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,060
Stay warm out there in the mountains? Stay warm.

567
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,360
Got it. I'll be careful.

568
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,480
Alright. Thank you.

569
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,240
Bye.

570
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,360
What's going on?

571
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,520
Well... What's going on here?

572
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:55,050



573
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,620
