1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,940
   

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:24,090



3
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,360
   

4
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,000
   

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,060
   

6
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,720
Zha Ma, the mule cart lantern is like will-o'-the-wisps.

7
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,800
Out here in the middle of nowhere. It scared us to death.

8
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,040
Is Qiju Village up ahead?

9
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,220
- Yes. 
 - But I heard the village was deserted?

10
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,260
Most folks moved to town years ago.

11
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,780
But the elders who've lived in the mountains all their lives prefer to stay.

12
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,060
Like my mom.

13
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,400
She's used to mountain spring water and can't stand tap water.

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,220
See, I come by every couple of weeks to drop off supplies.

15
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,540
And stay with her for a few days.

16
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,140
Then we're lucky.

17
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,420
Just got here and ran into you, even hitched a ride.

18
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,080
So, what brings you out here?

19
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,060
You've got relatives here, right?

20
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,980
Oh, by the way, we just ran into some crazy geezer.

21
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,440
Gave us a real fright. He kept babbling about savages.

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,580
That's Mr. Suo Nan from the next village.

23
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,240
He went into the mountains and saw a savage a few years back.

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,640
- That scared him out of his mind. 
 - Are there actually savages around here?

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,700
No. Absolutely no.

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,820
That's just folklore.

27
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,640
The government sent a team to investigate after what happened to Mr. Suo Nan.

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,540
No savages at all.

29
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,040
If they were real, this place would've been famous by now.

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,300
This is a shortcut. Only for oxcarts.

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,240
We'll reach the village soon.

32
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,928
Stop trying!

33
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:34,629
No signal out here.

34
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,591
I have something very urgent to contact my friends. What should I do?

35
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,171
Go out.

36
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:42,971
Where you can drive, there's signal.

37
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,780
Is your mule cart heading out tomorrow morning?

38
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,480
Here's the number. Could you help me contact them?

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,560
The mule just got here. It's tired.

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,680
It needs rest.

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,260
You need rest. So does it.

42
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,340
Then I'll hire someone?

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,240
How much are you offering?

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,100
A hundred?

45
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,360
Yes.

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,140
I'll give you two hundred. Just help me contact them.

47
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,420
Then, I'll do it.

48
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,780
I ate my fill tonight.

49
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,240
I've got strength. I'll leave at first light tomorrow.

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,660
All right. Here's the number.

51
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,220
Sure.

52
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,700
My master's phone is still switched off.

53
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,040
Can't get through to Miss Rich either.

54
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,340
Best-case scenario?

55
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,980
Bad signal in the mountains.

56
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,180
- Well, worst- case... 
 - No. Don't even think it.

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,020
Forget it.

58
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,540
Luo Ren, we need to hurry.

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,520
I saw a shadow in the cart today.

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,080
Looked just like a Sunny Doll.

61
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,460
Vision again?

62
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,300
Yes.

63
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,260
Then, ignore it.

64
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,420
Ping Ting's safe now.

65
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,980
No one wants anything to do with that cursed relic of ill omen.

66
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,120
What?

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,860
You're going to Yueliang Mountain?

68
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,680
Why? Is there any problem?

69
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,320
Rainy season now. Roads are rough.

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,820
And you are an elderly man.

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,560
With two young girls?

72
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,160
Plus, rumors say there are savages in there.

73
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,860
Thought you said no savages?

74
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,640
No one's seen them. But the stories persist.

75
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,700
Locals avoid the mountain.

76
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,660
Few dare to go in.

77
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:35,560
So, even without savages, there are still beasts, I guess.

78
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,040
Relax.

79
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,560
I've been there before.

80
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,220
No savages. No beasts.

81
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,280
Just rumors.

82
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,440
Rumors don't scare us.

83
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,700
Hong Sha.

84
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,880
Back to the room.

85
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,700
No, thanks. I'm good.

86
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,260
I'm getting old. This thing keeps me up at night.

87
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,780
Let's head back.

88
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,940
I'll go out.

89
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,340
Madam, I'll have some.

90
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,920
There's more if you want.

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,440
There's more if you want.

92
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,000
My mom means you can ask for more if you want.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,040
No, this is plenty.

94
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,580
My mom likes you.

95
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,960
- Keep it. 
 - Thank you.

96
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,360
My mom's amazing. The colored cords she weaves possess power.

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,880
They can help with romantic relationships.

98
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,440
Help with romantic relationships?

99
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,960
Back in the day, couples in these mountains would visit a Taoist nun

100
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,260
to see if they were well-matched before marrying.

101
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,120
My mom's ancestors were great shamans.

102
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,060
Truly powerful.

103
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,360
I know you city folk might not put much stock in our old ways.

104
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,560
Then, does checking a match require both people, or just one?

105
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
Just one.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But do you have something he gave you?

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,060
If you do, then we can do that.

108
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,620
Here.

109
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,460
May Yueliang Mountain bring you blessings.

110
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,840
Well?

111
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,220
I had a feeling. Not a good match?

112
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,440
These will fill you up on the road.

113
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,080
- And mark your trail, or you'll lose your way. 
 - Got it.

114
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,520
Also, there's an abandoned village halfway.

115
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
You can shelter there.

116
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,400
Our hunters stay there when they can't make it back in a day.

117
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,540
I know.

118
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,920
You know?

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,820
My mom said that the village was cleared out 20 years ago.

120
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,680
You've been there?

121
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,112
I heard it from...

122
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:33,780
Mom.

123
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,540
My mom prepared these for you.

124
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,400
Yueliang Mountain sees a lot of rain.

125
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,140
Her woven bamboo hats work better than umbrellas.

126
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,360
Thank you.

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,160
Here, Grandpa.

128
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll leave right away and make good time.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,180
I'll make sure to contact your friends.

130
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,060
Thank you.

131
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,020
Don't dwell too much on last night.

132
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,020
My mom's visions aren't always right.

133
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,760
 My mom just said she couldn't fully see through it. 

134
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,680
 She said there's another you. 

135
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,680
 But the one that remains in the end isn't the same as you now. 

136
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,320
What's "right" or not?

137
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,960
Don't dilly-dally. Let's go.

138
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,660
Be safe.

139
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,300
Bye, Madam.

140
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,680
 She said there's another you. 

141
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,180
 But the one that remains in the end isn't the same as you now. 

142
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,940
What are you doing?

143
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,279
Marking the trail.

144
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,580
We'll need it to find our way back.

145
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,200
We're here.

146
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,840
The village is just ahead. Hurry.

147
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,820
What's wrong?

148
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,880
Nothing. Keep moving.

149
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,840
What's that hanging there?

150
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,400
That's a Sunny Doll. For praying for clear weather.

151
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,000
It's a local custom. Almost every household has one.

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,820
- Sunny Doll? 
 - Why does that sound so familiar?

153
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,940
The relic of ill omen?

154
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,340
Remote mountains, village, raining, and Sunny Doll.

155
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,200
Now everything adds up.

156
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,760
We can't be that unlucky to run into the relic of ill omen again, can we?

157
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,300
Eat first.

158
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,960
Let's eat first?

159
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,900
Whatever we've stumbled into, we'll face it better on full stomachs.

160
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,960
Fair point.

161
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,720
Grandpa, let's eat.

162
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,740
I thought that 50,000 would be easy money.

163
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,700
Nothing but fear and sweat.

164
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Every penny is earned through hard work.

165
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,900
Doubt this water's even safe.

166
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,170
I just got off the phone when you said you'd arrived.

167
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,500
That scared me.

168
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,780
Thought you were all playing a prank on me.

169
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,880
So, Mu Dai and the others are fine?

170
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,060
Apart from that madman, nothing else happened?

171
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,060
Hey, how many times do I have to tell you?

172
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,440
Relax. All's well.

173
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,000
Eat.

174
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,280
Still a day's gap, though.

175
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,700
Just walk faster tomorrow.

176
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,200
They're just women and an elderly man.

177
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,620
You'll catch up with full stomachs.

178
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,240
But don't travel at night.

179
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,280
Too dangerous. You'll get lost.

180
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,980
Mom, do you want some porridge?

181
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,660
By the way, Zha Ma.

182
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,220
No savages, right?

183
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,820
Didn't they say his clothes were torn to shreds when they found Mr. Suo Nan?

184
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,420
And he was screaming about savages eating people?

185
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,780
Female savage, huh?

186
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,560
He was raving mad. Nonsense.

187
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,300
Sounded convincing to me. Pretty credible.

188
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,480
See? You're buying into it already.

189
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,140
The more rumors spread, the wilder they get.

190
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,440
What's so funny?

191
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,020
Your eyes have narrowed to slits.

192
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,720
Spit it out.

193
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,100
You may not come here in vain.

194
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,344
Might end up a mountain bridegroom.

195
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:40,020
Right, Brother Luo? Think about it.

196
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,240
You're skilled in combat.

197
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,120
And I'm strong.

198
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,260
But this guy? Skinny arms, twig legs.

199
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,520
What'll you do if a female savage really shows up?

200
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,940
Yes, right. Let me tell you, these twig legs?

201
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,140
She won't like them.

202
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,920
She'll want your type, strong guy.

203
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,120
You're laughing too?

204
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,580
You...

205
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,300
My ring fell in.

206
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,520
I'll get it.

207
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,500
There, the ring.

208
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,460
Fished a Sunny Doll out of the well?

209
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,820
You already pulled it out. Might as well bring it over.

210
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,980
Maybe we'll discover something.

211
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,120
Since when are you so brave?

212
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,740
You go get it then.

213
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,420
It's right by the well.

214
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,120
I'm freaked out.

215
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,780
Me too.

216
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,700
Hauling that bucket up nearly killed me.

217
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,960
You're just picking it up.

218
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,140
A quick sprint.

219
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,420
Mu Dai.

220
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm your boss now.

221
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,340
You're the employee.

222
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,300
Since when can an employee direct the boss?

223
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,160
Mu Dai, Mu Dai.

224
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,940
It is a Sunny Doll.

225
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,660
Just like Luo Ren described.

226
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,420
But the craftsmanship is a bit shoddy.

227
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,020
Even my work's better than this.

228
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,880
But who made it?

229
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,200
What are you two doing?

230
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,540
Mu Dai fished a Sunny Doll out of the well.

231
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,520
Why mess with children's toys?

232
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,000
Mu Dai. Please stay here alone for now.

233
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,860
Hong Sha and I need to discuss family matters.

234
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,320
- All right. 
 - Hong Sha. Come on.

235
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,880
Wait for me.

236
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,280
What are you staring at?

237
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,057
Grandpa, can you stop being so wary of Mu Dai?

238
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:05,060
She's my closest friend.

239
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,420
How am I supposed to be with her if you keep this up?

240
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,660
What do you know?

241
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,460
This treasure hunt...

242
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,680
might be my last.

243
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,160
Your uncle's dead.

244
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,560
Who knows how long I have left?

245
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,020
Grandpa, please don't say that.

246
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,880
Why do you think I'd come all the way here?

247
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,220
For you.

248
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,220
They say we reap what our ancestors sowed.

249
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,560
I'm just here to help you lay a solid groundwork.

250
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,260
I went to great lengths to hide this gem well.

251
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,420
I don't use it lightly.

252
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,500
It's only for emergencies.

253
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,100
Some things in this trade can't be shared.

254
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,220
Fierce competition, scarce opportunities.

255
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,780
When you find a gem well,

256
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,760
you're afraid it'll be discovered by others.

257
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,180
So, you'd resort to an ancient method.

258
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,680
You use human vitality to suppress the treasure's aura.

259
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,220
Only then can it be concealed tightly, and others won't be able to find it.

260
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,000
The sun's out.

261
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
A good omen.

262
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,900
Let's go.

263
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,920
Mu Dai, what are you looking for?

264
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,240
Move.

265
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,360
Hurry.

266
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,600
Let's go.

267
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,220
That Sunny Doll.

268
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,560
Now of all times?

269
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,000
You're still hung up on a doll?

270
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,400
Go.

271
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,920
Move.

272
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,340
Let's go.

273
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,320
Where did the Sunny Doll go?

274
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,020
What, is it strange?

275
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,180
Yes.

276
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,660
After we brought it back yesterday, no one touched it.

277
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660
There were only a few of us in the room.

278
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,680
How could it just disappear?

279
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,300
Did it move on its...

280
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,760
What's wrong, Grandpa?

281
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,240
Why stop?

282
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,840
This is it.

283
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,080
Here?

284
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,140
Can't you feel it?

285
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,180
The energy here is different.

286
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,600
What energy?

287
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,720
What exactly can your grandpa see?

288
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,760
I don't know the specifics.

289
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,100
But my uncle once told me

290
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,800
the range of the electromagnetic spectrum is vast.

291
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,480
The range that human eyes can perceive is roughly from 400 to 700 nanometers.

292
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,020
The parts we can't see aren't empty.

293
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,460
It's just that we can't perceive them.

294
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,040
Right here. Start digging.

295
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,180
Don't touch this!

296
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,200
This is a Yan family matter.

297
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,589
Outsiders shouldn't interfere.

298
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:43,780
You've got good martial arts skills.

299
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,880
Go up there and keep watch.

300
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,441
Back in the day, treasure hunts always attracted vultures.

301
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:51,623
We'd better be on guard.

302
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:53,143
Go.

303
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,820
Hong Sha.

304
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,410
Hong Sha!

305
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,400
Come here.

306
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,440
Hong Sha.

307
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,800
Hong Sha!

308
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,060
Come here.

309
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,000
 Use human vitality to suppress the treasure's aura. 

310
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,360
Take it.

311
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,860
Take it!

312
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,920
Take it.

313
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,120
Dig here.

314
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,680
Hurry.

315
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,700
Gently.

316
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,840
Tall trees, saplings, crooked trunks,

317
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,760
and ochre-colored trees.

318
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:06,561
What's the big deal about these?

319
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,860
Grandpa, I... I can't keep digging.

320
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,460
I'm too scared.

321
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,340
- Dig. Keep digging. 
 - No!

322
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,782
If I could do it myself, would I need you?

323
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:26,760
- Dig! 
 - I won't!

324
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,500
I'm not digging. I refuse!

325
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,160
Hong Sha. What? Are you tired?

326
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,610
Well, let me dig.

327
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,280
No! Don't.

328
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,020
- Why not? 
 - Don't dig.

329
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,880
Why?

330
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,560
There's a corpse down there!

331
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,460
Hong Sha!

332
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,980
How could there be a corpse here?

333
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,820
What's going on?

334
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,400
You've been protecting us all the way.

335
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,020
You're practically one of us.

336
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,780
It doesn't matter if I tell you.

337
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,760
Well, it was my own greed.

338
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,740
Back then, we formed a treasure-hunting squad to explore the well.

339
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,700
Among all the members,

340
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,840
I was the only one who could read the treasure's aura.

341
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,520
After scouting several mountains,

342
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,710
I found it...

343
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,220
Right here.

344
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,260
A perfect well.

345
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,501
The treasure's aura was extremely strong.

346
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:45,181
And...

347
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,000
There was a corpse inside.

348
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,620
Normally, a corpse's vitality should've suppressed the treasure's aura.

349
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,060
Yet it didn't.

350
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,720
It's evident how strong the treasure's aura is.

351
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Maybe too much time had passed.

352
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,120
The corpse had decayed to bones.

353
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,340
Its vitality faded.

354
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,000
So, it couldn't suppress the treasure's aura.

355
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,920
So, I got greedy.

356
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,020
I told them the well was a dud.

357
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,300
And they just bought it.

358
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,260
Gem well? Nine out of ten are empty.

359
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,521
If we had just left without doing anything, it actually would have been fine.

360
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:31,240
But what if another expert passed by?

361
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,640
They'd notice it.

362
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,680
I had to hide it properly.

363
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,320
I needed to come up with a plan.

364
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,540
Just then, one of the members suffered from acclimatization problems

365
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,200
and died of a sudden illness.

366
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,560
So, I buried him right in here.

367
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,600
Fresh corpses have strong vitality.

368
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,720
It could suppress the treasure's aura.

369
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,100
An old, vile practice among treasure hunters.

370
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Vile! It's absolutely...

371
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,320
- Only fools would believe in that nonsense. 
 - Shut up!

372
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,880
Hong Sha.

373
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,920
Who do you think I did all this for?

374
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,240
For you youngsters!

375
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,060
You youngsters are so disappointing.

376
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,840
You made me have to...

377
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,960
Maybe...

378
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,080
Maybe it's because I'm getting old.

379
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,140
I regret what I did more every day.

380
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,640
So, this trip isn't just about leaving Hong Sha something valuable.

381
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,180
It's about laying my friend...

382
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,780
to rest properly.

383
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,380
After we take the treasure, we'll send his family their share.

384
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,560
Your grandpa's right.

385
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,640
But I'm afraid of corpses, too.

386
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,020
It's up to you whether we dig or not.

387
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,785
My master often says that it's all about fate

388
00:27:19,785 --> 00:27:22,850
when one meets someone and does something somewhere.

389
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,591
Since we're here, we'll bury him properly.

390
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:27,891
Call it karma.

391
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,300
What's wrong?

392
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,920
Someone's here.

393
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,640
- There's someone nearby. 
 - How many?

394
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,380
- Let me see. 
 - They're hiding behind the trees.

395
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,510
I can't tell.

396
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,200
How many?

397
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,320
I don't see anyone now.

398
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,840
Probably ran. Too far to chase.

399
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,480
Treasure poachers.

400
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,640
Here to snatch the treasure.

401
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,640
Stop humming.

402
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,680
You'll attract things with that noise.

403
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,140
Morale boost for the march.

404
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,260
Morale? So annoying.

405
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,500
Come over here.

406
00:28:33,262 --> 00:28:37,540
Found it. This mark is different from the ones we saw.

407
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,480
When we carve marks, we usually do it at chest height.

408
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,880
Given Mu Dai's height, it's impossible for her to reach this high.

409
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,240
And look, this carving is so deep.

410
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,860
Neither of us could've made them.

411
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,960
Something's wrong in this mountain.

412
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,680
There are others besides Mu Dai and her group.

413
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,260
Let's go find the marks Mu Dai made.

414
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,620
Careful. Here's the knife.

415
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,940
For me?

416
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,440
I'll leave the back to you.

417
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,380
Mu Dai!

418
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,680
The cave is right below.

419
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,700
Get the ropes.

420
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,380
They're in your red bag.

421
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,320
Two of them.

422
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,140
Tie them tight.

423
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,260
On the count of three, you two pull together.

424
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,600
One.

425
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,800
Two.

426
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,320
Three.

427
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,560
The...

428
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,220
The bones are gone.

429
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,440
Really.

430
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,500
Give me the rope. I'll go down and take a look.

431
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,140
No, Grandpa.

432
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,700
Grandpa!

433
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,820
What was that?

434
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,760
Mu Dai!

435
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,360
You saw it too, right?

436
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,340
That thing with the fur.

437
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,000
Had to be two meters tall.

438
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,620
That's the savage, isn't it, Mu Dai?

439
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,275
Probably. Such a huge size.

440
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:31,797
And it ambushed us.

441
00:32:31,797 --> 00:32:34,306
Ordinary beasts can't do that.

442
00:32:34,306 --> 00:32:36,427
Are we even safe here?

443
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:38,492
Get down!

444
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:39,893
Don't let him chase after us.

445
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:42,660
No, it had to be in the well.

446
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,000
How could the corpse just disappear?

447
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,140
Please, just forget the well, Grandpa.

448
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,180
We just saw a savage!

449
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,140
Grandpa, could someone else have found the well

450
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,000
and removed the corpse?

451
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,300
Impossible.

452
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,500
I hid that well so well.

453
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Others simply couldn't find it.

454
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,760
And even if they removed the corpse,

455
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,000
why would they restore the well to its original state?

456
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,657
Who knows. Your companion died of an illness.

457
00:33:16,657 --> 00:33:20,320
Maybe he wasn't fully dead. So he climbed out.

458
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,000
No way!

459
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,100
He had his throat cut. Bled out all over that well.

460
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,160
How could he have just...

461
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:47,806
Grandpa. You said he died of an illness.

462
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,480
Where are you going?

463
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,720
To take a leak.

464
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,480
I'll go with you. It's not safe for you to go alone.

465
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,800
No need. How am I supposed to piss with you there?

466
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,040
Don't worry.

467
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,000
You two stay here.

468
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,820
Mu Dai.

469
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,940
My grandpa killed someone.

470
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,260
Didn't he?

471
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,920
He killed someone.

472
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,480
Maybe it's not what we think.

473
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,160
I'm not stupid.

474
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,360
He killed someone.

475
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,380
He is...

476
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:55,613
A murderer.

477
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,740
It's raining outside.

478
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,700
Hong Sha, your grandpa's still out there. Let's check on him.

479
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,900
Why bother?

480
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,940
He'll be fine.

481
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,280
He can even kill people.

482
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,760
Is this lamp about to be broken?

483
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,980
Grandpa?

484
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,940
What's wrong? What was that noise?

485
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,000
Grandpa, get inside!

486
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,140
Grandpa!

487
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,680
Hong Sha! Hong Sha!

488
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,525
Grandpa!

489
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:21,420
Grandpa! Are you hurt?

490
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,540
Go. Go!

491
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,740
Get away!

492
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,340
Mu Dai.

493
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,180
Mu Dai. Mu Dai.

494
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,600
Mu Dai.

495
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,160
Are you okay?

496
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,980
What a thrilling night.

497
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:12,080
Let's add an egg for my master to calm and nourish her.

498
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,680
You swiped this from Zha Ma's place, didn't you?

499
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,960
What else did you swipe? Just toss it all in.

500
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,040
Savages might carry bacteria.

501
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,180
I'll give you a shot later.

502
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,040
You're really prepared.

503
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,620
Obviously.

504
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,060
You're in the deep mountains.

505
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,100
Even without beasts, there's tetanus from falls.

506
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,540
I've checked your luggage.

507
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,380
No medicine. No proper weapons.

508
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,060
But you do have plenty of food.

509
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,820
What are you here for? A vacation?

510
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,100
Enough.

511
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,900
I'll check the noodles.

512
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,840
Hong Sha. We need to talk later.

513
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,780
Almost done.

514
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,980
Oh, no. Chubby, I've never seen Luo Ren this pissed.

515
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,620
Is he going to kill me?

516
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,380
You get an egg too.

517
00:40:47,683 --> 00:40:50,565
Don't be mad at Hong Sha.

518
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:52,745
It's not her fault.

519
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,080
Does it still hurt?

520
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,560
Let me see.

521
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,260
What's wrong? Lower your head and let me see.

522
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,400
That savage dragged me by the hair for a while.

523
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,800
Is it a strain?

524
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,580
Let me check.

525
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,900
- It's quite bad. 
 - What?

526
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,060
This patch might not recover.

527
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,820
You'll have a bald spot this big.

528
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,600
Bald?

529
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,100
- I'm going bald? 
 - It's okay.

530
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,620
Smart heads stay bare.

531
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,840
If you go bald, it means you're getting smarter.

532
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,020
Normally, you can just cover it up with the hair on the sides.

533
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,220
If that doesn't work, just wear a hat.

534
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,367
Why are you crying?

535
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:48,040
I was just kidding.

536
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,313
You're not bald.

537
00:41:50,313 --> 00:41:51,813
You...

538
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,640
I pulled this off that savage.

539
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:12,140



540
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,140
 'Palm Print' - An Qi 

541
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,560
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

542
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,920
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

543
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,170
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

544
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:35,690
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

545
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,310
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

546
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:47,720
♫  Every hand has two sides  ♫

547
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,560
♫  One offers blessings  ♫

548
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,840
♫  One waits in silence  ♫

549
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,940
♫  There's no end to this game  ♫

550
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:05,400
♫  Following the traces left behind  ♫

551
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,000
♫  If you were me  ♫

552
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,340
♫  You'd understand every tear of mine  ♫

553
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,340
♫  (The reason they fall)  ♫

554
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,840
♫  If I were you  ♫

555
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:26,850
♫  I'd feel each breath you take  ♫

556
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,220
♫  Then we'd move forward  ♫

557
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,780
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

558
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,080
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

559
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,400
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

560
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:49,310
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

561
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,380
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

562
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,880
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

563
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,280
♫  It's telling me the end  ♫

564
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,640
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

565
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:12,590
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

566
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:18,780
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

567
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,100
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

568
