3
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,420
   

4
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,020
   

5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,980
   

6
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,610
 Zhang Guang Hua? Who's that? 

7
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,540
 The person she's looking into is probably dead. 

8
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,770
 Dead? 

9
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,820
 Zhang Guang Hua was also from Luoma Lake. 

10
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,690
 Lived in the same building as Li Ya Qing. 

11
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,130
 After the incident, 

12
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,100
 he vanished. 

13
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,560
He was in Luoma Lake, too?

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,070
An old acquaintance.

15
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,900
 I just want to know where he is. 

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,120
 Money isn't the issue. 

17
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,460
 It's this photo. 

18
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,360
 Once it's lost, it's gone forever. 

19
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,950
Lost him?

20
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,230
Not my fault.

21
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,790
That guy's extremely surveillance-aware.

22
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,000
And let's be real.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,480
His Hummer's a beast.

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,660
Floor it, and we common folks can't keep up.

25
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,740
Missy, maybe that guy's into you.

26
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,090
And that's why he did something so wild.

27
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,360
Well, I have to say, he looks pretty sharp, doesn't he?

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,740
 So, Luo Ren's the one behind Ma Tu Wen. 

29
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,280
Maybe you two should...

30
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,310
Move, move! Keep up!

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,130
Isn't that his car?

32
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,730
He got away again.

33
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,810
He can run, but he can't hide.

34
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,300
What do you mean?

35
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,810
I know the driver.

36
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,620
Mozzie. A pretty famous bar singer on Bar Street.

37
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,330
Well, Mr. Cao from Qianjinbei.

38
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,470
- You flatter me. 
 - Can you find out where he lives?

39
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,770
- Absolutely. 
 - Fine. I'll trust you one more time.

40
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,110
Let's go.

41
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,020
GPS says we're here.

42
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,300
Which one's his place?

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,080
Let's take a look around.

44
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,370
Look, isn't that his car?

45
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,240
Excuse me, is this Building No. 3?

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,330
Cen Chun Jiao?

47
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,980
 Isn't Ms. Cen here today? 

48
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,960
 She left early, saying there was an emergency at home. 

49
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,090
It's that guy.

50
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,140
He's up to something here.

51
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,710
 What's she doing here? 

52
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,760
Let's go.

53
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,410
Take this.

54
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,780
 But our inn's on the main street. 

55
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,700
 There is a camera that captures people coming and going. 

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,650
 I had the sense to keep a backup. 

57
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,410
 But even the cops couldn't find anything. 

58
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,140
 When can I get the footage? 

59
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,360
I can go home and grab it now.

60
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,410
- Just give me the money. 
 - One more thing.

61
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,340
You're sure Liu Shu Hai

62
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,945
never mentioned the Xiaoshang River?

63
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,555
No, he didn't.

64
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:45,850
Just Luoma Lake and Dalunte'er.

65
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,480
What's up with the Xiaoshang River?

66
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,700
So, Wuxia...

67
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,560
is real.

68
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,210
   

69
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,480
 You've been hanging outside the window. 

70
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,190
 Must be exhausted. 

71
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,750
 There are freshly washed strawberries on the table. 

72
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,050
 Have some to refresh yourself. 

73
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,530
 Don't thank me. 

74
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,630
I...

75
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,040
   

76
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,580
Uncle Li?

77
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,410
Where are you going?

78
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,510
Ms. Mu Dai. The matter is over.

79
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,720
Night flights are cheaper. So, I'm leaving.

80
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,510
Makes sense. Auntie Hong's been urging me to go back.

81
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,770
Thought I'd get some clues this time.

82
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,980
But it's another wasted trip.

83
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,760
For over 20 years, I've been going on these fruitless trips.

84
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,830
It's always the same.

85
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,060
But thank you anyway.

86
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,970
If it weren't for you, I would have even lost that photo.

87
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,020
I'm off now.

88
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,100
Uncle Li, what time is your flight?

89
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,260
Something's wrong?

90
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,210
Let me buy you a drink.

91
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,990
Uncle Li, can you tell me about that case from two years ago?

92
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,650
It happened...

93
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,520
at the Xiaoshang River.

94
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,540
But to understand it fully, we have to go back to Luoma Lake.

95
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,080
Every year on the anniversary of that incident,

96
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,660
I'd visit the scene.

97
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,560
I don't do anything special.

98
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,160
Just stroll around inside and remind myself not to give up.

99
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,191
For over 20 years, it has become a habit.

100
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:27,491
That day...

101
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:30,640
It has been exactly 20 years since the Luoma Lake case.

102
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,900
It was also Ya Qing's birthday.

103
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,040
 I was smoking in the hallway 

104
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,900
 when I saw a strange man enter Ya Qing's place. 

105
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,640
What was he doing there?

106
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,280
I didn't dare get too close.

107
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,280
But through the crack of the door, I could vaguely see him...

108
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,280
running his hand

109
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,160
 over the nail holes on the wall. 

110
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,060
It was like...

111
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,020
 It was like he was reliving old memories. 

112
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,340
And he seemed to be enjoying it.

113
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,960
You know how some psychopathic murderers

114
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,120
return to crime scenes on anniversaries to savor the moment?

115
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,880
Anyway, he just showed up like that on that day.

116
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,840
No way he wasn't connected.

117
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Then, why didn't you arrest him?

118
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,020
I was not a cop anymore.

119
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,100
And gut feelings aren't evidence.

120
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,280
I decided to keep an eye on him instead.

121
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,160
So, I followed him cautiously all the way to the Xiaoshang River.

122
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,705
The Xiaoshang River?

123
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:13,585
 You're sure Liu Shu Hai never mentioned the Xiaoshang River? 

124
00:10:13,585 --> 00:10:15,560
 No, he didn't. 

125
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,020
I tracked him to the Xiaoshang River and searched for days.

126
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,940
 Finally, I spotted him in a shop. 

127
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,580
 When I went inside, I found the entire family was dead. 

128
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,280
 The murderer was tying up the bodies with fishing line. 

129
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,940
 All I could think of was not letting him escape again. 

130
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,300
 At least, I had to knock him out. 

131
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,180
I hit him hard in the head, but he was unharmed.

132
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,640
His strength was unnatural.

133
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,140
 He beat me half to death. 

134
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,520
 Then suddenly, a fire broke out. 

135
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,420
 It distracted him just long enough for me to pin him down. 

136
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,780
 Unexpectedly, someone attacked me from behind. 

137
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,760
And the next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital bed.

138
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,100
Who took you there?

139
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,340
No idea.

140
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,140
 Neither the doctors nor the nurses got a clear look. 

141
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:52,440
After I was discharged, I heard the shop was a mutton shop.

142
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,780
Flames leaped out of the stove when the late-night soup boiling went awry.

143
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,380
Half of the alley was burned down.

144
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,620
By the time the fire was put out,

145
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,560
almost nothing was left of that family.

146
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,680
So, did this matter just end up unresolved? Didn't you call the police?

147
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,700
My head injury left my memories scrambled for quite a while.

148
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,760
It took me nearly half a year to piece together what happened that night.

149
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
I thought about reporting it.

150
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,580
But firstly, the case had already been closed.

151
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,860
Secondly...

152
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,060
I had no solid evidence.

153
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,000
I couldn't even recall what the murderer looked like.

154
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,020
If you'd been knocked out at the scene,

155
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,740
the police should have taken you away for questioning.

156
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,980
But they didn't, which suggests you were already removed from the scene

157
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,700
and might have been taken to the hospital.

158
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,980
But he's a serial killer.

159
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,420
Why would he have let you off?

160
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,600
Exactly.

161
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,020
If he were the murderer,

162
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,360
I should've died in that fire.

163
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,760
Maybe that young man wasn't in cahoots with the murderer?

164
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,280
Whether they were accomplices or not, he's a key figure.

165
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,600
Uncle Li, you saw his face before you were knocked out.

166
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,920
Sketch it.

167
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,360
Even a rough likeness would help.

168
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,760
You think I haven't tried?

169
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,080
But I just can't recall that face.

170
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,720
Sometimes when I push too hard, my head feels like it's splitting open.

171
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,440
Have you tried hypnosis?

172
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,040
How can we believe in such unorthodox stuff?

173
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,640
Uncle Li, hypnosis is legitimate science.

174
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,860
It can help bring your subconscious back to the scene and aid in scene reconstruction.

175
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,000
It's very useful.

176
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,720
I've had hypnotherapy before.

177
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,380
I even studied it out of interest.

178
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,480
Ms. Mu Dai, since you've learned about it, maybe you could try it on me?

179
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,780
- I trust you. 
 - No, absolutely not.

180
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,580
My skills are too amateurish.

181
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,840
You can go to Uncle Wan.

182
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,740
He'll find you the most suitable person.

183
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,120
Oh, Uncle Li, one more thing.

184
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,360
Did Professor Li only have one daughter?

185
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,400
Ya Qing had a twin sister.

186
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,160
She was kidnapped at the age of two.

187
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,040
She was never found.

188
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,780
   

189
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,000
Hello, Auntie Hong.

190
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,400
 Mu Dai, when are you coming back? 

191
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,820
 Haven't seen you in days. 

192
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,320
 I miss you. 

193
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,780
Auntie Hong, did you go to the temple again?

194
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,580
Sharp ears.

195
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,920
Auntie Hong, this trip wasn't in vain.

196
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,780
I got much valuable information from Uncle Li.

197
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,380
Well, Uncle Li said the murderer wasn't dead.

198
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,140
 When he committed the crime two years ago, he even fought with Uncle Li. 

199
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,580
Not dead?

200
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,900
 Really? 

201
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,080
Of course.

202
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,980
Why is that surprising?

203
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,520
 Auntie Hong, what's wrong? 

204
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,960
Auntie Hong? Auntie Hong!

205
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
Sister, where are you going?

206
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,580
- Back to Lixi. 
 - To Lixi?

207
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,920
Hey, don't. Stay a few more days.

208
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,360
I'll treat you to a meal.

209
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,520
Maybe next time. I'm in a hurry.

210
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,140
Next time? So, you'll be back?

211
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,220
Sir, to the airport.

212
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,940
   

213
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,040
Excuse me, make way.

214
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,860
Auntie Hong.

215
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,420
- Mu Dai. 
 - You've been asleep forever.

216
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,960
Are you all right?

217
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,340
When did you get back?

218
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,200
A while ago.

219
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,720
I'm fine.

220
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,160
I... just felt dizzy because of the sun today.

221
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,060
And I got grazed by a car.

222
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,860
But I'm okay, really. Don't worry.

223
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,620
I'm glad you're okay.

224
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,080
- Go ahead. 
 - All right.

225
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,600
I'll go check on things downstairs.

226
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,660
Call me if you need anything.

227
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,740
   

228
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,890
   

229
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,120
- Let's play this. 
 - Why leave so early?

230
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,400
We've finished half the bottle.

231
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,840
Drinking with you, I'd finish a whole bottle.

232
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,500
This is expensive stuff.

233
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,840
Don't you feel like you're at a loss?

234
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,060
Not at all.

235
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,960
Hubby.

236
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,700
Hubby?

237
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm right here.

238
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,540
Haven't learned your lesson yet, huh?

239
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,840
No.

240
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,352
No, no... She's just...

241
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:52,120
Let me see.

242
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,880
Macanllan?

243
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,580
Macallan.

244
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,360
Changed one letter and you got the girl?

245
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,419
No.

246
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,580
You... You scumbag, shameless bastard!

247
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,932
No, wait. I...

248
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:09,600
- Get lost! 
 - My feelings for you are real.

249
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,600
I... There's nothing between her... Let go.

250
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,200
Hubby, aren't you going after her?

251
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,620
Lady Dai, don't call me that.

252
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,620
I don't deserve such a title.

253
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,741
I... I'll chase her!

254
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:22,966
I can't.

255
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:24,846
I just can't.

256
00:18:26,284 --> 00:18:27,800
Just kidding. Testing your skills.

257
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,520
- Then let me set your bones right. 
 - Ow, that hurts!

258
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,580
I'm an excellent bonesetter.

259
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,060
I...

260
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,340
Lady Dai, I can't handle your eight years of skills.

261
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,560
My hand is going to break.

262
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,406
Help me! Someone help me.

263
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:40,460
- Help! 
 - Mu Dai.

264
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,120
- No. 
 - Mu Dai.

265
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,360
What nonsense are you up to?

266
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,280
- Auntie Hong. 
 - Let go of him.

267
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,060
Don't always bully Thirteen-Thousand.

268
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,320
I'm not bullying him.

269
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,080
Uncle Zhang's been bustling around.

270
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,880
Let him go and lend a hand.

271
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,200
- Exactly. 
 - Go on, chase her.

272
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,720
Come upstairs. I need to talk to you.

273
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,620
Chase her my ass.

274
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,180
You witch!

275
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,260
I'm magnanimous.

276
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,460
I won't stoop to your level.

277
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,420
But really, Uncle Zhang should've warned me the witch was back.

278
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,500
Don't always pick on Thirteen-Thousand.

279
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,740
Look at you. Always calling him Thirteen-Thousand.

280
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,800
I've even forgotten his real name.

281
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,900
I call him that to remind him you paid his debt of 13,000 yuan.

282
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,220
He should be grateful.

283
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,640
- He owes you that. 
 - That wasn't for free.

284
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,400
For 13,000 yuan, he has to work in my bar for a whole year.

285
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,040
Fair trade.

286
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,620
Work for a whole year?

287
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,880
Just wait and see.

288
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,260
He'll skim profits and cook the books throughout this year.

289
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,660
That schemer never loses money.

290
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,740
Auntie Hong, I thought you were asleep.

291
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,580
Why are you up?

292
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,600
Professor Li's case weighs on me like a stone.

293
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,960
Tell me everything you've learned.

294
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,660
Or I'll never sleep.

295
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,440
How old was the murderer Li Tan saw at the Xiaoshang River?

296
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,880
And how tall?

297
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,080
Not very tall.

298
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,600
About...

299
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,260
This tall.

300
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,580
That can't be right.

301
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,200
What's wrong?

302
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,340
Nothing.

303
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,700
No, thanks.

304
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,480
I'm full.

305
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,650
   

306
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,520
What a beautiful new day.

307
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,540
For the witch? 
    

308
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,240
You're that excited over a package?

309
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,720
You'll never understand the joy of unboxing.

310
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,340
But I know the pleasure of wiping tables.

311
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,980
Where's the tracking number?

312
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,260
Is this even a delivery?

313
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,480
- Who sent it? 
 - Anonymous?

314
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Maybe from your admirer?

315
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,120
I found it by the door this morning.

316
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,780
Didn't pay attention to the tracking number.

317
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,440
   

318
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,600
 You've been hanging outside the window. 

319
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,280
 Must be exhausted. 

320
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,865
 There are freshly washed strawberries on the table. 

321
00:21:46,865 --> 00:21:48,066
 Have some to refresh yourself. 

322
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:49,946
 Don't thank me. 

323
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,880
Uncle Li.

324
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,360
 The hypnosis worked. 

325
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,440
 We've got a portrait. 

326
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,080
Really?

327
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,920
So, this is Luo Ren?

328
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,540
And he's in cahoots with the murderer of the Luoma Lake case?

329
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,520
He seems too young.

330
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,300
The case is over 20 years old.

331
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,360
Maybe he's the son of the murderer.

332
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,120
Impossible.

333
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,180
Why?

334
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,500
This Luo Ren guy is quite suspicious.

335
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,640
He followed me when I was in Wujiang.

336
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,240
Then he bribed Cen Chun Jiao to intercept the information.

337
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,100
Now he's come to Lixi.

338
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,480
He can't be here as a tourist, right?

339
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,600
It's natural for me to be concerned about my teacher's case.

340
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,425
They'd target me just for that?

341
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:53,505
Unlikely.

342
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,060
Auntie Hong, stop pretending.

343
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,180
I know everything.

344
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,680
Know what?

345
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,060
He wasn't just your teacher.

346
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,680
You're Professor Li's daughter, aren't you?

347
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,300
How do you know?

348
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,340
Is it that hard to guess?

349
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,600
I saw the photo in Li Tan's wallet.

350
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Li Ya Qing looks exactly like you.

351
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,440
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

352
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,300
Then I learned the professor had twins.

353
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,980
One of them was kidnapped at the age of two.

354
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,280
And that was you, wasn't it?

355
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,380
Later, when you grew up, you returned home

356
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,040
and discovered that something had happened.

357
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,000
So, you've been investigating ever since, right?

358
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,240
Why keep this from me?

359
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,540
You're keeping me at arm's length.

360
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,840
You clever little thing.

361
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,320
Nothing can escape your notice.

362
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,640
But I think this matter is quite serious.

363
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,920
Just think about it. The murderer has committed so many cases.

364
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,640
He always slaughtered entire families.

365
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,440
He must be somewhat psychopathic.

366
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,940
Maybe he's found out you slipped through

367
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,500
and wants to finish the job?

368
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,225
You might be right.

369
00:24:10,225 --> 00:24:16,020
But now that he's found me, can I escape?

370
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,440
Why not?

371
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,080
 Where there's a will, there's a way. 

372
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,540
 Maybe I can catch him and bring him to justice. 

373
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,120
 From now on, we'll check security every night. 

374
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,520
 Can't let our guard down. 

375
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,580
 Who's calling me this late? 

376
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,876
Hello.

377
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,485
Hello?

378
00:24:42,485 --> 00:24:44,326
I won't be coming tonight.

379
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:46,233
Rest early.

380
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:48,053
See you tomorrow.

381
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,365
How arrogant.

382
00:24:56,365 --> 00:24:59,380
"See you tomorrow"? Think I'm some pushover?

383
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,380
You wish!

384
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,240
Only losers resort to bluffing.

385
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,120
I'll be waiting for you.

386
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,720
   

387
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,400
Ma'am, excuse me...

388
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:35,940
Who are you calling?

389
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,061
Chubby.

390
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:38,322
My bad, Handsome.

391
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:40,583
May I ask if Mu Dai lives here?

392
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,148
Mu Dai?

393
00:25:42,148 --> 00:25:43,988
You're looking for her?

394
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,160
- What are you doing here? 
 - Came to see you.

395
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,740
What happened to your face?

396
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,580
Get caught stealing and beaten up?

397
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,800
Oh, come on.

398
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,300
That's downright slander.

399
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,500
Long story.

400
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,020
Those scumbags I hang out with crossed the line.

401
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,460
They were in the hospital and targeted the elderly.

402
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,480
You know what their money is for.

403
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,040
For saving their lives.

404
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,320
Stealing their money is just evil.

405
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,900
So, I tried to stop them.

406
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,460
But they wouldn't stop and even turned on me.

407
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,040
Yeah right. Since when did you have a conscience?

408
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,640
True story.

409
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,260
I wouldn't indulge them.

410
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,960
I fought with them right away.

411
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,220
Being a bulk helped.

412
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,580
But the commotion attracted the cops.

413
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,280
Mu Dai, is this your out-of-town friend?

414
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,600
This is Cao Yan Hua. And this is Auntie Hong.

415
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,720
- Auntie. 
 - Hello.

416
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,760
Nice to meet you.

417
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,360
That's Uncle Zhang over there.

418
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,880
- Oh, guess you're her husband. 
 - No, no.

419
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,400
He helps out here.

420
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,772
- This is Thirteen-Thousand. 
 - Hello.

421
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:56,700
- We've met. 
 - Yes, yes.

422
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,960
Have you found a place to stay?

423
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,400
He hasn't, I guess.

424
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,580
- You haven't, right? 
 - Not yet.

425
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,520
Well, no need to waste money then.

426
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,460
Thirteen-Thousand's room has bunk beds, doesn't it?

427
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,860
Is the upper bunk available?

428
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,840
I'll handle it, Madam.

429
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,160
This is Destiny Bar, where meetings are fated.

430
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,040
Well said.

431
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,280
Sorry, I didn't hear you clearly.

432
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,680
Your name is Cao...

433
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,320
Cao Yan Hua.

434
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,580
So, Brother Cao!

435
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,700
Sounds like swearing.

436
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,200
Well, hello, Brother Thirteen.

437
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,800
Exactly.

438
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,320
Brother Cao, if we inlay the word "fortune"

439
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,800
with gold at the entrance, what would that signify?

440
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,340
What?

441
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,720
It would mean "earn a fortune daily."

442
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,405
An auspicious saying.

443
00:27:44,405 --> 00:27:45,480
You two are really something.

444
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,800
Cao Yan Hua, get back here.

445
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,340
Mu Dai.

446
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,660
Mr. Cao is our guest.

447
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,020
Mind your manners. Look how fierce you are.

448
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,780
A new customer by the window.

449
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,300
Go take his order.

450
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,920
Show me the ropes.

451
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,920
I'll give it a try.

452
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,720
Hello, Sir. What would you like to order?

453
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,020
Any recommendations?

454
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,640
If you like cocktails, the B-52 is quite good.

455
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,800
Manhattan is also nice.

456
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,820
The taste...

457
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,820
How would you describe the taste of those drinks you recommended?

458
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,520
Let's talk somewhere else.

459
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,580
Sorry, but I came here to drink, not to chat with you.

460
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,940
- Don't even think about hurting Auntie Hong. 
 - Madam.

461
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,760
Auntie Hong, this is Luo Ren.

462
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,260
You're Huo Zi Hong, right?

463
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,720
Remember me?

464
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,560
I'm Luo Ren.

465
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,120
We used to be neighbors.

466
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,640
Neighbors?

467
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,000
Forgotten already?

468
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,720
I lived at No. 11 Chenqian Alley, Luoma Lake.

469
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,920
One year during heavy rains, your roof leaked.

470
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,160
My dad even helped fix your awning.

471
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,160
Now I remember.

472
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,540
Look how you've grown.

473
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,620
I barely recognized you.

474
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,380
So, how is your father?

475
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,900
My father?

476
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,880
Yes, your father.

477
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,480
He's doing well.

478
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,280
Good to know.

479
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,920
Let me treat you to a drink.

480
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,680
Thanks.

481
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,240
Auntie Hong.

482
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,320
Relax.

483
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,140
It's fine. We'll be just over there.

484
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,720
Let's go.

485
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,160
Were they really neighbors?

486
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,040
Why did you come alone?

487
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,180
Should I have come with a group?

488
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,360
What about your companion?

489
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,640
Companion?

490
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,120
The Xiaoshang River, midnight, mutton soup.

491
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,740
You knocked out Li Tan for your companion.

492
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,460
Don't you remember?

493
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,900
Why isn't he here?

494
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,620
You seem to be expecting to see him.

495
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,340
Isn't he dead yet?

496
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,780
Alive and kicking.

497
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,600
Tough guy, isn't he?

498
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,400
You know who the culprit is in the Luoma Lake case, don't you?

499
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,100
And you're not the real Huo Zi Hong.

500
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,620
Someone! Someone help me!

501
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,340
Take care of Auntie Hong.

502
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,240
Mu Dai, stop chasing.

503
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,620
Auntie Hong, are you all right?

504
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,580
Any injuries?

505
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,400
I'm fine.

506
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,460
So fierce?

507
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,960
♫  How much further until the end?  ♫

508
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,620
♫  I'll fight until I bend  ♫

509
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,400
♫  Even if fate has me by the throat  ♫

510
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,620
♫  Call my name, and I'll follow you into the night  ♫

511
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,320
♫  I don't care if the answer's in sight  ♫

512
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,020
♫  We'll stand side by side facing fate  ♫

513
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:42,820
♫  Through thorns, we charge to the rescue  ♫

514
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,180
♫  These unknown adventures and schemes  ♫

515
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,960
♫  It will ultimately be conquered in time  ♫

516
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,700
♫  Through raging flames we'll fight  ♫

517
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,480
♫  Beyond the nightmares, we'll stand in the light  ♫

518
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,320
♫  What's there to fear?  ♫

519
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,020
♫  Wu ~ Wu ~ Wu ~  ♫

520
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,220
♫  What's left to fear?  ♫

521
00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:29,756
Any last words?

522
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,580
Are you that easily scared?

523
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,780
Mu Dai.

524
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,120
I can let you go.

525
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,480
But listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

526
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,060
First...

527
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,520
I know it looked like I attacked Huo Zi Hong.

528
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,600
But did you actually see it happen?

529
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,200
Second, I've investigated Huo Zi Hong.

530
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,400
She comes from a poor family.

531
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,360
Her parents were vegetable vendors,

532
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,600
and she had to drop out in second grade to help at their stall.

533
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,201
Go back and observe her.

534
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,240
Does she match?

535
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,240
Third, I'm releasing you now.

536
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,921
Don't look back.

537
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:28,200
Or else, I may change my mind.

538
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,000
Auntie Hong.

539
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,800
Are you all right?

540
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,220
- I... 
 - Let me check.

541
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,440
I'm fine.

542
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,520
Really.

543
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,220
Don't worry.

544
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,520
- Sister. 
 - Lady Dai, are you all right?

545
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,180
What about that guy?

546
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,394
Not injured. Didn't catch him.

547
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,355
Couldn't beat him.

548
00:36:37,355 --> 00:36:39,515
Exhausted. Need rest.

549
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,839
 There was a Huo Zi Hong in Luoma Lake. 

550
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:43,760
 Lived at No. 12 Chenqian Alley. 

551
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,320
 Her parents were vegetable vendors, 

552
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,620
 and she had to drop out in second grade to help at their stall. 

553
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,728
 Go back and observe her. 

554
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,368
 Does she match? 

555
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:57,520
 How badly could she have hurt you? 

556
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,660
 Is she really that skilled? 

557
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:02,260
She's trained, after all.

558
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,420
Rare to meet real martial artists these days.

559
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,800
Her master must be exceptional.

560
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,000
 You two have already clashed.  
    

561
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,040
 This makes investigating harder now. 

562
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,720
Actually, I think it might get easier.

563
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,700
Fights reveal character and skills.

564
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,144
That Mu Dai girl is worth getting to know.

565
00:38:23,144 --> 00:38:26,044
 That's high praise. 

566
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,880
High?

567
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,480
 From you? Absolutely. 

568
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,800
You always say people around you are two-faced and ruthless.

569
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,980
 This is the first time I've heard you 

570
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,440
 say that someone "is worth getting to know." 

571
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,220
By the way, how's Ping Ting doing?

572
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,120
Not bad.

573
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,601
Same as always.

574
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:56,021
   

575
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,240
 Thankfully, she's the quiet type. 

576
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,920
 I couldn't handle her 

577
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,800
 if she were violent.  
    

578
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,000
 How about this? 

579
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,525
 Let's find her a better doctor. 

580
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:12,546
 You're investigating an old case. 

581
00:39:12,546 --> 00:39:15,706
 Even if you find the culprit, 

582
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,760
it won't help Ping Ting.

583
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,720
Uncle Zheng,

584
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,900
my uncle's case is too bizarre.

585
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,140
And Ping Ting's breakdown was too sudden.

586
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,871
That's why I believe the case itself is the key.

587
