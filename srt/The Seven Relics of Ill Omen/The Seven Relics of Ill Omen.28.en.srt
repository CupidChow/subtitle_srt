She knows it's the nemesis
of the relics of ill omen,

so she wants it
to avoid further trouble.

How can we get it within ten days?

180
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,580
Even if we do, we can't give it to her.

181
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,700
Did she mention the deal location?

182
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,260

And she calls this "a deal"?

186

When we fought the relics of ill omen,

194

we wouldn't have succeeded
without teamwork.

195
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020

In the worst case,

Yes.

Because Luo Ren and his men

00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,300
burned my house.

262
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,940

Please bless her, ancestor.

We're descendants of the Star Lord.

283
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,980
In no way can we be extinct.

284
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,540
Descendants of the Star Lord?

285
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,860
Your ancestor is a Star Lord?

286
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,660
Of course.

287
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,900
Not a lowly follower,

288
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,660
but an orthodox Star Lord.

289
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,260
I'm originally

290
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,900
from Xiacheng Town,
the southeast of Jiang Province.

291
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,380
My clan was infamous in town.

292
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,020
Because over 200 years ago,

293
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,780
my ancestor kept killing people.

294
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,660
The notorious "Snow Plum Case".

295
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,940
Descendants of such a murderer

296
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,980
would never rise

297
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,300
in that isolated town.

298
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,220
So,

299
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,140
my grandpa sailed south

300
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,580
and settled down in Heisha.

301
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,700
When I was disabled,

302
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,420
my grandpa checked the ancestral records

303
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,700
and sent many minions to Xiacheng Town

304
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,860
for the relics of ill omen.

305
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,220
They did find a man

306
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,900
who was possessed.

307
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,860
Was it appropriate?

308
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,500
Taking the relic of ill omen
from a Star Lord.

309
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:16,940
Him?

310
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,020
Not all the hosts

311
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,300
can be called "Star Lord".

312
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,740
He's just a "deliveryman".

313
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,580
He carried the relic of ill omen
in his body

314
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,660
and delivered it to me.

315
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,060
It took me a long time to blend into it.

316
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,100
The process was rather painful.

317
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,100
But I also enjoyed it.

318
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,100

just like a phoenix.

00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,340
Wonderful, indeed.

320
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,780
So,

321
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,940
you got me all the way here.

322
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,820
How will you deal with Luo Ren?

323
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,500
Are I that shallow in your eyes?

324
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,860
Revenge is just a side benefit.

325
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,580
What I really want is...

326

One relic of ill omen is so wonderful.

I can't be satisfied yet.

328
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,380

all the relics of ill omen.

00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,140
on Yin's genealogy, huh?

378
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,660
Yes.

379
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,780
It wasn't expressed directly.

380
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,580
It wasn't...

381
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,260
Among the ninth, tenth,

382
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,140
eleventh, and twelfth generations,

383
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,180
we can see some words

384
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,620
making up the Guansi Memorial Archway.

385
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,780
Mighty, you remind me of something.

386
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,580
The lintel of my master's gate

387
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,740
is inscribed with some words,

388
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,420
"Guansi Memorial Archway".

389
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,460
It's been a really long time.

390
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,260
The words have been decomposed.

391
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,700
Youwu Town is below Yun Ridge.

392
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,180
A wild goose will fly south.

393
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,180
Yin Village is in the north.

394
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,860
Youwu Town is in the south.

395
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,620
Ma mentioned the letter thing.

396
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,860
In ancient times,
people send letters by wild geese.

397
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,940
Wild geese deliver letters.

398
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,900
So, it means "a message".

399
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,540
Ma also said

400
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,860
the map was lost.

401
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,100
Map.

402
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,580
Right.

403
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,300
It's the map to Youwu Town.

404
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,300
It's more than that.

405
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,260
In the Snow Plum Case of Xiacheng Town,

406
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,700
there were five martial artists
whose mark was a plum blossom.

407
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,940
Mu Dai's master

408
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,900
is Meihua Jiuniang.

409
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,700
It's also about the plum blossom.

410
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,740
So, Mu Dai's sect

411
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,020
has something to do
with the relics of ill omen.

412
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,940
Get out.

413
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,820
Remember.

414
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,660
I want exactly the same.

415
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,980
Yes, madam.

416
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,820
To myself.

417
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,820
Go ahead, please.

418
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,820
I'm listening. Very carefully.

419
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,860
Three ridges.

420
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,660
Fiery, what are their names?

421
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,660
Fenghuang Ridge.

422
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,860
Fengfei Ridge, Fengzi Ridge.

423
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,900
I've made notes.

424
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,980
Why do people around Xiagu Pass

425
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,820
love to name a ridge like that?

426
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,980
Don't ask me for money.

427
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,220
I won't spend a penny.

428
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,220
I'll hang up.

429
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,260
Be persistent and honorable.

430
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,140
Mr. Kun.

431
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,100
Look at this.

432
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,460
A wooden bat.

433
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,100
Take a look.

434
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,540
How ingenious.

435
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,260
Is it the work
of the grandmaster of carpenters?

436
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,460
Who?

437
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,980
Grandmaster of carpenters.

438
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,540
The wooden kite he made

439
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,340
could fly three days and nights
without landing.

440
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,900
It's...

441
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,460
Mingshan.

442
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,700
It's...

443
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,420
We get lost in the mountain
even in the daytime.

444
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,220
The visibility is terrible at night.

445
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
How did Mu Dai and her master

446
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,860
tell the directions?

447
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,540
Mingshan,

448
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,660
you know this place best.

449
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,180
You must know, right?

450
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,380
The bat...

451
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,740
Lift its left wing three times.

452
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,180
Left, three times.

453
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,500
Press its right wing four times.

454
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,340
Right, four times.

455
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,620
I remember

456
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,580
once I saw my master

457
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,020
manipulate the Silver-Eyed Bat.

458
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,020
It can fly.

459
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,380
It's a flying map.

460
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,460
My master scolded me.

461
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,300
Those who aren't her heirs

462
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,260
can't know this secret.

463
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,500
She asked me to forget what I saw.

464
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,300
If I weren't trying to save Dai,

465
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,700
I wouldn't have told you.

466
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,140
But anyway,

467
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,740
I can't disobey my master.

468
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,460
So, I can't go with you.

469
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,660
Anyway,

470
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,980
I'll guard at the entrance
of the mountain.

471
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,860
To bring up the rear.

472
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,220
Be careful, guys.

473
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,300
Left, three times.

474
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,660
Right, four times.

475
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,900
Mighty, be careful on your way.

476
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,380
This is incredible.

477
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,900
It's not driven by steam
or internal combustion.

478
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,820
No solar energy or battery.

479
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,140
Ancient people are really wise.

480
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,700
Luo Ren.

481
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,820
Stay safe.

482
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,500
Don't try to be a hero.

483
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,180
Thank you.

484
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,180
Isn't it the...?

485
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,260
The...

486
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,660
Wild goose.

487
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,500
Come on.

488
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,700
Let's go check it out.

489
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,500
The door is open.

490
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,620
The bat took Mu Dai here, I think.

491
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,300
What do these characters mean?

492
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,180
Cao...

493
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,620
What is that?

494
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,140
Chubby,

495
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,620
have some safety awareness, okay?

496
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,620
It's a strange place

497
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,380
with a mechanism.

498
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,980
How can you press like that?

499
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,940
This is a secret cave of our sect.

500
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,660
Everything must be safe here.

501
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,100
Even if it's a mechanism,

502
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,180
it won't be too malicious.

503
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,780
I think

504
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,060
it's just something like a button.

505
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,460
Let's just try desperately.

506
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,220
How many times have we pressed?

507
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,380
My grandpa told me something

508
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,460
about ancient mechanisms.

509
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,060
I think you're right.

510
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,420
This is a password keypad.

511
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,260
But it just backed out.

512
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,740
So, we pressed wrongly.

513
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,020
Then it reset itself.

514
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,540
So the number of times we just pressed

515
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,740
should be the number of digits
in the password.

516
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,660
So, it's an eight-digit password.

517
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,620
Below Yun Ridge

518
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,380
is the Guansi Memorial Archway.

519
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,940
Ma told me

520
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,820
the key was kept inside his genealogy.

521
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,300
I used to think

522
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,460
it was a real key.

523
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,700
But it can just be a riddle.

524
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,260
Oh, I see.

525
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,140
If the map and the key

526
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,260
were set for this place,

527
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,100
the first half of the map

528
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,020
would be from Yin Village to Youwu Town.

529
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,140
The second half of the map

530
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,460
is the Silver-Eyed Bat.

531
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,900
As for the key...

532
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,940
The first half is the Silver-Eyed Bat.

533
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,020
The second half

534
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,060
is the riddle in the genealogy.

535
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,980
"A wild goose flying south" means
a messenger will come.

536
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,820
It has only eight words.

537
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,300
"Below Yun Ridge

538
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,780
is the Guansi Memorial Archway."

539
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:01,980
Right.

540
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,980
Let's find out these characters.

541
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,100
Yun.

542
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,020
Yun...

543
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:19,360
[Below Yun Ridge
is the Guansi Memorial Archway.]

544
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,220
Look. It's open.

545
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,420
One of us should guard out here.

546
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,860
There's a path ahead, right?

547
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,860
Never mind.

548
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,220
Tiankui Seven-Star.

549
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,820
The meteorite

550
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,820
probably comes from Tiankui Seven-Star.

551
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,100
Look at the mountain.

552
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,420
It looks like a phoenix.

553
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,020
It must be Feng... Ridge.

554
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,620
You know what?

555
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,100
This is a clever design.

556
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,020
Like the pictures in our childhood.

557
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
You can pull and see the next one.

558
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,580
So, the relics of ill omen

559
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,300
inhabited this tree at first.

560
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,020
It's the Stargazing Platform
in Yin Village, right?

561
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,580
So, the relics of ill omen
and the platform

562
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,540
both came from Tiankui Seven-Star.

563
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,860
These guys were ridiculous.

564
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,540
They took away the relics of ill omen.

565
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,740
They weren't to blame.

566
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,260
They didn't know
the relics of ill omen were dangerous.

567
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,380
Maybe

568
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,020
they thought they were treasures.

569
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,420
This man was hanged.

570
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,580
He was slashing someone.

571
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,380
This guy was buried alive.

572
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,260
This guy was pushed into the water.

573
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,380
After the relics of ill omen
were exposed,

574
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,100
many guys were killed in a strange way.

575
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,380
What is this?

576
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,940
I think exaggeration was used

577
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,740
to show how powerful
the relics of ill omen were.

578
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,900
The Great Virtuous One
was leading his followers

579
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,940
to fight against the relic of ill omen.

580
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,860
Wooden slips.

581
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,660
It must be the imperishable wood
that can trap the relics of ill omen.

582
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,380
So, the imperishable wood

583
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,460
is where the relics of ill omen
first dwelt.

584
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,620
I'll take some photos

585
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,540
and share them in the group chat.

586
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,020
In this way,

587
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,340
the sixth
and the seventh relics of ill omen

588
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,460
are "human" and "heart".

589
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,260
How can the human heart hurt people?

590
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,500
Stabbing, hanging,

591
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,100
drowning, burying
and even slandering people

592
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,140
are just appearances.

593
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,820
It's always the human heart

594
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,660
that fuels them.

595
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,140
Right. As people love to say,

596
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,380
humans should be honest and righteous.

597
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,940
If humans are wicked,

598
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,380
terrible things will happen.

599
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,260
So,

600
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,660
Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle
is made of meteorite.

601
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,780
This is what it looks like.

602
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,860
Anything else?

603
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,180
Watch out.

604
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,260
There's more in there.

605
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,540
Oh my gosh.

606
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,380
Be careful, Cao.

607
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,740
You...

608
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,740
- It's okay.
- I'll go too.

609
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,340
Interesting.

610
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,740
Guansi Memorial Archway.

611
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,460
Guansi means four pillars.

612
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,780
But we see five pillars here.

613
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,060
It should be another name.

614
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,380
We should observe four things.

615
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,220
What are they, four seasons?

616
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,500
Or four kinds of flowers?

617
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,620
Or just something else?

618
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,620
Is this archway in memory

619
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,020
of the five persons on it?

620
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,380
Fiery.

621
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,380
You know what?

622
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,100
You're so clever.

623
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,380
Let me guess,

624
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,620
the five of them were just like you.

625
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,020
They fought
against the relics of ill omen.

626
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,100
I think they are

627
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:25,100
the five martial artists
in the Snow Plum Case.

628
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,980
And the kneeling figurines
in the cave of Cao Village.

629
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,060
So,

630
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,620
they're the Phoenix Squad
in ancient times.

631
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,780
What a coincidence.

632
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,780
Also three men and two women.

633
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,460
That's right.

634
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,700
The man opposite us.

635
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,620
He looks really strong.

636
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,620
That's just me, isn't it?

637
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,460
And one of them is...

638
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,380
Then I'm the one...

639
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,860
Yeah. Someone's name is Hai.

640
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,140
You were just born by the sea.

641
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,180
[Haibin]

642
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,820
- I'm him.
- In this case,

643
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,020
this girl looks like me.

644
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,060
Her posture shows she isn't a pushover.

645
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,180
And there seems to be a little bell

646
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,900
on the tassel of her sword.

647
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,020
Just like mine.

648
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,940
Wait. Do you think it's like the...?

649
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,660
I mean

650
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,940
the five-door design.

651
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,380
The doors can't be open

652
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,580
unless they're pushed together.

653
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,020
Shall we have a try?

654
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,620
Each of us

655
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,700
will choose a door.

656
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,060
Then we'll push together.

657
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,820
Okay.

658
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,340
- I'm over there.
- Go.

659
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,300
Let's push our own door.

660
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:37,980
- Come on.
- I'll do this one.

661
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,540
Okay.

662
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,340
Shall I take Pocketty's place?

663
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,100
I'll push this one.

664
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,540
Okay.

665
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,100
I'll be here.

666
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,540
Are you ready?

667
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,460
Yes.

668
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,180
Yes.

669
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,220
One, two, three.

670
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,020
You must remember who you are

671
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,820
and who I am.

672
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,420
You must remember.

673
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,260
You can't end up like Tasha.
