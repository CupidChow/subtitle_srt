1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,940
 

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:25,000



3
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,180
Title

4
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,020
 

5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,925
 

6
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,680
Mu Dai!

7
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,780
Mu Dai!

8
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,640
Mu Dai!

9
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,020
Mu Dai.

10
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,340
Free?

11
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,180
Mu Dai.

12
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,760
Mu Dai!

13
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,040
Luo.

14
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,260
Let her go.

15
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,760
It's between us.

16
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,020
Don't get others involved.

17
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,620
Luo,

18
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:18,080
aren't you a brave little child?

19
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,440
This between you and me will always affect your loved ones.

20
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,580
Let's see. Your daughter.

21
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,813
Your brothers.

22
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:29,020
There's no reason she...

23
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,920
She'll be an exception, isn't it?

24
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,612
So...

25
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:50,415
You can't kill her until you kill me first.

26
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:52,981
Is that a promise?

27
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,600
Have you ever kept one before?

28
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,260
Remember what you said to your daughter?

29
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,020
"Daddy will always protect you."

30
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,747
Then what happened?

31
00:04:03,747 --> 00:04:05,356
And your brothers.

32
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:08,236
You guys burst into my home
and tried to kill me.

33
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:12,162
They're all dead, but you're still alive.

34
00:04:12,162 --> 00:04:13,815
Now here we are.

35
00:04:13,815 --> 00:04:16,425
After all those promises,

36
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,120
you're still gonna break it this time.

37
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,800
 ♫ Trapped in darkness, longing for daylight ♫ 

38
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,140
 ♫ Pursuing light behind the fog ♫ 

39
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,200
 ♫ Just drag me into the whirlpool ♫ 

40
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,220
 ♫ I know you will hold on to me at last ♫ 

41
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,000
 ♫ Good and evil may rise from a single thought ♫ 

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,880
 ♫ It doesn't take a reason
for us to stand together ♫ 

43
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,740
 ♫ Hands are joined ♫ 

44
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,820
 ♫ even without heaven's blessing ♫ 

45
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,557
 ♫ Those unknown adventures and schemes ♫ 

46
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:10,480
 ♫ Will ultimately be conquered ♫ 

47
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,880
 ♫ If you are still persistent,
I dare to go along ♫ 

48
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,886
 ♫ Beyond the nightmares we'll open our eyes ♫ 

49
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,080
 ♫ What's there to fear? ♫ 

50
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,260
Leopard fixes her eyes on us.

51
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,200
Just in case, we need a warning code.

52
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Don't wait for me to have dinner.

53
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,540
Aoki, take her away.

54
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,220
Hurry!

55
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,960
Leave.

56
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,140
Don't you want to revenge? Just kill me.

57
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,120
Daddy!

58
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,046
I'm a very reasonable person.

59
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:56,366
There's two here.

60
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:59,120
You can only take one.

61
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,655
Listen.

62
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,875
Only one.

63
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:05,394
Decide.

64
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,760
Aoki.

65
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,121
 
How is he, Aoki?

66
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:41,980
- Is he in there?
- What's going on in there?

67
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,480
What did you say?

68
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,700
What do you mean? He was shot?

69
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,920
Stop making noises.

70
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,140
Don't you know this is a hospital?

71
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,080
Let him speak.

72
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,080
I thought he was shot four times.

73
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,100
But they aren't bullet wounds.

74
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,463
No bullets in his body.

75
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:59,660
So, I told the doctor
it was an engineering accident.

76
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,360
Totally unexpected.

77
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,070
Is his problem serious?

78
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,260
Better than being shot.

79
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,420
But... Serious, indeed.

80
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,980
This is it.

81
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,220
No bullets are in his body.

82
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,081
Luo Ren was here to save
you and gave you a little hug.

83
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,525
And then, he took one, two, three, four...

84
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:45,900
Four bullets.

85
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,680
Don't you want to know if he's dead?

86
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,640
Let me tell you. Of course, he is not dead.

87
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,060
I told you. His death is never my intention.

88
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,680
Too bad you missed Luo Ren's face
when he met Tasha.

89
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,940
It was very interesting.

90
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,060
Tasha?

91
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,260
Oh.

92
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,505
Don't you remember?

93
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,705
I told you. I have trump cards.

94
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,940
Mummy.

95
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,420
What's your name?

96
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,020
Tasha, Linda, Emma.

97
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,000
Whatever you like, Mummy.

98
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,165
Where are you from?

99
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:32,746
Anywhere as your wish.

100
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:35,338
Who's your favorite person in the world?

101
00:09:35,338 --> 00:09:36,600
It's you, Mummy.

102
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,355
What happens if someone bullies Mummy?

103
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:41,735
I'll kill him!

104
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,220
Good girl. Go play.

105
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:55,514
Isn't she so cute?

106
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:57,475
One day, you'll be just like her.

107
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:59,860
Loyal and obedient.

108
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,200
You'll use me against Luo Ren?

109
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,860
You're so important to him.

110
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,320
I have to think about it.

111
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,400
With all your grand debut.

112
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,537
That's all.

113
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:13,211
It's time to go and see Luo Ren.

114
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,471
Any words for him?

115
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,242
Pretty.

116
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:28,703
Give it back to me.

117
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:30,184
I know this.

118
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:33,485
It's his. It's Luo's.

119
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:36,065
Luo gave a token for your love?

120
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,860
I was wondering what gift I should give to Luo.

121
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:48,018
Tell him.

122
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:49,960
I may not go back to him.

123
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,560
If he misses me, blow the whistle
like he can see me.

124
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,920
Luo, your girlfriend must be Alice in Wonderland.

125
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,940
Mu Dai.

126
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Where's Mu Dai?

127
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,240
Let's have a talk.

128
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,540
What did you do to her?

129
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,480
Luo, we've always been at odds with each other.

130
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,301
Your abilities are no match for mine.

131
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:35,072
And your fatal weakness

132
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:39,206
is being easily distracted by appearances.

133
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,522
The moment you saw her hairpin, you and your guys, couldn't wait to take revenge.

134
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:47,902
Every one of them died in the end.

135
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,660
The moment you saw the old lady's body,

136
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,140
you just rushed back, leaving your girl with me.

137
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:05,311
Luo,

138
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:10,496
you're totally messed up.

139
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:14,686
You'll always be beneath me.

140
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:19,935
But now?

141
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:23,910
I have to make a deal.

142
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,811
There's a favor I need you to do for me.

143
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:33,502
Your little beauty will be safe
for the next ten days.

144
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:36,662
And I need you to fetch something

145
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,646
and exchange for her.

146
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:41,646
What is it?

147
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,300
Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

148
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,420
How do I know where it is?

149
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,520
That's your problem.

150
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:03,619
I'll be waiting for you in Heisha.

151
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:06,100
Leopard, if you dare to hurt Mu Dai,

152
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,540
I won't let you go!

153
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,000
Doctor, he'll check out.

154
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,450
Check out?

155
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,795
But he hasn't recovered yet.

156
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:20,993
Yes. Please do it now.

157
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:25,054
You're badly hurt. If you go out now,
can you hold up?

158
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:26,855
I have only ten days.

159
00:14:26,855 --> 00:14:28,896
Such a vicious woman.

160
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:30,657
She asked for Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

161
00:14:30,657 --> 00:14:32,262
She knows it's the nemesis
of the relics of ill omen,

162
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:34,072
so she wants it to avoid further trouble.

163
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,505
Ten days?

164
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:36,950
How can we get it within ten days?

165
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,470
Even if we do, we can't give it to her.

166
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:42,489
Did she mention the deal location?

167
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,420
In Heisha.

168
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,341
Luo, you'll go to her lair.

169
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:53,902
And she calls this "a deal"?

170
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:56,282
You'll be a lamb to the slaughter.

171
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,520
I have no choice.

172
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,281
Heisha.

173
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:15,249
Can you even imagine?

174
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:19,575
Only strong guys like Senior Master and Aoki will dare to go.

175
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:21,376
Anyway, we can't just do nothing.

176
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:22,761
When we fought the relics of ill omen,

177
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:25,863
we wouldn't have succeeded without teamwork.

178
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,190
It makes sense.

179
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,271
We're in such big trouble.

180
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:31,911
Should we tell Mr. Kun, right?

181
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,590
 

182
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:49,396
I'm so worried.

183
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:50,901
But you brought a fake cock.

184
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:52,779
How heartless! Leave right away!

185
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,120
- Take another look.
- Guys back there, check what you're holding.

186
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,280
Look at the painting.

187
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,800
 
Do they look alike? A rooster.

188
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,600
- And what is this?
- Don't fool me like that.

189
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,160
- They look alike.
- And a Brazilian turtle. Whose is it?

190
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,480
- It's mine.
- Take it away. A frog, at least.

191
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,346
Don't be kidding me. Go away now!

192
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:10,526
How ridiculous.

193
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,900
Mr. Kun, how come you arrived so soon?

194
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,100
I have to.

195
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,100
When I was away for a short while, such a big accident happened.

196
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,560
I have to stay here.

197
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,720
I gave instructions to Wan Feng Huo.

198
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,400
He'll give a priority investigation on Feng X Ridge near Xiagu Pass.

199
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,240
Ma told me

200
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,080
the imperishable wood and
Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle both came from there.

201
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,640
An investigation there will succeed.

202
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,920
Feng... Ridge.

203
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,260
Hey, that's a big place.

204
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,440
How can we find Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle?

205
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,660
Leopard is really vicious.

206
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,020
Don't mention her! Just don't!

207
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,820
Free Cao is missing.

208
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,480
According to Luo,
Leopard was there when it was last seen.

209
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,660
In the worst case, Leopard stewed it and ate it.

210
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,263
This woman is extremely vicious.

211
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:15,120
She even kills animals!

212
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,621
She killed my grandmaster, kidnapped my master,

213
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,002
and ate my pet.

214
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:23,787
She isn't Luo Ren's enemy.

215
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:26,167
She's my enemy!

216
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,140
We'll be sworn enemies!

217
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,960
Drink some water and calm down.

218
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,380
Welcome to Heisha.

219
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,640
How do you feel?

220
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:21,911
Does it feel good to live in my home?

221
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:23,811
Your home?

222
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,965
Yes.

223
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,360
If you had come two years before,

224
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,440
you could see the real jaguar
going around in my house.

225
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:43,160
But now, you can't.

226
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,520
Because Luo Ren and his men burned my house.

227
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,920
It doesn't matter, anyway.

228
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,420
Even if it's a ruined house, nobody dares to mess with it.

229
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,140
What's mine is always mine.

230
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,100
Yes.

231
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,400
Nobody can take away anything from you.

232
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,140
Either the diamond necklace or this house.

233
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,160
And my life.

234
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,540
No one can take it.

235
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,552
 My grandpa... 

236
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:34,440
 I thought he was a useless elderly man. 

237
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,040
 Unexpectedly, when I became a helpless wreck, 

238
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,800
 he gave me a big surprise. 

239
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,280
Heaven, earth, and humans.

240
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,240
Sun, moon, and stars.

241
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,380
Your descendant is in trouble.

242
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,920
Please bless her, ancestor.

243
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,320
We're descendants of the Star Lord.

244
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,020
In no way can we be extinct.

245
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,560
Descendants of the Star Lord?

246
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,500
Your ancestor is a Star Lord?

247
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,340
Of course.

248
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,120
Not a lowly follower,

249
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,740
but an orthodox Star Lord.

250
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,260
I'm originally from Xiacheng Town, the southeast of Jiang Province.

251
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,330
My clan was infamous in town.

252
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,720
Because over 200 years ago,

253
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,660
my ancestor kept killing people.

254
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,860
The notorious "Snow Plum Case".

255
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,340
Descendants of such a murderer
were always shamed

256
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,180
in that isolated town.

257
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:46,460
So, my grandpa sailed south
and settled down in Heisha.

258
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:49,202
 When I was disabled, 

259
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:52,460
 my grandpa checked the ancestral records 

260
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,620
 and sent many minions to Xiacheng Town 

261
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,020
 for the relics of ill omen. 

262
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,680
 They found a man who was possessed. 

263
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,760
Was it appropriate?

264
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,220
Taking the relic of ill omen from a Star Lord.

265
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,320
Him?

266
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,820
Not all the hosts can be called "Star Lord".

267
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,480
He's just a "deliveryman".

268
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,360
He carried the relic of ill omen in his body and delivered it to me.

269
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,700
 It took me a long time to blend into it. 

270
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,820
 The process was rather painful. 

271
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,940
 But I also enjoyed it. 

272
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,980
 I rose from the fire just like a phoenix. 

273
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,900
Wonderful, indeed.

274
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,220
So, you got me all the way here.

275
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,700
How will you deal with Luo Ren?

276
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,616
Are I that shallow in your eyes?

277
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,756
Revenge is just a side benefit.

278
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:13,314
What I really want is...

279
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,580
One relic of ill omen is so wonderful.

280
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,060
I can't be satisfied yet.

281
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,360
I'll bring back all the relics of ill omen.

282
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,140
And...

283
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:37,542
I'll be their predestined master.

284
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,630
Yin Yun Xiang, Yin Yun Hou.

285
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,527
Yin Ling Feng, Yin Ling Bang, Yin Ling...

286
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:54,155
It's...

287
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:56,010
This is a ranking of seniority.

288
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,490
Yun Ridge.

289
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,659
Our sect is there, isn't it?

290
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:01,520
Chubby, let me have a look.

291
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,968
Come on.

292
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:05,489
Names.

293
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:07,360
Seniority ranking.

294
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,900
Put it down on your phone.

295
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,140
- Okay. 
 - North. N-O-R-T-H, north.

296
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,820
- Okay.
- Then a wild goose.

297
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,520
South, S-O-U-T-H. Fly.

298
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,340
F-L-Y, fly. Yun, Y-U-N.

299
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,280
Ridge, R-I-D-G-E.

300
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Then is... I-S, is.

301
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,420
B-E-L-O-W, below.

302
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,940
Guan. G-U-A-N.

303
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,120
Si, S-I.

304
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,500
M-E-M-O-R-I-A-L.

305
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
- Yes, I know.
- Memorial.

306
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,509
- Yes.
- Memorial.

307
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,860
 
Archway.

308
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,420
"A wild goose will fly south."

309
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,705
"Below Yun Ridge is the
Guansi Memorial Archway."

310
00:23:37,705 --> 00:23:40,885
It sounds nice.

311
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:43,869
But I can't see any word from Yin Er Ma's name.

312
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:46,310
His original name is Yin Si Ma.

313
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,760
He didn't like it and had a new name.

314
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,440
Just two letters. There's no difference.

315
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,020
You just said you found
the Guansi Memorial Archway on Yin's genealogy?

316
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,100
Yes.

317
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,952
It wasn't expressed directly. It wasn't...

318
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:03,120
Among the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th generations,

319
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,200
we can see some words

320
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,940
making up the Guansi Memorial Archway.

321
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,585
Mighty, you remind me of something.

322
00:24:09,585 --> 00:24:13,609
The lintel of my master's gate

323
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:16,135
is inscribed with some words,

324
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:18,280
"Guansi Memorial Archway".

325
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,422
It's been a really long time.

326
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:23,362
The words have been decomposed.

327
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,480
Youwu Town is below Yun Ridge.

328
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,985
A wild goose will fly south.

329
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:36,546
Yin Village is in the north.

330
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:38,227
Youwu Town is in the south.

331
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,948
Ma mentioned the letter thing.

332
00:24:39,948 --> 00:24:41,809
In ancient times,
people send letters by wild geese.

333
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:43,190
Wild geese deliver letters.

334
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,130
So, it means "a message".

335
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,280
Ma also said the map was lost.

336
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,820
Map.

337
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,345
Right. It's the map to Youwu Town.

338
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:57,220
It's more than that.

339
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,940
In the Snow Plum Case of Xiacheng Town,

340
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,780
there were five martial artists
whose mark was a plum blossom.

341
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,705
Mu Dai's master is Meihua Jiu Niang.

342
00:25:07,705 --> 00:25:09,146
It's also about the plum blossom.

343
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:14,801
So, Mu Dai's sect has something to do with the relics of ill omen.

344
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,820
Get out.

345
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,020
Remember.

346
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,640
I want exactly the same.

347
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,760
Yes, madam.

348
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,016
To myself.

349
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:45,060
Go ahead, please.

350
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,740
I'm listening. Very carefully.

351
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,380
Three ridges.

352
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,565
Fiery, what are their names?

353
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:53,080
Fenghuang Ridge.

354
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,700
Fengfei Ridge, Fengzi Ridge.

355
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,560
I've made notes.

356
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,020
Why do people around Xiagu Pass

357
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,420
love to name a ridge like that?

358
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,060
Don't ask me for money.

359
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,420
I won't spend a penny.

360
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,900
I'll hang up.

361
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,040
Be persistent and honorable.

362
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,160
Mr. Kun, look at this.

363
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,040
A wooden bat.

364
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,880
Take a look.

365
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,500
How ingenious.

366
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,820
Is it the work of the grandmaster of carpenters?

367
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,940
- Who?
- The grandmaster of carpenters.

368
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,420
The wooden kite he made

369
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,220
could fly three days and nights without landing.

370
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,672
It's...

371
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:47,940
Ming Shan.

372
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,700
- It's...
- We get lost in the mountain even in the daytime.

373
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,420
The visibility is terrible at night.

374
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,840
How did Mu Dai and her master tell the directions?

375
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,040
Ming Shan, you know this place best.

376
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,160
You must know, right?

377
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,160
The bat...

378
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:16,916
Lift its left wing three times.

379
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:17,960
Left, three times.

380
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,180
Press its right wing four times.

381
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,360
Right, four times.

382
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,560
I remember once I saw my master

383
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,600
manipulate the Silver-Eyed Bat.

384
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,100
It can fly. It's a flying map.

385
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,880
My master scolded me.

386
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,040
Those who aren't her heirs can't know this secret.

387
00:28:39,045 --> 00:28:42,342
She asked me to forget what I saw.

388
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:47,157
If I weren't trying to save Dai,

389
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,280
I wouldn't have told you.

390
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,780
But anyway, I can't disobey my master.

391
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,737
So, I can't go with you.

392
00:28:55,737 --> 00:29:01,390
Anyway, I'll guard at the entrance of the mountain.

393
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,058
To bring up the rear.

394
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:06,038
Be careful, guys.

395
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,180
Left, three times.

396
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,540
Right, four times.

397
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,140
Mighty, be careful on your way.

398
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,920
This is incredible.

399
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,780
It's not driven by steam or internal combustion.

400
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,120
No solar energy or battery.

401
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,020
Ancient people are really wise.

402
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,580
Luo Ren.

403
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,260
Stay safe. Don't try to be a hero.

404
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,960
Thank you.

405
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,500
Isn't it the...?

406
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,140
The...

407
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,540
Wild goose.

408
00:30:39,865 --> 00:30:42,500
Come on. Let's go check it out.

409
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,280
The door is open.

410
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,798
The bat took Mu Dai here, I think.

411
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:53,118
What do these characters mean?

412
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,960
Cao...

413
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,400
What is that?

414
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,681
Chubby, have some safety awareness, okay?

415
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:16,342
It's a strange place with a mechanism.

416
00:32:16,342 --> 00:32:17,943
How can you press like that?

417
00:32:17,943 --> 00:32:20,224
This is a secret cave of our sect.

418
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,540
Everything must be safe here.

419
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,099
Even if it's a mechanism,
it won't be too malicious.

420
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:28,799
I think it's just something like a button.

421
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,260
Let's just try, since we are desperate.

422
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,078
How many times have we pressed?

423
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:01,879
My grandpa told me something
about ancient mechanisms.

424
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,020
I think you're right.

425
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,500
This is a password keypad.

426
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,041
But it just backed out.

427
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:08,622
So, we pressed wrongly.

428
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:10,023
Then it reset itself.

429
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:11,424
So the number of times we just pressed

430
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,285
should be the number of digits in the password.

431
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:15,866
So, it's an eight-digit password.

432
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:18,466
Below Yun Ridge

433
00:33:19,482 --> 00:33:21,523
is the Guansi Memorial Archway.

434
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:25,648
Ma told me the key was kept inside his genealogy.

435
00:33:25,648 --> 00:33:28,900
I used to think it was a real key.

436
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,260
But it can just be a riddle.

437
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,840
Oh, I see.

438
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,740
If the map and the key were set for this place,

439
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,371
the first half of the map

440
00:33:38,371 --> 00:33:40,758
would be from Yin Village to Youwu Town.

441
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:43,859
The second half of the map is the Silver-Eyed Bat.

442
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:45,405
As for the key...

443
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:48,566
The first half is the Silver-Eyed Bat.

444
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:52,547
The second half is the riddle in the genealogy.

445
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:56,508
"A wild goose flying south" means
a messenger will come.

446
00:33:56,508 --> 00:33:58,249
It has only eight words.

447
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:01,170
"Below Yun Ridge is the Guansi Memorial Archway."

448
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,941
Right.

449
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:05,321
Let's find out these characters.

450
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:07,170
Yun.

451
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,611
Yun...

452
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:14,600
 

453
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,231
 

454
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,200
Look. It's open.

455
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,202
One of us should guard out here.

456
00:34:50,202 --> 00:34:52,662
There's a path ahead, right?

457
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,640
Never mind.

458
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,620
Tiankui Seven-Star.

459
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,140
The meteorite probably
comes from Tiankui Seven-Star.

460
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,925
Look at the mountain.

461
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:07,626
It looks like a phoenix.

462
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:09,846
It must be Feng... Ridge.

463
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,500
You know what? This is a clever design.

464
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,940
Like the pictures in our childhood.

465
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,840
You can pull and see the next one.

466
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,040
So, the relics of ill omen inhabited this tree at first.

467
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,420
It's the Stargazing Platform
in Yin Village, right?

468
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,800
So, the relics of ill omen and the platform

469
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,520
both came from Tiankui Seven-Star.

470
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,100
These guys were ridiculous.

471
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,460
They took away the relics of ill omen.

472
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,880
They weren't to blame.

473
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,460
They didn't know
the relics of ill omen were dangerous.

474
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,700
Maybe they thought they were treasures.

475
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,037
This man was hanged.

476
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:12,051
He was slashing someone.

477
00:36:12,051 --> 00:36:14,136
This guy was buried alive.

478
00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:16,560
This guy was pushed into the water.

479
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,200
After the relics of ill omen were exposed,

480
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,080
many guys were killed in a strange way.

481
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,120
What is this?

482
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,760
I think exaggeration was used

483
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,720
to show how powerful the relics of ill omen were.

484
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:32,834
The Great Virtuous One was leading his followers

485
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:34,934
to fight against the relic of ill omen.

486
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,381
Wooden slips.

487
00:36:38,381 --> 00:36:41,102
It must be the imperishable wood
that can trap the relics of ill omen.

488
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,423
So, the imperishable wood

489
00:36:42,423 --> 00:36:44,520
is where the relics of ill omen first dwelt.

490
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,080
I'll take some photos
and share them in the group chat.

491
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,880
In this way, the sixth

492
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,880
and the seventh relics of ill omen are "human" and "heart".

493
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,460
How can the human heart hurt people?

494
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,790
Stabbing, hanging,

495
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,120
drowning, burying and even slandering people are just appearances.

496
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,600
It's always the human heart

497
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,800
that fuels them.

498
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,120
Right. As people love to say,

499
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,380
humans should be honest and righteous.

500
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,160
If humans are wicked, terrible things will happen.

501
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:27,000
So, the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle
is made of meteorite.

502
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,949
This is what it looks like.

503
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:30,809
Anything else?

504
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,060
Watch out.

505
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,140
There's more in there.

506
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,420
Oh my gosh.

507
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,667
- Be careful, Cao. 
- You...

508
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,670
- It's okay. 
 - I'll go too.

509
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,160
Interesting.

510
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,620
Guansi Memorial Archway.

511
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,380
Guansi means four pillars.

512
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,781
But we see five pillars here.

513
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:55,080
It should be another name.

514
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,740
We should observe four things.

515
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,220
What are they, four seasons?

516
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,940
Or four kinds of flowers?

517
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,325
Or just something else?

518
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:07,580
Is this archway in memory
of the five persons on it?

519
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,540
Fiery. You know what?

520
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,820
You're so clever.

521
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,200
Let me guess, the five of them were just like you.

522
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,860
They fought against the relics of ill omen.

523
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:25,560
I think they are the five martial artists in the Snow Plum Case.

524
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,760
And the kneeling figurines
in the cave of Cao Village.

525
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:36,400
So, they're the Phoenix Squad in ancient times.

526
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,485
What a coincidence.

527
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:42,560
- Also three men and two women.
- That's right.

528
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,020
The man opposite us.

529
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,400
He looks really strong.

530
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,500
That's just me, isn't it?

531
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,360
- And one of them is...
- Then I'm the one...

532
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,540
Yes. Someone's name is Hai.

533
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,020
You were just born by the sea.

534
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,160
 

535
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,260
- I'm him.
- In this case, this girl looks like me.

536
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,660
Her posture shows she isn't a pushover.

537
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,000
And there seems to be a little bell on the tassel of her sword.

538
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,900
Just like mine.

539
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,820
Wait. Do you think it's like the...?

540
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,060
I mean the five-door design.

541
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:27,060
The doors can't be open
unless they're pushed together.

542
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,900
Shall we have a try?

543
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,940
Each of us will choose a door.

544
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,900
Then we'll push together.

545
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,300
Okay.

546
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,440
- I'm over there.
- Go.

547
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,860
- Let's push our own door.
- I'll do this one.

548
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,220
- Okay.
- Shall I take Pocketty's place?

549
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,320
- I'll push this one.
- Okay.

550
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,880
I'll be here.

551
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,960
Are you ready?

552
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

553
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,000
One, two, three.

554
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,910
You must remember who you are and who I am.

555
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,260
You must remember.

556
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,220
You can't end up like Tasha.

557
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:10,010



558
