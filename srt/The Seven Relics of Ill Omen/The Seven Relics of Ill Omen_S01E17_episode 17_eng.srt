1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,040
   

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:24,050



3
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,380
   

4
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,020
   

5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,080
   

6
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,620
Officiers, something wrong?

7
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,740
We think you're harboring a murderer.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,840
Hey, Auntie.

9
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,140
- What's wrong? 
 - Auntie said you...

10
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,260
You killed someone.

11
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,655
She's there!

12
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:54,340
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

13
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,740
- Stop! 
 - She's there!

14
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,300
- Stop running! 
 - We're the police.

15
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,980
- Stop! 
 - Stop running!

16
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,655
♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

17
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,240
Stop running.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,640
♫  Like a whisper in my mind, a fleeting touch across my face  ♫

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,200
- Stop! 
 - Stop!

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,980
♫  Yet I find myself in the dark  ♫

21
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,820
Luo Ren?

22
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,640
For your information, we don't see the suspect here.

23
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,820
 She's seen in the west. Go help them. 

24
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,640
Roger.

25
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,220
Excuse me, does Mu Dai live here?

26
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,400
Who are you?

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,480
I'm her boyfriend.

28
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,560
So, you're "sort of."

29
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,900
"Sort of"?

30
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,380
Once I asked her if she had a boyfriend.

31
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,580
She said, "Sort of."

32
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,740
She also said she got you when she was muddled.

33
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,280
That's ridiculous.

34
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,600
- Where is she now? 
 - She ran away.

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,425
Just now, a lot of policemen came, accusing her of murdering.

36
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,160
   

37
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,180
   

38
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,220
   

39
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,280
   

40
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,420
Mu Dai.

41
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,160
How did you get here?

42
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,260
I need your help, of course.

43
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,080
Put me in your trunk.

44
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,540
I'll leave Nantian.

45
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,380
Come in here.

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,920
You want to run away?

47
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,320
Or what?

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,160
You know what I did, huh?

49
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,420
Or will I stay and get caught?

50
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Will you help me?

51
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,340
Say something.

52
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,840
You must be hungry.

53
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,960
Would you like to eat something and have a rest?

54
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,280
Okay.

55
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,700
Is there a change of clothes?

56
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,500
I'll take a bath.

57
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,860
Long time no see.

58
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,760
How have you been?

59
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,960
You know what?

60
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:57,017
Years ago, I had a skin condition.

61
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:03,220
At first, it was a small piece of ringworm.

62
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,880
Later, it was all over my face

63
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,480
and even my body, like a plague.

64
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,700
Then I became a monster who looked terrible.

65
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,380
Everybody spurned me.

66
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,725
And then, I became the ringworm of Nantian.

67
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,320
I watched the ringworm of Nantian grow bigger and bigger,

68
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,720
until one day, it merged with me.

69
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,880
You don't know how excited I was.

70
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,420
"How have I been?"

71
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,280
Great.

72
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,520
Really, really great.

73
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,620
Long time no see.

74
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,660
You made me wait here for 20 years.

75
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,740
Should we start our game?

76
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,580
It's too late.

77
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,260
Many stores are closed.

78
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,860
Take a good rest tonight.

79
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,660
I'll buy you inner and outer clothes tomorrow.

80
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,060
It's thoughtful of you.

81
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,100
You're not a perfect boyfriend but a good partner.

82
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,060
I finished eating.

83
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,660
So, will you help me?

84
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,700
Mu Dai, I have a few questions.

85
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,040
First, in this day and age, you have no money and don't want to get exposed.

86
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,580
How far can you go?

87
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,420
You may hide now, but can you hide forever?

88
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,340
Are you helping or ruining yourself?

89
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,940
Second, did you kill anyone?

90
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,520
I don't know. I'm not sure.

91
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,820
I heard two witnesses testify against me.

92
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,900
You want to run away before knowing anything.

93
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,780
If you end up in another place where you're also accused, will you run away again?

94
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,200
Is this the way you solve a problem?

95
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,880
What's your point?

96
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,060
Mu Dai.

97
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Dr. He said you were more rational and powerful.

98
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,000
But I don't think so.

99
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,980
Pocketty is much braver than you.

100
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,380
- What did you say? 
 - Am I wrong?

101
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,980
When you were accused, you ran away in the first place.

102
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,740
Did you really kill him?

103
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,980
What if you were framed?

104
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,260
I just think it's troublesome to explain anything.

105
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,760
Running away causes more trouble.

106
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,620
I'm here to help you.

107
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,840
You must tell me what happened that night.

108
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,220
I was in a bad mood.

109
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,340
Then, I took a walk around the bridge.

110
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,760
In my memory, I didn't kill anyone.

111
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,160
In your memory?

112
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,300
I didn't kill anyone.

113
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,280
But I'm not sure if she went out.

114
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,820
She?

115
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,360
Pocketty wouldn't kill anyone.

116
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,540
Are you sure? Do you know her well?

117
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,840
Of course. I know her better than anyone else.

118
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,565
Don't say "she."

119
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:47,806
You are Mu Dai.

120
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:49,806
I'm not her.

121
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,440
Let's...

122
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,200
Play a game.

123
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,500
No preconceptions. Don't suspect yourself.

124
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,980
Try your best to defend yourself.

125
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,780
This is a game of defense.

126
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,900
You're framed.

127
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,040
You must offer convincing reasons to defend yourself.

128
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,540
Five seconds for one reason.

129
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,560
If you fail, you'll drink.

130
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,220
If you succeed, I'll drink.

131
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,460
You have five chances.

132
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,100
If you end up with no reason, you'll be the murderer.

133
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,620
Do you dare?

134
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,480
Bring it on.

135
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,080
The first.

136
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,400
   

137
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,160
Time's up.

138
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,020
Again.

139
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,260
Time's up.

140
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,740
Go on.

141
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,760
Five.

142
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,800
Four.

143
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,020
Three.

144
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,932
Two. One.

145
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:11,520
- You fail. You're the murderer. 
 - I'm not.

146
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,620
In ancient times, a lot of criminals whined in the court.

147
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,500
But a flogging would make them confess.

148
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,860
I said, I'm not.

149
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,500
- Reason. 
 - Reason?

150
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,360
Zhang Tong and I aren't enemies.

151
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,620
Just nodding acquaintances. Why would I kill him?

152
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,940
I have no motive.

153
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,980
Okay. It counts.

154
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,720
You have no motive.

155
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,880
Go on.

156
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,980
Even if we had a problem, I just happened to meet him.

157
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,700
He's just an ordinary man.

158
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,380
I couldn't have easily knocked him down.

159
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,860
Why would I kill him?

160
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,700
Okay. It counts too.

161
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,540
And I knew everything I wanted to know and planned to leave here.

162
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,720
Why would I go to that bridge?

163
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,740
I found out there were two witnesses.

164
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,780
One is Ma Chao and the other is Song Tie.

165
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,180
They don't know each other.

166
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,600
But outsiders may not know a secret relationship.

167
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,940
So, they could be colluding or accusing you deliberately.

168
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,060
Why did they frame me?

169
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,760
Zhang Tong was murdered.

170
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,480
The murderer wants a scapegoat.

171
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,180
Indeed. Something's fishy in this case.

172
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,760
Anyway, I'd like to see who's trying to frame me.

173
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,700
Have a good rest tonight.

174
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,300
I'll get a room next door.

175
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,700
Tomorrow, we'll check out the clues.

176
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,340
Mu Dai.

177
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,201
Luo Ren. Is Mu Dai all right?

178
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:28,029
Don't be so indirect.

179
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,409
Luo Ren, does she have a split personality?

180
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,580
She's a bit different indeed.

181
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,680
You must get used to that.

182
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,038
If she sounds harsh, please try to bear with it.

183
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,380
What are they doing here?

184
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,500
They worry about you.

185
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,740
And many hands make light work.

186
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,000
What can they do?

187
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Hong Sha has some family-inherited skills.

188
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,800
The other two guys are the fillers, huh?

189
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,080
Mu Dai, you poor little thing.

190
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,680
Look at you. You're skinny.

191
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,880
Don't worry. We'll handle this.

192
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,800
Right. Master, don't worry.

193
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,380
Later, we'll go talk to Ma Chao and the other man.

194
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,840
We'll take care of this for you.

195
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,280
You're untalented or qualified.

196
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,400
I wonder what's wrong with her.

197
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,500
She has a casual boyfriend and a weak disciple.

198
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,080
Complain about Chubby but don't get me involved.

199
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,400
Well, should we go back and unpack our luggage?

200
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,080
We have a mission later.

201
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,400
- Let's go, guys. 
 - Womanizer.

202
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,961
Right.

203
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:23,161
Come on. Let's go.

204
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,700
You kept talking about the split personality.

205
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,280
But when I saw her, I didn't think she was different.

206
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,786
I even think she's so cool.

207
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:38,487
Indeed.

208
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:40,860
She just sounds harsher.

209
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,800
She's just like before. The same old temper.

210
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,840
Hey. Am I the only one who thinks she's like a different person?

211
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,660
She was really nice to me.

212
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,040
Whether she praises or punishes you, she has been caring.

213
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,000
She used to be a loving mother.

214
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,860
Now, she's like a strict father.

215
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,720
But I can see.

216
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,300
She cares for you as much as before.

217
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,180
You just bear with it.

218
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,420
We're reunited, anyway.

219
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,520
We'll be happy.

220
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,820
Everybody is here.

221
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,660
Let's have a discussion.

222
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,860
Two witnesses, Ma Chao and Song Tie.

223
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,320
Thirteen-Thousand. Chubby.

224
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,200
You'll talk to Ma Chao and I'll talk to Song Tie.

225
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,880
Hong Sha, you take care of Mu Dai.

226
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,840
She's only nice to you now.

227
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,080
Of course.

228
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,840
You don't understand our friendship.

229
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,960
You guys just don't.

230
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,100
Mu Dai!

231
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,940
Are you boneless? Don't lean on somebody.

232
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,980
You're not just "somebody."

233
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,900
You're my bestie.

234
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,500
What do you think? Teamwork is cool, huh?

235
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,580
It's warm to have friends, isn't it?

236
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,180
I don't need friends.

237
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,660
Why hasn't Chubby come out yet?

238
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,000
What?

239
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,880
What's wrong?

240
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,820
It's my original look.

241
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,720
Does it scare you?

242
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,200
Oh, Brother Cao.

243
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,140
I didn't know you had tattoos.

244
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,340
I used to conceal them in case you were scared.

245
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,722
But Brother Cao, we're just going to see Ma Chao.

246
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:37,982
Do you have to look so cool?

247
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,960
You have no idea.

248
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,100
To deal with a wicked guy, we have to be more wicked.

249
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,960
We should be... Ruthless.

250
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,480
Cool.

251
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,240
Just do as I tell you.

252
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,033
Let's talk.

253
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,500
How dare you come out here without knowing the boss?

254
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,280
Why don't you tell me?

255
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,760
Who's the boss

256
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,720
in this region?

257
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,560
Sit down and eat.

258
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,340
Don't make trouble over a meal.

259
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,820
I...

260
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,940
Get lost.

261
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,200
Dude, you're interesting.

262
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,680
Let's be friends.

263
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,580
Thirteen, why is the bottle made of sugar?

264
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,130
I bought it in a magic shop next door.

265
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,020
It's fun.

266
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,980
That was really dangerous.

267
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,560
Why were there so many minions?

268
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,280
You're right.

269
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,660
Hey, Brother Cao... Still eating?

270
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,040
Look. Look at this.

271
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,240
What's this?

272
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,840
Were you really a great guy in Qianjinbei?

273
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,640
A horse that stumbles has four legs.

274
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,060
Besides, who would know that guy had noodles with his minions?

275
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,820
And they ate separately. Quite unexpected.

276
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,300
Anyway, how was your communication with him?

277
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,140
The communication went rather smoothly.

278
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,960
But the result was quite depressing.

279
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,440
Ma Chao said they had a meal and drank that night.

280
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,100
On the bridge, Zhang Tong wanted to pee.

281
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,640
He then urged him to climb over the railing and pee.

282
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,460
 Brother Chao, this is way too high. 

283
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,160
 How about we leave? 

284
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,000
 The higher you stand, the farther you'll pee. 

285
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,080
 Move. 

286
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,900
 He said he saw what happened. 

287
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,700
 His legs were so weak that he ran away. 

288
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,220
On his way, he was nearly hit by an electric bike.

289
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,320
There's another witness named Song Tie, huh?

290
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,980
Did he ride the bike?

291
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,020
No. I talked to Song Tie.

292
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,280
 Well, I didn't really see too much. 

293
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,240
 That day, my friend invited me to play mahjong. 

294
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,680
 On my way home, when I passed the east of the bridge, 

295
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,800
 I heard someone screaming. Then, I heard a "thump." 

296
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,680
 So, you didn't see the crime scene. 

297
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,640
 No. But I wanted to know what was happening. 

298
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,820
 Just then, a man ran over from the bridge as if he were crazy. 

299
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,360
 You know what? He looked as if he were haunted. 

300
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,640
 - Was someone else around? 
 - Yes. 

301
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,200
 Just after the man ran away, another guy appeared. 

302
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,020
 It was a girl. A very pretty girl. 

303
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,960
 Later, the police asked me to identify her. 

304
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,220
 It's her. 

305
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,680
How can he be so sure it's Mu Dai?

306
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,600
Song Tie said a pretty girl appearing there at midnight was conspicuous.

307
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,020
So, he took a few more glances.

308
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,580
So, I really went to the bridge.

309
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,880
Let's not jump there yet.

310
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,460
Don't forget. There's a third witness.

311
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,780
The bike rider?

312
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,920
I guess it's a woman who had a night shift.

313
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,000
After work, she rode from east to west.

314
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,140
She had to pass the bridge.

315
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,480
Song Tie didn't see her because this woman was in the middle

316
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,340
when he passed the east of the bridge.

317
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,060
When Ma Chao ran away, he nearly bumped into her.

318
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,760
So, she's the only one who rode across the entire bridge

319
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,120
and may have approached the murderer.

320
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,400
Maybe the police have interrogated her.

321
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,800
Let's talk to her tomorrow.

322
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,720
You promised me a ride.

323
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,920
But you're watching the stars here.

324
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,580
Gas is costly, after all.

325
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,200
And it's a nice day today.

326
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,760
Sadly, the stars here are worse than those in Xiaoshang River.

327
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,920
Are the stars worse, or are you in a worse mood?

328
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,180
Last time, it was her who watched the stars with you.

329
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,060
Mu Dai, everyone has two sides.

330
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,080
Why do you keep saying you're split?

331
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:17,058
I've been thinking about what you said in the psychological clinic.

332
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,200
I think you have a point.

333
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,220
A long time ago, I realized you behaved weirdly.

334
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,440
But I didn't ask or do anything.

335
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,340
When it came to it, I began to care for you.

336
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,440
Ridiculous, indeed.

337
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,420
I'm thinking...

338
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:43,305
Pocketty must also have wondered about it.

339
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:45,185
So?

340
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:49,362
So, I think

341
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,260
you differ in no essential respect.

342
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:01,360
And you said Mu Dai was so weak that she lived a messy life.

343
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,520
- I totally don't agree. 
 - Why?

344
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,510
Mu Dai has families, friends, and love.

345
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,351
She's brave and authentic.

346
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:12,051
I think...

347
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:17,600
you should set aside your prejudice and try melting into her.

348
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,440
Then, you'll know she's beyond your imagination.

349
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,775
She's more stupid than I imagined, indeed.

350
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:27,080
She tried really hard to overrule me.

351
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,269
She wouldn't do that.

352
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:30,390
Why?

353
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,511
Every reason you used to defend yourself also works for her.

354
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:37,418
Because you're the same person.

355
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:40,080
She thinks about you and protects you.

356
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,600
So do you, right?

357
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,040
You won't appear unless she's in the greatest danger

358
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,300
or she's being her weakest.

359
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,025
Right?

360
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:51,407
How much do you know about my past?

361
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:53,694
Don't talk as if you know me well.

362
00:27:53,694 --> 00:27:56,254
I don't know too much.

363
00:27:56,254 --> 00:27:58,662
But what you've done tells me something.

364
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,680
All these years, you've protected her from many terrible things.

365
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,992
Because you think

366
00:28:10,992 --> 00:28:15,463
you're more experienced in handling such things.

367
00:28:15,463 --> 00:28:18,683
People change under different circumstances.

368
00:28:19,622 --> 00:28:22,020
Mu Dai met Huo Zi Hong.

369
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,064
She met your master too.

370
00:28:24,064 --> 00:28:26,440
And she has many friends.

371
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,924
So, she softened and smiled a lot.

372
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,100
Don't be so harsh to yourself.

373
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,760
It's unfair to you. It's unfair to her, either.

374
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,740
People grow up.

375
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,000
They need tough experiences as well as sweet ones.

376
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,740
They need everything.

377
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,820
Walking with one leg will exhaust you.

378
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,700
Stop nagging.

379
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,480
Are you sure you'll see Wu Yu Ping?

380
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,740
I'm wearing a cap and a mask.

381
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,820
She won't recognize me, huh?

382
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,140
Hello. I'm Luo Ren.

383
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,080
- Hi. 
 - We're Zhang Tong's friends.

384
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,540
We really care about this case.

385
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,780
Please tell us what happened that night.

386
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,860
That night, I was passing the bridge on my way back home.

387
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,640
 From afar, I saw two men standing there. 

388
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,120
-  They seemed to be peeing. 
 - The farther you'll pee. 

389
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
 How ill-mannered. 

390
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,960
 I-I'm really scared. 

391
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,840
 I heard you fell after that. 

392
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,400
Because I was scared.

393
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,280
 I suddenly heard a scream. 

394
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,980
 Then, I looked back. 

395
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,560
 But as I turned around, I fell by accident. 

396
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,962
Then, did you see a girl?

397
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:00,120
Yes.

398
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,720
When I rose to pick up my bike,

399
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,320
 I saw a girl standing in the distance and staring at me. 

400
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,160
 Well, she was weird. 

401
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,105
 I fell so badly, but she didn't come to help me. 

402
00:30:11,105 --> 00:30:13,725
She didn't sympathize at all.

403
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,320
Could you take a look and pick out the girl?

404
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:23,608
It's her.

405
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,860
Are you sure?

406
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,600
Yes. It's her.

407
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,360
Okay. Thanks.

408
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,840
I still think something's pretty weird.

409
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,720
Mu Dai has a split personality.

410
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,600
But since she was born, she's never done anything evil or hurt anyone.

411
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,340
Why did she become a murderer in this place?

412
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,680
Don't you find it fishy?

413
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,600
And three guys testified against her.

414
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,400
It was so dark that night. Did they really see clearly?

415
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,000
How can they be so sure that they saw Mu Dai?

416
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,385
Hong Sha, what did you say?

417
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:15,286
It was so dark.

418
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:16,966
That's right.

419
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,493
There are no street lamps there.

420
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,240
Hey, Luo Ren. Where are we going?

421
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,434
To the bridge.

422
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:34,017
I went there. No street lamps on or around it.

423
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,460
Zhang Tong fell off the middle of the bridge.

424
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,720
Only Ma Chao met Mu Dai before.

425
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,820
Song Tie and Wu Yu Ping saw Mu Dai for the first time.

426
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,400
From a distance, actually.

427
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,520
It was a night with no light.

428
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,620
It must have been really dark.

429
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,760
Right.

430
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,400
With a mere glimpse,

431
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,200
they should have been unsure or hesitant when they testified.

432
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,200
But they identified Mu Dai straightaway. Isn't it weird?

433
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,800
You're right. There's always a reason.

434
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,020
Something must be wrong.

435
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,680
The three guys spoke as one on this.

436
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,840
It really scared us.

437
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,120
No wonder people say, "Three men make a rumor."

438
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,880
Who? Who makes a rumor?

439
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,080
Three men make a rumor.

440
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,400
It means three men will make people believe.

441
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Why don't we assume this?

442
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,540
What if the three of them are lying?

443
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,800
You mean...

444
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,680
They don't know each other.

445
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,640
How could they collude?

446
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,460
And think of Wu Yu Ping. She looks rather honest.

447
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,540
Are they mentally controlled?

448
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,960
The relic of ill omen.

449
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:49,237
Is it behind all this?

450
00:32:50,075 --> 00:32:52,000
How come we forgot that?

451
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,240
And the vision.

452
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,320
Brother Cao and I saw the vision on the relic of ill omen.

453
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,840
The wind out of nowhere.

454
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,120
Wind out of nowhere?

455
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,820
Have you heard of an urban legend in Nantian?

456
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,400
What's wrong? Didn't you feel some eerie wind?

457
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,000
Eerie wind? I feel something's blowing onto me.

458
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,500
Chubby, it's a windy night.

459
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,320
But you're wrapped up tightly.

460
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
What can actually blow into you?

461
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,360
Here we are. This is it.

462
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,480
These guys had too much free time.

463
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,920
They came for more courage.

464
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,320
What's the point of that?

465
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,400
- A lot of guys came. 
 - What kind of guy, actually?

466
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,720
Totally useless.

467
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,500
What is that?

468
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,720
What's this?

469
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,140
Joss paper?

470
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,580
Zhang Tong's name is on it.

471
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,660
Someone burned it here.

472
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,380
Ma Chao. Ma Chao.

473
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,760
What's wrong, Brother Chao? What's troubling you?

474
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,120
I don't want to talk about it. It's Zhang Tong's fault.

475
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,000
It's okay he died.

476
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,640
But he caused me trouble. I kept dreaming about him.

477
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,940
He said, "Brother Chao, I really left my name there."

478
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,700
"Check it if you don't believe me."

479
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,600
I was so scared.

480
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,660
Come on. Some advice for you.

481
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,320
Don't go out in the next few days.

482
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,260
- Why? 
 - Don't you know?

483
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,960
The woman you testified against... She ran away.

484
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,080
I know. I heard she could scale the walls.

485
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,860
Very swiftly, she escaped.

486
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,240
I also heard she had great martial arts skills.

487
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,440
Then, how dare you come out here?

488
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,680
You accused her of killing.

489
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,500
She has martial arts skills, and she's on the run.

490
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,980
It's so easy for her to kill you.

491
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,280
She won't.

492
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,000
I also heard through the grapevine

493
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,600
that she claimed she didn't kill Zhang Tong,

494
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,900
but you did.

495
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,220
That's impossible. I saw it with my eyes.

496
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,360
Calm down, Brother Chao. Come on.

497
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,680
You were really drunk that night.

498
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,700
Are you sure about that?

499
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,520
I also heard when the man died, you ran away.

500
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,640
The police came to you the next day.

501
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,900
Why didn't you call the police then?

502
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,880
 Nobody move! 

503
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,920
 We're the police. 

504
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,470
 - Who's Ma Chao? 
 - Who is Ma Chao? 

505
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,200
 I am. 

506
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,140
 Ma Chao, tell me. Where were you last night? 

507
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,760
 Last night? I was drinking with my friend. 

508
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,960
 Do you know your friend died? 

509
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,120
 Something happened. Someone killed my friend. 

510
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,100
 Why didn't you call the police last night? 

511
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,000
I was drunk.

512
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,700
I was frozen with fear, too.

513
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,920
Frozen with fear? Come on, Brother Chao.

514
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,300
Come on, Brother Chao. You have a lot of minions.

515
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,880
When one of them was pushed off the bridge and killed,

516
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,840
how could you forget to call the police?

517
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,760
 Brother Chao, I don't want to pee now. 

518
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,880
 Just do it. 

519
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
 I don't dare. 

520
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,400
 But you said you wanted to pee. 

521
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,320
 - Brother Chao. 
 - Why do you stop now? 

522
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,200
 - Brother Chao, I'm begging you. Stop it. 
 - Down you go! 

523
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,760
 Brother Chao. 

524
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,320
 Will I throw you down? 

525
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,660
 Will I really do that? 

526
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,340
 Ma Chao, how was your neck injured? 

527
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,760
 - I don't dare. 
 - Pee. Down you go! 

528
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,400
 Brother Chao! 

529
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,800
 Who's that? 

530
00:37:56,554 --> 00:37:58,560
 Sorry. 

531
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,340
 I... I can't remember. 

532
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,845
 Brother Chao, how did I die? 

533
00:38:10,845 --> 00:38:13,040
 I died a miserable death. 

534
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,670
 Why? 

535
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,460
 I really left my name there. 

536
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,120
Ma Chao!

537
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,720
It's you who killed him on the bridge, right?

538
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,500
It's not me! She killed him!

539
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,700
Oh... What's going on?

540
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,680
Why are they fighting?

541
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,720
He...

542
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,730
- Get out of my way! 
 - Don't you see?

543
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,540
Hey!

544
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,750
 What's he doing? 

545
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,740
Is it the thief thing?

546
00:38:51,990 --> 00:39:01,030



547
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,200
What's going on here?

548
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,800
Let's call the police.

549
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,780
Ma Chao, watch out!

550
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,920
A car accident. He was hit so hard.

551
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,100
- Call the ambulance. 
 - Hurry.

552
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,200
- Okay. Come on. 
 - What happened?

553
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,540
Did you film it?

554
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,180
No.

555
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,700
Let's call the ambulance.

556
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,520
- Call the ambulance. 
 - I'm calling it.

557
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,780
It freaked me out.

558
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,400
I called the police.

559
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,000
- Did anyone call the police? 
 - Hope he won't die.

560
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,240
The car overturned. See?

561
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,460
- He can't leave. 
 - That's right.

562
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,580
This guy may die.

563
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,300
- Ma Chao. 
 - What do we do?

564
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,300
- Ma... 
 - This man may die.

565
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,200
- It's a fight, huh? 
 - Is it him?

566
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,620
He hit this guy.

567
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,880
- Don't let him get away. 
 - He pushed this guy.

568
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,610
- I didn't. 
 - He did push this guy.

569
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,380
You did it!

570
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,680
I said, it's not me.

571
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,020
It's him. Don't let him get away.

572
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,500
He killed a man.

573
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,480
 - It's him. 
 - It's him. 

574
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,720
 - It's him. 
 - It's him. 

575
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,720
- It's not me. No. 
 - He hit that guy.

576
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,920
I said, it's not me.

577
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,780
- It's him. 
 - He did that.

578
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,220
- Don't let him get away. 
 - Don't let him get away.

579
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,380
- It's all your fault. 
 - It's all your fault.

580
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,600
- He killed him. 
 - He killed him.

581
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,240
- It's you. You can't get away. 
 - It's you. You can't get away.

582
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,360
- It's not me! 
 - You are the murderer.

583
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,160
I'm not!

584
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:26,110
