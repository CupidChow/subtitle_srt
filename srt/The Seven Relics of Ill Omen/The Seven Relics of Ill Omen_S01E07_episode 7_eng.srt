1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,960
   

2
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:24,130



3
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,360
   

4
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,000
   

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,080
   

6
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,040
That place is in Wuzhu Village, Hepu, in the Gui Region.

7
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,340
It's my hometown.

8
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,140
 For generations, villagers have fished for pearls. 

9
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,640
 They dive for clams and get pearls. 

10
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,700
 In our ancestral hall is the God of Water. 

11
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,420
 On its roof ridge, there are animals of Immortals Leading the Way. 

12
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,280
Actually, in Xiaoshang River, when I painted for the first time,

13
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,260
I saw the vision from the shadow of water.

14
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,420
But before I finished it, I didn't know what it was.

15
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,960
I was too shocked to tell anyone about it.

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,600
And I didn't know you guys would see the same vision one after another.

17
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,080
The shadow of water is one thing while the vision is another.

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,360
How can you be sure the exact thing in your village is what we are after?

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,560
Because I smashed the last animal.

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,060
It was my hands that took it away.

21
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,680
- Why didn't you tell us? 
 - Because I hate that place!

22
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,100
Wuzhu Village.

23
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,700
Glad we have an address now.

24
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,980
I'll check the map.

25
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,820
It's a small village.

26
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,840
You can't find it on the map.

27
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,260
I can take you there.

28
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,600
But there is a condition.

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,340
Tell me.

30
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,640
Keep me safe.

31
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,160
Deal.

32
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,532
   

33
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:24,760
   

34
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,540
The cool bartender isn't here.

35
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,940
He isn't here.

36
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,920
I'll serve you.

37
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,712
Sorry about that.

38
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:36,780
- Fine, then. 
 - Oh, poor me.

39
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,380
Xiao Luo took away Thirteen-Thousand.

40
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,120
The workload isn't a problem.

41
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,240
I just feel way too lonely.

42
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
I'm a party person, after all.

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,140
Luckily, Master is here with me.

44
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,860
Or how could I live?

45
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,720
I even feel life is meaningless.

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,200
Life is actually meaningless.

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,460
What would you like, Sir?

48
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,060
I've got this.

49
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,660
You can sit for a while.

50
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,880
But this is an area for paid food.

51
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,000
You can use this.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,360
Is Mu Dai here?

53
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,180
You know her?

54
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,960
Tell her her senior is here.

55
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,480
Who?

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,880
You... You... look fine.

57
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,020
My master punished him severely for that.

58
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,920
 He's still recovering. His arms and legs are broken. 

59
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,860
Your limbs have recovered?

60
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,200
You look intact.

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,580
What did she tell you?

62
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,860
No, no.

63
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,580
- Nothing. I just... 
 - Senior.

64
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,180
You've an able body.

65
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,760
Oh, gosh.

66
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,640
When did you come?

67
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,040
Get in there.

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,560
You have a new hairstyle.

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,040
I hate washing my hair.

70
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,920
Didn't you ask me to get you a job?

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,580
- You got one? 
 - Yes.

72
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,040
Go with me for an interview. Come on.

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,600
- Where are we going? 
 - Huacheng.

74
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,420
Huacheng? I need to get packed.

75
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,600
No need.

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,480
It's just 30 kilometers away. You'll be back soon.

77
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,460
- You're right. 
 - Let's go.

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,420
Tell Uncle Zhang I'm leaving with my senior.

79
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,280
- What's your name? 
 - Cao.

80
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,920
Xiao Cao.

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,740
Thanks for taking care of Mu Dai.

82
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,280
Life is meaningful in some ways.

83
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,640
Yes, whatever you say.

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,280
Go get my purse.

85
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,480
Hurry. The train is leaving.

86
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,360
Be right there. Hurry.

87
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,740
- Bye- bye. 
 - I want to talk to him.

88
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,820
Such a medical miracle!

89
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,420
   

90
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,640
Fancy house, indeed.

91
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,420
A fancy house doesn't mean anything.

92
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,840
All are made of clay bricks.

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,880
Senior.

94
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,300
Can I really be a bodyguard?

95
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,520
Of course. You're my junior. You can do anything.

96
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,320
Then... What should I do in the interview?

97
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,440
Nothing. Just be yourself.

98
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,560
Don't put on an act.

99
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,960
They'll test you. You'll test them, too.

100
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,760
If you feel upset, leave immediately.

101
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,320
Don't hesitate.

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,960
And remember. In your life, you must respect yourself.

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,200
It makes sense.

104
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,000
There you go.

105
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,160
Old Yan, we're here.

106
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,920
A minute, please.

107
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,500
Here, Junior.

108
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,980
Remember. Don't put on an act.

109
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,660
- Hello. 
  - Mu Dai, huh? 

110
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,880
 See the stone table in front of you? 

111
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,540
Yes.

112
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,160
 There are words on it. Read them out. 

113
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,080
"Gems bath in the moonlight."

114
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,280
"And soil can't obscure them."

115
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,420
Well done!

116
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,580
Junior, I've told you many times to be gentle.

117
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,800
What if you choke her?

118
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,540
Hello.

119
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,947
Nice to meet you.

120
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:36,760
Someone recommended your clan.

121
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,860
Hong Sha has never traveled alone.

122
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,640
I want a female bodyguard to travel with her.

123
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,760
Four or five days at most.

124
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,820
This trip is all-inclusive.

125
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,080
The pay is 20 thousand.

126
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,420
It's the deposit.

127
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,020
10 thousand.

128
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Senior.

129
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Quite a lot of money.

130
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,040
If necessary, I'll give you more.

131
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,280
Where are we going then?

132
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,780
What will we do?

133
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,560
Hong Sha.

134
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,200
Tell her about it.

135
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,100
We're treasure hunters.

136
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,920
Have you heard of it?

137
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,140
Treasures refer to gems.

138
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,160
They're priceless.

139
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,400
Can we get them, then?

140
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,680
Be patient, okay?

141
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,200
Equipment is needed for the gems in the mine.

142
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,320
We don't do such hard jobs.

143
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,486
Do you remember the remark on the table? What is it?

144
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:51,931
"Soil can't obscure them."

145
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,960
"Gems bath in the moonlight."

146
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,120
"And soil can't obscure them."

147
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,520
We only hunt this kind of gem.

148
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,920
Why do you think you can get this kind of gem?

149
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,360
People would get them first.

150
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,860
Such an ignorant amateur.

151
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,020
Do you think gems will shine where they are?

152
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,920
They're either encased in stone or wrapped in earth.

153
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,760
They're invisible to ordinary guys.

154
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,620
Special eyes are needed to detect their spreading light.

155
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,420
Got it?

156
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,840
We don't dig from the earth.

157
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,760
We only dive in water or wells.

158
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,520
In water, we get pears and jade.

159
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,840
In wells, we get gems.

160
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,760
According to ancient books,

161
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:43,540
"If there are gems in a well, the air will look crystal."

162
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,080
- "Pearls are in the deep..." 
 - Hong Sha.

163
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,720
This is too elusive to be understood.

164
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,700
Let me tell you.

165
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,080
Treasure hunters like us

166
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,720
need the eye training.

167
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,920
We locate the treasures with our eyes.

168
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,680
But it exhausts our eyes terribly.

169
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,260
So, we end up half-blind for the rest of our lives.

170
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,440
I have a son.

171
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,620
He's Hong Sha's uncle.

172
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,080
Instead of using this skill, he uses his own way.

173
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,960
Some days ago, he went to the Gui Region.

174
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,200
For some treasures.

175
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,120
The other day, when I called him, I couldn't get through.

176
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,040
When I could get through, he didn't answer.

177
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,680
I located him.

178
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,400
He was in that region.

179
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,560
I'm really worried.

180
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,780
But I have trouble moving around.

181
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,920
So, I want you to take Hong Sha there.

182
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,600
Gui Region?

183
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,440
Around the Plateau Lake?

184
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,680
Can you tell me the exact location?

185
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,580
Wuzhu Village, Hepu.

186
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,740
 What a coincidence. 

187
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,480
The tunnel is closed. Go another way.

188
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,300
   

189
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,500
 The tunnel is closed. Go another way. 

190
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,980
Thirteen-Thousand, the tunnel isn't available.

191
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,180
In such remote areas, the navigation often goes wrong.

192
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,440
Trust me.

193
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,080
Go through the tunnel, and Wuzhu Village is just a few miles away.

194
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,120
I remember the route clearly.

195
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,900
The navigation is accurate.

196
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,720
That's impossible.

197
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,280
Drive through the tunnel and we'll arrive.

198
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,200
It'll take a whole day if we go another way.

199
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,460
I don't know why the tunnel is closed.

200
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,200
My luggage.

201
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,360
I'm your bodyguard, not your personal assistant.

202
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,040
Oh, right.

203
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,800
When we're in Hepu, what vehicle will we take?

204
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,360
Where will we live after our mission?

205
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,105
Have you arranged it? Have you got a plan?

206
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,825
Your grandpa said this trip would be all-inclusive.

207
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,645
So, arrange everything.

208
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,200
I invited you over for a dance. It was lively, indeed.

209
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,817
- It tastes great. 
 - Look at this.

210
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:12,195
Madam. Have you heard of a Wuzhu Village nearby?

211
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:15,240
Yes. You're going there?

212
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,360
Before, you could go through the old tunnel.

213
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
But it's closed now.

214
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,740
You'll have to take a detour.

215
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,040
You can go by train. It's available there.

216
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,200
Do you know why the tunnel is closed?

217
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,600
Because no one is there. The village is empty.

218
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,540
Empty?

219
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,080
I've heard people in this village do pearl hunting.

220
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,560
For generations.

221
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,800
How come it is empty?

222
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,400
It's true.

223
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,920
No pearls are available.

224
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,260
So, people moved away.

225
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,920
No pearls?

226
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,920
But I heard there were many clams in the lake.

227
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,680
There should have been pearls.

228
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,200
Dude, you have no idea.

229
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,480
On one Mid-Autumn night,

230
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,340
Clams Basking in the Moon actually happened.

231
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,300
Clams were everywhere on the shore.

232
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,720
But a naughty boy burned them with gasoline.

233
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,240
What a terrible kid. So wicked.

234
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,440
That's right.

235
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,780
I've heard, since then, no pearls have been found here.

236
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,180
According to the locals, they offended the God of Water and had their comeuppance.

237
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,140
Well, I think everything has a soul.

238
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,380
When the clams were burned, they would hate this place.

239
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,734
So, they'd never come again.

240
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:27,820
- Right? 
 - Maybe.

241
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,160
Why are you going there? Nothing's left there.

242
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,880
I've also heard that the village is haunted now.

243
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,460
Really?

244
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,540
You don't know?

245
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,699
Hey, stop. Sounds creepy.

246
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:39,980
- Let's drink. 
 - Okay.

247
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,120
- Come on. 
 - Here.

248
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,160
- No. 
 - Join us.

249
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,900
I have allergies.

250
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,620
Second Uncle.

251
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,050
   

252
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,600
Hey, Second Uncle.

253
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,574
Hello?

254
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:29,864
Hey, Second Uncle. Can you hear me?

255
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:31,364
Hello?

256
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,600
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed cannot be connected. 

257
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,880
 Please redial later. 

258
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,140
 Sorry... 

259
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,620
Mu Dai.

260
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,600
Wake up.

261
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,440
Wake up now.

262
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,560
Wake up.

263
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
What's wrong?

264
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,300
Get up now.

265
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,560
What happened?

266
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,420
Something's wrong.

267
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,932
 Sorry... 

268
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:22,160
Why can't I get through to him?

269
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,540
Your uncle was missing.

270
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,980
But he called you just now. Isn't it great?

271
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,320
Maybe his phone is dead.

272
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,820
He'll call you after charging it.

273
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,440
Come on, he answered.

274
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,560
He just didn't say anything.

275
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,860
Is he in trouble?

276
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,280
Maybe he couldn't say anything because of the low battery.

277
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,220
My dream was horrible.

278
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,680
It felt so real.

279
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,040
People say dreams aren't real.

280
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,280
Stop worrying.

281
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,680
Go back to sleep.

282
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,560
I'm so tired.

283
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,160
It's not easy to be a bodyguard.

284
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,920
I'm tired too.

285
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,380
   

286
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,320
How did this happen?

287
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,300
Where's everyone?

288
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,380
Are you sure we'll get a ride here?

289
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,700
Don't worry. I've arranged everything.

290
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,680
This is a professional driver.

291
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,160
Poor bodyguard.

292
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,680
You aren't observant at all.

293
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,520
Here.

294
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,460
Not this one?

295
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,581
Hello, ladies.

296
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:06,861
Which one of you is Miss Yan?

297
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,620
So, this is your fancy cart?

298
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,140
That's right. Fancy cart.

299
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,280
Yeah. Let's get in.

300
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,440
Come on. Hold on tight.

301
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,560
We're about to go.

302
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,760
I've got this too.

303
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:50,760
   

304
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,860
How did this happen?

305
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,020
My home is still here.

306
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:13,341
This is...

307
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,760
your home?

308
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,960
 Aren't we supposed to have a final division? 

309
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,520
 Why do you have to guard the lake? 

310
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,124
 Our village head is foresighted. 

311
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:54,220
 He fears neighboring thieves. 

312
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,880
 If they steal, we'll get fewer pearls. 

313
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,360
 Each family will get a smaller share. 

314
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,640
 For Jiang Zhao's school life, we'll afford fewer erasers or pencils. 

315
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,420
 Am I right? 

316
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,300
 I should go. 

317
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,480
 Be very careful. 

318
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,600
 I'm wearing my talisman. 

319
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,220
 Don't worry. 

320
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,360
We're here alone.

321
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,800
If something is on your mind and bothers you, you can talk to me.

322
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,046
You know.

323
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:04,847
Villagers here live off pearls.

324
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:07,172
Waters with clams are just like farmlands.

325
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:09,200
They aren't all fertile.

326
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,049
Some have more clams while some have fewer.

327
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,518
Everybody wants the best part.

328
00:22:14,518 --> 00:22:16,698
 Stop fighting. 

329
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,440
 In the division of water, we fought with the neighboring village. 

330
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,387
 - At first, they agreed to wait for the authorities' solution. 
 - Stop it! 

331
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,760
 But guys from the neighboring village 

332
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,161
sneaked in to steal clams.

333
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:33,241
Things were out of control.

334
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,780
 This is our territory! Go back to your own village. 

335
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,840
 Go away. Get out of here. 

336
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,400
 Get away! Leave. 

337
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,260
 Send them away. 

338
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,960
 Throw them off. 

339
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:48,484
My father...

340
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:52,004
fell into the water

341
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:55,481
and died during this fight.

342
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,620
But a pearl fisher should be a good swimmer.

343
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,840
That's right.

344
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,740
Who knows?

345
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,240
Maybe he fell and cramped up.

346
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,780
Accidents happen.

347
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,220
Right?

348
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:21,912
We didn't even find his body.

349
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:31,040
After he died, my mother became delirious.

350
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,900
She couldn't distinguish between illusion and reality.

351
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,680
 Mom, where are you going? 

352
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,960
 To see your father. 

353
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,920
 Mom, the wind's blowing really hard. Don't go. 

354
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,480
 Mom! 

355
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,460
 Did you hear? 

356
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,200
 He's yelling for help. 

357
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,640
 He's hunting pearls. 

358
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,440
 He can't pull so many pearls. 

359
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,840
 - I need to go now. 
 - Mom, you can't go. 

360
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,040
 The wind's blowing hard. Mom! Mom! 

361
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,920
 Get out of my way! 

362
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,720
 Mom! 

363
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,580
 Mom! Mom! 

364
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,220
 Mom! Don't go! 

365
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,320
 Come back! 

366
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,040
 - You can't go! 
 - Let me go! 

367
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,360
 - You can't go. 
 - You can't go. 

368
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,120
 Don't be silly. You'll get killed. 

369
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,920
 You can't go. 

370
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,200
 Chief, please save my mother. 

371
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,640
 Such strong waves. How can I save her? 

372
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,400
 Nobody can get down to save her! 

373
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,780
 Or they will just die! 

374
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,580
 You're a madwoman. 

375
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,740
 - Mom! 
 - She's insane! 

376
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,580
 Let me go! 

377
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,920
 Let me go! 

378
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,980
 Mom! 

379
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,092
 That night, the wind blew strongly on the water. 

380
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:18,952
 Nobody saved her. 

381
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,620
The next morning,

382
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:27,705
she couldn't be found.

383
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,740
Do you think I was really unlucky?

384
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,080
I thought so, anyway.

385
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,040
During that time, I often sneaked into the ancestral hall.

386
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,816
I asked the God of Water what I had done wrong

387
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:50,180
or what my family had done wrong.

388
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,040
 I asked how we offended him. 

389
00:25:54,073 --> 00:25:56,433
 But he didn't reply. 

390
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,308
 Close the door. 

391
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:21,040
 I got you guys here to talk about Jiang Zhao. 

392
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,120
 He's a poor kid. 

393
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,240
 He needs a lot of money for his school and marriage. 

394
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,260
 Why don't we split the cost evenly? 

395
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,060
 Okay. Whatever you say. 

396
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,360
 That's fine with me. 

397
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,040
 Jiang Liu, say something. 

398
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,040
 Chief, this is unfair. 

399
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,155
 You didn't save his father. Why do I have to pay? 

400
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:54,040
 Nonsense. I didn't kill him. 

401
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,160
 I didn't push him into the water. 

402
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,820
 You were just beside him. Why didn't you save him? 

403
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,160
 It was too chaotic. 

404
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,800
 We might not manage to save him. 

405
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,600
 Anyway, his death isn't in vain. 

406
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,680
 At least, we own the lake now. 

407
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,040
 Yeah. 

408
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,640
 We lost a man and they were guilty. 

409
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,660
 They were too ashamed to come. 

410
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,280
 The authorities pitied us too. 

411
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,907
 Then, this lake was given to us. 

412
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:26,706
 So, Jiang Zhao's father is our hero. 

413
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:31,127
 We should take care of Jiang Zhao and raise him. 

414
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:35,281
 - Don't be stingy on such small expenses. 
 - Fine, then. 

415
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:38,800
 - Clams are basking in the moon. 
 - Clams are basking in the moon. 

416
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,040
 - Clams. 
 - In the moon. 

417
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,220
 It's really happening. 

418
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,910
 Let's take a look. 

419
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,052
 - Let's go. 
 - Clams. 

420
00:27:44,052 --> 00:27:46,260
 - Move. 
 - Be quick, Chief. 

421
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,800
 I'll screw this. 

422
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,006
 Then, what is Clams Basking in the Moon? 

423
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,845
Clams Basking in the Moon?

424
00:28:29,553 --> 00:28:32,634
That's just a ridiculous legend here.

425
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:37,015
During the Mid-Autumn Festival, if the clams come onto the shore,

426
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,757
open their shells and bask in the moon,

427
00:28:40,757 --> 00:28:45,119
there will be a great harvest of pearls for the next year.

428
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,600
Enough moonshine can make the pearls bigger and rounder.

429
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,060
But did they deserve the pearls?

430
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,120
They watched my father die heartlessly.

431
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,960
Do you think they deserved that?

432
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,400
A great harvest?

433
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,320
Then what happened?

434
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,940
What happened?

435
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,161
I took some diesel there and burned the clams.

436
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:16,420
 I climbed onto the roof and smashed Hangshi. 

437
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,822
 Then, I ran away. 

438
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:22,102
After that, I never told anyone about this.

439
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,860
Am I to blame?

440
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:38,885
Thirteen-Thousand...

441
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:44,540
what's gone is gone.

442
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,170
What matters

443
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,700
is to live a good life now.

444
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:55,411
Yes.

445
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:57,211
You're right.

446
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:01,035
We're here to save Ping Ting.

447
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,377
Tell me. Where are we going now?

448
00:30:06,377 --> 00:30:07,958
The ancestral hall.

449
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:11,140
The corner of its roof appeared in the vision.

450
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,400
We'll find a clue there.

451
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,120
Here we are.

452
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,660
Someone cleans this hall regularly, or it wouldn't be so clean.

453
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,960
Yeah. I noticed that, too. 
    

454
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,920
Does someone come back to clean this hall?

455
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,520
Hey.

456
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,000
Do you guys here believe in this?

457
00:30:54,177 --> 00:30:55,837
No.

458
00:30:56,462 --> 00:30:59,027
People here honor the God of Water.

459
00:30:59,027 --> 00:31:02,387
But we don't believe in retribution.

460
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,780
Here we are.

461
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,720
This is it?

462
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,120
My cart can't get through that path.

463
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,520
Ladies, you'll have to walk from here.

464
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,760
Keep walking in this direction.

465
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,560
Wuzhu Village is on the opposite hill.

466
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,640
Climb up and you'll see an old ancestral hall. That's it.

467
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,840
Will we go along the way?

468
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,925
You can't go straight there.

469
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:06,800
See? You must take the outer path.

470
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,360
In the middle is a swamp.

471
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,941
You'll get stuck.

472
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:12,641
Call me if you need a ride when you're back.

473
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:28,518
Why are you going that way?

474
00:32:28,518 --> 00:32:30,479
Isn't that the center of the lake?

475
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:33,560
There's a swamp. We'll get stuck.

476
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,700
Where are you going?

477
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,120
Let's just go straight.

478
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,980
Don't take a detour. Isn't it exhausting?

479
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,020
According to my analysis, this terrain is like a divided soft-boiled egg.

480
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:54,854
In the middle is the lake. Around the lake is the inaccessible swamp.

481
00:32:54,854 --> 00:32:57,020
But as it goes out, it gets more solid.

482
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,500
Horses and cars can ride on it.

483
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,360
Between two points, the straight line is the shortest.

484
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,600
We should walk near the center as far as we can.

485
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,040
It saves time and energy.

486
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,230
The lake bottom.

487
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,060
Thirteen-Thousand.

488
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,460
What's that noise?

489
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,374
Don't need to see it.

490
00:34:57,374 --> 00:34:59,159
It's the pearl lugger.

491
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,224
According to our custom,

492
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,960
a shell wind bell is tied to the pole

493
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,280
to get good luck for clams and pearls.

494
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,140
Let's take a look.

495
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:17,137
Are you sure we'll walk there?

496
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,907
What a terrible route you've chosen.

497
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:39,288
Look.

498
00:35:39,288 --> 00:35:40,830
So what?

499
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,820
A bodyguard can't even endure this?

500
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,184
See for yourself. Aren't we getting closer?

501
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,784
Look.

502
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:52,630
Come on.

503
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,220
I'm talking to you. Be polite, okay?

504
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,400
Do you feel there's something underground?

505
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:01,209
No.

506
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,100
Don't be so suspicious.

507
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,750
Thirteen-Thousand.

508
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,620
The food was freshly made.

509
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,480
Is it the guy we saw just now?

510
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,320
This is where he lives for now.

511
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:37,540
But why does he live on a boat instead of living in the village?

512
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,680
Hey, Mu Dai. What's up?

513
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,920
Hey, Luo Ren. Are you in Wuzhu Village?

514
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,980
 Yes. What's wrong? 

515
00:37:55,638 --> 00:37:57,319
Luo Ren, I'm also here.

516
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:59,639
 You're also here? 

517
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:02,723
Mu Dai. I'm sinking.

518
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:07,357
Mu Dai. Mu Dai!

519
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:12,820
Mu Dai.

520
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,900
- What's wrong? 
 - Hello?

521
00:38:15,757 --> 00:38:19,337
Mu Dai, I'm stuck.

522
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:22,534
Mu Dai, I'm stuck!

523
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:23,855
Mu Dai, help me!

524
00:38:23,855 --> 00:38:25,133
Help me!

525
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:26,920
- Hello? 
 - Something's in the lake bottom. 

526
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,425
 Come and help us. 

527
00:38:28,425 --> 00:38:30,920
- Hello? 
 - What's wrong?

528
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,940
Lake bottom.

529
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,000
Mu Dai, help me!

530
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,740
Mu Dai!

531
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,360
Mu Dai! Mu Dai, help me!

532
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:44,246
Mu Dai! Mu Dai.

533
00:38:52,687 --> 00:38:56,594
♫  The sky splits the dawn's horizon  ♫

534
00:38:56,594 --> 00:38:58,960
Are you okay?

Come on.

♫  (The end) Is about to gently appear  ♫

537
