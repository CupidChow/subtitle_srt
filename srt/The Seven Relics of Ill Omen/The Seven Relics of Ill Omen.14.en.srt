[Episode 14]

5
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,820
All rubbernecks!

6
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,140
They just love it, huh.

7
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,500
Some even came
from out of town just for this.

8
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,420
Heartless.

9
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,860
Chubby,

10
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,700
it's natural for villagers

11
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,260
to be afraid when a savage
enters their village.

12
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,500
Were they supposed to invite her in?

13
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,900
And it's natural for them to rubberneck.

14
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,420
When you first arrived

15
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,020
and heard a savage had been killed,

16
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,620
you might've done that too.

17
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,420
They're not heartless.

18
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,780
They...

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,580
They just don't understand savages.

20
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,100
To them,

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,100
she was just a terrifying beast.

22
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,340
She wasn't a beast.

23
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,380
Master, you're right.

24
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,460
I have no right
to judge those villagers.

25
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,540
When we first encountered her,

26
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,740
we thought she was a monster too.

27
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,180
Well?

28
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,340
I spoke to the village head.

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,180
Hongsha has to stay for a few days.

30
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,140
Her grandpa's situation is complicated.

31
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,620
She may need to assist
with the investigation.

32
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,260
But we have to get the relic of ill omen

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,100
back to Lixi now. No more delays.

34
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,500
We'll split up.

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,660
One group takes
the relic of ill omen to Lixi.

36
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:12,980
The other...

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,700
- Then I'll stay.
- I'll stay.

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,700
She saved my life.

39
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,660
Walking away now would make me

40
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,580
no better than a beast.

41
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,540
Besides,

42
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,300
Hongsha has to stay here.

43
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,780
I might as well

44
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,500
keep her company.

45
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,260
I...

46
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,100
Zhama,

47
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,260
if there's any news about savages,

48
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
contact me anytime.

49
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,700
Oh,

50
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,580
this is from my mom.

51
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,700
She

52
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,980
asked me to tell you something.

53
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,660
She noticed you the moment
you entered the village.

54
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,060
She could see

55
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,700
you carry deep sorrow and burdens.

56
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,980
But she hopes you won't
let them crush you.

57
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,500
Just keep moving forward.

58
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,780
The road ahead will get brighter.

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,540
She also said

60
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,660
if you ever meet someone you like,

61
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,220
never let her go.

62
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,540
People drift apart too easily.

63
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
Once they're gone,

64
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,500
you might never find them again.

65
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,420
Give it to me.

66
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:32,980
Help me out.

67
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,580
Hand me that.

68
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,540
Let's go.

69
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,140
Don't pick unripe fruit anymore.

72

We'll talk later, Mr. Kun.

105
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,260
What did Mighty Kun say?

106
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,300
He was worried

107
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,620
when he couldn't reach us
these past few days.

108
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,380
And he made a major breakthrough
on his trip.

109
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,820
He'll share it in the group later

110
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,980
for us to look into and discuss.

111
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,940
He also wants to review
what we told him.

112
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,700
Oh,

113
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,140
and he brought us gifts.

114
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,020
Gifts?

115
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,620
What kind of gifts?

116
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,580
He didn't say.

117
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,980
But

118
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,540
coming from him,
it's bound to be extraordinary.

119
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,460
Extraordinary.

120
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,220
Let's hope so.

121
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,500
By the way,

122
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,460
both Thirteen-Thousand and I

123
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,860
wanted to stay with Hongsha.

124
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,420
Why did you give me that look?

125
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,860
He's better suited to stay.

126
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,260
Why?

127
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,980
Hongsha and I are like sisters.

128
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,540
Wouldn't it be better if I stayed?

129
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,820
The broken understand the broken.

130
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,700
They'll have more

131
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,500
to talk about.

132
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,580
And that might help them heal.

133
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,140
Fine.

134
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:40,780
Hit.

135
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
Hit... Hit him.

136
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,820
What are you mumbling about?

137
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,820
Is this yours?

138
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,020
Can I open it?

139
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,820
I have one just like it.

140
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,260
It's from Zhama's mom, right?

141
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,220
Do you know

142
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,740
what it's for?

143
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,340
For enhancing romantic luck.
Very effective.

144
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,100
If you ever meet someone you like,

145
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,260
wear it on your wrist.

146
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,500
Let's take a break up ahead.

147
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,940
Mu Dai.

148
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,100
Remember that question you asked me

149
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,020
in Wuzhu Village?

150
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,020
I've asked you a lot of questions.

151
00:08:59,460 --> 00:08:59,980
I...

152
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,180
Alright.

153
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,380
Ask me now.

154
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,660
Do you like me?

155
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,580
I haven't

156
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,900
answered you.

157
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,260
Is it too late...

158
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,860
to answer now?

159
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,540
You once said

160
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,620
the best time for two people
to be together

161
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,180
is when they

162
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,060
like each other.

163
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,940
Mu Dai,

164
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,620
I like you.

165
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,620
But I don't know

166
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,060
how you feel now.

167
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,980
What if

168
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,980
I've already moved on?

169
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,060
What would you do?

170
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,700
Then I'll pursue you.

171
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,980
With everything I've got.

172
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,180
Is it too late?

173
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,820
Zhama's mom is never wrong, is she?

174
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,660
I don't want us to go our separate ways.

175
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,300
I don't want to see you
holding someone else's hand.

176
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,260
She said my future would be brighter.

177
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,300
But

178
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,620
without you in it,

179
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,620
nothing could ever be bright enough.

180
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,380

Who are you trying to scare?

214
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,540
Got a problem with that?

215
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,780
Chubby, you...

216
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,780
Move aside. I can't see clear now.

217
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,580
I almost forgot about you.

218
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,460
Here.

219
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,580
Have a proper look.

220
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,500
This relic of ill omen is unusual.

221
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,780
Could it be because...?

222
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,740
Our theory might be correct.

223
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,580
There's another savage.

224
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,300
And another amber.

225
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,220
This relic of ill omen isn't complete.

226
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,060
You're right.

227
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,940
Its reactions are so abnormal.

228
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,020
It hasn't shown us the shadow of water.

229
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,400
So there is remaining part
of the relic of ill omen

230
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,600
hidden in Yueliang Mountain?

231
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,060
But it's fine.

232
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,260
We have most of it here.

233
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,580
The remaining traces

234
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,460
probably can't cause much harm.

235
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,020
I've told Zhama

236
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,740
to contact me immediately

237
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,620
if anything happens.

238
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,260
We can't let the remnants
hurt anyone else.

239
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,100
What do you all think about my trip

240
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,100
to Lengquan?

241
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,780
It was really valuable.

242
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,860
Bo Yangzi, the bamboo slips,

243
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,740
Feng, Huang, and Luan.

244
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,820
They all share striking parallels

245
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,100
with our experiences.

246
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,300
Let me be blunt.

247
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,780
Whether it's water or blood,

248
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,420
they can only temporarily

249
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,260
restrain the relics of ill omen.

250
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,420
Only by finding those legendary items

251
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,460
can we

252
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,180
seal them away forever.

253
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,860
But

254
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,060
where are we supposed to find them?

255
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,100
And

256
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,700
how many relics of ill omen
are there in total?

257
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,460
If there are only three,

258
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,980
then we're pretty much done.

259
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,100
What's his problem?

260
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,220
He must be stumped.

261
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,420
Ren!

262
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:33,980
In a minute.

263
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,780
Chubby,

264
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,020
I'm paying you to work.

265
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,500
But look at you.

266
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,820
Ren!

267
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,060
You worked for a few days

268
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,540
and then vanished for over a week.

269
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,900
- What were you thinking?
- Renting the space, renovations.

270
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,260
They all fell on me.

271
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,020
Got it.

272
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,140
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,060
Oh, just shut up.

274
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,180
I'll be more responsible, alright?

275
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:51,700
Look at you.

276
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,340
Look at that attitude.

277
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,220
He... He said he still has
important matters to handle.

278
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,020
Nonsense.

279
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,260
I've been so busy
these past few days.

280
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,180
I haven't even had time
to take care of Pingting.

281
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,780
Thanks to Miss Lian.

282
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,420
Otherwise this whole thing would've...

283
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,820
Miss Lian?

284
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,620
The owner of Lianyan Boutique

285
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,260
right across from Phoenix Pavilion.

286
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,900
When she heard we were renovating,

287
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,860
she was really enthusiastic.

288
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,340
She gave a lot of great suggestions.

289
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,020
Wait, how do you know her?

290
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,140
I just told you.

291
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,220
We're neighbors.

292
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,060
A neighbor cares more than you.

293
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,220
Stop contacting her

294
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
from now on.

295
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,700
Why?

296
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,420
Well, Hongsha,

297
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,180
I need to head back.

298
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,340
Now that I've gotten you here,

299
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,700
my job's done.

300
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,660
Chubby just told me

301
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,540
Mr. Zhang is waiting

302
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,980
to skin me alive when I return.

303
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,940
I really have to go.

304
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,180
You can handle

305
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,740
the rest on your own, right?

306
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,900
Do...

307
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,580
Do you actually know
what needs to be done?

308
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,580
What else is there?

309
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,940
First,

310
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,260
you'll need a proper portrait

311
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,020
of your grandpa, right?

312
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,700
And,

313
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,500
for the funeral arrangements,

314
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,660
you'll need to prepare everything.

315
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,260
Elegiac couplets, wreaths,

316
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,420
mourning dress, crapes.

317
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,820
And the burial plot.

318
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,220
And the cemetery.

319
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,980
You'll have to make calls

320
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,900
to find a geomantically...

321
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,020
Wait, hold on.

322
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,340
Start from the beginning.

323
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,420
First, the portrait,

324
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,140
- then...
- I'll handle it.

325
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,980
Let me.

326
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,020
Good thing I'm here.

327
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,100
Lady Dai tried to fight me over staying.

328
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,660
What use would she have been?

329
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,740
Thirteen-Thousand,

330
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,260
how do you know

331
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,860
all this so well?

332
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,300
Me?

333
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,020
Of course I know.

334
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,860
I've been on my own
since I was a teenager.

335
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,700
Back then, to scrape by,

336
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,100
I did everything,

337
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,700
like, playing the filial mourner,
professional wailing.

338
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,660
Yan!

339
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,420
Yan!

340
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,820
Yan!

341
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,820
Who are you people?

342
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,140
You guys...

343
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,060
Finally, someone's here.

344
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,180
Where's your grandfather?

345
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,460
Inside.

346
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,100
Yan!

347
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,540
Wait.

348
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,980
Yan!

349
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,100
Yan, come out!

350
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,260
You can talk to me instead.

351
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,300
Where's your grandfather?

352
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,500
Dead?

353
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,780
Are you all messing with me?

354
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,860
I kept extending the deadline,

355
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,380
and now you pull
this "playing dead" stunt on me?

356
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,620
Pretending to be dead, huh?

357
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,380
Think that gets you out of paying?

358
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,500
Get your grandfather out here!

359
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,940
What do you mean "pretending"?

360
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,180
I have his death certificate.

361
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,500
Want to see it?

362
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,420
I'll show you.

363
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,460
Still acting?

364
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,060
I'll break your arm right now.

365
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,140
Not bad moves, eh? She taught me.

366
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,620
You know how the Yan family fights.

367
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,580
You guys don't stand a chance.

368
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,100
You won't even afford the medical bills.

369
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,540
Debts should be repaid.

370
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540
That's only fair.

371
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,020
But claims need proof.

372
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,180
Where's the IOU?

373
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,660
The IOU? Give it to me.

374
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,900
Man,

375
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,580
is this IOU even legit?

376
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,500
Even debt collection
has to follow basic rules.

377
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,780
Deadbeats lecturing me about rules?

378
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,300
Read it clearly!

379
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,460
How much

380
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,980
did my uncle owe you?

381
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,780
Missy, listen up.

382
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,180
Even with this house as collateral,

383
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,740
you still owe me 1.2 million!

384
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,020
I've got not just this IOU,

385
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,860
but recordings from every visit.

386
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,860
Your grandfather promised me

387
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,700
he'd repay this!

388
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,660
What now?

389
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,460
The Yan family's word means nothing?

390
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,700
Hey,

391
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,740
no need for insults. Calm down.

392
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,620
- I'll pay it.
- Calm...

393
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,700
I'll repay you.

394
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,860
But listen.

395
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,420
The Yan family

396
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,460
always keeps its word!

397
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,140
If I say I'll repay, I will.

398
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,940
But I don't have the money right now.

399
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,780
What I do have
are two working hands to earn it.

400
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,100
It might take time,

401
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,540
but you'll get every last cent.

402
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
Understood?

403
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,860
No money now? Then how do you
plan to repay?

404
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,980
And "take time"?

405
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,220
What trick are you pulling on me?

406
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,300
If you don't accept this...

407
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,180
Then just kill me.

408
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,140
You heard her, man.

409
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,820
She's not afraid to die.

410
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,140
Let me suggest something.

411
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,580
Call the police.

412
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,500
Let the judge decide

413
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,300
whether a niece
should pay her uncle's debts.

414
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,980
What do you think?

415
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,940
A young girl

416
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,700
willing to repay

417
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,900
millions in debt.

418
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,300
That's more than fair.

419
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,820
Fine.

420
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,220
But every last cent better be paid!

421
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,420
Let's go.

422
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,500
Well, Hongsha,

423
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,180
are you sure

424
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,180
you'll be alright?

425
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,660
I'll manage.

426
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,860
Really sure?

427
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,860
It's just...

428
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,380
You wrote me that checklist.

429
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,620
I'll follow it

430
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,180
step by step.

431
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,100
I know

432
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,180
I'm the last of the Yan family now.

433
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,020
That's exactly why I have to live well.

434
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,780
Having nothing left doesn't matter.

435
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,180
I can start from scratch.

436
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,700
Begin anew.

437
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,660
I'll work hard

438
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,020
and earn my way back

439
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,060
to being rich again.

440
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,140
Okay, since you've said that,

441
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,100
I can

442
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,420
leave reassured.

443
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,060
But let me correct one thing.

444
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,820
Well,

445
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,980
It's not like that you have nothing.

446
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,260
Head south

447
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,460
from here.

448
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,740
There's a place called Destiny Bar.

449
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,020
Your friends are there.

450
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,740
As long as they've got something,

451
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,780
you'll get your share.

452
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,460
I'm leaving now.

453
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,220
Here.

454
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,700
Hey,

455
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,860
make way.

456
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,900
Alright, put it here.

457
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,540
I told you
to take Pingting out for a walk.

458
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,460
Why are you here?

459
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,020
Today's the plumbing
and electrical work.

460
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,380
I don't trust it without supervision.

461
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,700
Look, we're short on pipes.

462
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,420
Don't worry,

463
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,020
Miss Lian is taking care of Pingting.

464
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,980
Why her again?

465
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,260
And who's this?

466
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,180
Oh, Miss Lian.

467
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,300
Nothing. We were just
discussing the plumbing.

468
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,540
Miss Lian, you know him.

469
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,660
Mr. Zheng mentioned

470
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,540
you've been a great help
with the renovations lately.

471
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,500
Thank you.

472
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,580
We're neighbors.

473
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,700
No need for formalities.

474
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,380
By the way, Mr. Zheng,

475
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,980
my friend just got

476
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,500
new wallpaper stock
for the private rooms.

477
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,740
We can go check samples tomorrow.

478
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,780
Good, good.

479
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,220
Miss Lian, could we speak privately?

480
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,540
Go ahead.

481
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,140
Pingting, don't stay here.

482
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,420
It's too messy.

483
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,820
Come over here.

484
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,380
Pingting, come here.

485
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,700
What now?

486
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,260
Dragging me in here for secret talks.

487
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,980
Let me be blunt, Miss Lian.

488
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,340
What's your intention?

489
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,660
Intention?

490
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,620
I don't understand.

491
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,380
Taking care of Pingting,

492
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,940
advising on renovations,

493
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,220
and even going to check out
the samples.

494
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,620
What?

495
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,860
Don't you have your business to run?

496
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,420
Don't you think you're being
overly enthusiastic?

497
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,740
I can't help it.

498
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,340
I've been

499
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,380
warm-hearted all my life.

500
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,140
Well? Is it against the law?

501
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,420
Something wrong with that?

502
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,540
Do I deserve to be dragged in here
for questioning like this?

503
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,500
Mr. Zheng.

504
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,780
Mu Dai.

505
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:28,980
Where's Luo Ren?

506
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,420
Inside.

507
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,180
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

508
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,300
I'm meeting Mr. Zheng tomorrow
to check samples anyway.

509
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,180
Pingting.

510
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,700
Mr. Zheng said

511
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,100
you were up to no good in here.

512
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,300
Me?

513
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,940
He said you dragged

514
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,220
some pretty girl in

515
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,420
and wouldn't let anyone else enter.

516
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,740
What were you trying to do?

517
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,780
Out with it.

518
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Where's that pretty girl?

519
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,540
Right here.

520
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,380
Mr. Zheng also said

521
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,620
you got upset about Lian Shu

522
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,340
helping pick wallpapers.

523
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,980
How did she offend you?

524
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,940
Why the hostility?

525
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,260
I can't quite explain.

526
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,580
She gives me

527
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,620
this uneasy feeling.

528
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,300
And the way she's always hovering
around Pingting and Pingting.

529
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,100
I feel a bit unsettled

530
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,940
about it.

531
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,420
Then I'll handle
the wallpaper samples tomorrow.

532
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,140
As one of the shareholders
of Phoenix Pavilion,

533
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,180
I should do my part.

534
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,460
I'll ask her

535
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,620
to hand over all the work

536
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,140
to me later.

537
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,860
That way, we won't have to
trouble her further.

538
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,500
What do you think?

539
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,900

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,660
From now on,

565
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,860
she'll handle these matters.

566
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,060
We've troubled you long enough.

567
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,780
I'm really sorry about that.

568
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,460
Don't mention it, Mr. Zheng.

569
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,780
Let's go then. The car's outside.

570
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,340
Alright.

571
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,540
Mr. Zheng, I'll be leaving then.

572
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,220
Go ahead.

573
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,380
We're leaving, Mr. Zheng.

574
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,940
Miss.

575
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,540
Upstairs.

576
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,820
I'm not going upstairs.

577
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,340
I'm going out. Bye.

578
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,060
Come on, sit and eat.

579
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,380
Here you go.

580
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,780
This piece is entirely handcrafted.

581
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,020
The carving details

582
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,940
are exceptionally fine.

583
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,460
Over here

584
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,140
we have marble designs.

585
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,660
Each stone

586
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,780
has been processed by skilled artisans.

587
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,620
The durability and attention to detail

588
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,580
in every small piece are remarkable.

589
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,780
Now,

590
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,900
these six pieces use

591
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,140
imported German materials.

592
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,660
The engraving work

593
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,820
is impeccable.

594
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,580
And over here,
we have ceramic colored stones.

595
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,100
The color procurement for these...

596
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,380
Pingting, what are you looking at?

597
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,140
Miss.

598
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
Upstairs.

599
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,420
That's downstairs, Pingting.

600
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,420
You can't tell up from down.

601
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,820
But since when am I a girl?

602
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,860
Well,

603
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,060
just skip breakfast.

604
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,220
It's practically noon.

605
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,140
You might as well sleep straight
through till evening.

606
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,880
[Zhama]

607
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,820
Smells amazing.

608
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,780
I'm getting hungry.

609
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,940
I'm starving too.

610
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,900
Why don't you check out this shop?

611
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,860
And I'll order some takeout.

612
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,060
Alright. But I can't handle spice.

613
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,380
Mild then. Thank you.

614
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,380
Alright.

615
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,140
Hello, sir,

616
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,260
I just placed that order.

617
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,300
Make it extra spicy, please.

618
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,460
Also, I ordered a soda.

619
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,420
Don't forget that.

620
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,460
Thank you.

621
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,900
Not a savage?

622
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,540
That expert mentioned

623
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,220
it belongs to

624
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,620
the order Primates, genus Simia.

625
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,220
Then he rambled on
about a bunch of other stuff.

626
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,500
I didn't understand any of it.

627
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,020
True.

628
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,500
The "savage" label is just folkloric.

629
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,020
The scientific community
never endorsed it.

630
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,140
By the way, Luo,

631
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,220
there's one more thing.

632
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,620
Do you

633
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,780
remember that vanished village

634
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,180
on Yueliang Mountain?

635
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,420
Some elders recently

636
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,940
brought up that old story.

637
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,380
They said that twenty years ago,
when that village

638
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,580
wasn't abandoned yet,

639
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,420
a woman went into the mountains
to gather herbs

640
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,500
and was assaulted by a savage.

641
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,900
Then her husband

642
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,540
led village hunters from our village

643
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,940
into the mountains to corner it,

644
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,380
and in the end, they killed it.

645
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,740
But later,

646
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,700
people noticed the woman
kept returning to the mountains.

647
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,260
And she stayed with a little savage.

648
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,220
Gradually, rumors started spreading.

649
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,940
Many people claimed
that the little savage

650
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,060
was her child with that savage.

651
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,140
Impossible.

652
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,300
As Simians,

653
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,580
savages can't have children with humans.

654
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,060
Yueliang Village

655
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,620
was already slated for relocation then.

656
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,860
Her husband told her to just leave

657
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,940
and forget about that beast.

658
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,620
Yet she

659
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,740
abandoned her husband and daughter,

660
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,900
never to return.

661
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,380
The authenticity of this story
needs verification.

662
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,380
Also,

663
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,820
have you ever considered

664
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,740
that the woman

665
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,900
might not have come back

666
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,860
because something happened to her?

667
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,780
I'll make more inquiries.

668
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,220
Abandoned her husband and daughter.

669
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,660
She had a daughter?

670
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,620
We guessed wrong.

671
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,300
The other wasn't a savage.

672
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,940
It was her daughter.

673
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,820
The relic of ill omen is incomplete.

674
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,780
She gave the amber

675
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,420
to her daughter.

676
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,260
This world is vast.

677
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,180
Where could it be?

678
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,660
Miss, upstairs.

679
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,380
Miss, upstairs.

680
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,140
Pingting,

681
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,180
are you talking about Mu Dai?

682
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,820
She's not here. She can't go upstairs.

683
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,620
No idea why,

684
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,820
but she's been

685
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,220
saying that all day.

686
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,580
Not Mu Dai.

687
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,140
Pingting,

688
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,300
are you saying

689
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,020
a girl did go upstairs?

690
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,420
Which girl?

691
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,220
Then

692
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,620
where is this Sunny Doll from?

693
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,340
I don't remember exactly.

694
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,460
Some rainy place.

695
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,940
Lian Shu?

696
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,500
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

697
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,620
I'm meeting Mr. Zheng tomorrow
to check samples anyway.

698
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,100
Then I'll handle
the wallpaper samples tomorrow.

699
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,820
As one of the shareholders
of Phoenix Pavilion,

700
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,780
I should do my part.

701
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,260
Wow ,who are you?

702
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,060
You look familiar.

703
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,380
I think you might be

704
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,900
[Destiny Bar]
a former employee here.

705
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,980
No, Mr. Zhang,

706
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,420
please don't say that.

707
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,420
I swear I won't do it again.

708
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,500
Never again.

709
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,540
Mr. Zhang,

710
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,020
I think the kid's apology

711
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,260
sounds sincere.

712
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,780
Right.

713
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,340
Besides, the temps

714
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,980
we've been interviewing lately

715
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,220
are slow.

716
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,340
They're all clumsy.

717
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,860
This kid's worth three of them.

718
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,700
I'm sharp.

719
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,100
Listen,

720
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,900
this better not happen again.

721
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,220
It won't happen again.

722
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,940
Come on in and get to work.

723
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,180
Thirteen-Thousand, Chubby,
get in the car!

724
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,180
Sorry for the trouble.

725
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Love you, Mr. Zhang.

726
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,180
You...

727
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,340
What kind of nonsense is that?

728
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,180
So you're saying Lian Shu
is that woman's daughter

729
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,940
and she's kidnapped Lady Dai?

730
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,260
Wait, was the amber on that woman

731
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,140
the one my master pried off?

732
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,580
Lian Shu kidnapped her?

733
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,540
Is this revenge?

734
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,380
Any leads?

735
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,140
They said they drove off

736
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,020
in a white car.

737
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,140
They left for an hour or two.

738
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,740
That's impossible to track.

739
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,300
Should we call the police?

740
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,140
The police?

741
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,980
The sales guy said

742
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,860
they were laughing and chatting,

743
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,180
got into the car with barbecue.

744
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,060
What evidence do we have?

745
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,940
How do we prove it was a kidnapping?

746
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,980
Then we do it the hard way.

747
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,820
Check every security camera
along the route.

748
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,460
Let's go.

749
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,620
Here.

750
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,060
Right here.

751
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,100
Hurry.

752
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,900
Thanks.

753
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,340
What do you want?

754
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,460
What are you doing?

755
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,700
I don't know what I'm doing.

756
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,180
I just thought you'd look good

757
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,700
hanging there.

758
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,100
How did I offend you?

759
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,140
You didn't offend me.

760
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,020
You offended it.

761
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,300
Thin.

762
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,260
Flaky.

763
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,940
With jagged fractures.

764
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,780
She might not even have understood

765
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,900
what was happening.

766
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,220
To her, the amber

767
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,860
was a life-saving treasure.

768
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,580
So

769
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,780
she shared it with her child.

770
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,780
Is your hometown Yueliang Mountain?

771
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,660
You have a sister who's a savage, right?

772
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,340
That filthy little beast.

773
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,380
My sister?

774
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,580
She was never worthy.

775
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,580
But your mom cared for her.

776
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,940
My mom was insane.

777
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,020
She kept running into the mountains

778
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,340
to raise a savage's child.

779
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,140
The whole village insulted her.

780
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,340
The said she'd bred with a savage.

781
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,260
But she didn't care.

782
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,900
But what about me?

783
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
My dad?

784
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,900
Our dignity?

785
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,980
But your mom must have had her reasons

786
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,180
for taking care of her.

787
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,300
Reasons?

788
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,260
She once went into the mountains
to gather herbs

789
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,620
and didn't return for days.

790
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,660
My dad grew worried
and sent men to search for her.

791
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,420
They found her disheveled,

792
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,020
with some savage.

793
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,140
Anyone could tell

794
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,620
what happened.

795
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,100
My dad killed that beast.

796
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,380
To spare my mom's dignity,

797
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,300
he begged the others

798
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,860
to keep it quiet.

799
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,900
But what did she do?

800
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,260
She claimed she'd been in danger
in the mountains

801
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,540
and the savage had saved her.

802
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,580
That my dad had killed her savior

803
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,300
in a misunderstanding.

804
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,580
That she was guilty.

805
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,380
How ridiculous.

806
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,020
As if anyone would believe that.

807
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,020
Why wouldn't you believe your mom?

808
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,460
What if she was telling the truth?

809
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,820
Because she made it up!

810
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,260
She knew she'd been defiled
and was too ashamed,

811
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,900
so she spun that ridiculous story
about gratitude.

812
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,780
Would someone abandon her own child
just to repay a debt of gratitude?

813
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,100
I was her daughter.

814
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,620
Mom, this amber is so pretty.

815
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,180
Doesn't its color look like honey?

816
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,060
Yeah.

817
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,300
Sweet as honey,

818
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,620
a charm for good fortune and health.

819
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,980
When you're older,

820
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,700
I'll give it to you.

821
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,260
Yay.

822
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,300
Good girl.

823
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,380
She abandoned me

824
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,540
for that monster.

825
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,780
Have you considered

826
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,420
that maybe your mother was killed

827
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,100
and can never come back?

828
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,380
Can never come back?

829
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,420
But she did come back.

830
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,900
Mom!

831
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,060
She left the amber for that little beast

832
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,460
but gave me this hideous thing instead.

833
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,500
Yet sometimes

834
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,500
it feels sentient.

835
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,060
It understands me,

836
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,700
comforts me.

837
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,540
But talking to you is a waste of time.

838
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,100
You might as well die now.
