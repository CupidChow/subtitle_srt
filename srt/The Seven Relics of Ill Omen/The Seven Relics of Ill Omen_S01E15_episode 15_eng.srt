5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,080
   

6
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,340
Let's split up.

7
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,760
Come on.

8
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,520
Mu Dai.

9
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,120
You go that way.

10
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,360
I found her!

11
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Brother Luo! Here!

12
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,540
I got her!

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,660
Lian Shu.

14
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,763
 This must be the last piece of amber. 

15
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,880
 You send it back. I'll take care of this. 

16
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,240
Where's Mu Dai?

17
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,720
She went out with you. Why is she missing?

18
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,760
Mu Dai? I don't remember.

19
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,060
Then, think hard.

20
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,800
I said I don't remember.

21
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,040
Let me go! Or I'll call the police.

22
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,980
There aren't many people I'm close to in my life.

23
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,460
So, I hate it when people hurt them.

24
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,740
I never want anyone to hurt my friends, buddies, or beloved girl.

25
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,240
Think over what happened.

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,080
Think hard. Otherwise, I'll make you do it.

27
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,360
When I first met you,

28
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,520
I had a strange feeling.

29
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:18,206
 I felt scared 

30
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,940
 and excited. 

31
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,413
Not only about you, but also your friends.

32
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:32,733
I wanted to avoid you guys.

33
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,040
But I also wanted to approach.

34
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,900
I didn't know why.

35
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,640
I tried to get close to your family.

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,580
The room on the second floor...

37
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,800
It gave me a feeling of closeness.

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,880
 But it was locked and I couldn't get in. 

39
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,500
When you were back this time, something changed.

40
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,260
I felt like a voice was calling me over.

41
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,720
 Missy. 

42
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,240
 The second floor. No. 

43
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,780
That day, I didn't know why,

44
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,480
but before I knew it, I was at the door.

45
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,832
I was thinking...

46
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:30,660
About what?

47
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,340
Hang Mu Dai.

48
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,760
And then?

49
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,920
I'd hang her.

50
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,000
What happened then?

51
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,320
Then...

52
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,660
Then I drugged her.

53
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,840
I brought her here.

54
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,720
But she was like a different person.

55
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,680
She hit me!

56
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,580
She hit me really hard!

57
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,720
- She hit me! 
 - And then?

58
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,560
- She hit me. 
 - What happened later?

59
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,380
- Where is she? 
 - Help me!

60
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,620
I can't remember.

61
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,460
She hit me.

62
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,140
I think she's telling the truth.

63
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,900
Boss Lady Dai is skilled in martial arts. I'm sure she's fine.

64
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,220
Maybe she's back home now.

65
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,860
I'll go get her.

66
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,000
Since Brother Luo is in the middle of something,

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,460
I'll do the recording for our further reference.

68
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,200
Attention. The shadow of water is appearing.

69
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,480
Isn't the Bajiao house burned?

70
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,380
How come it's restored?

71
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,580
The burned woman is all right, too.

72
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,360
She's even living a happy life.

73
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,040
This is what we can see from this shadow of water.

74
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,900
But it's a little strange.

75
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,020
A burned house can be rebuilt.

76
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,500
How could a burned woman recover?

77
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,660
This story...

78
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,920
Is it presented in reverse, starting from the end?

79
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,220
Well...

80
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,600
In your childhood, were you the young savage's friend?

81
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
She didn't deserve me.

82
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,940
I went to Yueliang Mountain.

83
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,160
She painted a lot in the cave.

84
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,460
About your mother having fun with you two.

85
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,660
Yes.

86
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,340
In case she was lonely,

87
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,940
my mother took me up there to play with her.

88
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,540
Why would a beast be lonely?

89
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,500
Did you never play with her there?

90
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,220
I did.

91
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,000
I played with her happily and taught her to paint.

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,500
You taught her to paint?

93
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,540
Or who else did?

94
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,040
If nobody had taught her, how could a beast learn to paint?

95
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Stop calling her a beast.

96
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,580
Show some respect, will you?

97
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,040
It's too early to be angry.

98
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,760
When you know what happened later, you'll go mad.

99
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,320
I played with her happily.

100
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,080
Otherwise, my mother wouldn't have let me take care of her alone.

101
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,120
And she wouldn't have obeyed me.

102
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,940
What did you do?

103
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,640
Nothing, actually.

104
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,240
I just chewed a mushroom

105
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,220
and rolled on the ground, gripping my stomach.

106
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,100
I frothed at the mouth.

107
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,160
You pretended to be poisoned, and she took you to the village.

108
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,860
In the village, I got better.

109
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,460
 I shouted and shouted. 

110
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,800
I had everybody come out to see her.

111
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,960
You should have seen how they hit her with stones.

112
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,930
 It's over there. 

113
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,830
 There. 

114
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,720
Shut up!

115
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,180
You know what? She deserved it.

116
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,720
I used to have a happy family.

117
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,000
 Because of her, 

118
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,100
I lost everything.

119
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,200
My mother abandoned me.

120
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,820
My father got a new wife.

121
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,920
Do you know what a terrible life I had?

122
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,280
It was all because of that beast.

123
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,540
She deserved it.

124
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,180
Miss Lian.

125
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,180
You never understood their love.

126
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,120
You had a loving mother.

127
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,820
You also had an honest and kind sister.

128
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,220
You lost both of them.

129
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,640
But it's not that they abandoned you,

130
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,240
but you didn't deserve them.

131
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,640
All the time,

132
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,380
you never deserved.

133
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,520
Well, you called her a beast.

134
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,620
But in my eyes,

135
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,260
she's more like a real human.

136
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,100
How tragic! That girl was knocked away.

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,060
Such a miserable car accident.

138
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,380
The police even came.

139
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,660
Look at the tiny pieces of glass.

140
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,700
- And the blood. 
 - Yes.

141
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,140
How miserable! Can she survive?

142
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,340
I heard it was a mass of blood. That's horrible.

143
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,160
Exactly. Her family must be heartbroken.

144
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,740
Look. Even the car is...

145
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,360
Doctor, come on.

146
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,700
My son is injured. Hurry.

147
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,830
   

148
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,840
Doctor, I'm her family. How's she?

149
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,060
- You are? 
 - Yes.

150
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,380
She had head trauma. But the CT doesn't show any bleeding in her brain.

151
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,720
Her condition remains unclear. She'll stay in ICU for observation.

152
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,560
- Is she all right? 
 - I can't tell now.

153
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,370
   

154
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,400
   

155
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,240
Where's that patient?

156
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,340
Discharge already.

157
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,500
Discharged?

158
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,320
She checked out and left before dawn.

159
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,681
Wait a minute.

160
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,901
She left something on the bed.

161
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,140
   

162
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,820
Hello.

163
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,220
 - Is Uncle Zhang there?  
 - No.

164
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,740
He left me a note, saying he was on a long trip with Madam Hong,

165
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,300
and for me to take care of the bar.

166
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,340
I called them, but they didn't answer.

167
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,000
 Fine. I'll ask Wan Feng Huo instead. 

168
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,480
Hello? Hello?

169
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,700
   

170
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,140
   

171
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,500
She's up there, right?

172
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,120
Mu Dai can stay here for a few more days for further observation.

173
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,260
Okay. I get it.

174
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,380
Long time no see.

175
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,140
Dr. He is an old friend of mine.

176
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,400
Eight years ago, he worked at Huacheng People's Hospital

177
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,120
and dealt with Mu Dai's case.

178
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,520
Eight years ago?

179
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,640
You don't know?

180
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:17,260
How about you tell Mr. Luo what happened eight years ago?

181
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,540
8 years ago, Mu Dai was 15.

182
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,820
 Back then,   I adopted her and have raised her for a dozen years. 

183
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,320
 She was adorable. 

184
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,940
 She was outgoing too. 

185
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,400
 Mu Dai. 

186
00:16:41,326 --> 00:16:43,660
 - It's for you. 
 - Thanks. Let's go. 

187
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,220
 I was looking for you. 

188
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,440
 Where are we going? 

189
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,360
 In her class, she had a close friend named Shen Wen. 

190
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,400
They stuck together as if they were hand in glove.

191
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,760
But later...

192
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:02,640
Something happened.

193
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,760
After school, they usually went to a tutoring center.

194
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,240
But one night, they didn't come home even when it was 11 p.m.

195
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,120
Their phones were disconnected.

196
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,200
We talked to their tutor, only to know they had skipped class.

197
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,500
 Wen Wen's mother and I looked everywhere, street by street. 

198
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,800
 - Wen Wen! 
 - We ended up at an alleyway. 

199
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,560
 Mu Dai! 

200
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,680
 - Wen Wen! 
 - Where are they? 

201
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,680
 It's Mu Dai's phone. 

202
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,920
 - Where are they? 
 - Don't worry. 

203
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,020
 Wen Wen! 

204
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,800
 Wen Wen! 

205
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,520
 That was a deserted construction site. 

206
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,780
We went in there.

207
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,960
We saw...

208
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,760
Mu Dai had fallen downstairs.

209
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,307
The back of her head was bleeding.

210
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:08,067
Then...

211
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,760
We found Wen Wen in the building.

212
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,560
She...

213
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,320
She was dead.

214
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,860
Mu Dai was in a coma for several days.

215
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,720
When she woke up, she told us the story.

216
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,840
That night,

217
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,660
they skipped class for a movie.

218
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:34,500
But on their way, they met some rogues.

219
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,200
That's why she had a problem.

220
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,840
Those rogues were caught soon and sentenced.

221
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,800
But Shen Wen's parents lost their daughter.

222
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,980
They had no way to let the pain out.

223
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,120
So, they blamed everything on Mu Dai.

224
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,780
Wen Wen was a top student in her class.

225
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,580
She was always obedient.

226
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:00,300
Her parents insisted Mu Dai nudged her into skipping class.

227
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,440
 If you hadn't taken her out, she wouldn't have been killed! 

228
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,340
And some guys said Wen Wen could have run away.

229
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,540
She returned to save Mu Dai.

230
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,660
 Kneel before my sister! 

231
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,800
 - Kneel! 
 - Sinner! 

232
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,740
 - Kneel! 
 - Kneel now! 

233
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,780
 - Stop hassling her. 
 - Sinner. 

234
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,440
 After that, instead of blaming those rogues, 

235
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,960
 they blamed Mu Dai. 

236
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,880
 - Pay with your life! 
 - Don't hit her. 

237
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,080
 - Die! 
 - Don't. 

238
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,980
 - Don't do this. 
 - How unfair! 

239
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,400
 Don't hit her. Please don't. 

240
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
 Why is my daughter dead alone? 

241
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,240
 Mu Dai hit her head and had little memory of that. 

242
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
 When Shen Wen's family questioned her, she couldn't explain anything. 

243
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,840
They took her silence as a yes.

244
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,000
As the only person who could protect her,

245
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,480
didn't you defend her?

246
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,720
Defend her? How?

247
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,200
Their child was killed.

248
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,000
Mu Dai survived, after all.

249
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,960
I asked Mu Dai to bear with it. Then, it would be over.

250
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,912
But that day...

251
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:56,460
 Mu Dai. 

252
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,360
 Mu Dai. It's okay now. 

253
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,160
 It's okay. 

254
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,600
 Mu Dai, who did this? 

255
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,000
 Who? 

256
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,400
 Who did this? They went too far! 

257
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,400
 Mu Dai. 

258
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,460
 Auntie Hong. 

259
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,780
 It's my fault. 

260
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
 Auntie Hong. 

261
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,280
 I should have died. 

262
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,320
 Don't say that. 

263
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,460
 It's okay, Mu Dai. 

264
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,620
 You have me. 

265
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,820
 I'll protect you. 

266
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,480
Only then did I realize

267
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,880
Mu Dai had a mental problem.

268
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,380
Silence grew in her,

269
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,460
and she barely talked to anyone.

270
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,440
She remained sleepless.

271
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,180
I couldn't let this continue.

272
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,040
So, we moved away.

273
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,320
Then, she began to see doctors.

274
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,320
It was then that I met Dr. He.

275
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,560
It's been eight years.

276
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,440
He's been following up on her case.

277
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,921
Following up?

278
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:32,961
Does Mu Dai know that?

279
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,840
Her case is quite unusual.

280
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,720
It's rare in my experience of many years.

281
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,460
Mr. Luo, I heard you were her boyfriend.

282
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,080
I still am.

283
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,140
What you're going to see and hear may upend what you know about her.

284
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,200
I advised Ms. Huo to watch Mu Dai's daily behaviors

285
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,600
and even made some videos when she wasn't paying attention.

286
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,820
Then, we could monitor her in a more comprehensive way.

287
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,480
 Leave me alone. 

288
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,320
- She... 
 -  You didn't kill her. 

289
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,040
 You almost died too. 

290
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,380
 You barely survived. 

291
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,760
 Don't lose your life. 

292
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,780
 Stop crying. 

293
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,360
 You don't understand. You just don't. 

294
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,620
 I really feel bad. 

295
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,160
 Feel bad? 

296
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,540
 About what? 

297
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,120
 Did you kill her? 

298
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,220
 But I feel terrible. 

299
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,180
 I want to kill myself. 

300
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,220
 I really want to do that. 

301
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,000
 This is my body. 

302
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,280
 Mine. 

303
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,720
 Fine. 

304
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,840
 What do I do? What do I do now? 

305
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,540
 Let it be. 

306
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,040
- And then? 
 - Then she recovered.

307
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,260
With treatment?

308
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,420
Without. Without treatment.

309
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,580
So, that was...

310
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,760
Split personality?

311
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,280
It doesn't fit the definition of split personality.

312
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,740
In that case, each personality is intact,

313
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,520
and they don't share memories.

314
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Mu Dai's case doesn't accord with any of our known cases.

315
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,520
As far as I inferred, in this case,

316
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,160
Mu Dai couldn't bear so much pain.

317
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,740
To save herself, she split off a different personality.

318
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,600
Let's call this one "Dark Mu Dai."

319
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,320
She's rational, calm, and hostile to everyone and everything.

320
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,400
And this one is the girl you're familiar with.

321
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,880
She's warm, soft, and adorable.

322
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,200
At the end of the video, she said, "Let it be."

323
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,080
What does that mean?

324
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,560
Dark Mu Dai and Bright Mu Dai fought for control of the body.

325
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:09,180
I guess Bright Mu Dai prevailed in that fight.

326
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,200
But in the video, Dark Mu Dai looked more aggressive.

327
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,280
What she said at last is the result of a compromise.

328
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,320
Humans are social by nature.

329
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,160
Bright Mu Dai's character is more acceptable in society.

330
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:31,140
So, Dark Mu Dai chose to relinquish control and stay silent.

331
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,765
 She wouldn't wake up unless she needed to save this body 

332
00:26:35,765 --> 00:26:39,745
 from extreme danger or pain. 

333
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,000
 And it seems Bright Mu Dai doesn't know the existence of the dark one 

334
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,860
 because it hugely exceeds what her body can tolerate. 

335
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,820
But now...

336
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,000
She... She's back.

337
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm not interested in your long speech.

338
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,220
I want to see Mu Dai now.

339
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,120
Tell me where she is.

340
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,840
Thirteen.

341
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,040
Thirteen-Thousand. Oh, Thirteen.

342
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,880
What happened? What's the fuss?

343
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,320
You disturbed my artistic creation.

344
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,120
Leave it alone. Something happened.

345
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,920
I saw the vision again.

346
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,960
Vision? You saw another one?

347
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,500
Here's the thing.

348
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,800
Today, I had a really good lunch.

349
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,740
Then, I wanted to do some digging in the garden as physical exercise.

350
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,720
When I shoveled, guess what I saw?

351
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,460
What?

352
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,420
A hole.

353
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,160
If I shoveled, I'd see a hole, too.

354
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
That's not an ordinary hole.

355
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,640
It's...

356
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,640
- Dark red. 
 - Dark red?

357
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,120
And there seemed to be a lot of...

358
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,420
Blood vessels.

359
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,705
They intertwined.

360
00:27:57,705 --> 00:27:59,765
Quite disgusting.

361
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,060
The wind even blew out of the hole.

362
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,140
Stop that. Stop.

363
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,040
Is it the sign of another relic of ill omen?

364
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,440
Of course.

365
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
But... But our fighters aren't here.

366
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,440
We... You... We just...

367
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,600
Come on.

368
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,920
Brother Luo said he had found my master but didn't specify her condition in detail.

369
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,720
Shall we call him and ask him how everything's going?

370
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,260
We can also update him on our progress.

371
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,580
That's right.

372
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,660
 This is what has happened.  
    

373
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,840
I got it. You guys stay alert.

374
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,160
I'll go back when I'm done here.

375
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,000
Hey, Luo Ren.

376
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,500
Um... Is Boss Lady Dai all right?

377
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,960
She is.

378
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,220
Wipe it.

379
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,880
Mu Dai is in the playroom downstairs.

380
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,380
She loves to stay alone.

381
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,730
Before you see her,

382
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,680
be mentally prepared.

383
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,920
She...Is she very different now?

384
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,160
You'll see.

385
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,120
Did she mention me?

386
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,280
Then...

387
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,460
Does she remember me?

388
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,825
Yes, of course.

389
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:01,999
You.

390
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:04,640
Cao Yan Hua. And the new girl, Hong Sha.

391
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,940
She remembers all of you.

392
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,680
Don't forget. Dark Mu Dai has Bright Mu Dai's memories.

393
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,697
She just has different feelings for you.

394
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:27,220
   

395
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,500
   

396
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,580
If you aren't ready, you can see her later.

397
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,180
I'm ready.

398
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,740
Are you okay?

399
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,560
Yes.

400
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,240
Is there a two-player mode?

401
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,820
Let me play with you.

402
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,000
I prefer to play alone.

403
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,260
Together, we'll play longer.

404
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,740
- Is that so? 
 - Let's try.

405
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,800
Nothing's really changed.

406
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,640
It's not over yet.

407
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,120
Mu Dai, now.

408
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:07,760
   

409
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,859
I had good luck.

410
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:14,560
We made it.

411
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,680
You didn't win by luck.

412
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,660
Instead, you let me play with you.

413
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,140
When things happened, I used to decide alone.

414
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,760
In trouble or danger, I counted on myself.

415
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,420
Later, a girl told me

416
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:51,757
this was a very,

417
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
very wrong attitude

418
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,700
toward life.

419
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,874
I think she has a point.

420
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:06,219
Sharing the burden is better than struggling alone.

421
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:08,339
 Murderer! 

422
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,740
 You... 

423
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,660
 What are you doing? 

424
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,800
 After chatting, don't you think we're quite alike? 

425
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,520
 We are in the same industry, and we have similar families. 

426
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,520
 That's true. 

427
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,710
 We feel sorry for each other.. 

428
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,050
 We should have a toast. 

429
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,360
I can't change what happened eight years ago.

430
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,060
But in the future,

431
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,480
I'll face everything with you.

432
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,800
What makes you think I need you?

433
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,780
Because it's been eight years

434
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,340
and you haven't moved on.

435
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,620
I know.

436
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:06,120
Neither you nor Pocketty can stop feeling guilty about Shen Wen.

437
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,860
I didn't kill her.

438
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,560
Why would I feel guilty?

439
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,200
Right. You don't need to feel guilty because you did nothing wrong.

440
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,480
You aren't to blame for Shen Wen's death.

441
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,780
It's not you who wanted to see the movie or advised taking a shortcut.

442
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,320
Right?

443
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,280
I asked Auntie Hong about what happened that day.

444
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,460
 Come on, Mu Dai. Or we'll be late for the movie. 

445
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,800
 Wen Wen. 

446
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,920
 Wen Wen. How about we go back to class? 

447
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,540
 Too late. 

448
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,360
 We can't take the main road. 

449
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,020
 Let's take a shortcut. 

450
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,140
 - Okay. 
 - Come on. 

451
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,620
 Slow down. 

452
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,400
 Because you were guilty, you didn't explain anything. 

453
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,760
 Because it's Shen Wen who actually died. 

454
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,380
 It's also because... 

455
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,145
 She could have run away. 

456
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:21,758
 Stop running! 

457
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:23,598
 Stop. 

458
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,620
 Try running again. 

459
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,960
 Such a bad temper. 

460
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,140
 You hit me hard. Trying to kill me, huh? 

461
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,100
 Come on, let's have fun. 

462
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,460
 Come over here. 

463
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,520
 - Wen Wen, run! 
 - Come on. 

464
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,660
 Come over here. 

465
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,440
 Let me go! Help! 

466
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,780
 Somebody help! 

467
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:53,220
 To outsiders, it may not be a wise choice. 

468
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,773
 I don't know what Shen Wen was thinking. 

469
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,540
 But I'm sure about one thing. 

470
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,940
 She cherished you. 

471
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,420
 - What a bad temper. 
 - Indeed. 

472
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,280
 Help! 

473
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,540
 Help me! 

474
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,660
 Give me a kiss. 

475
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,980
 What do you say? 

476
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,060
 I'll be gentle. 

477
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,280
 - Hit her. 
 - Darn it. 

478
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,240
 - Go ahead. 
 - Fight us, huh? 

479
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,320
 - How dare you? 
 - How dare you? 

480
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,920
 Screw you. 

481
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:45,221
 Shen Wen's parents lost their daughter. 

482
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:51,475
 But anyway, you shouldn't take the blame for the real murderers. 

483
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:56,220
 Do you think this is the whole story? 

484
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,520
 They have a reason to hate me. 

485
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,120
 If it weren't for me, 

486
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,720
 she wouldn't have died. 

487
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,912
 What do you mean? 

488
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:12,600
 It was I who provoked those guys and made them kill. 

489
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,080
 But according to Huo Zi Hong, 

490
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,180
 you hit your head and didn't remember anything. 

491
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,906
 She didn't. 

492
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,951
 But I'm not her. 

493
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:28,253
 So, it was you who they dragged up there. 

494
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:30,820
 Clever boy. 

495
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,220
 She was so weak that she lived in a total mess. 

496
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,249
 She couldn't bear all that. 

497
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:39,509
 I had to be there. 

498
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,300
 I just had to. 

499
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,540
 So, Dark Mu Dai didn't appear after Wen Wen was killed. 

500
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,120
 Instead... 

501
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,460
 - Boss. 
 - Boss. 

502
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,260
 Hit her! 

503
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,584
 - Hit her! 
 - Catch her. 

504
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,780
 - Beat her. Go. 
 - Come on. 

505
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,860
 There you go. 

506
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,300
 Hit us, huh? 

507
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,400
 - Had fun fighting, huh? 
 - Screw you. 

508
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,080
   

509
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,740
Do you still think you know me very well?

510
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,460
You said we would be honest.

511
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,620
But you have more secrets than her, right?

512
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,120
She keeps her secrets.

513
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,597
So do you.

514
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:11,070
You realized something was wrong,

515
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,798
but you never asked her or did anything.

516
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:17,620
Now, you claim you will share her burden.

517
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,880
Don't you think this is ridiculous?

518
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,320
Are you guys really in love?

519
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,620
You don't even know what each other can't get over.

520
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,380
You're both dishonest.

521
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,620
How can you call it "love"?

522
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,560
Still wearing it?

523
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,420
I thought you would know why I dumped it.

524
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,962
- What do you mean? 
 - Isn't it obvious?

525
00:39:49,962 --> 00:39:51,963
I'm not your Pocketty.

526
00:39:51,963 --> 00:39:53,603
She...

527
00:39:54,286 --> 00:39:56,546
She'll never be back.

528
00:39:59,557 --> 00:40:01,138
Just be straightforward.

529
00:40:01,138 --> 00:40:02,958
Break up.

530
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,660
Just don't embarrass me or torture yourself.

531
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,100
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

532
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,780
The level we passed today...

533
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,860
I actually made it last week.

534
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,780
I used less time.

535
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,100
So, don't overestimate yourself.

536
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,180
Obviously, I don't need you.

537
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,260
Maybe you're right.

538
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,600
I don't know you well.

539
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,040
But there's something you can't get over.

540
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,580
Right?

541
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,920
If it isn't Shen Wen, what is it, then?

542
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,460
I'm going back to handle something.

543
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:37,220
If you need help or if Mu Dai is in trouble, call me.

544
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:50,919
   

545
00:41:58,452 --> 00:42:00,880
 Let me out. Hurry. 

546
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,100
 Come on. 

547
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,000
Too many people have spoiled you.

548
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,600
That's why you're so weak.

549
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,780
Stop struggling. It won't help.

550
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,980
I've taken over your life from right here.

551
