112
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,940
Perhaps during the era
of the Great Virtuous One,

113
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,780
they could be lured
into the wooden slips

114

and sealed
with the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

115

However,

116

117
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,580

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,180
"This time, subduing it

120

will not be easy."

121
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,500
So, aside from the death ritual,

122
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,900
do we have no other options
to completely seal them?

123
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,020
Well,

124
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,460
we can only seal them by sacrificing.

125
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,300

This is a scam.

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,860
The maze is huge and chaotic.

Even tracing the solution

293
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,820

Ten seconds

295
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,060
is impossible.

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,860
How is it impossible?

297
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,460
One second is enough.

298
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,900
One second?

299
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,020
Show me.

300
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,980
Then you try.

301
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,580
You're not following the rules.

302
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,100
- Is this allowed?
- Drawing like this?

303
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,420
If that counts,

304
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,340
anyone can do it.

305
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,300
- Exactly.
- Indeed.

306
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,900
The rule says to connect to the exit.

307
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,580
But it never said
you had to follow the lines.

308
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,300
Facing a dead end,

309
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,100
sticking to the rules leads nowhere.

310
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,940
Only by thinking outside the box

311
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,700
can you find a new way.

312
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,100
What was that?

313
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,940
What nonsense.

314
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,860
Let's get out of here.

315
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,300
Let's go.

316
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,980
Scammer.

317
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,740
On the way,

318
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,220
I kept thinking

319
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,740
that if the Imperishable Wood

320
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,420
is a vessel that stabilizes
the activity of the relics of ill omen,

321
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,020
then the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle

322
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,820
is the inhibitor
that reduces their activity.

323
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,460
So, as long as we have
these two functions,

324
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,020
we can seal the relics of ill omen

325
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,900
even without the Imperishable Wood

326
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,660
and the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle.

327
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,220
Mr. Kun is right.
We have what we need in this room.

328
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,620
Luo?

329
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,900
The solution's right here in this room.

330
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,220
Where?

331
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,340
Let's be clear.

332
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,300
We refuse a death ritual.

333
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,620
But we can't just give up, right?

334
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,860
Even if we want to give up,

335
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,980
once the cycle of seven sevens ends

336
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,260
and the relics of ill omen escape,

337
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,580
will they spare us?

338
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,140
And they already

339
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,060
know everything

340
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,460
about our families and friends.

341
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,540
I'm really worried they'll target them.

342
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,620
We lack the Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle
and the Imperishable Wood

343
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,900
and can't complete
the so-called death ritual.

344
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,500
So we have to find another way.

345
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
What's your idea?

346
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,340
My idea is

347
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,700
the Living Buckle.

348
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,740
Living Buckle?

349
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,180
The Living Buckle means

350
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,780
drawing the relics of ill omen
into our bodies.

351
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,460
We'll use our bodies

352
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,180
as living Feng-Huang-Luan Buckle
and Imperishable Wood.

353
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,460
Who?

354
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,380
Well, I have to say

355
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,780
Radishie's idea

356
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,260
is quite interesting.

357
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,980
You are indeed
living vessels and inhibitors.

358
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,380
Mr. Kun, does that mean it's feasible?

359
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,100
Well, not really.

360
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,660
I...

361
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,340
It's unprecedented.

362
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,700
I can't guarantee anything.

363
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,780
But it's definitely unconventional.

364
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,500
There's potential
for unexpected success.

365
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,660
So what's the success rate

366
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,580
of this unexpected victory?

367
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,420
Either it succeeds or fails.

368
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,300
Fifty-fifty.

369
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,780
Fifty percent, I guess.

370
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,020
Fifty percent.

371
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,980
Fifty.

372
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,940
If it's 50%, I'm in.

373
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,860
Better than a 100% fatal death ritual.

374
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,540
Right?

375
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,980
Count me in.

376
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,380
Me too.

377
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,500
We don't have other options anyway.

378
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,300
This is what the Plum Blossom Sect does.

379
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,020
If not us, then who?

380
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,780
Right, Master?

381
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,020
Kill all demonic blocks.

382
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,100
Let's go take our chances.

383
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,540
Alright.

384
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,260
Then let's go

385
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,860
take our chances tomorrow.

386
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,540
Come on.

387
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,180
Also,

388
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,700
I got you a massage chair.

389
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,140
I know. I've been worried
about your back.

390
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,860
And Dad's drinking.

391
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,660
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

392
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,860
Don't push him too hard.

393
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,140
How's business at the shop lately?

394
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,340
I don't think quitting is the answer.

395
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,140
I'll send him some good stuff.

396
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,540
Listen, stop sourcing from Beard.

397
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,500
Most of the wine he sells

398
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,940
is counterfeit.

399
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,180
If you're shorthanded,
just hire a few helpers.

400
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,940
You'll manage.

401
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,620
I just wanted to say

402
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,620
if I don't make it back this time,

403
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,860
just sell everything

404
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,220
in my room.

405
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,540
Or throw it all away if you prefer.

406
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,460
I'm not terminally ill.

407
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,380
Memorize my bank card PIN.

408
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,420
You can tell Pingting.

409
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,980
Alright. That's all.

410
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,260
Mr. Zheng.

411
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,380
It's nothing.

412
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,740
I'll hang up now.

413
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,740
Finished your call?

414
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,380
What?

415
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,380
You're not calling Madam Hong?

416
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,180
After careful consideration,

417
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,740
I've decided not to.

418
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
The more I say, the more
she'll overthink things.

419
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,820
Ren,

420
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,300
it'll be fine.

421
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,740
Human determination conquers all.

422
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,940
Everyone will be safe.

423
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,580
The slopes at Fengzi Ridge

424
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,660
are quite challenging indeed.

425
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,380
I really don't get it.

426
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,540
If we're just
absorbing the relics of ill omen,

427
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,380
why can't we do it

428
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,700
lying in our beds?

429
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,700
Why trek all the way

430
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,540
to this so-called origin site?

431
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,060
The ancient texts state

432
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,380
all previous sealings

433
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,660
occurred at the origin site.

434
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,540
There must be a reason.

435
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,540
We should follow the records.

436
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,500
Exactly.

437
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,820
Something this important

438
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,220
deserves proper ceremony.

439
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,260
You're just lazy.

440
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,540
You call this lazy?

441
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,260
So heavy.

442
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,140
Is this the tree?

443
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,020
Yes.

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,340

don't hesitate.

Radishie,

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,820
it's been ten minutes.

494
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,180
You were the first one injected.

495
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,820
Do you feel anything?

496
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,420
Not really.

497
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,380
Nothing at all?

498
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,620
What about you two?

499
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,580
Do you feel any different?

500
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,580
My neck hurts a little.

501
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,500
Did I sleep on it wrong?

502
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,140
Most likely.

503
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,740
And you? Any changes?

504
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,100
Me? Nothing.

505
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,140
Just feeling warm by the fire.

506
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,780
Any different sensations for you guys?

507
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,700
Anything at all?

508
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,780
I don't feel anything.

509
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,580
Just hungry.

510
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,780
I want to eat something.

511
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,780
I do.

512
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,900
I need to take a dump.

513
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,140
That's it?

514
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,460
Nothing else?

515
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,420
Then that means no feeling.

516
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,060
Mr. Kun.

517
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,060
You're

518
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,180
feeling it now?

519
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,060
No.

520
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,140
My car's still at Ding Laojiu's place.

521
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,660
Take it back for me.

522
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,380
The one I spent ages modifying.

523
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,140
You're not feeling anything,

524
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,420
yet you're talking

525
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,500
- about your car?
- Mr. Kun.

526
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
I've got a request too.

527
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,620
If I die,

528
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,060
can you take care of Free Cao for me?

529
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Just one thing.

530
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,780
You love chicken too much.

531
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,660
Can you quit it?

532
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,180
Then you take care of Madam Hong
for me too.

533
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,380
I...

534
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,540
Kids say the darndest things.

535
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,020
They speak without restraint.

536
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,740
You're not feeling anything,

537
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,180
yet you're making

538
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,420
all these arrangements?

539
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,980
No feeling is a good thing.

540
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,500
You scared me to death.

541
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,860
I was so nervous.

542
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,140
I broke into a sweat.

543
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,180
Listen, this is a historic moment!

544
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,900
Really?

545
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,460
This is a moment worth remembering!

546
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,700
Just now, with the two of you
standing here

547
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,980
and snow falling from the sky,

548
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,100
it was breathtaking.

549
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,540
Let's take a photo.

550
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,580
So beautiful.

551
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,940
Come on, stand over here.

552
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,020
Hurry up, come on!

553
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,420
Stand over here.

554
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,300
Make sure the tree's in the shot.

555
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,820
Good point.

556
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,660
Get the whole tree in.

557
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,940
This is a good thing.

558
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,740
We're fine!

559
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,020
We were due for some luck, right?

560
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:07,780
Alright.

561
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,340
Come on, strike a pose.

562
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,180
No side effects at all.

563
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,660
It's been ages since we took a photo.

564
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,820
You've lost weight.

565
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,380
Right?

566
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,420
- Look over here!
- Photogenic.

567
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,900
Come on.

568
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,340
Three, two, one.

569
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,940
Got it. Let's see.

570
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,940
Now, switch up your pose.

571
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,140
I like his idea.

572
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,260
The heart shape would be cute.

573
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,380
Strike a new pose.

574
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,860
No, move a little.

575
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,140
Just adjust slightly.

576
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,820
Can you hear me?

577
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,180
Move a little.

578
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,420
What's wrong with...?

579
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:44,860
Oh no.

580
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,340
Where is this?

581
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,460
What kind of place is this?

582
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,820
Weren't we just taking a photo?

583
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,100
Did we get pulled into the photo?

584
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,820
Mu Dai.

585
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
Are you feeling alright?

586
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,700
I'm fine.

587
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
This is creepy.

588
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,140
Let's split up and look around.

589
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,860
Don't bother.

590
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,500
Zhang Guanghua?

591
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,500
It's you.

592
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,620
Welcome

593
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,820
to my world.

594
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:15,980
No.

595
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,380
He's not Zhang Guanghua.

596
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,180
If I'm not mistaken,

597
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,180
you're the seventh relic of ill omen.

598
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,540
You're right

599
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,260
and also wrong.

600
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,660
With all seven gathered,

601
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,820
I, the leader, have been fully awakened.

602
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,460
Under my guidance,

603
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,700
you've smoothly implanted
the relics of ill omen into your bodies.

604
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,500
Facing a dead end,

605
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,220
sticking to the rules leads nowhere.

606
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,100
Only by thinking outside the box

607
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,740
can you find a new way.

608
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,180
So that person was arranged by you?

609
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,260
You deliberately guided us.

610
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:00,820
Exactly.

611
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,780
You're sharp.

612
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,340
Quick to connect the dots.

613
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,260
Then what is this place?

614
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,340
How to describe it?

615
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,940
Your bodies remain where they were.

616
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,060
You're simply trapped

617
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,740
in the vision I created for you.

618
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,620
Or more precisely,

619
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,500
I

620
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,700
am

621
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,420
inside your minds.

622
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,980
You're messing with our brains now?

623
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,700
Get out!

624
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,660
No wonder subduing
the seventh relic of ill omen

625
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,860
was so easy.

626
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,380
So this was the trap.

627
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,260
What a sneaky scumbag.

628
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,220
He's trying to turn us into idiots.

629
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,260
I'm warning you,

630
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,460
let us out.

631
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,660
I need to take a dump!

632
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,500
Childish.

633
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,100
Because every one of you

634
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,660
holds something I want in your minds.

635
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,620
What do you mean?

636
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,220
All along,

637
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,620
you've been dealing
with individual relics of ill omen.

638
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,420
But the seven were always
meant to be one.

639
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,620
This kind of convergence

640
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,780
last occurred
during the era of Bo Yangzi.

641
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,460
The one your kind called
the Great Star Lord.

642
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,180
He just vanished?

643
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:14,900
Where did he go?

644
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,140
I can tell you this.

645
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,220
To reunite as one,

646
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,300
we need the connectors.

647
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,500
And there are

648
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,060
five of them.

649
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,660
Those things

650
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,780
are inside our minds?

651
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,700
When we finally achieved union

652
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,460
and were ready to thrive,

653
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,660
Bo Yangzi shattered and sealed us
into wooden slips.

654
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,340
Knowing it was irreversible,

655
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,620
so

656
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,820
the Great Star Lord
left a contingency plan.

657
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,220
Bo Yangzi

658
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,100
took the seven relics of ill omen.

659
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,220
But the five connectors...

660
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,660
Five disciples

661
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,140
fell unconscious for days,

662
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,900
their lives in grave danger.

663
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,900
It seemed they might not survive.

664
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,260
Yet seven days later,

665
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,980
they were all fine.

666
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,620
You planted the five connectors

667
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,260
in five disciples
of the Great Virtuous One.

668
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,180
Clever.

669
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,220
The connectors are passed down by blood.

670
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,820
Hidden deep within your minds,

671
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,220
buried

672
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,540
in your subconscious.

673
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,740
You're saying

674
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,740
the five of us

675
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,740
are descendants of those disciples?

676
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,700
Exactly.

677
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,020
But his disciples had many descendants,

678
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,980
scattered everywhere.

679
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,300
I picked you five

680
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,140
because the connectors within you guys
remain most intact.

681
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,980
So all our encounters
with the relics of ill omen

682
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,060
were never coincidences.

683
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,140
Of course not.

684
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,780
Why else would the relics of ill omen
keep appearing

685
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,820
among those connected to you?

686
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,180
All by my design.

687
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,060
I orchestrated your meeting

688
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,060
and dragged you into this.

689
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,660
Mom!

690
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,980
It was destined

691
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,700
that you'd come here

692
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,420
to complete our union ritual.

693
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,740
Can you hear me?

694
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,140
Can you see me?

695
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,580
At last, we're about
to fulfill our purpose.

696
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,540
You lowlifes

697
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,460
will be crushed beneath me.

698
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,740
If you're in such a hurry,

699
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,260
then let's begin!

700
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,260
Ren.

701
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:41,900
Ren?

702
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,860
Hongsha?

703
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,980
Chubby? Thirteen-Thousand?

704
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,500
Mu Dai.

705
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,140
Where am I?

706
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,260
Where are my friends?

707
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,900
This is the origin point.

708
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,940
Your friends are each

709
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,340
at their own origin points.

710
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,620
What kind of trick are you pulling now?

711
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,380
Pitiful humans.

712
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,620
Your time flows in one direction,

713
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,940
ever forward,

714
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,860
never back.

715
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,860
But here,

716
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,780
everything can begin anew.

717
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,620
Do you see?

718
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,860
Every moment of your life is here.

719
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,340
Regrets can be undone.

720
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,020
Wounds can be healed.

721
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,900
Your story can be rewritten as you wish.

722
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,740
I...

723
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,260
What's past is past.

724
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,540
I like the life I have now.

725
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,140
I don't need to rewrite it.

726
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,820
Is that so?

727
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,700
Don't worry. I won't force you.

728
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,740
I'm just offering you the choice.

729
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,900
Your life,

730
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,780
your decision.

731
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,580
Where's Free Cao?

732
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,700
Where's Free Cao?

733
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,420
Free Cao?

734
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,820
No time to worry about that now.

735
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,220
Hey,

736
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,340
Jiu.

737
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,460
Listen,

738
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,060
I've got a minor situation here.

739
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,260
Any chance you could get me a ride?

740
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,020
Yeah, I...

741
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,300
I know cars can't get in here.

742
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,860
Of course,
I know cars can't get in here!

743
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,780
I mean, get me like an ox cart,

744
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,620
a horse cart, or a donkey cart.

745
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,940
Any kind of cart will do.

746
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,100
I'll pay you a generous amount, alright?

747
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,620
If that's not enough, I'll write you
a letter of commendation.

748
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,300
And I'll give you
a certificate of merit.

749
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,780
You can hang it on your wall.

750
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,580
How prestigious would that be, right?

751
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,900
Tomorrow morning?

752
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,740
Jiu, is there any way

753
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,260
you could speed things up?

754
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,100
Make it fast.

755
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,900
Say,

756
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,340
show up in an hour or so?

757
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,060
That'd really make my day.

758
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,180
Is tomorrow morning the earliest?

759
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,300
Fine, okay.

760
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,300
Just get here as fast as you can, okay?

761
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,100
Please.

762
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,300
Stay warm out there in the mountains?

763
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,220
Stay warm.

764
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,140
Got it. I'll be careful.

765
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,500
Alright. Thank you.

766
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,300
Bye.

767
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,020

768
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:29,940
