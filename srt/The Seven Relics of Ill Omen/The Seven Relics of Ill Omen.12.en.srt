[Episode 12]

5
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,260
Hey, I mean,

6
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,780
it's such a huge piece in it!

7
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,900
I'm not deficient in calcium.

8
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,380
That savage seems attentive.

9
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,700
Why don't you let her cook for you?

10
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,860
Hongsha, come out for a moment.

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,700
Stop staring. Eat up.

12
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,900
What exactly is going on?

13
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,260
My grandpa killed someone.

14
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,980
That savage gets style,

15
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,580
and even wears a necklace.

16
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,700
It's called amber, right?

17
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,780
Is it valuable?

18
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,380
Ask the expert.

19
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,100
Let's go.

20
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,500
Sir.

21
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,460
About the incident last night,

22
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,540
do you have anything to say?

23
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,420
Luo Ren.

24
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,260
I've told you everything.

25
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,780
My grandpa was scared today.

26
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,060
- Could you not...?
- He has to say it himself.

27
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,860
You must tell

28
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,500
every detail about the murder.

29
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,900
- Murder of what?
- Of a human?

30
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,780
Who do you think you are?

31
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,620
What gives you the right to question me?

32
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,060
The savage came at you!

33
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,180
Luo.

34
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,420
How do you tell
that the savage came at him?

35
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,180
The savage attacked you at the gem well.

36
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,540
She chased you here
and only took you captive.

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,740
Didn't you notice

38
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,260
that you had always been her target?

39
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,620
With her strength,

40
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,460
she can strangle Mu Dai instantly.

41
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,420
Mu Dai wasn't killed

42
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,580
not because we got there in time,

43
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,140
but because the savage
didn't intend to kill her.

44
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,700
Sir.

45
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,580
Why would a savage
keep chasing after you?

46
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,900
What evil deeds have you done here?

47
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,820
That...

48
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,660
That woman...

49
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,940
This has nothing to do
with the savage!

50
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,860
Are you sure?

51
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,620
Sir.

52
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,500
You must tell us everything
that happened back then,

53
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,740
so we can prepare in advance.

54
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,740
It's the territory of the savage
deep in the mountains.

55
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,260
Everybody's stuck here.

56
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,860
Even if you don't care about us,

57
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,300
you have to think
about your granddaughter.

58
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,580
Grandpa.

59
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,060
Just tell them.

60
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,860
Grandpa.

61
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,100
Just say it, Grandpa.

62
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,420
More than 20 years ago,

63
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,300
everyone was ready
to leave Yueliang Mountain.

64
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,740
But I didn't want to let others

65
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,100
know about the gem well I explored.

66
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,260
So under the cover of night,

67
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,180
I went to conceal it.

68
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,140
But without vitality,

69
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,020
the treasure's aura
would be found sooner or later.

70
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,980
Right at that time...

71
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,620
Didn't you say it was a companion
who died of illness?

72
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,380
Grandpa, which of your words is true?

73
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,660
Consider herself unlucky

74
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,820
by entering the mountains alone!

75
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,180
I'll say it again.

76
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:44,980
That person

77
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,660
is a human.

78
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,860
It was a human,

79
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,420
not that savage!

80
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,780
Certainly not the savage.

81
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,500
I fought with that savage.

82
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,420
She is full of strength
and is in the prime of life.

83
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,140
More than twenty years ago,

84
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,620
she was still a child, wasn't she?

85
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,140
By calculating the age,

86
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,420
that's right.

87
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,220
That woman could practically
be her mother.

88
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,100
And there were candies
and a little rag doll

89
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,500
in that basket.

90
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,500
They seemed to be prepared for kids.

91
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,180
But that gem well is remote.

92
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,020
It's so far from the village.

93
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,580
Who would raise their kids there?

94
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,940
At the very least,

95
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,380
even if she was out of her mind

96
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,700
and insisted on raising her kid there,

97
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,580
knowing the danger of delivering food
to the mountains at night,

98
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,940
why did she do that all alone?

99
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,860
That makes sense.

100
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,700
You killed someone, you know?

101
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,580
Don't skirt around the main point.

102
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,740
I heard

103
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,340
when some families had abnormal
and sick babies back then,

104
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,620
they would feel ominous

105
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,700
and thus throw those babies
into the mountains,

106
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,820
leaving them to their own devices.

107
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,340
But some mothers wouldn't bear it,

108
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,740
so they would secretly
enter the mountains to deliver food.

109
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,100
If that's the case,

110
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,020
I'm afraid it's not easy
for us to get out.

111
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:58,940
It's me.

112
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,820
It's raining heavily.

113
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,860
Can't fall asleep?

114
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,580
So much has happened recently.

115
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,780
You should get inside and sleep.

116
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
I'll keep watch for you for a while.

117
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,540
It's okay.

118
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,140
But you...

119
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,900
You must be tired along the way.

120
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,340
I can't sleep either.

121
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,900
It was almost the time

122
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,500
that I nearly died yesterday.

123
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,060
You are so young. You won't die.

124
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,900
You don't know this.

125
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,420
Death

126
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,380
is actually around us.

127
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,180
Just like last night,

128
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,060
if you were late for just a while,
I would have died.

129
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,100
Also,

130
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,500
eight years ago...

131
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,900
Eight years ago?

132
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,300
Never mind.

133
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,540
It's all the past.

134
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,300
Just a minor accident.

135
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,300
Luo Ren.

136
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,620
In the future,

137
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,100
if I change
into a totally different person,

138
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,820
will you recognize me?

139
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,420
A different person?

140
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,860
How will you change?

141
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,140
Well...

142
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,900
Same appearance

143
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,860
while totally different characters

144
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,260
and behaviors.

145
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,180
Mu Dai.

146
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,140
Have you ever heard a saying?

147
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,620
Human body cells

148
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,700
undergo constant metabolism.

149
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,060
It takes seven years

150
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,140
for your body

151
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,820
to change all its cells.

152
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,660
So in seven years,

153
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,300
we will both become brand-new.

154
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,220
We will both change.

155
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,460
Will we?

156
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,580
When I came back from Heisha,

157
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,060
Pingting said to me,

158
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,780
"Ren,

159
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,980
you seem to be a different person."

160
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,940
But I think

161
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,500
those who really care about you

162
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,580
will recognize you at a glance

163
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,740
no matter how you change.

164
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,420
Because they not only
notice the results,

165
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,740
but also

166
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,220
the reason why you change.

167
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,300
So you'll recognize me, right?

168
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,820
Yes.

169
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,260
Remember your words.

170
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,500
It's a deal.

171
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,220
Words count.

172
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,620
Deal.

173
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,940
Your hand is so wet.

174
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,220
Luo Ren,

175
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,780
you are childish.

176
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,140
If you ask me,

177
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,220
every wrong

178
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,980
has its perpetrator.

179
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,260
What do you mean?

180
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,060
Let's find a chance

181
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,900
to sell Yan out.

182
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,700
Where are your quality and conscience?

183
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,900
At the very least,

184
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,340
he is Miss Rich's grandpa.

185
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,420
It's not righteous indeed.

186
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,900
At most,

187
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,340
we can only walk fast

188
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,860
and leave him behind.

189
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,820
And then...

190
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,700
That will do.

191
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:02,940
What are you talking about?

192
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,540
We are wondering
if we'll meet the savage today.

193
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:07,900
Yeah.

194
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,220
Luo Ren, do you think

195
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,820
the savage has
the third relic of ill omen on her?

196
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,740
Very possibly.

197
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,340
Deep in the mountains, the rain,

198
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,860
the village, and the Sunny Doll.

199
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,260
Every one of them is here.

200
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,220
And not only was this savage

201
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,300
strong in strength,

202
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,380
but she also faked signs along the way,

203
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,380
using the Sunny Doll to confuse us.

204
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,740
Such intelligence

205
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,340
is suspicious.

206
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,060
The clam was hard to deal with.

207
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,860
This time, what we'll face
is a live person.

208
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,460
We...

209
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,500
You still have the mood for scenery.

210
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,220
Master.

211
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,180
Do the relics of ill omen
prefer animals?

212
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,340
They took possession of an old clam,
and then a savage.

213
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,940
Why can't they find a normal person?

214
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,660
Humans are not easy to deal with either.

215
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,700
Sometimes, humans
are much scarier than animals.

216
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,420
Why did you stop?

217
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,820
Go away!

218
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,340
Don't hit them.

219
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,260
Run!

220
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,380
Let's go.

221
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,940
Run!

222
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,460
Run!

223
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,020
Hurry and run!

224
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,500
Go away!

225
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,300
It's useless.

226
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,860
Luo Ren!

227
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,620
The savage captured my grandpa.

228
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,380
Let's go.

229
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,500
Mu Dai!

230
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,380
Thirteen-Thousand!

231
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,460
Chubby!

232
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,460
Grandpa!

233
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,940
Luo Ren.

234
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,180
Hongsha.

235
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,940
Mu Dai.

236
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,020
Mu Dai.

237
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,380
Mu Dai, are you alright?

238
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,940
Are you hurt?

239
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,940
No. How about you?

240
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,780
We are alright.

241
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,740
- We are alright.
- Good.

242
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,740
Where are Chubby and Thirteen-Thousand?

243
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,860
Wake up.

244
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,100
Wake up...!

245
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,340
Where are we?

246
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,700
The savage!

247
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,620
Understand?

248
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,180
Understood.

249
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,100
Where is the savage?

250
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,780
She's not here.

251
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,660
Not here?

252
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,180
- Let's go.
- Go.

253
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:01,980
Let's go.

254
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,340
It's a dead end.

255
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,860
There's light there.

256
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,060
I'll go first.

257
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,900
Wait for me!

258
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,780
Wait for me!

259
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,740
Be careful.

260
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,860
There's no other way.

261
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,300
This won't do.

262
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,180
We can't go down,

263
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,460
but they can come up here.

264
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,180
Fortunately, we are high above.

265
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,540
They can hear us when we shout.

266
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,140
Yeah.

267
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,020
Yeah.

268
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,900
Master!

269
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,180
No!

270
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,940
What if the savage hears that?

271
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,340
What to do now?

272
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,620
What to do?

273
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,540
Thirteen.

274
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,180
Calm down.

275
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,740
The more dangerous it is,
the more calm we should be.

276
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,380
Figure out a way.

277
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,540
Use our brains and save ourselves.

278
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,100
Right.

279
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,780
We can do it.

280
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,380
We can.

281
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,220
Step one,

282
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,660
think about what we're good at.

283
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,700
I'm good at drawing

284
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,020
and mixology,

285
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,860
and I can do a little magic.

286
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,740
I...

287
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,660
That's all!

288
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,860
What about you?

289
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,780
I'm good at lock-picking.

290
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,660
And?

291
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,100
We are done for.

292
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,580
It's all your fault!

293
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,740
You kept saying

294
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,220
we'd be captured by the savage,

295
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,060
and now it comes to reality!

296
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,940
It's you to blame!

297
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,580
You even said
I could marry into her family!

298
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,300
You jinxed it.

299
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,820
Stop it! Mind your words!

300
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,540
Get down.

301
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,780
What's that?

302
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,820
A big lump

303
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,220
is rushing towards us.

304
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,700
Don't tell me it's the savage.

305
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,780
Let's go.

306
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,020
Let's just fight her.

307
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,260
Okay.

308
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,100
We'll beat her to death!

309
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,460
Stab her to death!

310
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,020
Over there.

311
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,060
Look.

312
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,100
Let go!

313
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,060
Let go!

314
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
Cao Yanhua, you can't do this.

315
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,940
Cao Yanhua, be righteous!

316
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,020
You are no better than me.

317
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,540
I...

318
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,380
She smeared leek flowers on my face.

319
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,580
Let me go!

320
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,140
Don't eat me!

321
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,660
Don't eat me! I'm skinny.

322
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,500
Don't eat me.

323
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,980
We've been searching for this long,

324
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,060
but we haven't found them.

325
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,180
Will they possibly be...?

326
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,860
It's okay.

327
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,180
No news means good news.

328
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,060
They'll be fine.

329
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,100
That's right.

330
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,900
We need to have faith in them.

331
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,940
Although Thirteen-Thousand and Chubby

332
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,700
don't do well in martial arts,

333
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,540
they are quite smart,

334
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,340
and they always desire to survive.

335
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,300
Your grandpa will be okay.

336
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,260
He has gone through the mill.

337
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,540
I don't think he survived this.

♪In the deepest night,

339
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,340

with my own eyes.

341
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,740
The savage was targeting him.

342
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,020

The gem well is to the west.

354
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,340
And to the east

355
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,460
are the woods where we encountered wasps.

00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,260
Which direction should we search?

359
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,260
Every time the savage attacked us,

360
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,860
she intended to take your grandpa away

361
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,540
without killing him on the spot.

362
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,580
It seemed

363
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,340
she wanted to take him somewhere.

364
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,060
If the savage is really
that woman's child,

365
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,260
think about it,

366
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,020
when she finally caught the murderer,

367
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,260
where would she want to take him

368
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,660
the most?

369
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,780
Let's go to the gem well first.

370
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,340
OK.

371
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,380
Luo Ren!

372
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,460
Who is it?

373
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,900
Hongsha.

374
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,140
Hongsha.

375
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,380
What should we do?

376
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,980
I'll go down and check it.

377
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,020
Hongsha!

378
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,140
Mu Dai!

379
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,500
Mu Dai!

380
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,540
Are you okay?

381
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,220
I'm okay.

382
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,820
How did you fall?

383
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,300
The rope suddenly broke,

384
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,100
and I fell off
before I could turn around.

385
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,260
Will Hongsha be in danger?

386
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,020
No, I have to get up there.

387
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,780
Mu Dai, take care of Hongsha.

388
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,420
I'll follow it.

389
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,620
Maybe I can find Thirteen-Thousand
and the others.

390
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,340
Hongsha.

391
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,660
Hongsha?

392
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,140
Wake up, Hongsha.

393
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,740
Don't come here!

394
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,380
Hongsha?

395
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,380
Don't come here!

396
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,020
Mu Dai.

397
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:12,700
What's wrong?

398
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,500
I see a ghost!

399
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,620
There are no ghosts.

400
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,500
No...

401
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,140
There was.

402
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,460
I saw it.

403
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,860
You're just scared by the savage.

404
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,180
It's not the savage.

405
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,460
It was a woman.

406
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,420
Her face was as pale

407
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,140
as a dead one.

408
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,740
I couldn't see any vitality on it.

409
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,740
And she was white-haired,

410
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,220
in tattered clothes.

411
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,420
Her neck seemed

412
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,220
to be sealed

413
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,340
with some transparent glue.

414
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,580
And...

415
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,180
there seemed to be
melted amber on her neck.

416
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,860
Transparent?

417
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,500
Do you mean you could
see through her neck?

418
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,180
It seemed like someone cut it open.

419
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,340
It was mangled!

420
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,900
And she suddenly

421
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,620
came towards me.

422
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,300
Luo Ren.

423
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,340
Are you okay?

424
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,100
I'll talk to you later.

425
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,100
Luo Ren.

426
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,460
Well...

427
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,820
Mu Dai and I just put my grandpa down.

428
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,620
But

429
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,940
I really couldn't carry him.

430
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,660
Could you help me

431
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,340
carry him up,

432
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,780
please?

433
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,060
Hongsha.

434
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,300
I'd like to discuss this with you.

435
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,540
Considering the situation now,

436
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,900
it may not be convenient
to take your grandpa away.

437
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,140
So can we

438
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,100
leave your grandpa's body here
for the time being?

439
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,180
I've seen the temperature below.

440
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,540
The body should last for a few days.

441
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,620
When we get down the mountain safely,

442
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,460
we'll have his body delivered.

443
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,580
Is that okay?

444
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,380
Okay.

445
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,140
♪In the deepest night,
longing takes shape♪

446
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:54,900

♪Stubbornness and courage

451
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,540
Be careful.

452
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,460
So that weird white-haired woman

453
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,300
is the one killed by Hongsha's grandpa
back then, right?

454
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,420
I suppose so.

455
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,700
I think

456
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,300
it was the relic of ill omen
that kept the woman alive.

457
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,860
Have you noticed this?

458
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,580
So far,

459
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,660
all people or creatures possessed
by those relics of ill omen

460
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,340
were greatly strengthened

461
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,460
either in the body functions

462
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,820
or in vitality.

463
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,020
Luo Wenmiao, Pingting

464
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,900
and the clam.

465
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,660
So it seems.

466
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,620
But why was there amber

467
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,540
on her neck?

468
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,500
Hongsha.

469
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,460
Is amber a kind of gem?

470
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,620
What are its characteristics?

471
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,500
Amber is a kind of organic gem.

472
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,500
It has a low melting point
and is relatively fragile.

473
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,300
It can't stand high temperatures
and will melt when heated.

474
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,780
Is it possible

475
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,220
that she originally wore the amber,

476
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,540
and when the relic of ill omen
had an effect on her wound,

477
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,100
some kind of energy released

478
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,380
melted the amber?

479
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,700
Yes, it is.

480
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,140
The amber on her neck

481
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,620
was tight-fitting.

482
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,180
It seemed to have solidified again

483
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,260
after it melted.

484
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Then this piece...?

485
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,380
It's a very thin

486
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,860
flake.

487
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,020
There are irregular fractures on it.

488
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,500
Look here.

489
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,940
There are some red lines.

490
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,940
It looks like some flesh and blood

491
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,620
were mixed

492
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,500
when the wound was sealed.

493
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:02,980
Then will there be

494
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,700
part of the relic of ill omen inside?

495
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,180
Think about this.

496
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,500
After the relic of ill omen took effect,

497
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,620
the amber melted.

498
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,420
The relic of ill omen, the amber

499
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,300
and the flesh and blood
coagulated together.

500
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,660
Since the piece taken off

501
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,140
contains some flesh and blood tissue,

502
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,020
there must be part
of the relic of ill omen as well.

503
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,420
Hongsha, water.

504
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,860
Here.

505
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,820
When the amber was on her neck,

506
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,580
I clearly saw some words on it.

507
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,540
Why isn't there any?

508
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,260
Take it.

509
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,260
Recently,
I've been studying paleography.

510
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,060
This is an ancient character, "human".

511
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,340
This is a rope.

512
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,060
This rope entangled the person

513
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,140
pointing upward.

514
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,980
The meaning is obvious.

515
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,980
This character is "hang".

516
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,620
That's right.

517
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,300
So my grandpa was hanged

518
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,180
not just because of
the woman's revenge...

519
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,020
But also

520
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,100
because of the ill omen of the relic.

521
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,340
It seems Mr. Kun is right.

522
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,860
Each ill omen of the relic

523
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,100
presents a way of the relic to kill.
